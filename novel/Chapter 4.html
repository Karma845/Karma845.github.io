<h2>Chapter 4: Whether This Feeling is Real or Fake, That's the Question</h2>

<p>The mysterious naked hero who defeated the Org Specter, became a hot topic at the academy.</p>
<p>It seems that it was totally popular in the city, and there’s a manufacturing uprush for its character merchandises.</p>
<p>However, for the students, the impending first semester midterm exams are much more important, and no one wanted to find out about the naked hero.</p>
<p>History, geography, language, mathematics, basic magic theory of all attribute, magic pharmaceutics, magic mineralogy, spell literature, strategy outline, basic tactical, Northern Demon(tempest) theory, dark magic basics&#8230;&#8230; and so on.</p>
<p>They studied each lesson until the very last minute of the examination. They took the tests. When it’s finished, they start the next day&#8217;s counter-measures. Their days passed with such repetitions.</p>
<p>And thus, the exam will be over by tomorrow, and at the after school of that day.</p>
<p>Rows of tall bookshelves filled with thick books, were lined up.</p>
<p>Standing in the valley of such bookshelves, was Haruto pulling out a book in front of him.</p>
<p>Then, he peeks at his vicinity through a gap.</p>
<p>He could see a part of her head with silver hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto pulls out another book, and bends forward.</p>

<p>“……How are you doing on the exam?&#8221;</p>

<p>A barely audible voice was heard.</p>
<p>Iris&#8217; blue eyes, peek through the thin gap.</p>

<p>“……So-so”</p>

<p>Frankly, it can be said to be total destruction, but Haruto thought in his heart that he wouldn’t give up hope until the end.</p>

<p>“Finally &#8230;&#8230; I can speak to you. The other day was a little…… uhmm”</p>
<p>“Tha,that’s true……”</p>

<p>The shocking incident in the bath, is still fresh in their memory. Rather, the two mutually, couldn&#8217;t forget about it.</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-71771413' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-71771413' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p>“Oh…… more than that, there are many people here during the examination period. It isn’t too quiet”</p>
<p>“Indeed…… my bad, but”</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; eyes became a little sharper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Actually, I did some investigation after that, but &#8230;&#8230; from the ore samples of President Ernest, it seems that the Black Onyx was stolen.&#8221;</p>
<p>“What……?”</p>
<p>&#8220;As I thought, it seems to be correct that Sazaku is in the academy &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto also had that in mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so too. The package sent to me, wasn’t through mail. Someone directly, left it there. There is a barrier erected in the academy. I don&#8217;t think outsiders can come in that easily.”</p>
<p>“Moreover, the subjugation competition where Sazaku first appeared was also, an event that was decided in a hurry. There is no way for outsiders to know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>——<em>Then, who the hell is that?</em></p>
<p>The most suspicious one, is Fatima Nefer, who manipulates the darkness magic.</p>
<p>However, Adelina, who invited him to meet Iris alone, seems to be also planning something. If it’s about acting suspicious, it’s these two.</p>
<p>But he has no evidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the test is over, let’s plan a strategy &#8230;&#8230; During the exam break, it seems that everyone will sally forth to the city of Grandia. Why don’t we go out in the meantime and meet in the city?&#8221;</p>
<p>“!? Tha,that’s!”</p>

<p>Iris’ unrest was transmitted to him.</p>
<p><em>Is there any problem with that? Is it not possible for her to go out alone because she’s a royalty?</em></p>

<p>“Tha,that’s already…… a da,date desu!?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!?&#8221;</p>

<p>When she said that, Haruto had trouble replying.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>He wants to affirm it, but honestly, it was embarrassing for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Date with Haruto &#8230;&#8230; in the city &#8230;&#8230; the two of us alone…… such an unrealistic thing, can happen &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Beyond the bookshelf, Iris was unsteadily swaying.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a book slipped down towards Haruto.</p>

<p>“Iris!?”</p>

<p>It seems that Iris who was staggering plunged into the bookshelf. In the aisle of Haruto, the hand with an icefish-like* finger of Iris, jumped out. <em>(TN: Icefish &#8211; </em><a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/icefish"><em>https://www.lexico.com/definition/icefish</em></a><em>)</em></p>

<p>“Yo,you okay?”</p>

<p>He unintentionally took Iris&#8217; hand, and entwined his fingers with hers. He tried to push it back, while supporting it,</p>
<p><em>——It’s dangerous, Iris&#8217; palm &#8230;&#8230; feels great.</em></p>
<p>They loosened their connected hands, slide while brushing their fingertips, and savor each other&#8217;s texture.</p>
<p>The skin of the back of her hand is smooth. Her thin skeleton under the tissue is surprisingly delicate.</p>
<p>Her palm is soft and fluffy, completely different from a man&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>To that excessively good feeling, Haruto seemed to forget himself unintentionally.</p>
<p>And even though Iris is just holding his hand, she was intoxicated with pleasure as if she was being caressed in her whole body.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun &#8230;&#8230; ❤&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Iris &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment when the two lost all their restraint, and was about to run wild——,</p>

<p>“『Shining』!!”</p>
<p>““!?””</p>

<p>Haruto lets go of Iris’ hand, and turns sideways with a snap.</p>
<p>Then a sacred light came into his eyes; it passed through the Will-o-wisp floating by the wall, and its evil body of light.</p>
<p>The Will-o-wisp got bisected by the sword-like light.</p>
<p><em>That was Luminous!?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;To show up in a place like this, that’s amazing nodesu”</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p>The one who appeared holding a cane with the Luminous emblem, was Clara Strahl. The Luminous lead magician and angel of light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh ya? Haruto-san is in here nodesu?&#8221;</p>
<p>“O,oh…… unexpected meeting”</p>

<p>He searched for signs on the other side of the bookshelf, but there&#8217;s nothing.</p>
<p><em>It seems that Iris have escaped</em> —— Haruto was relieved.</p>
<p>However, when Clara suddenly notices something, her face becomes severe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-san! That&#8217;s no good nodesu!!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was nervous inside his heart, but he responded with a somehow threatening face.</p>

<p>“What ……is?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p>Clara pointed her wand at the books scattered under Haruto&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scattering around is no good! It&#8217;s even worse to treat books poorly! Books are the crystallization of human wisdom nodesu. This is a hall of wisdom. It’s the nourishment of head and mind nodesu.”</p>
<p>“Ah…… this is. I’m sorry”</p>

<p>Haruto picked up the book, and began to put it on the bookshelf.</p>

<p>“……You’re more obedient than I expected nodesu.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked a little surprised, but she immediately combined her fingers with an angel&#8217;s smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally, Haruto-san has also received the voice of the God of light nodesu. It’s the miracle of God nodesu. Thank you, God Luminous…&#8230; Lux”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard no one. Of such voice”</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, Haruto-san is no better than a believer then nodesu.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“No, no, I’m not”</p>
<p>&#8220;If the leading magician enters the faith, it&#8217;s no exaggeration to say that all of the Blaze nations have become Luminous nodesu.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Aren’t you exaggerating too much!? Or rather, listen to me!!”</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>And the test was completed successfully.</p>
<p>It’s the long-awaited, one-week examination break.</p>
<p>All the students went out to the city of Grandia.</p>
<p>The people of the Republic of Blaze, are also launching a party by renting out a cafe for private use.</p>
<p>While waiting at their tables, the Blaze people are waiting for the start. Before them, Claude stood, and next to him, was Haruto leaning against the counter.</p>
<p>Claude raised a glass.</p>

<p>“——Now then, in celebration to the end of the exam. And for the miracle who occurred in Haruto that we prayed for.&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Only Haruto had a bitter face, but everyone laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Haruto. Give a toast signal &#8221;</p>

<p>When Haruto, who appears to be annoyed, gets up from the counter, he raises a glass of Bellini, a peach non-alcoholic cocktail, and</p>

<p>&#8220;To our Blaze!&#8221;</p>
<p>“““To our Blaze!!”””</p>

<p>Everyone cheers and raises their glasses together.</p>
<p>Haruto also lightly, hit the glass of Claude.</p>

<p>“Haruto, thank you for your hard work&#8221;</p>
<p>“I should be the one saying it. The test counter-measures too, it was my bad to just leave you alone although you dashed up a preliminary test for me.”</p>
<p>&#8220;This kind of detailed work, is my duty so that’s fine. Instead, I’ll expect greatly from you for the practical skill exam.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Leave it to me&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps their exchange was heard, a boy who was nearby interpose between them.</p>

<p>“That’s right! Blow away the empire bastards!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially that Iris! Defeat that girl next time!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Haruto won’t lose to such a noble princess!!&#8221;</p>

<p>——<em>Defeat Iris, huh.</em></p>
<p>His inner heart is complicated, but he can&#8217;t show it on his face.</p>
<p>With a smile, Haruto responded by raising a hand. Then a loud applause and cheers erupted. Perhaps they felt that it was over, the students returned to their tables and chatted again.</p>
<p>Haruto gulped down the Bellini at once. When he put his empty glass on the counter, the bartender brought another cup to him right away.</p>
<p>This time, in a low voice, Claude told Haruto.</p>

<p>&#8220;The invasion of the Northern Demons (Tempest), seems to be more serious than I expected.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“……That much?”</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the information from the Hero&#8217;s Guild, who visited the site. There are rumors that the Empire is planning to move to the south of the defense line. I fear that it’s likely, that they’ll withdraw to the Blaze&#8217;s territory.&#8221;</p>

<p>The continent can be divided into two, the extreme north, which is an unexplored land, and the land where the humans live.</p>
<p>And the human land controls each land, in the form of the Absolute Empire in the north and west, the Blaze Republic in the east, and the Horizon Kingdom in the south.</p>
<p>There’s a river running along at the border, and the source of the river is almost in the center of the continent. It’s the lake where this Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy is located.</p>
<p>By the way, the Luminous religion state is in the territory of the Absolute Empire, and compared to the other three countries, its area is extremely small.</p>
<p>The only place where these four countries meet across the river, is this Grandia.</p>
<p>Currently, only the Absolute Empire is in contact with the extreme north, where the Northern Demon (Tempest) is located.</p>
<p>That is, because the territory of the Absolute Empire is blocking the north, it doesn’t weigh on Blaze.</p>
<p>However, when the border between the empire and the far north was moved south, it became a shared form between the Empire and Blaze. In other words, the Republic of Blaze was forced to take on half the defense from the Northern Demon (Tempest).</p>
<p>When Claude said, &#8220;The empire is planning to go south of the defense line.&#8221;, it had such meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, if they have done that, the territory of the empire will decrease. Besides, what will happen to the people living there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To that end, it&#8217;s still a rumor.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p>&#8220;But, the empire is struggling to the extent that such rumors come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that Blaze is also seriously discussing it. Including the reorganization of the military. From there, what becomes important is ——”</p>
<p>“Us…… why”</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s correct. Eventually, our regular army will have to defend against the Northern Demons (Tempest). However, our regular army is also an amateur against the Northern Demon (Tempest). They have to come under our command. We, will be one step closer to our ideals.”</p>
<p>“……Defeat the Absolute Empire, and create a world dominated by the Republic of Blaze.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, we&#8217;re going to move the Blaze with our hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto also drank his second cocktail, all at once. Claude continues while watching such Haruto.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people who rule the Blaze today, are those who have lost their national ideals, and are only thinking about their own interests and self-protection &#8230;&#8230; Traitors who made Blaze their own. If we leave it as it is, the country may be destroyed in 20 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re still kids. We don’t have power.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would be a lot better for the current ruler to be a kid, you know. With Haruto and everyone here, we can create a new era.&#8221;</p>
<p>“You’re overestimating me”</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a legitimate evaluation. You’re Blaze&#8217;s youngest leading magician. Your popularity among the people is undisputed. We’ll wheedle our way, so Haruto should just greatly prepare and get aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>I will take care of the dirty work</em> —— Claude added, while sweetly smiling.</p>
<p>Haruto was a little suffocated because of the weight of expectations from him.</p>
<p><em>What do the other guys will think?</em></p>
<p>On the surface, as they were relieved from the pressure of the exam, they cut loose without thinking about anything, looking just like drunken persons.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto frowns,</p>

<p>“Oy, Claude. This Bellini is nonalcoholic, right?”</p>
<p>“……It should be, though”</p>

<p>Because of that, everyone strangely has high tension, and there are red-faced guys mixed here and there.</p>

<p>“Hey~, what are you two guys doing~! I don’t like it~”</p>

<p>Kyrie, whose cheeks are red, got entwined with Haruto.</p>

<p>“You’re drunk already”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not! Because it&#8217;s non-alcoholic!&#8221;</p>

<p>Though she said that, her appearance of laughing happily can be called drunk no matter how one looks at it.</p>

<p>“Who, is the bastard who opened one without permission……”</p>
<p>“Well, this is a store run by Blaze people, so it should be fine. I will tell them to keep it a secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>This Grandia is a special district that isn’t in any territory. It’s the only town on this continent where the four countries line up shops in the same land.</p>
<p>However, most of the customers at Blaze-owned stores, are still from Blaze. Which is precisely why, they are given considerations to a little overdoing.</p>
<p>Claude disappears into the back of the store, and Kyrie leaves with an unsteady gait.</p>
<p>Looking over the students who make loud noises, Haruto suddenly, wondered if Iris was also doing a closing party at this time.</p>
<p><em>Since they’re Absolute. I&#8217;m sure, they’re doing a tea party or something.</em></p>
<p>Like that, when he thought so, a cat came near his feet.</p>
<p>A long fur, pure white cat.</p>

<p>“——This guy is”</p>

<p>When he squatted down, he quickly pulled out the paper tied to its collar.</p>
<p>As he put the paper in his pocket casually, the cat disappeared before he knew it.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>Looking towards the way out, it was about to exit through the open door. As if to follow after it, Haruto also headed for the exit.</p>

<p>“Oy~, where are you going? Haruto&#8221;</p>

<p>A student near the exit called out to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I drank a little too much. I&#8217;m going to breathe in the air outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Already!? What kind of pace are you drinking at!&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving behind a laughing voice, Haruto went outside.</p>
<p>While walking on the stone pavement, he takes out the paper hidden inside his pocket.</p>
<p>The sender, and the name of a place were written there.</p>
<p>Haruto ran through the city full of waterways, and headed to the place which was designated.</p>

<p>At a large bridge over the grand canal, Canal Grande——the Memphis Bridge.</p>
<p>On both sides of it, there are a lot of small shops. There is a sidewalk further outside the shopping street, which overlooks the Canal Grande.</p>
<p>Beautiful <em>consumer </em>buildings were lined up on both sides of the gently curving river, and many ships were floating in the river.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one of the best views of this Grandia.</p>
<p>A girl who colors the magnificent view even more beautifully, was leaning her body on the handrail, and gazing at the river surface.</p>

<p>“Iris”</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Haruto-kun&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked back at him with her silver hair fluttering.</p>
<p>Her figure, is more beautiful than the scenery behind her.</p>
<p>Iris, floated a relieved smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad &#8230;&#8230; you received the letter properly, Haruto-kun.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“Ah, Iris’ familiar passed it over at a nice timing. But, isn&#8217;t Absolute also in the middle of their closing party?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Yes. Rather than waiting after it&#8217;s over, I wondered if it will get in the way……”</p>

<p>Casting her eyes down, Iris who looks embarrassed was very cute.</p>

<p>“……I see. Luminous and Horizon would have gathered somewhere by now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Francette said that it&#8217;s near the store where the Absolute were having their closing party. That’s why, if we go beyond the Canal Grande, perhaps no one will find us …&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“Understood. Let&#8217;s cross the bridge&#8221;</p>

<p>As Haruto and Iris quickly crossed the bridge, they felt a little relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, where are we going?&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris frowned in a troubled way.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p>&#8220;Picking a place, is important, right?&#8221;</p>

<p><em>That’s true, </em>Haruto thought. They’ll discuss about Sazaku and Prospero, and about the Demon King&#8217;s half body. They don’t want people to hear their conversation.</p>

<p>“It’s our first commemorable date &#8230;&#8230; it&#8217;s my first time going to a shop &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was far from the pretext that he was thinking.</p>

<p>“I,indeed…… Iris, where do you want to go? We can go anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Thinking about it, Iris wouldn&#8217;t have the chance to play alone in the city. This is a long-awaited opportunity. I want to fulfill her wishes as much as possible.</em></p>

<p>“That is, uhmm, I heard about it from a Horizon girl talking the other day &#8230;&#8230; there is a shop I’m a little curious about, but&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go there. Do you know its location?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I can tell if it&#8217;s the name of the shop. It&#8217;s called Hell&#8217;s Kitchen.&#8221; <em>(TN: You read that right)</em></p>

<p><em>&#8230;&#8230; Hell&#8217;s Kitchen?</em></p>
<p><em>That’s a very, devilish name.</em></p>
<p><em>Perhaps, it&#8217;s a place where we can get information about darkness magic and the demon king&#8217;s half-body.</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><em>The date she said must’ve been a joke, and as I thought, Iris had been thinking about it seriously, too.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;If you know that, then it’s just fine. If we ask someone, we&#8217;ll know right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, they quickly found the store they were looking for.</p>

<p>“……Is this it?”</p>

<p>It’s a small store facing the square just across the bridge.</p>
<p>A fancy white and pink sign that says Hell&#8217;s Kitchen is there. And then, an incredibly sweet scent drifted through the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard that it&#8217;s a crepe shop &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Indeed, it was a crepe shop. The menu was lined with chocolates, caramel, bananas, strawberries, and countless toppings. </em></p>
<p><em>Once again, it was far from what I expected.</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>By the way, there are no seats, only takeout.</p>

<p>“But, this……is it really a crepe specialty store? There is no entrance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that this place is specially for takeout. Rather, let’s eat around that area.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were also benches in the square, and some women were actually eating crepes they had bought in there. It certainly seems to be a popular shop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, we&#8217;ve come all this way. So, let’s buy some”</p>
<p>“Yes…… uhmm”</p>

<p>Iris squirmed and glanced at Haruto as if she was having trouble saying something.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? If you have something to say, say it clearly.”</p>
<p>“……After all, it’s my first experience.”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><em> Ah, I see.</em></p>
<p><em>Since she’s a princess. She has never bought food in such a commoner-like store, and she didn&#8217;t seem to have any experience in buying food in the first place. When it comes to things that is close to eating in standing like this, it would be a hurdle for Iris.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never bought &#8230;&#8230; stuff for myself. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s from there!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she tentatively had her wallet. However, all it contains are high-denomination bills, so she feels bad about using it in a store like this. Haruto pulled out a coin from his wallet and gave it to Iris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway. Why don&#8217;t you order one and buy it for yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ye,yes! This me is still the leading magician of the Absolute Empire! I&#8217;ll get it done!&#8221;</p>

<p>After much deliberation, Iris selected, all of the toppings.</p>
<p>Haruto initially said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need it.&#8221;, but Iris had a sad look on her face, so he asked for the same.</p>
<p>After placing the order and paying, Iris turned her sparkling gaze to Haruto.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;I did it, Haruto-kun! I, was able to shop!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I,indeed …&#8230; that’s great.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Haruto complimented her, she snorted and had a rough proud look. He can&#8217;t help but think that Iris is cute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, it appears that your order is ready. Make sure you get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the shop staff handed her the crepe, Iris’ smile changed to a dubious one.</p>

<p>“Err…… is this, really a crepe?&#8221;</p>

<p>While holding a crepe with fresh cream and fruit which was being wrapped inside it with both hands, Iris stared at it with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>“What is with that <em>this is not a crepe </em>look?”</p>
<p>&#8220;It was different from the crepe I know, so …&#8230;&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Which part is different?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s usually on a plate, and it&#8217;s round and looks like a galette, with fresh cream and fruits on top of it, but…&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because this is for the commoners. Besides, while shopping and enjoying oneself, they’ve tried to make it easy to eat as one does that. Well, try some.&#8221;</p>
<p>“I see…… You won&#8217;t need a knife and fork to eat this. It’s a little, ill-mannered, but &#8230;&#8230; thanks for the meal”</p>

<p>That what she said, but she just stared at the crepe in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Improper imitation like this in public &#8230;&#8230; Is it okay?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thinking that it couldn&#8217;t be helped, Haruto let himself first tried it.</p>
<p><em>——Sweet!?</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like sweet things, but this is quite intense.</em></p>

<p>Iris also took the plunge and bit into it with a small mouthful.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;This is &#8230;&#8230; violently sweet, alright.&#8221;</p>

<p>As to whether a girl would think so, Haruto felt a little relieved.</p>
<p>However,</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like its pursuing only a sweet but rough, strong impact that has nothing to do with delicacy &#8230;&#8230; Plus, all the flavors of the toppings got mixed up&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>While sandwiching comments that can be taken as complaints, the princess eats continuously in haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this …&#8230; this feeling of peculiarity …&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>She completed it in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p><em>Girls are amazing</em>, like that, Haruto rolled his tongue. And then Haruto, bought an additional espresso, and somehow swallowed the violent sweetness.</p>

<p>“Haruto-kun, thank you. I was able to do a lot of new things today.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“It’s not a big deal for me, you know.”</p>
<p>&#8220;That might be the case for Haruto, but it&#8217;s a big thing for me. Once again, I was reminded &#8230;&#8230; that I don&#8217;t know the world.”</p>
<p>“Well…… if it isn’t necessary, you’ll have a chance to know it”</p>
<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun is kind, isn&#8217;t he”</p>
<p>“Is that right?”</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some people who turn blue simply because they don&#8217;t know the way people live and the common sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>If it had been before, Haruto might have thought so as well.</p>
<p>However, after getting to know Iris, he changed his mind a little. Of course, if it was a politician or a government official, if they don&#8217;t know how the commoners live, they can&#8217;t discuss about it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are some people who naturally don’t know it too.</p>
<p>Aristocrats have the social etiquette of noblemen, which is something that the common people don’t know, and even if they know it, they won&#8217;t understand its meaning or value.</p>
<p>However, it’s an essential conduct to survive in the aristocratic world. As he talked to Iris, Haruto came to understand that.</p>
<p>Iris murmured as if to confess.</p>

<p>“Moreover…… some time ago, I was asked to say a speech at the after party of the test, but &#8230;&#8230; while being stirred by everyone, I’ll defeat Blaze, and unify the Absolute —— that’s what I said”</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>


<p>Haruto also remembered doing it, so he scratched the back of his head awkwardly.</p>

<p>“<em>But those words, are just to uplift everyone&#8217;s morals, right?</em> When asked like that, I feel that it is not only that &#8230;&#8230; After all, I think it would be a lie to say that I don&#8217;t hate the Blaze Republic. The Empire’s rule of the continent &#8230;&#8230; such idea hasn’t change in me that it&#8217;s the best thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris looks up at Haruto&#8217;s face with reservation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But then, for what reason am I talking to Haruto-kun like this? Is this feeling of loving Haruto-kun a lie? When I think about it, I don&#8217;t understand why &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“You’re overthinking it”</p>

<p>Haruto throws a word of comfort at her, but Iris continues to spit out what was stuck in her heart, as if she was confessing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to get along with Haruto-kun normally. Dating like this, holding hands, tightly squeezing, without worrying about anyone&#8217;s eyes —— But every time we do that, the world would be one step closer to ruin&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“Iris”</p>
<p>&#8220;It won’t be just a betrayal of the Empire. It’s betrayal of the whole world&#8230;&#8230; I know it will lead the world to ruin, but I still want to be with Haruto. When I was thinking about how to do that, suddenly, frightening things floated in my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>“——Iris, it’s okay already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears came to Iris&#8217; eyes, and her beautiful eyes shimmered even more beautifully.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this feeling was due to the Demon King&#8217;s half body (Juliet) &#8230;&#8230; If it wasn&#8217;t my true feelings, but a fake, I would——&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto suddenly, held Iris&#8217; hand.</p>

<p>“……Haruto-kun”</p>
<p>&#8220;Calm down, Iris&#8221;</p>
<p>“But…… besides, if you held my hand, a Northern Demon (Tempest) will also ……”</p>
<p>“That sort of thing, I&#8217;ll do something about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris didn&#8217;t further argue. When she felt the temperature of Haruto which is holding her hand, her heart mysteriously calmed down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Actually &#8230;&#8230; I’ve also, told the guys to defeat the empire at our closing party. It’s just like the words from your mouth, and then I’ve meet Iris in this way. In the first place, we are fighting with the Northern Demons (Tempest), and have gathered to save the world. Meeting Iris, would summon the Northern Demon (Tempest). The contradiction was also of the right moment. We have no chance to be close.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, right …&#8230; if so, as I thought——&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, that can’t be it, you know. Humans, can’t be so easily separated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto with a faraway look, stares at the square.</p>
<p>In there, children are running around and playing. Parents are staring at them with a smile, and anxiety sometimes.</p>

<p>“When I was a kid, I lost my family.”</p>
<p>&#8220;That was …&#8230; an absolute soldier &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>To the shocked Iris, Haruto shook his head.</p>

<p>“But, I killed those guys. It was the flames when the Demon King&#8217;s half body woke inside me. So, as for revenge, it&#8217;s already over. Really”</p>
<p>“That…… became your hatred for the whole Absolute.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the same with Iris.</p>
<p>It’s from that day when she was attacked in her birthday party.</p>

<p>“But, it doesn’t feel like I can hate Iris. With that, I suddenly remembered it. The people who took care of me when I was a kid. Those guys, well, I couldn’t speak well of them. They are people who were doing shady business, and criminals.”</p>
<p>&#8220;That was &#8230;&#8230; you had a painful childhood &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>To Iris with a pitiful look, Haruto responds with a bitter smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not really. It was fun, you know. Those guys were weird fellows, and even though they&#8217;re doing all sorts of bad things, they were kind in strange places. Although they can take their lives without hesitation, they helped children and old people in need, and even avoided stepping on ants under their feet A man who cheats others out of their money, can be a good father at home*.&#8221; <em>(TN: Proverb)</em></p>
<p>“……That, seems to be a bit inconsistent”</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I thought. Human beings can be dirty, but beautiful, and contradictory creatures in the first place. There&#8217;s no one who&#8217;s completely separated by walls. Therefore, whether I hate the empire or want to save the world, I who like Iris, am not strange.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; face became brighter.</p>
<p>With a happy face, Haruto is also glad.</p>

<p>“Right now…… I, like you”</p>
<p>“……!!”</p>

<p>She thought that it was over, but there was a <em>post-festival*</em>. She was too embarrassed to say that she likes him or even facing him. <em>(TN: Idiomatic expression meaning ‘after the excitement is over’)</em></p>
<p>Haruto stood up after letting go of Iris’ hand.</p>

<p>“Le,let’s go now. Besides, there will be a Northern demon (Tempest) somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Because it&#8217;s our responsibility. We have to defeat it. &#8221;</p>

<p>With a super happy face, Iris stands up.</p>
<p>Just then, a parent who was letting her children play screams.</p>

<p>“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!? So,somebodyyyyy!!”</p>

<p>Behind the child, a Will-o-wisp was approaching as it floats.</p>
<p>When Iris rushes out in the wind, and passes behind the child, she slashes off the Will-O-Wisp between the opening.</p>
<p>When the mother hugs her child, she thanks Iris many times.</p>
<p>As Iris returns to Haruto, she smiled with a slight embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Since it’s our fault…… I’m bothered that she said thanks”</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not our fault. It’s is because of the Demon King’s half body.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, but……”</p>

<p>Then, at that moment, a scream was heard from the other side of the building, instead of the square.</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>As Haruto and Iris looked at each other, they started running at the same time. They ran through the alleyway, went around the buildings, and when they turned around the corner, there was a bakery, and inside such store, five or six large rats with horns were rampaging.</p>

<p>“Dead mouse huh”</p>

<p>A level 1 demon, and it wasn’t much of a threat. However, for the bakery being attacked, it’s a disaster. Besides, if they were attacked by those numbers, they will be seriously injured.</p>
<p>Haruto and Iris instantly smashed the Dead mouse that had just broke the glass and jumped out.</p>

<p>“However, I didn&#8217;t expect two types of Northern Demons (Tempest) will come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right &#8230;&#8230; just holding hands——&#8221;</p>

<p>They heard a scream again.</p>
<p>It isn’t one either. They heard it from all over the place.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>A black dog-like demon, was running through the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now …&#8230; was it a Gray Wolf?&#8221;</p>

<p>A lizard with wings growing flies overhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lizard Bird &#8230;&#8230;. Why are there so many types &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“What the hell is going on……”</p>
<p>『That is, because I summoned them』</p>
<p>“!?”</p>

<p>One big bat —— a Murciélago has come down.</p>

<p>『There are about 200 demons in this street. I’ll release 1 more for the next 10 seconds. Town would be in panic. Victims will rise as well』</p>

<p>The Murciélago is speaking. But the one who was really talking was——,</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-12137032' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-12137032' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p>&#8220;You bastard …&#8230; Sazaku?&#8221;</p>
<p>『Indeed. If you want to stop the demons, I’ll lead you to the summoning place』</p>

<p>The Murciélago had a black sphere on its leg.</p>
<p>——Black onyx.</p>
<p>The built-in magic formula unfolds from it, and a magic circle floats on the ground. The next moment, the Murciélago was sucked into the magic circle and disappeared.</p>

<p>“It’s a blatant trap, isn’t it”</p>
<p>“But…… We have no choice but to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Iris with a tense look, Haruto answers with a fearless smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s also true&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>When Haruto put his hand out as if to invite her to dance, Iris smiled a little and took his hand.</p>

<p>“Let’s go!!”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>The two jumped into the magic circle of transition.</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>“Here is……”</p>

<p>The two looked around to see where they had been transferred.</p>
<p>They are inside the building. And it was like a church as well.</p>
<p>There are no chairs, and it looks just like a large hall. At the back, the altar is decorated with a Luminous emblem.</p>
<p>However, they don&#8217;t know the location of the Luminous church.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>The transition magic circle wasn’t that big. Considering that the Northern Demon (Tempest) was in the city, they are probably somewhere in Grandia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun! That!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the direction Iris pointed, there were countless magic circles emerging on the ground. From there, the northern demons (Tempest) appear one after another and run outside the church.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a number of summoning magic &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun! Leaving that aside, we have to stop it!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true ——『Vulcan』!!&#8221;</p>

<p>A red magic circle floats at the tip of the sword pulled out by Haruto, and a mass of flame is fired from there.</p>
<p>The bullets of fire blow off the summoning magic circles drawn on the ground one after another, and the Northern Demon (Tempest) that are about to appear have disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright …&#8230; with this, the number of demons won&#8217;t increase anymore.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, when he exhaled a sigh of relief —— a sound of clapping was heard.</p>

<p>“!!”</p>

<p>The two stares at the person who made the sound, and they prepare their swords.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>From behind the altar, in front of the two who’s being vigilant, a man wearing a carnival mask appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well well, it takes courage to jump in knowing that it&#8217;s a trap. That’s youth. However, youth and stupidity are one piece of paper. Well then, this would be a problem. Which result will your choice lead to now?”</p>
<p>“……Sazaku”</p>

<p>Iris also pulls out her sword, and glares at Sazaku.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much she stares at him, she cannot tell the other person&#8217;s facial expression. His face under such mask, Haruto imagined.</p>
<p>The fact that they are using the Luminous Church this time again means, that it could be Clara, or one of her subordinates. Thinking about it, Clara often appears when he meets Iris.</p>
<p>When they fought Sazaku last time, she showed up immediately after that.</p>
<p><em>However, when it comes to using this much summoning magic, is it Fatima Nefer after all?</em></p>
<p><em>It should be possible to deceive us magically with a man-like body figure.</em></p>
<p>Haruto regrips the handle of his sword, and turns it towards Sazaku.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are a lot of things I want to ask you, you bastard. But first, I&#8217;ll knock you down and pull off that stupid mask of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Stupid —— mask?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p>Sazaku tilted his neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s not stupiddddddddddddddd!? This shitty!! Fucking kid!! Ah, I want kill you already! I’ll kill you! I’ll burn your body to ashes! No, rather than that, I’ll slice you alive in millimetersssssssssssssss!!”</p>

<p>As he was heavily breathing, he straightened his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me. I lose my composure.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point, Haruto became suspicious that he might be doing this on purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, the fact that you came here knowing it was a trap, means that you both have such feeling. In other words, you want to unite.” <em>(TN: LOL)</em></p>
<p>“You’re self-centered as usual…… I, would never do anything that can destroy the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so. Then, how about this?&#8221;</p>

<p>When Sazaku snaps his finger, a large magic circle floats in front of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s summoning magic! A big one is coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>Haruto and Iris, construct a magic formula inside their bodies, to prepare for the arrival of the enemies.</p>
<p>From the magic circle, it emerged.</p>
<p>Making the best use of a craftsman’s technique, it was a frame decorated with elegant sculptures.</p>
<p>It was a mattress with a built-in spring that are adjusted to the perfect firmness.</p>
<p>Has glossy sheets that guarantee a supreme touch.</p>
<p>There’s a canopy with the finest curtain overhead.</p>
<p>It was a bed no matter where you look it, from up, down, left and right.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it? Even if you look for such a bed all over the continent, it&#8217;s hard to get it, you know?&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Haruto drew back his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about it for a long time, but &#8230;&#8230; are you, stupid? You’ve given us a bed and you thought that we would say yes——&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Haruto was thrown into the bed.</p>

<p>“Wha……!?”</p>

<p>While falling down, he controlled his posture and fell on his back on the mattress. His hand that was trying to hold the sword was kicked off.</p>
<p>The sword was blown off of Haruto&#8217;s hand, and it slid down on the floor.</p>
<p>He tried to get up, but by that time, Iris was already riding him like a horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Iris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufu …&#8230; Haruto-kun❤&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Iris with a little devilish smile, was looking down at Haruto.</p>
<p><em>Reincarnation wedding (necromance)!? At times like this!!</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Fufufu, it seems that you can&#8217;t go against the power of the Demon King. Now then, it&#8217;s your chance to accomplish the thing you were thinking! Since I splurged in order to prepare the finest bed!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stupid bastard! You want to destroy the world with such a thing!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto tried to get up, but a string appeared from under the bed and wrapped around Haruto&#8217;s body.</p>

<p>“This is!?”</p>
<p>&#8220;I made use of my contemplation the other day, and restrained your body firmly this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto was bound to the bed in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>There are magic characters floating on the string.</p>
<p>—— Restriction Magic 『Restrain』.</p>
<p>This string also acts as a barrier. When he tries to assemble a magic formula in his body, the barrier interferes and the formula cannot be constructed. Even with all his might, of course he can’t escape.</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Iris smiled when she saw Haruto who couldn&#8217;t move.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor guy…… you’re tied up. Then, you can&#8217;t do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Iris! Stand firm! Wake up!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris sticks out her chest as if she’s showing it off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even though, you can massage them as much as you want …&#8230;❤&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he knew it, a heart-shaped light was floating in her eyes.</p>
<p><em>Damnit! Don&#8217;t be seriously beaten by the Reincarnation wedding(necromance)!</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;Iris, please hold on!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Aren’t you charmed by me? It doesn&#8217;t even feel like you’re going to touch me &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing! But it&#8217;s bad right now! The world will be destroyed!?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>However, whether she couldn’t hear Haruto&#8217;s restraining voice, or it sounded different to her, Iris laughed in a sweet voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ufufu &#8230;&#8230; we have to endure for the sake of the world&#8230;&#8230; that’s unreasonable. Becoming one &#8230;&#8230; the Demon king’s resurrection, too, it isn’t bad”</p>

<p>Iris removes her cloak, which is the proof of her being a leading magician, and takes off her jacket. She pulls the hem of her shirt out of her skirt. At that time, as he glanced at her white belly and cute navel, Haruto&#8217;s willpower has been shaved off.</p>
<p><em>Shit, stay on your ground, me! If I lose my sanity, the world is done for!</em></p>
<p>Iris unhooked her shirt and opened the front.</p>
<p>From that gap, he caught a glimpse of her pink bra.</p>

<p>&#8220;Iris! If you keep doing this, he too, can see it!! And yet, are you fine with that!?”</p>

<p>Haruto glared at Sazaku and shouted so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I don&#8217;t particularly have any hobbies of peeping.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>


<p>When Sazaku snapped his finger, the string on the canopy was unraveled. Then the curtains came down on all sides, and the bed became completely covered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Son of a b*tch! You’re so smart in strange places!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pressing down Haruto’s cheeks who was bellowing, Iris turns his body to her way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun &#8230;&#8230; there’s no one that will disturb us two anymore. No one can stop the love of the two people &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>When he saw Iris smiling happily, Haruto felt a pain in his chest.</p>
<p>Taking her hand off of Haruto, Iris slipped her shirt off her shoulders. Her white and thin shoulders were exposed, and her delicate collarbone was also unveiled.</p>
<p>And when she took off her shirt, Iris’ underwear is the only thing that hid her upper body.</p>
<p>A light pink bra, which was adorned with a splendid lace, was tightly holding Iris’ chest, and lifting it.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s beautiful.</em></p>
<p>Haruto honestly thought so.</p>
<p><em>I have never really seen Iris&#8217; boobs so seriously. It&#8217;s easy to tell that she has big breasts in her usual uniform, but it feels bigger because I&#8217;m looking up right now.</em></p>
<p><em>And even the shape is also good. Looking at it, she has a soft line. The fact that her bra is a little bit tucked in, emphasizes her fleshiness even more.</em></p>
<p>Every time she breathes, her boobs themselves move up and down as if they were breathing. Looking at the movements, it felt like he could feel the warmth of her boobs on his skin even though he hadn&#8217;t touched it.</p>
<p>And then, her white skin that smells so sweet. He felt like he wanted to bury his face into her chest.</p>
<p><em>This is, Iris’ body.</em></p>
<p><em>——</em> <em>I want this body.</em></p>
<p><em>—— I want to make it mine.</em></p>
<p><em>—— I want to be one with her.</em></p>
<p>Muttering inside his heart, Haruto suddenly returned to himself.</p>
<p><em>I…… just now, what the heck is……</em></p>
<p>At that time, Iris puts her hand on her back.</p>
<p>A small sound of something coming off was heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! Iris!!&#8221;</p>

<p>The bra that was holding down her chest in place becomes loose, and her boobs jump out and bounce in front of him.</p>
<p>And then, just before her bra slips from her chest,</p>
<p>Haruto turned his face away.</p>
<p>His palpitations are so severe, that the sound of his heart seems to reach his own ears.</p>
<p><em>This is bad.</em></p>
<p><em>Iris…… if I look at her bare chest, perhaps my reason will blow away.</em></p>
<p><em>Sh*t! Did the effect of the Reincarnation wedding(necromance) begin to appear on me too!?</em></p>

<p><img src="https://ukutranslations.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screenshot_2021-03-31-00-04-47-272_jp.bookwalker.kreader.android.epub_.jpg?w=721" alt="" width="563" height="801" /></p>

<p>Either way, he was in a desperate situation.</p>
<p>From an objective point of view, it only looks like a female-superior bondage play.</p>
<p><em>It’s such a state, but it is a world crisis.</em></p>
<p><em>The fate of the world, will be determined by whether or not I see Iris&#8217; bare chest.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“Will you look &#8230;&#8230; at this way already? You see, I haven&#8217;t shown it to anyone yet, you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>Slightly sulking, she invites him with a seductive voice.</p>
<p>Even so, when he stubbornly turned his face away, Iris muttered while thinking a little.</p>

<p>“It’ll be good if Haruto&#8217;s one hand is free, but …&#8230;”</p>

<p>Then, behind the curtain, Sazaku responds in a troubled voice.</p>

<p>“<em>Fumu</em>…… well, one hand is fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the sound of his finger snapping, Haruto&#8217;s right hand was freed.</p>
<p><em>——Alright!</em></p>

<p>“『Flame』!”</p>

<p>But nothing happened.</p>

<p>“F*ck…… it was no good huh”</p>

<p>Even if he tried to forcibly activate his magic, he was hindered by the barrier of 『Restrain』. Haruto clicked his tongue in his heart, but at the same time, he noticed something strange.</p>
<p><em>——</em> <em>The magic formula of this barrier…… No way?</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;Come now, Haruto-kun. Your hand……&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris grabs Haruto&#8217;s right hand with both her hands, and pulls it towards her.</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>Iris grabs Haruto&#8217;s right hand with both her hands and pulls it up.</p>
<p><em>That means that…… right now, Iris isn&#8217;t covering her chest with her hands.</em></p>
<p>Just the thought of it made him think of Iris&#8217; boobs swaying from side to side.</p>
<p>At that moment, Haruto&#8217;s consciousness was fading away.</p>
<p><em>Dammit! What are you doing digging your own grave, me!! Don&#8217;t think about it! Be insentient! Mu——,</em></p>
<p>It felt as if he was being absorbed into the palm of her hand.</p>
<p><em>It was a new feeling for me.</em></p>
<p><em>That incredible softness.</em></p>
<p><em>That quite indescribable elasticity.</em></p>
<p><em>I remembered as it was over the cloth.</em></p>
<p><em>However, when it was touched directly, the feeling is completely different.</em></p>
<p><em>Her moist, smooth skin seems to get absorbed into my hands.</em></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><em>Her body temperature is being transmitted directly to me.</em></p>
<p><em>I can even feel her heartbeat.</em></p>
<p><em>More than anything,</em></p>
<p><em>It tickles the palm of my hand, a slightly stiffer feel.</em></p>
<p><em>It was the only rough feeling of discomfort in the smoothness of her skin. </em></p>
<p><em>As it rolled around in my hands, a thrilling feeling of pleasure wells up from deep within my chest. (TN: LOL, it’s her n*ps)</em></p>
<p><em>I want to feel it more.</em></p>
<p>Unconsciously, he applied force into his hands, and his fingers sunk into such soft object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hahn❤&#8221;</p>

<p>A seductive sigh escaped from Iris’ mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun &#8230;&#8230; it feels good❤&#8221;</p>

<p>The door in the depths of Haruto creaked.</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-98131664' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-98131664' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p>——Get it, the power of destruction.</p>
<p><em>Shut up.</em></p>
<p>——『The Demon King&#8217;s Half Body(Juliet)』.</p>
<p><em>Noisy.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“I……”</p>

<p>The door slowly opens.</p>

<p>“I am!”</p>

<p>Something is trying to emerge through the gap of that door.</p>
<p>——Destroy the world.</p>
<p>From behind that door, an intense amount of magic power flowed out.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><em>Inside my body, the power of the Demon King runs around.</em></p>
<p><em>Don’t fuck with me.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;I am! The world, too! Iris! Don&#8217;t give up!!&#8221;</p>

<p><em>I took my hand off Iris’ chest.</em></p>
<p><em>I extend that hand right out to the side.</em></p>
<p><em>It should be beyond that.</em></p>
<p><em>My buddy, which I dropped some time ago.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;Come! Phoenix!!&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to assemble the magic formula of movement magic 『Movement』 inside his own body.</p>
<p>However, his magic is sealed due to the boundary barrier of 『Restrain』.</p>
<p>——It was supposed to be.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>However, that barrier was torn off and the magic formula was completed.</p>
<p>And the enormous amount of magic power that overflows from the bottom of his body flows into the magic formula.</p>
<p>At that moment, a red sword flew into Haruto&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>“Hah!”</p>

<p>He thrust in the sword between their bodies and the string, in order to break the restraining magic.</p>

<p>“Iris!!”</p>
<p>“Kyaah!?”</p>

<p>He flips his body, and this time he holds Iris down on the bed.</p>
<p>He turned around, slashed the curtain, and flew at once.</p>

<p>“Uooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh”</p>

<p>He flew his body to Sazaku with 『Movement』.</p>

<p>“Wha!?”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>The Phoenix&#8217;s sharp blow hit Sazaku, who was caught off guard.</p>
<p>The mask splits in half and bursts apart.</p>

<p>“Guh!?”</p>

<p>Sazaku hurriedly hid his face, and fled backwards.</p>

<p>“Haruto-kun!”</p>

<p>Fastening the hook of her shirt, Iris comes running up to him.</p>
<p>Perhaps she couldn&#8217;t afford to put on a bra properly, Iris&#8217; chest wrapped in elastic fabric shook greatly every time she ran.</p>

<p>“Uh,uhmm……. I”</p>
<p>“We’ll talk later. More than that——”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>Haruto carried his sword over his shoulder, and glared at Sazaku.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to hide your face. <em>Elric-sensei</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris, who was about to put her sleeves on her jacket, stopped moving.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Sazaku, Elric-sensei? &#8230;&#8230; that shouldn’t be……”</p>
<p>“『Restrain』”</p>

<p>When Haruto told her, Iris remembered that Elric-sensei had tied them up with the restraint magic 『Restrain』.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Elric-sensei is good at restraint magic, but &#8230;&#8230; there are other magicians who can use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But no magic formula is ever an exact match.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; eyes widely opened.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>The magic formula is basically the same, but each person has their own subtle quirks and personality. It&#8217;s kind of like handwriting, so to speak. From there, it is also possible to identify the magician.</p>
<p>Sazaku&#8217;s eyes peeked through the gap between his fingers that hid his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was tied up by at the perverted bed, in an attempt to break the barrier of 『Restrain』, I analyzed the magic formula from the string that touched my body. I couldn&#8217;t make my own magic formula due to the effect of his barrier, but I read his magic formula.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Haruto-kun…… then, that’s”</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. When I was bound up in the classroom, I did the same thing to try to escape. As a result of comparing the two, there was no difference, and they were the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>“——Fuh”</p>

<p>Sazaku dropped the hand that had been hiding his face.</p>
<p>What was there, was the face they saw many times in the classroom.</p>
<p>It was the face of a blonde, refreshing handsome teacher.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Elric &#8230;&#8230; sensei…&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>The look in her eyes, as if Iris couldn’t believe what she was seeing, look at the man who called himself Sazaku.</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>&#8220;No, Haruto-kun, way to go. I thought you were certainly stupid, though”</p>

<p>The content of his words were insulting, but the tone of his voice was as gentle as ever.</p>
<p>Haruto, without replying to his light talk, glares at Elric.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Sorry, sorry. You are, after all, a head magician. When it comes to practical skills, you can&#8217;t be underestimated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris appeals to Elric with her eyes still in disbelief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sensei! This is &#8230;&#8230; this is, what the heck does this mean!?”</p>
<p>“What does this mean, is it?”</p>

<p>It was the same kind, slightly delicate smile as in the classroom.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->

<p>“Hahaha, isn&#8217;t it decided because I am a Prospero&#8217;s apostle.”</p>
<p>“Then…… you being a member of the Hero’s Guild——&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>As if he can&#8217;t believe it, Haruto shouts.</p>

<p>“Stop bullshitting me! Don&#8217;t you dare say random words!!”</p>
<p>“Bullshit——?”</p>

<p>Elric&#8217;s neck tilted in an angle.</p>

<p>“You’re the one who’s bullshitting meeeeeeeee!? You bum don’t even listen to the classes, and you were making a lot of noise!? This fucking kiiiiiiiiiiid! Who the hell do you think you are, you bastarddddddd!!”</p>

<p>By his outburst, the two of them were taken aback.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“Always, always making fun of adultsssssssss!? I don&#8217;t care if you guys live or die, you pieces of shit! You guys are always making me stupid and I don&#8217;t like ittttttttttt! Both the students and teachers at the academy! The upper management of each country is also incompetent and uselesssssssss! The Hero’s guild is just fools who don&#8217;t know the truthhh! It&#8217;s a rubbish guild, isn&#8217;t itttttttt!”</p>

<p>Elric then straightened his neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, sorry, sorry. Sensei, was just a little distraught.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a refreshing smile, he laughed <em>hahaha.</em></p>
<p>That smile that brings so much comfort in the classroom, makes them feel madness now.</p>

<p>&#8220;To explain it properly, I&#8217;m originally from Luminous. However, the upper echelons of the church have no eyes to see people. It&#8217;s all a bunch of silly precepts and rules that don&#8217;t make sense. In the end, they picked up and made a child into a child of God. I abandoned Luminous and went to the Hero’s Guild.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Pick up a child &#8230;&#8230;a child of God?&#8221;</p>

<p>Clara&#8217;s face crossed Haruto&#8217;s mind. However, ignoring Haruto&#8217;s murmur, Elric continued to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Hero’s Guild was no good either! They don&#8217;t appreciate me!! If you weren’t conferred with leader position, your rank won&#8217;t go up. And to top it off, I became a teacher!? Babysitter of kids!?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Elric&#8217;s neck, gradually tilts.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of them do justice in valuing others! Both Luminous and the Hero’s Guild value the people they like. If you don&#8217;t join a close friend’s group, you won&#8217;t get ahead! It&#8217;s ridiculous!!”</p>

<p>Elric&#8217;s expression, twisted in hatred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I am superior, so they were jealous. They thought I will deprive them of their positions! That&#8217;s why if they don&#8217;t evaluate me, they won&#8217;t have to promote me! Dirty hypocrites! I, despaired of this world that didn&#8217;t recognize me! If the world doesn&#8217;t recognize me, I don&#8217;t recognize this world either!!&#8221;</p>
<p>“——Tuh!!”</p>

<p>Haruto&#8217;s heart bounced.</p>
<p>Elric’s muddy eyes, broadly grins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t you also think this way? A world that doesn&#8217;t admit you —— I’ll destroy it”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Cold sweat runs down on Haruto&#8217;s cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;The world will never recognize your relationship, too, right? Then you can just destroy it. Using the power of the Demon King&#8221;</p>
<p>“You bastard …&#8230; is that why you enter Prospero?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Yes! Prospero acknowledged me. They took me up as an executive right away! And they taught me how to destroy the world! The human world is coming to an end, and the Demon world is coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let all of humanity follow your heart!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ha? They won&#8217;t die, you know? What are you saying?&#8221;</p>
<p>“……What?”</p>

<p>Both Haruto and Iris, stared at Elric with a dubious look.</p>

<p>“Well, they’ll mostly die! But they won&#8217;t be annihilated. Because, if you kill them all, you won’t any slaves!”</p>
<p>&#8220;……What do you mean&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We, Prospero, are the <em>new demon</em> so to speak. Following the Northern Demons, we Prospero will become the rulers of the new world. The human beings will be our labor force, and the food of the demons. Simply put, they’ll be livestocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; face was distorted in anger.</p>

<p>“Unbelievable…… even so, you were a priest, a hero, and a teacher!?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Indeed”</p>

<p>Without being timid at all, Elric answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you can&#8217;t be a ruler in this world with those! But if I switch to the Demons, you can become a ruler! If so, there is no choice but to do it!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elric, complained as if it was unreasonable.</p>
<p>Haruto and Iris, thought.</p>
<p><em>——He’s insane.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Hate to break it to you, but we like this world just fine. I love it that way.”</p>
<p>“Whoa, then you guys can&#8217;t have sex forever, can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; cheeks, turn red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tha,that&#8217;s not the point! My heart and Haruto’s, are connected with each other!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elric&#8217;s neck, which remained tilted, returned straight back.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>He looked at Iris with a puzzled look on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps, you really love each other?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Eh……”</p>

<p>Iris involuntarily held her breath.</p>
<p>Elric bursts into laughter at Iris, who seems to be shocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Did you think it was real love!? Did you really like each other!? That&#8217;s not the case! It&#8217;s all a lie! It&#8217;s an illusion! The demon king’s half body, are just drawing each other together!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; face turned deep blue. The hand holding her sword trembled.</p>

<p>“N……no, it’s different…… I! I really, want Haruto-kun &#8230;&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Like I said, that&#8217;s the power of the Demon King! Naiveeeeeeeeeeee!”</p>
<p>“That is……”</p>

<p>Tears welled up in Iris&#8217; eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie &#8230;&#8230; This feeling, is really …&#8230; genuine &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“Uhahahahahahahahaha! You’re crying!? After all, you fell in love at first sight!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; shoulders jumped.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, isn’t it! The Demon king’s halves are just calling each other! It’s love? That’s stupid!! It’s just sexual desire! Ahahahahahaha!!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sword slipped out from Iris&#8217; hand and rolled to the floor, making a noise.</p>
<p>Tears spilled from her eyes without stopping.</p>

<p>“No…… it’s different…… I &#8230;&#8230; for the first time, really &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice became fainter, and she started crying.</p>
<p>There was neither the face of the princess nor the figure of the leading magician in that.</p>
<p>The only one who was sad was the girl.</p>
<p>As if crumbling, Iris sat down on the spot.</p>
<p>Seeing that figure, Elric smiles with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s fine, isn’t it. It has nothing to do with love or affection. If only there was a physical relationship ——&#8221;</p>
<p>“——Wait”</p>

<p>Haruto, who had been silent until then, muttered.</p>
<p>Haruto&#8217;s eyes reflected Iris, who broke down in tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elric, you can&#8217;t let us die&#8221;</p>

<p>With those words, Elric happily put his hands together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hahahaha, you know what you are doing. That’s right, as I thought of a man. It&#8217;s not about feelings or love, it&#8217;s about your bodies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto carried his red sword on his shoulder, and walked slowly towards Elric.</p>
<p>Flames ran around its body, and sparks scattered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a lot of things I need to get you to speak about. But ——”</p>

<p>Raising his face, a flame of anger was burning in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I won’t just blow you away the normal way!! Prepare yourself!!”</p>

<p>Haruto&#8217;s body disappears.</p>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>It was an instant activation of 『Movement』. He jumped into Elric&#8217;s bosom in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>He slammed his sword into him with frightening speed.</p>
<p>Elric also prevents it with his sword. However, Haruto pushes in as it is——,</p>

<p>“『Vulcan』!!”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>

<p>Flames burst between the two men.</p>
<p>On contact, he shoots a fire bullet, and cause an explosion between the two. It was an attack which he was prepared to take damage for.</p>
<p>The shock wave of the explosion separates the bodies of the two.</p>

<p>“Kuh…… Are you crazy!? You’ll receive your own blow too!?&#8221;</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t need you to worry about my head! 『Flame』!!”</p>

<p>The sword fires out flames, and Haruto sets on Elric once more.</p>

<p>“This brat!! 『Eclipse』!“</p>

<p>Darkness wraps Elric&#8217;s sword.</p>
<p><em>——No,</em></p>
<p>What was supposed to be darkness, was a purple flame.</p>

<p>“Behold! This is the flame of the 『Soul of the Demon King』!! It&#8217;s not a modest fire like that of a Blaze, it&#8217;s a world-burning fire!! And <em>——</em>”</p>

<p>Elric holds a purple-burning sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I’m from the Hero’s guild. My sword skill is above you”</p>

<p>Haruto smiled ferociously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Interesting! Show me the sword of a Hero who fell into the darkness!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto and Elric run at the same time.</p>
<p>Sword clashed with sword.</p>
<p>Red sparks, and purple sparks fly in the air.</p>
<p>The trails of the red and purple swords created innumerable lines in the air.</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>“This fucking kiddddddddddddddddddd!”</p>
<p>“This chap from the Hero’s guildddddddddddddd!”</p>

<p>The incessant metallic sound continued, like it was a single sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter how much you kids deny it, the facts don&#8217;t change! Your destiny has already been decided! You have no other choice but to become a Demon king!!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop bullshitting! We will decide our destiny from now on! We are!!”</p>

<p>Haruto momentarily turned his back on Erlic.</p>
<p>Elric isn’t someone who will miss such opportunity. He swings a deadly blow down to Haruto&#8217;s back.</p>
<p>However, he had read such move.</p>
<p>Haruto ducks under his sword, and slams his own sword into Elric&#8217;s stomach.</p>

<p>“Guhaa!?”</p>

<p>He felt his hard armor on his hands. Under his clothes, Elric was wearing armor with magic defense.</p>
<p>However——,</p>

<p>“『Vulcan』!!”</p>

<p>The flames create an explosion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guhaah!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elric was sent flying backwards in a grand way, and rolled on the floor.</p>

<p>“Such, such! Such! Such! Fucking kidddddddddddddd!!”</p>

<p>While spitting saliva mixed with blood, Elric stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been pissing me off from the start! You&#8217;re cocky and you&#8217;ve got a big attitude! You don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to be a teacher! What&#8217;s more, even though you’re a kid, you’re a leading magician? How lucky can you get!? How much money did you pile up!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s a matter of ability, you know. I won the Blaze magic martial arts tournament. Well…… there were a lot of things I had to do to get into, though &#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto smiles bitterly, and repositions his sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I, carved out my destiny at that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaaaaaaa!? Shut the f*ck upppppp! This idiot!! Since destiny is decided, it’s destiny! You guys’ future, has already been decided!!”</p>

<p>Elric held up his two fingers, and placed them on the stomach of his sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;The source of dark magic is anger! It&#8217;s my rage against that unreasonable fate!!”</p>

<p>His magic power swells, and purple flames begin to scatter from Elric&#8217;s body.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“『Vampir』!!”</p>

<p>A black magic circle unfolded beneath Haruto&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>“——Wha”</p>

<p>By the time he tried to escape, the strength had already drained from his body.</p>
<p>There was nothing he could do, so he dropped to his knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is &#8230;&#8230; my physical strength, and magic power…… are being absorbed?”</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Well done! I&#8217;m going to worn you out, and let you fuck that crying girl over there. With that…… if I revive the Demon King &#8230;&#8230; I’ll be the greatest in Prospero. I will leave behind the other executives, even the master &#8230;&#8230; Fufufu&#8221;</p>

<p><em>&#8230;&#8230; Other executives? Master?</em></p>
<p>Questions arise in Haruto&#8217;s head, but that isn’t the point right now.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the hell you&#8217;re talking about, but&#8230;&#8230; this bastard!”</p>

<p>Haruto stands up with all his strength.</p>
<p>However, he couldn&#8217;t get any strength into his knees at all. If he was pushed, he would likely fall down easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elric &#8230;&#8230; The source of your power isn’t anger. It’s selfish jealousy and resentment. We don&#8217;t have time to deal with that kind of nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blood vessels emerged on Elric&#8217;s forehead.</p>

<p>“Shut uuuuuuuuup!! You ignorant kid! You’ve never felt frustration, so you’re just a fool who was saying such sleep-talk! Look at that woman!”</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; body jolted from her reverie.</p>

<p>&#8220;That hopeless look, is the right look for you guys! You know what I&#8217;m talking about, don&#8217;t you!? You guys are just containers! Just a temporary residence for the Demon King! It&#8217;s like you yourselves don&#8217;t even exist! Accept the reality, Haruto Shindou!! Neither your existence nor your mind is real! That&#8217;s why your heart and your feelings are all lies!”</p>

<p>Iris shook her shoulders, and continued to let her tears fall to the floor.</p>
<p>To that figure of her, Haruto calls out from the bottom of his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Raise your face! Iris!!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p>Iris raises her face timidly.</p>
<p>With her cries, the area around her eyes becomes bright red. Her eyes spill large tears, and she stares at Hart as if she’s seeking salvation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our feelings are real!&#8221;</p>
<p>“……Haruto-kun”</p>
<p>“My feelings of love for Iris, it has no lie or truth! Even if it was because of the Demon King&#8217;s half-body! Since——”</p>

<p>Haruto cried out, praying that his heart would connect with Iris.</p>

<p>“Since right now, this feeling I have for Iris, is real!”</p>
<p>“Haruto……kun”</p>

<p>The sparkle returns to Iris&#8217;s eyes. However ——</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>“『Eclipse』”</p>

<p>Elric swung his sword again. A purple shockwave struck Haruto.</p>

<p>“Guo!?”</p>

<p>Blood spewed from Haruto&#8217;s knees.</p>
<p>Again, Haruto kneels. Then, one after another, cuts were carved into his arms, back, and cheeks.</p>

<p>“Aaaah, I’m so pissed off alreadyyyyyyyyyy! I don&#8217;t care about your feelings and such!! As long as you can get together and revive the Demon King, that&#8217;s all that matters——&#8221;</p>
<p>“『Protect』!!”</p>

<p>An ice wall rose in front of Haruto.</p>
<p>Absolute’s defense magic. It is an ice barrier boasting formidable strength.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->

<p>&#8220;This f*cking princess &#8230;&#8230; I wish you could just be quiet and despair.”</p>

<p>Iris wiped her tears away, and picked up her sword which had fallen to the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if this feeling is real or not. &#8230;.. But my feelings here, right now, are undeniably true.”</p>

<p>Her blue eyes glared at Elric.</p>

<p>“This me won&#8217;t allow you to hurt Haruto-kun!!”</p>

<p>Elric tears off his well-groomed golden hair.</p>

<p>“Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh annoyinggggggggggggggggg!!”</p>

<p>From his body, purple flames flared up.</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;I’m not holding back anymore! My flames! The soul of the Demon King! Just the strongest! Bring me the greates Northern Demon(Tempest)!!”</p>

<p>A huge magic circle emerges on the floor of the church.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch out, Iris!&#8221;</p>

<p>He could feel enormous magic power and intense pressure from the bottom of the magic circle. Haruto trembled down his spine.</p>

<p>“The hell, what kind of monster did you call &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer to that question soon become clear.</p>
<p>Two large wings emerged from the magic circle.</p>
<p>And a long tail covered with red scales.</p>
<p>Its neck is as long and thick as its tail.</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Beyond that is the head of a giant reptile.</p>
<p>It has an exceptional hugeness, and presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; A Flame Dragon, is it&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto and Iris’ complexion changed.</p>
<p>The same is true for Elric himself, the one who summoned it. He looked up at the huge dragon that filled the church with a look of disbelief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha,haha &#8230; I never thought this kind of thing will come out &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew his smile, and shuddered.</p>
<p>That’s natural.</p>
<p>The Dragon race is a species that reigns at the top of the Northern demons (Tempest).</p>
<p>Its power is overwhelming. Not to mention humans, even other Northern Demons (Tempest) is no match for it.</p>
<p>The Flame Dragon is a member of that dragon race. It has a fire attribute, and its flames is different from Blaze’s magic.</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>It is also highly intelligent and has a high level of magic resistance.</p>
<p>It’s exactly invincible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like a natural disaster, and fighting that itself is reckless.</p>

<p>&#8220;As expected, summoned by the soul of the Demon King &#8230;&#8230; and the Reincarnation Wedding (necromance) with the two half bodies of the Demon King &#8230;&#8230; amazing, it’s amazing!”</p>

<p>Elric turned his smile at the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter how many hundreds of subjugation troops you have, they won’t matter with this! Ah, it’s lovely! Look! This is my power! It&#8217;s my power!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; throat gurgled as she looked up at the Flame dragon.</p>

<p>“Haruto-kun…… we have no choice but to withdraw——”</p>
<p>“——No”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Haruto carried his sword on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a monster like that goes on a rampage, Grandia will be annihilated.”</p>
<p>“But…… then, how about ——— Haruto-kun!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto circumvents the ice barrier created by Iris, and appears in front of the Flame Dragon.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a Flame Dragon, a fire-based dragon species! It’s too incompatible with Haruto-kun!! If so, then it’ll have to be me!!”</p>

<p>However, Haruto turned his palm to Iris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay where you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to go check my answers to the practice questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>


<p>Haruto approaches the Flame Dragon in a far too defenseless manner, while carrying his sword.</p>

<p>“Oy oy, are you sane? What do you think you&#8217;re going to do all by yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>“I told you, didn&#8217;t I?  I’m more than just an ordinary bump in the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>A cruel smile appears on Elric&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll make your limbs as food for it. As long as your torso is still intact, it should be fine.”</p>

<p>Haruto held his sword with one hand, and placed his other hand as a support on the sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;You made Iris cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red flames erupted from Haruto&#8217;s body.</p>

<p>“Even if my limbs got eaten, I won’t forgive only you!!”</p>

<p>Haruto slid his finger down the blade.</p>
<p>The air inside the church dramatically changes.</p>

<p>“——Spirit of flame, devil of blaze, I seek and appeal.”</p>

<p>A red magic circle opened under Haruto&#8217;s feet, and sparks began to fly throughout the church.</p>

<p>“——Combustion, raging fire, scorching heat, hell fire, turn tangible things into ashes, and intangible things into dust.”</p>

<p>At the Red magic sword—— Golden magic characters emerge on the blade of Phoenix.</p>
<p>Several magic circles unfolded not only beneath his feet, but also around Haruto.</p>
<p>Looking at his state, Elric laughs.</p>

<p>“Ah, are you going to use advanced magic? Do you really think you can defeat a dragon with that? You’re making me laugh.”</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>——Wrong.</em></p>
<p>A cold sweat flowed on Iris’ cheek.</p>
<p>It wasn’t at that level. The enormous amount of magic power flowing out of Haruto is something she has never felt before. And the magic circle that envelops around him as well.</p>
<p><em>Haruto-kun …&#8230; No way.</em></p>
<p>Elric spread out his arms and smiled in a welcoming way.</p>

<p>“Well then, give it a try! Go ahead, shoot! It was Meltdown, right? Right——”</p>
<p>“——Burning out hell, dust and end heaven&#8221;</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>His spell chanting didn’t stop.</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>Elric&#8217;s complexion changes.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t know such a spell.</p>
<p>He has never heard of it.</p>
<p><em>——No way.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;You &#8230;&#8230; that’s &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Impossible.</em></p>
<p><em>This guy——no way.</em></p>

<p>Flames swirl around Haruto.</p>
<p>The ferocious quantity of heat created a wind that rushed through the church.</p>
<p>From beneath the floor, a sound like the rumbling of earth echoes.</p>
<p>It sounded as if the gates of hell had opened.</p>
<p>The previously quiet Flame Dragon let out a roar.</p>
<p>Flames rise from its huge body as well.</p>
<p>It roared intimidatingly towards Haruto.</p>
<p>Elric stared at the Flame Dragon, and then at Haruto in disbelief.</p>
<p><em>A dragon, who is supposed to be an absolute being, is afraid of Haruto?</em></p>
<p><em>This guy—— no way, really, the ultimate——,</em></p>
<p>The air reverberates and makes a noise.</p>
<p>Haruto&#8217;s eyes glow red.</p>

<p>“——To the ultimate hell beyond&#8221;</p>

<p>Around Haruto, a magic circle which was glowing red further unfolds.</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-15914546' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-15914546' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p>A gigantic and elaborate three-dimensional magic circle, which no human being could have achieved, has been assembled.</p>
<p>An infinite amount of magic power, which couldn’t be produced by humans, has streamed in.</p>
<p>Then Haruto, greatly holds his sword, and,</p>

<p>&#8220;Ultima Zeno Inferno!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Flame.</p>
<p>It was a flame, and something more.</p>
<p>It was only for a moment.</p>
<p>The moment Haruto&#8217;s sword flashed, the Flame Dragon spewed fire.</p>
<p>Negating such fire, Haruto&#8217;s flame pierced the invincible dragon.</p>
<p>Without being able to counterattack, evade, or raise a voice, the Flame Dragon is swept away by the flames.</p>
<p>It was absurd that a dragon of fire, became a prey of his flames.</p>
<p>The flames, which defied all common sense, knocks the Flame Dragon out of the church with its pressure.</p>
<p>The resulting shockwave crumpled the church building in an instant, scattering debris in all directions.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>The flames that engulfed the Flame Dragon went straight ahead, vaporizing the water in the lake.</p>
<p>The moment the flames touched the water of the lake,</p>
<p>A large explosion occurred.</p>
<p>And a dazzling flash of light.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.io/Hvg6ZJh_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium" alt="" width="571" height="812" /></p>
<p>The extraordinary shockwave hollowed the lake, creating a tidal wave in the quiet lake.</p>
<p>The seemingly endless flames completely erased the Flame Dragon&#8217;s existence.</p>
<p>Huge explosive flames rose up as if piercing the heavens, and clouds of steam smoke were created.</p>
<p>It was a catastrophe unlike anything they&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>This is Blaze&#8217;s ultimate magic.</p>
<p>The end of hell, and beyond.</p>
<p>It was a very special kind of hellfire.</p>
<p>Its power is so tremendous, that even Elric, who stood near the Flame Dragon, wasn’t left unharmed.</p>
<p>The flames burned Elric&#8217;s body and even blew out the purple flames that surrounded his body.</p>
<p>However ——</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>Haruto went over to where Elric was standing, and he looked down at the disappearing magic circle of transition.</p>

<p>“He got away huh……”</p>

<p><em>But, with a magic circle of this size, he couldn&#8217;t have gone very far.</em></p>
<p>Haruto raises his face, and looks around.</p>
<p>The roof and also the walls of the church, had vanished like a lie, and it was hard to believe that there had been a church in this place earlier. There are barely any remnants of the mosaic pattern on the floor, and it only looks like an open space.</p>
<p>The place they’re at appears to be on the far end of Grandia, where a lake spreads out in front. Since the surrounding area was like a harbor, it was fortunate that there weren&#8217;t many building around.</p>
<p>However, if he turns around, he could see the streets of Grandia. Thinking like<em> I&#8217;m just glad that I didn&#8217;t shoot my ultimate magic in that direction</em>, Haruto sweated coldly at this late hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris is looking at Haruto, as her eyes were welling up with tears.</p>
<p>Haruto gave her a thumbs up.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was an easy win.&#8221;</p>
<p>“In what place!? You’re full of scratches!”</p>

<p>Indeed, he had taken quite a few attacks from Elric, so he was covered in blood.</p>
<p>Iris takes out a first aid kit from her pocket, and starts to treat Haruto&#8217;s wounds.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p>Since she would touch his body directly, a Northern Demon (Tempest) should appear again, but she decided that it was unavoidable.</p>
<p>While wrapping a bandage at Haruto&#8217;s arm,</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you&#8230;&#8230; Haruto-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to Haruto-kun, I feel like my worries have been blown away.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she knew that he was earnest when he said that, Iris leaked out a smile with a whiff.</p>
<p>After finishing the treatment, Iris continued to hold Haruto&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>They waited for a while, but the Northern Demons (Tempest) never appeared.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“……it isn’t coming”</p>
<p>“Ah…… it may be, but——”</p>

<p>When Haruto began to talk, Iris came to his face straightforwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I thought, Haruto-kun was thinking the same thing!? That purple flame, Elric said that it was the spirit of the Demon King —— he used to call it the flame of the 『Soul of the Demon King』. That means &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Demon King inside us is the half-body. In other words, it&#8217;s the 『body』.”</p>
<p>&#8220;If the 『Soul of the Demon King』 is really the spirit of the Demon King&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Extinguishing that purple flame, means extinguishing the Demon King&#8217;s 『soul』. The reason why the Reincarnation wedding(necromance) also no longer occurs, was it because of this?”</p>
<p>&#8220;So, if we could completely erase the soul of the Demon King, then!”</p>

<p>Hope overflowed in Iris&#8217; face.</p>

<p>“Haruto-kun!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p>Iris couldn&#8217;t contain herself and jumped on Haruto.</p>
<p>She put her hands on his body and brought her face to his chest. Haruto also put his hand on Iris&#8217; back and closely hugged her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if we can completely extinguish the flames of the 『Soul of the Demon King』, we&#8217;ll be able to——&#8221;</p>
<p>“We, can have sex!!” <em>(TN: Thirsty!)</em></p>
<p>“——Eh”</p>

<p>Time stood still.</p>
<p>Iris, replayed her statement inside her own mind. Her face turned red up to her ears.</p>
<p>She jumped back and moved away from Haruto.</p>

<p>&#8220;I,i,i,i,i,i,i,it&#8217;s different! Just now! Tha,that&#8217;s not what I meant!! I,i,it doesn&#8217;t mean that I want to do it in particular! Tha,that’s…… yes! It’s just a metaphor!”</p>
<p>“I,I get it. I understand, so calm down——&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O~~y! Haru~~to-sa~n! I~ris-s~an!!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Then, they heard a laid-back voice calling at them.</p>
<p>When they looked over, they saw Adelina and Clara crossing the bridge and coming towards them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The explosion some time ago &#8230;&#8230; Harurun!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wawah! You’re injured desu! Are you okay nodesu!?”</p>

<p>When the two came close to them, they both rounded their eyes at the bandaged Haruto.</p>

<p>“Ah…… I was hunting down the Northern demons(Tempest) who ran away. This injury is not a big deal”</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure!? Adelina-chan also has a state-of-the-art, ultra-luxurious medical set, you know!?”</p>

<p>Haruto stopped Adelina as she tried to pull a rather large box out of her pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me. More than that, what about the city?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Yup. It&#8217;s all taken care of alread~y! We were lu~cky that all the students were out on the town for their closing part~y!”</p>
<p>&#8220;It was also fortunate that we held a subjugation competition the other day nodesu. Everyone remained calm and defeated the Northern Demons(Tempest). nodesu”</p>
<p>“I see, that&#8217;s good to know. &#8230;&#8230;Nn?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sensing a presence behind him, Haruto turned around. A half-fish type Northern demon(Tempest) that was trying to get on land was there.</p>
<p>Haruto put on a suspicious look.</p>
<p><em>That’s? Reincarnation wedding (necromance) …… I thought it was OK to make out with Iris now?</em></p>
<p>While Haruto was worried about that,</p>

<p>“There was still here nodesu!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright! Let&#8217;s get rid of it! Claran!&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelina and Clara, slipped past Haruto and Iris, and went to fight off the half-fish.</p>
<p>Iris snuggles up to Haruto, who was making a difficult face.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Apparently, it&#8217;s okay to hold hands, but hugging still seems to be like a bad idea.”</p>

<p><em>&#8230;&#8230; I see, it was such a thing huh.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;But, I saw a way to advance forward.”</p>

<p>Looking up at Haruto, who replied so, Iris secretly held hands with him so that Adelina and Clara wouldn&#8217;t notice it.</p>
<p>Haruto also gently squeezed her hand back.</p>
<p><em>——Magic Association Prospero.</em></p>
<p><em>I’ll be sure to hunt you down, and defeat you.</em></p>
