<h2>Chapter 4 - Senpai's face is so warm, Senpai's eyelashes are slightly trembling.</h2>

<b>Part 1</b>
<p>It will be 9 pm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi took a deep breath. To cope with his condition, Asahi asked his mother to make a cup of vanilla tea and drink it. Just now, he threw a paper ball onto his Senpai's balcony. After that, he closed the window, but did not pull the curtain. Senpai's room curtains were tightly closed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi picked up the phone and opened the call log.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">He called out to Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This was Asahi's first time calling Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Senpai immediately connected the phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"&#8212;&#8212;Asahi-kun?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">A few days ago-when I received a call from Senpai on Monday, was Asahi's voice also the same? Senpai's voice was full of surprise and doubt, and she didn't know what was happening&#8212;her voice was mixed with warning. Asahi gave a suggestion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8220;Senpai, do you want to fight?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">As Asahi expected&#8212;Senpai made a surprised voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"......Eh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8220;I'm really embarrassed to call out to Senpai all of a sudden. But as Senpai did a few days ago, this call is only for today&#8230; I want to get rid of the special period of waiting to die soon. Can Senpai have a look at the balcony?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The curtain of Senpai's room was opened, and Senpai who was listening to the call with her cell phone appeared, her beautiful face was full of doubts. Asahi opened the window, and Senpai also opened the window. ...No one knows if Tsubasa is watching them tonight. The senpai glanced around the balcony, her gaze fixed on the paper ball.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi whispered by the window&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"That's it. Please read."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"Wait a minute. Let me turn my phone into video call mode"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Senpai switched her phone to video call mode and put it in the right position. Then she reached out and took the paper ball. She did not step out of the balcony, but opened it by the window. After reading the article written by Asahi, Senpai opened her eyes wide.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"...Asahi-kun, are you serious?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8220;Senpai doesn't want to be like this? If Senpai hates this, I'll think of another way. However, it was painful for me to wait for Tsubasa to let go. I also understand Tsubasa's thoughts, but one size fits all. Although I'm a little embarrassed about Tasogare-san, I&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"&#8212;Asahi-kun"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Senpai said jokingly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Across the night, across the window sill, Senpai whispered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"Asahi-kun wants to chat with me at the window as soon as possible"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"What about Senpai?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"Of course I want to see Asahi-kun's expression that belongs to me as soon as possible! If it's for this, I'm naturally willing to act in this drama. If Asahi-kun is also my accomplice, lying is no fun. ......Asahi-kun."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Senpai tilted her head slightly and looked straight at Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Due to staring for such a long time, Asahi, couldn't help but touch his cheek. His cheeks are not hot. He shouldn't be too confused. Senpai didn't sigh in satisfaction, nor did she tremble with joy. Senpai's mouth showed a slight smile, and said, "Could it be&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"Is there a reason why Asahi-kun is worried?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi didn't answer, but looked into the Senpai's eyes. ... Asahi thought: Where is it? &#8212;&#8212;But he had no way of knowing. The calm didn't leave Senpai's face. There should be no problem. Senpai smiled and picked up the cell phone that was set aside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"......I'm looking ahead. I already know this. I've memorized the points to pay attention to, so don't worry. I'm more worried about Asahi-kun's acting ability. ......But Asahi-kun will specifically call me, it's really full of enthusiasm. It's no longer raining, and Tsubasa might still be there&#8212;I'm still thinking: What should I do if Asahi-kun asks me to kiss him?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi knew that Senpai was saying this to embarrass him. Even though Asahi tried to stay calm, he couldn't do anything about it. The memory of kissing so vividly, just thinking about it, would start to excite him subconsciously. A faint red tinge appeared on Senpai's face, and she trembled. With excitement on her face, her eyes fell on the phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">She might want to check tomorrow's weather&#8212;while talking on video call, she operated the phone. Asahi counterattacked this time -</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"Senpai, I accidentally glanced at your phone's main interface earlier."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span>Eh!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Actually he didn't see. He just put down a set with words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">It's because he's already made up his mind&#8212;as long as there's a chance, so to speak.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8220;I can't see clearly, but I'm a little worried. Can Senpai turn the phone to my side?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8220;Hey, hey, this&#8230; shames me&#8230; can't do this&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"Why are you embarrassed?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"......No reason. It's a secret"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi thought of two things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The first point was that Asahi's words were beyond Senpai's expectations. Without psychological preparation, Senpai would be restless and defenseless. This is also taken for granted-Senpai isn't always so calm, there's a reason why she's so calm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Senpai would naturally lose that composure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The second point is Senpai's phone wallpaper.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">...Maybe what Aki said was true.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The wind was beautiful and clear, and there were no clouds in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Maybe it was because of the constant rain, which swept away the dust in the atmosphere, and the air was very fresh. It would be great if I could chat with Senpai by the window at night in this weather. The stars must be very beautiful-the bright moonlight will definitely make Senpai's hair even more beautiful. The moon will definitely send Senpai's smell and go with the sound of the two of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Therefore, Asahi wanted to solve all the problems today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">To make Tsubasa and Tasogare believe that Asahi and Senpai had nothing.</span></p><p style = "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">In the morning, Tsubasa's figure appeared in class. Asahi took the first English class, thinking about Tsubasa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This was how Senpai described her encounter with Tsubasa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;Don't look at me like this, I'm actually quite popular.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">No matter how you look at it, wherever you look at it, it must be popular - Asahi thought&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">so in his heart, listening to Senpai's words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;This isn't my self-proclaimed arrogance, in fact. When I was in middle school, it seemed to be more popular than it is now. However, rejecting the kindness of others is very uncomfortable, isn't it? To be honest, the reason why I publicly stated that I wouldn't hang out with anyone after I entered high school was because of this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This sounds like self-promotion and bragging&#8212;Asahi thought. At the same time, he also understood Senpai's feelings&#8212;but only because of his imagination and little experience. When the girl who gave Asahi a love letter in the past is hurt, Asahi hurts her too. This was not only because of Aki, but also because Asahi had no intention of responding to this love.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;Because Asahi rejected the other party's kindness for him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This kind of experience Senpai had so far was definitely way beyond Asahi's imagination. Beautiful like his Senpai, she must have been regarded as a shameless flower since she was resourceful and since she was born.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Maybe this has left a shadow on Senpai's childhood. So she put on the 'everyone's goddess' armor, and subconsciously began to drift away from love-until Asahi started chatting through the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;Therefore, I will often be calling and acknowledged by the other party. Tsubasa had seen it once&#8212;the other party was my classmate. For Tsubasa, who is in the first year of middle school, the other party is two years older than her, so I don't take it seriously. But that person made Tsubasa very angry. She kept saying: Is she planning to harm Senpai?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Did she want Senpai to do as she said?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Senpai had to find someone more suitable for her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Otherwise, Senpai will be hurt. I won't spare anyone who hurt Senpai. I will never let Senpai get hurt at all. Those who don't deserve to be Senpai confess to Senpai, whether now or anytime, only the kind-hearted Senpai will be hurt. Take back your confession. Let it remain in the longing stage&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;Looking back now, it was great to be able to criticize Tsubasa at that time. Whether it will hurt me or not, is not Tsubasa, but myself who decides whether I deserve it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Appropriate. It was Senpai who chose Asahi-she didn't choose anyone but Asahi. Now Asahi can almost be convinced that so-called love is something two people get after their lives are complicated and intertwined, and it's not as simple as people think. Because the person I like is not destined, the story will be up and down, full of drama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">- How was Senpai's answer back then?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;I was wrong on this too. In fact, I felt relieved that I didn't have to reject the other party myself. Tsubasa cried at that time. Cry and wipe away tears. Maybe it's because I wasn't angry and brought it up that this incident happened. Asahi, I'm sorry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi was called by the teacher and stood up, he glanced at Tsubasa who was hesitating to read English. Tsubasa is not very good at studies. Calculating her rank from behind would be faster-but not because she's not smart, but that she had less time to study.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Therefore, Tsubasa was able to make Asahi feel a strong desire in this class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">In order to get into the same high school as Senpai, Tsubasa must try everything she can to make time to study hard before the exam.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">...I only wish for Senpai, this is not love. But if that Senpai confessed to me, I might hang out with her&#8212;Asahi had heard Tsubasa say this half-jokingly to her classmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">However, there will be a gap of two academic years between the two. The two of them were able to attend the same high school for only one year, and Senpai had already reached the year of graduation. In the past few days, I don't know how many days they can come to school. In fact, it is much shorter than a year. Even so, Tsubasa studied hard and attended the same high school as her Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">She had only witnessed the scene where someone confessed to Senpai, and Senpai didn't respond to anyone else&#8212;but this made her panic and cry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">She could keep telling Senpai's strength in one breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">For example - solar energy is so beautiful because Senpai is in this world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi thought to himself&#8212;this was no different from falling in love.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Either you don't want to hurt Senpai, or you don't want to give Senpai to someone else.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Because Tsubasa stands in the way of others because of her love&#8212;even if he shares ideas with Tsubasa, Asahi won't worry about excluding her.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">To achieve this goal, Asahi and Senpai were scheduled to start an after-school drama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The location was chosen at a place where no one was left, and it was unnatural for Asahi to accidentally stop by&#8212;it was the library. After the library staff went home, there were very few people there. Asahi planned to ask Senpai to call Tsubasa and Tasogare to the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">As long as Himi Kanako, Noumachi Tsubasa, and Shimao Tasogare were gathered together, even if someone was there, there was no way to continue reading shamelessly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Although there may be some rumors.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">That was how Asahi and Senpai set it up on the line&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">...Senpai noticed Tsubasa's surveillance a few days ago. Although Senpai was very grateful that Tsubasa could care for her so much, she also felt that she had done too much. Keeping watch at night&#8212;Senpai was very worried about Tsubasa's body. At this time, Senpai met Asahi on the way to the bus stop. Senpai was worried about Tsubasa, so she asked if he found anything strange. Asahi's answer was hesitant, and Senpai realized what was going on, so she interrogated his carefully, and then asked about Tasogare. Only then did Senpai know that Tasogare had also helped Tsubasa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">After that, Senpai went to the two of them to explain &#8211; there was nothing between us, we were just living close to the hope of clearing the doubts of the two of them&#8230;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Except for "There's nothing between us", they shouldn't doubt anywhere else. No one knew how many times she had been monitored by Tsubasa since she was touched by Tsubasa in front of the library. However, just as Senpai had mentioned, Asahi could also sense that Tsubasa's suspicions were gradually diminishing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Tsubasa should have seen it a few times&#8212;Asahi and Senpai never had any conversation, and passed by in person.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">It's the same as Senpai said - let it go, when the time comes, Tsubasa will naturally let go. But Asahi wanted it to end soon. However, this was only a prerequisite, and what Asahi wanted to challenge was actually another matter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">To make Tsubasa and Tasogare truly relieved today, strong medicine was needed&#8212;especially Tsubasa. Senpai was worried about whether Asahi's acting skills would pass the test, but this was completely in vain. Asahi and Senpai will be acting today.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">However, Asahi didn't mean to make up stories just like that. He would pay attention to some of them, and at the same time tell the truth himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi didn't openly say that he liked Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">It was this point that made Asahi think of this idea.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi saw Tasogare while sweeping. Asahi was cleaning the corridor, and he saw Tasogare from the window that he was in the garden. Even if they were far apart, Asahi could recognize them. Tasogare had a neat appearance, was tall, and had a distinctive hairstyle&#8212;and, like his Senpai, there are always people around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">He plays with his male classmates while cleaning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Regarding Tasogare, Senpai said in a somewhat complicated tone&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span>I've never seen such a persistent person. No matter how many times I refuse, Shimao-kun will still come to confess to me - I thought of several reasons for this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi waited a moment, then asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">- Is there any reason other than liking Senpai?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span>Of course. The biggest reason is because he really likes me. I think another reason is that Shimao-kun is very confident. Besides that, I think it's also important to clearly convey that I like other people&#8212;but I think it's also to reduce my mental burden.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Senpai said maybe a little off topic, and continued to say&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span>Shimao-kun was very popular, so he knew: It hurts to refuse to face his kindness head-on. So he's going to make confession a routine, in a sense, I can easily turn him down. He is very gentle and I think he is a good person. Asahi said a few words to him, and he soon became good friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8230;&#8230;Indeed it is.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span>To be honest, I don't hate Shimao-kun. ...But he can't. What I felt in his was completely different from what I felt in Asahi. I'm half ashamed of Shimao-kun, and half helpless. You should ask me why, but I have no way of answering. Only Asahi would make me feel happy and my heart pounding.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">- I also think that Tasogare-san is very gentle and a good person. So, hiding from Tasogare-san... makes me feel guilty. I also thought about it: Maybe I should talk to Tasogare-san&#8212;the relationship between me and Senpai isn't limited to neighbors.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span>Think about it? Past time?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">- That is the past tense. ...This is because I realized that I don't have time to care about such things at all. For me, the most important thing is every day on the windowsill with Senpai&#8212;that's what shapes our present and future. So, I want it back as soon as possible. I want my time to overlap with Senpai's time - not to be disturbed by anyone. At least for now, I still don't want others to know. Because of that, I don't have time to care about my mistakes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">A smile appeared in the eyes, and the Senpai smiled and said &#8211;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span>Asahi really is a bad boy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">At this time, Asahi noticed that Tasogare in the playground suddenly raised his head and looked at the teaching building. He seemed to be looking at Asahi. His eyesight is also very good-Tasogare waved his hand gently. As if to console herself, Asahi smiled and lowered his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Even if he couldn't tell an outsider&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">except for Senpai, Asahi couldn't pretend to be doing anything else&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi would also lie big to Tasogare&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">...It is</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;I don't like Senpai, but I hate her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">In addition, he must paint the world of himself and his Senpai the same color.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Long homeroom time is over. Asahi pretended to be going home and observed Tsubasa's condition.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Tsubasa is still very popular, and she is surrounded by her friends at this time. They seem to be discussing where to go before heading home, but Tsubasa says she has something to do and refuses them. Tsubasa greeted her with a smile, and occasionally looked at the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The use of cell phones is prohibited in schools. Tsubasa didn't mention it, Asahi didn't think that Senpai would use a cell phone. Because of that, he didn't know if Senpai sent him a message, or if she said it directly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">No matter what, Tsubasa must have received an invitation from Senpai to meet. Asahi left the class before Tsubasa. He didn't know if Tsubasa was looking at him when he came out. Asahi walked to the toilet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">He walked into the cubicle, put on his pants, and sat on the toilet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">He intended to wait here until the time to meet his Senpai came.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi closed his eyes. To pass the time, he started a simulation exercise in his mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">...The time set by Senpai was five ten o'clock in the afternoon - by this time, the library staff had gone home. Tsubasa and Tasogare will be calling by Senpai, they will be so happy, they don't know what happened. They would definitely arrive earlier than the agreed time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Will it be earlier in the morning or earlier in the evening? Tsubasa is surrounded by girls who like to chat, and the nights when he usually plays with the boys should be faster. In the evening, the library doors had to be opened just after five o'clock. Library staff who have finished work may still be cleaning up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">At night, she likes to read books, although she is not as good as Asahi, she still goes to the library. Perhaps, she had a good relationship with the female library staff. The librarian looks young, but actually she is more than 40 years old, even though she already has children, for a woman like her, Tasogare should be very cute. She would say a few words with a smile, and Tasogare would respond with a smile. Tasogare really cared about time in his heart, he must have been thinking: What is the reason Senpai calling himself?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Was he expected to be calling to a place with few people? Or do you feel that something bad is about to happen, and your heart is very wary?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">At this moment, the library door opened again&#8212;it wasn't Senpai who entered, but Tsubasa. It's 5:08 p.m. now. Tsubasa was slightly out of breath&#8212;to meet Senpai, she would never be late. Even though the school rules stipulate that you are not allowed to run in the corridors, Tsubasa completely ignores this...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi opened his eyes. He took his cell phone out of his bag and checked the time. ...It's almost time to leave. In reality-Tsubasa and Tasogare almost left the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">He flushed the toilet, washed his hands, walked along the corridor, thinking again and again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">...Tasogare was happy to chat with the library staff, who accidentally stayed for a while, frowning calmly. Tsubasa is even more famous at school than Tasogare. Unlike Tasogare, the library staff hate Tsubasa very much&#8212;she's rebellious, cute and young, which makes her proud and self-satisfied. Many female teachers must hate her so much. The library staff finished talking to Tasogare, took the "CLOSE" sign, and walked out. Even if the sign is hung, the door isn't locked, meaning books are no longer borrowed, and access is still free.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Tsubasa didn't even look at the exiting staff. After seeing Tasogare, she immediately thought. Was this unintentional? Of course Tsubasa knew that Tasogare liked to read books. This was the first time in Tsubasa's life that she was calling by Senpai, and Tasogare, how could he appear at their meeting place&#8212;the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8220;I was calling by Senpai&#8221; &#8212;&#8212;Tsubasa's heart was thinking about speculations that were even more pessimistic than Tasogare's. Perhaps, the things she had monitored at Senpai's house and Asahi's house were revealed&#8211;she must have thought so in her heart. Wasn't Asahi, the one who made Senpai happy, a prisoner? To find out this character 'X', Tsubasa asks Tasogare to help her-after arriving at the library, that Tasogare happens to be here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Just as Tsubasa was about to find out the meaning of this, the protagonist appeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;Tsubasa, Shimao-kun, I've made you wait a long time. I'm really bothering you to make one more trip. I have something to say to you.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Senpai will definitely show a troubled expression, tilt her head, and her mouth will reveal an "Everyone's Goddess" smile. Tsubasa and Tasogare would definitely look back at Senpai with nervous looks. As Senpai entered the library, she said&#8211;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;I wanted to tell you about Amaharashi-kun. I also explained earlier, I think Tsubasa will be relieved after listening. But Tsubasa didn't want to accept it at all...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi walked to the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">It was the same as the scene he had simulated in his mind&#8212;the CLOSE sign had been hung in the middle of the door. A voice came from the library. Even though I can't hear what I'm talking about, it must be Senpai's voice, there's no doubt about that. ...had to wait a little longer. After Asahi made up his mind, he kept imagining what Senpai would say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">...Will Tsubasa deny it? Or will she lower her head without saying a word? After all the other party is Senpai. She must be guilty of spying on the secret. From these two points of view, Tsubasa should be the second situation. Even though she would lower her head, she would definitely clench her fists with both hands. In this way, Tasogare might speak for her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;Senpai doesn't want to ask me something? Wasn't Tsubasa's suspicion correct?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Not really. Nothing happened between Amaharashi-kun and me. The school's younger brother moved to the side, which actually made me feel very attractive, but it was nothing more. Rather, I want to know why Tsubasa suspects Amaharashi-kun, so much so that&#8230; Is it necessary to monitor Amaharashi-kun house and my house?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span>Monitoring their home? &#8212;&#8212;As Tasogare looked at Tsubasa in surprise. He only now understood why Senpai had specifically found a place to talk. Tsubasa will panic. When it comes to surveillance, "feeling exposed" and "clearly exposed" are fundamentally different. ...In other words, since it's been revealed, there's no need to be afraid anymore-s</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">he might be wrong. In Asahi's imagination, Tsubasa looked at Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;Then, what's with the ribbon? That "Aquavit" character ribbon! Didn't Senpai still like it a lot before? You put it on suddenly because it looks like Amaharashi-kun...!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Senpai had already prepared for this sentence, so he wouldn't hesitate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;Eh? Is this similar to Amaharashi-kun? Does Shimao-kun think so too?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8230;&#8230;That said, it really does look quite similar&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Is that true? I don't feel that way&#8230; and, Tsubasa, I want "Aquavit" just because I watched a movie recently. The film is very interesting. Is it so weird to have a favorite character?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Tsubasa didn't say a word. She couldn't argue. Because she had no proof&#8212;must be because Asahi's flower ornament that made Tsubasa suspect was no longer there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;In short, Tsubasa. I know you like me, you can like me too. But please don't bother irrelevant Amaharashi-kun. The same goes for Shimao-kun. I heard from Amaharashi-kun, Even though you're not very active, you have to persuade the girls at your school?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The most important thing is not to deny Tsubasa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">But to let Tsubasa be relieved.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">shouted Tsubasa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;That is the body of the Goddess...!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"&#8212;That's a body Goddess...!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The original Tsubasa and Imagination screamed at almost the same time, and the scream came out of the library. Asahi was surprised&#8212;it was a coincidence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">He took a deep breath and opened the library door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"...Said by the body of the Goddess! The body of the Goddess and my sixth sense say so! There is nothing suspicious about Senpai and that man, ...but I can't accept it! Chatting with him here is a fact! And, that flower, I happened to meet him buying flowers&#8212;&#8230;Amaharashi-kun!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">After Tsubasa noticed Asahi, she turned her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The situation in the library was almost exactly the same as Asahi's imagination. The only difference from imagination is gritted teeth, teardrops rolling in eye sockets. Asahi saw that after Tsubasa discovered that Asahi entered the library, she showed a redeemed expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">She clenched her fists and said&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"That is you!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi appeared here, making Tasogare show a thoughtful expression. Tasogare's appearance was also different from Asahi's imagination. There was a slight tension on Tasogare's face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">He had to try to make up for the lost points in the hearts of the Senpai. This was also natural&#8212;if there was something between Asahi and Senpai, as long as it could get in their way, even if Senpai was angry, Tsubasa wouldn't be afraid. But Tasogare is different. He said a more realistic reason&#8212;that is, he wanted to use this as an opportunity for Senpai to like him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Even if there was something between Asahi and Senpai, it didn't matter to Tasogare. Rather than letting Senpai be someone who doesn't like anyone, he wanted the possibility of bonding with Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">If you are not liked by Senpai, you will be completely powerless. As for Senpai, she tilted her head and said&#8212; &#8220;The Goddess' body&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This is also a common thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi could tell from Tasogare's expression&#8212;he didn't need to talk to him anymore. He was personally warned by Senpai that he would not act rashly again. His suspicion of Asahi at first wasn't as strong as Tsubasa's.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The problem actually lies with Tsubasa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Tsubasa moved the corners of his mouth and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"It's you, it's you...! What's wrong isn't the Goddess body or my sixth sense! Senpai, how do you explain it now! I thought it was strange at first. I always talk to Amaharashi-kun unconsciously. Regarding the topic of Senpai, it must be my instincts. who helped me&#8212;this person is dangerous! I don't understand how good you are, you will definitely hurt Senpai&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi interrupted Tsubasa--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">What are you talking about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Tsubasa looked a little cowardly for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">But the next second, the hostility flared again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"Why? You're going to pretend to be...!? You mean to say that as soon as we were talking about you, you came to the library by accident&#8230;!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8220;I came to the library by accident. You are here, it was me who was surprised. Don't you know that I like reading - no, Tsubasa doesn't seem to know. But Tasogare knows."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"Liar! Amaharashi-kun is a mollusk, you should stalk Senpai secretly! You're Senpai's neighbor, you should also look straight at Senpai's house! Disgusting! How dirty and cruel you used to make a good relationship with Senpai&#8212;&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Tsubasa spoke non-stop &#8212;the content made one want to say: You still have a face to say! Asahi turned to Tsubasa, facing the front, and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"I know what you want to say. The opportunity is right. Whenever Tsubasa talks to me about Senpai, I think - I'm really fed up. I don't care what Tsubasa thinks about me and Senpai, I'll take this opportunity to make it clear."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Senpai pricked up her ears. Looking at Asahi as Tasogare, waiting for his next word.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi said what he was thinking in his heart</span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"I really hate Senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This greatly surprised Tsubasa. Tasogare was surprised and called out Asahi's name. They didn't expect Asahi to say such a thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">On the contrary, it was an unprecedented thing for anyone who "hated" Senpai. Asahi continued&#8212;saying what he was thinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Tsubasa seemed to have said before that liking an alluring and gentle beauty like Senpai was natural. But back then, I already told you that this is completely wrong. Love isn't that simple. It wouldn't be for obvious reasons! I hate Senpai, but also for various reasons."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">...There is only one thing, which contradicts the facts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi's eyes were on Tsubasa, but his words were aimed at Senpai. Here, only Senpai understood what Asahi really meant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"I know Tsubasa is obsessed with Senpai's beautiful hair. I also understand why you are like this. I also think that Senpai's hair is very beautiful. It looks like pearls after being exposed to the light, but I hate&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Yesterday's Note was thrown onto Senpai's window sill at night&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">a very important note is written in bold above it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"Tasogare said that the reason why he was attracted to Senpai was simply because of his appearance. I don't think there is any need to be criticized by others. The so-called don't care about appearances, is just bullshit. Appearance is also part of Senpai's unique personality. Senpai is very beautiful. ...like Michelangelo Madonna, that's a fact. But it's because of my personal likes and dislikes, I hate Senpai's appearance. Especially her eyes in looking at other people."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Even if it was like now in this way, playing a "battle game" in front of Tsubasa and Tasogare&#8212;as long as there was this point of concern, Senpai would never be misunderstood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">There is a word. When it comes out of my mouth, please ask Senpai to automatically turn it in her heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">hate &#8594; like</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8220;I hate Senpai's face like a goddess. I hate Senpai's smile like an angel. I sometimes hate Senpai's voice like a child. I also hate Senpai's smell&#8212;after smelling her up close, the sweet smell even made people faint on the spot. I also hate Senpai's graceful posture being slightly taller than me&#8212;it makes her bulge back and forth, and I don't know where to look. I noticed my neighbor was staying at home. I really don't know what to say when facing a woman like Senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Here, Asahi breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">It's not enough, not enough, not enough at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"I hate her gentle character towards everyone, I hate her being called a saint, goddess, and not arrogant. I hate her for treating everyone equally even though she has many friends and is loved by all kinds of people. I hate her temperament that loves children and animals. I hate her smile when her eyes cross. I hate her who is serious, inflexible temper."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Asahi breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"I hate her both civilian and military, like the perfect superman. I hate the way she lifts her hair, I hate the way her head is tilted a little. I hate her attitude with&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">her&nbsp;</span>head held high and chest high, and I hate to see&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">her&nbsp;</span>give up a seat on the bus for parents and expectant mothers will be sitting soon, I hate her shy side facing the sunset. Not because of any of the points, but all of them are superimposed together, so I really hate Senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">When Asahi said all he could say&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Tsubasa's hostility and anger had disappeared. The expression in&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">her&nbsp;</span>eyes towards Asahi was full of surprise&#8212;perhaps it was anxiety, or perhaps it was guilt. Precisely because she provoked right and wrong, Senpai was said to be extremely "hateful"&#8212;this was the source of&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">her&nbsp;</span>guilt. In addition, unnecessary anxiety.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Hearing that Asahi said so much "hatred" in front of Senpai, they no longer had any questions about the relationship between Asahi and Senpai. In this way, Tsubasa monitors Senpai's house due to&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">her&nbsp;</span>own misunderstanding, which causes&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">her&nbsp;</span>hatred. Tsubasa looked back at Senpai trembling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"... Asahi-kun, it's our fault."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Tasogare apologized to Asahi. He showed a mixed expression and smiled bitterly. From time to time, he would look at his Senpai anxiously, in order to gain points, he would never be angry now&#8212;from this point on, he could tell a little about her personality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">"I really didn't expect Asahi-kun to hate Senpai so much. You should also hate me and Tsubasa for suspecting you. I'm really sorry. But no matter what, is this too much?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Senpai was expressionless and lowered her head. . .</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Without another word, she clenched&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">her&nbsp;</span>fists tightly and froze on the spot. Tasogare must have understood that Senpai's appearance meant that Senpai had been hit&#8212;no doubt. The same goes for Tsubasa&#8212;Tsubasa utters frantically: Senpai! Sorry Senpai! It was all because I was excited, Senpai&#8212;&#8212;. Even though Asahi lowered his head and said, &#8220;I'm sorry&#8221;, but he knew&#8212;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">But it's not.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The senpai was holding back&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">her&nbsp;</span>excitement,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">her&nbsp;</span>body shaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;I like Senpai, I really like him!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">She had to understand this. Because Asahi asked Senpai to turn hate into love&#8212;she knew Asahi meant this. Perhaps, Senpai didn't expect Asahi to say this directly - or she didn't expect that even so, it wasn't enough to express Asahi's heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">&#8212;&#8212;It wasn't because of any of them, but all of them were superimposed, which made me really like Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">In this way&#8212;although not reciprocal, but to challenge this, we have made preparations. I like you-Asahi explaining this to Senpai for the first time. At 9 o'clock tonight, no one will interfere with Asahi and Senpai's time by the window. Therefore, we should not be indifferent. Senpai is much more difficult than Tsubasa and Tasogare.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">She makes Asahi bloom all the time, she is a goddess that belongs only to Asahi.</span></p>
