<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; In The End, Everyone has a Smile on Their Face </h3>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, it’s summer vacation starting tomorrow, but you have to act like you’re a student of our school…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Closing ceremony.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I listened to the principal’s speech, I couldn’t get that scene out of my head for a while.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The day ended without me seeing Akari, who had gone home before me, and when I saw her in the living room this morning, she had left the house without calling out to me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Last week, Akari had always greeted me with a “Good Morning” whenever she saw me, and we had even gone to school together on occasion.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But today, it seems as if it was a lie… It’s as if we’re back to the old days again.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I think she’s doing it for the sake of Nanami… In the end, I was so worried about Akari that I couldn’t stop worrying about her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And before I knew it, the end of the school year ceremony and the last homeroom before summer vacation were over.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yusuke, let’s go to the club together.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was lying on my desk in a daze when Nanami called out to me. </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">So it’s time for the club…</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah, I guess so.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I replied with no effort, Nanami seemed to have noticed something.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm, did something happen this weekend?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">What happened this weekend?</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You went to the pool with Akari-chan this weekend, didn’t you? Did something happen there?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Nanami is very perceptive. That’s what I call a true childhood friend.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nope. Anyone would notice regardless of childhood friends. If you show your attitude in such an obvious way. Besides, you didn’t even come to school with her this morning.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Do you see through all of this?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Heh… I wanted to say something cool, like to face Nanami, but… I’m no good.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, let me know after the club. See you soon.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Eh?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I mean, we’re still dating, right? So I think it’s natural for us to discuss these things… Am I wrong?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, well… okay, I’ll tell you what happened.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah. Let’s go to the club first, shall we?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Now, how much should I tell Nanami?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Excuse me, can I have an ice coffee, please?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, I’ll have the same.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We stopped by our usual coffee shop and told the waitress our order.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This is the place where Nanami confessed her feelings for me last week…</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“So what exactly happened…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As the waitress walked away, Nanami quickly cut to the chase.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, where should I start?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">From there, I explained the whole thing in a bit of detail, adding some footnotes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As Nanami said, Akari was fond of me. However, I rejected her feelings. And this morning, we were back to our original relationship.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I kept quiet about Akari’s true nature and her plans, but I think I was able to tell her about the situation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When the coffee I had ordered was finished, I finally finished my story.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When Nanami heard my story, she said,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm, I see…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She mumbled and kept silent.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, even though it was something Nanami had expected, it was still a strong shock.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But in order to face Nanami, I have to tell her this for sure.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’d like to ask you something.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami, who had been pondering for a while, suddenly opened her mouth as if she had thought of something.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yusuke, you’re not going to answer Akari’s feelings, are you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“She’s… my sister.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“If that’s the case, why do you look in pain?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Eh?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was only when she pointed it out, I realized.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Did I have that expression on my face?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“So, in short…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami paused for a moment.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“In short?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, it’s nothing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I think her expression clouded for a moment, but when I looked at her again, she was as usual.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hey, why don’t we continue our conversation at my place? It’s almost time for the store to close, and I want to talk about the future.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nanami’s house?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, since none of my family is home today, you don’t have to worry about anything. Besides, my house is just around the corner, so you won’t have to worry about getting home late.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was a development I hadn’t expected, but Nanami was certainly right.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She wanted to talk to me about the future…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“All right, let’s continue at your house.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, excuse me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wonder how long it’s been since I’ve been in Nanami’s house.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Even though we were friends since childhood, it was still her house. I’m a little nervous.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Phew, don’t be so nervous. I told you no one would be here today.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Even so, you know…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, my whole family went to my grandmother’s house, so no one’s at home. I’m the only one left.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I see.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wonder if it was okay for me to come in without permission when no one in her family was home.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Anyway, since we can’t talk in the living room, let’s go to my room.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami’s room… It’s been a long time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Do you remember where my room is?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s a corner room on the second floor, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yup. I’m going to prepare some tea, so you can go ahead.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Okay, got it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I headed for her room, relying on my old memories.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I walked up the stairs, I felt nostalgic. To be honest, I don’t remember much about the past, but I guess my body somehow remembered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Let’s see, is it here?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I went upstairs and reached the farthest room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I put my hand on the doorknob and stepped into her room for the first time in years.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s dark… I should turn on the light.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I found a string hanging from the light and pulled it once to turn on the light.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was suddenly bright and for a moment I couldn’t see what was in front of me, but I soon got used to the light and could see around the room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Whoa?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">
</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Whoa!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">My thoughts came to a complete halt when I saw Nanami’s room before me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Yusuke, you saw.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I heard Nanami’s voice coming from the door.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Unlike the usual cheerful voice, her voice had a hint of coldness in it, which I didn’t know.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, I was so confused by the abnormality of this room that I didn’t have time to pay attention to Nanami.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nanami, um… this is…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The walls of her room were covered with my photos.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m sorry, I didn’t tell you until now, but… that’s how it is.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I turned in the direction of the voice. In front of the door, Nanami was looking at me with an expression on her face that I had never seen before.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Although she was smiling, I felt an unfathomable fear from her face. There was no anger or joy in her expression.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">In other words, it was null.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Although she was smiling deep down she wasn’t.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What… do you mean by… that?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I don’t know if it was her expressions that pressured me or if I was just cowering from the situation. This was not the way to address a woman with whom you are in a relationship.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What does Yusuke think of me?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What do you mean…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Not as a childhood friend, of course, but as a woman?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She asked me in a voice that chilled me to the bone.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, it doesn’t really matter.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I couldn’t answer her question well, Nanami opened her mouth first.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Because it doesn’t matter anymore if you like me or not.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She didn’t make any mention that I hadn’t responded to her yet and walked straight towards me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“W-wait…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t help but back away from her.&nbsp; I tried to say something to her, who was coming towards me, to calm her down, but she seemed to be unconcerned and approached me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… I should’ve done this from the beginning.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami showed me the black rectangular object she was holding in her right hand.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It may hurt a little, but you’ll have to be patient.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She pushed her right hand into my abdomen. While I was still confused about what was happening, I felt an intense pain in my stomach and all over my body.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">My whole body went numb and I started to wince. I couldn’t stand up, I couldn’t free my body.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You’re conscious. I thought stun guns were enough to knock you out.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was conscious, but I still felt pain and numbness all over my body, and I couldn’t get up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The word “Stun Gun” that came out of her mouth was enough of a keyword to make me understand this situation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“N-Nanami…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm, it would be better if you were unconscious, but… that’s fine.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I squeezed out my voice, but it didn’t reach Nanami.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Or it hasn’t arrived, or maybe it has, but it’s being ignored.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We’ve known each other for over a decade, but this is the first time I’ve seen her like this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m sorry Yusuke, I know it hurts. I didn’t want to be this rough with you either…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wondered if she was talking to me or just herself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nanami, why are you doing this…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Then Nanami turned around said,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Why? Isn’t it obvious?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Then, in a voice that I could hear even as I endured the pain.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“To make you mine.” She said.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… What does that mean?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The numbness continued as usual, and I could not free my body.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, after a while, I was able to calm down and was now able to reason with her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wasn’t sure that I could talk to Nanami as well as I used to, now that my fear was getting the better of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was not even sure if the woman in front of me was the Nanami Haruse I knew.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Do you like me, Yusuke?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami asked the same question as before.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t answer earlier, but now I can.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I like…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“But that’s as a childhood friend, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t answer well.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I indeed like Nanami. But when it came to the question of whether I liked her as a woman, I hadn’t yet found a clear answer to that question.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami had confessed her feelings to me before, and that had triggered my interest in her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I became aware of her as a woman, and I was sure that a new feeling was born in me, as I had only known her as a friend.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But I don’t know if I would call it love.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’m not lying when I say that I like her as a friend.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But when she asked me if I like her as a woman… I couldn’t say it outright.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m kind of aware of everything.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Everything…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m vaguely familiar with what’s going on in between you and Akari-chan.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Akari…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Before confessing my feelings to you, I told you, “I don’t know for sure, but I think Akari-chan likes you.” That was a lie.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As she said this, Nanami continued to talk about herself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“The first time I noticed this was when I walked into your room the other day.&nbsp; I was so surprised that there was a ‘surveillance camera’ on the bookshelf.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Surveillance camera? … Don’t tell me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“At first, I thought I was mistaken. But then I realized that it couldn’t be. Because this surveillance camera was the same as the one I was planning to install.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Seriously?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I knew right away who was setting up these surveillance cameras. The only person around you who could do such a thing is… Akari-chan, right? I had some doubts earlier, but at that point that I was right.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Yeah, it’s true that the only person around me who can do that is Akari.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“So, I was trying to keep her away from you. When I heard that you were trying to introduce her to someone, I was going to push her to that person so that you would be mine. That’s why I suggested that the three of us should go on a date. The reason why I made her buy the swimsuit, and the reason why I shook her when we were alone at the cafe, was all to keep her away from you, Yusuke.”</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“So, I was trying to keep her away from you.

The reason why I made her buy the swimsuit, and the reason why I shook her when we were alone at the cafe, was all to keep her away from you, Yusuke.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Were there such circumstances that led to the events of that day?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“But you see, there was one problem.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Problem?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It was Yamamoto-senpai. You know, at that time, when Akari was about to say something at the end, you suddenly approached her. I think you were trying to stop Akari from confessing that she liked you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Did she know?</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s when I realized that maybe Yusuke knew something about Akari-chan, and you did something like that at the right time, I wouldn’t mind noticing… I knew that Akari-chan had feelings for you, and you were trying to fix it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I really like you, Yusuke. No, I love you. I don’t want to give you to anyone, and I don’t want you to look at anyone except me… I won’t allow it, even if it’s your sister.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… You, Nanami, that day…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s why I confessed to you that day. I know how you felt about Akari-chan, and I thought now was the time to do it. Of course, I knew I wouldn’t get a good answer. But if we pretended to go out, at least you would think about me, right? I didn’t think that you would think about Akari-chan even after rejecting her feelings, but…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami knew everything,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She knew that Akari had feelings for me.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And that I knew about it. All of it.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I think she once told me that she wanted me to tell her, “Thanks to Akari-chan, I was able to go out with Yusuke.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That could have been a distant declaration of victory from… Nanami.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I can understand why you were so gloomy today. You may not be aware of it, but I do.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Why…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s because you’ve been unconsciously attracted to Akari-chan. That’s why you look in pain after rejecting her confession.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Eh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I know what she meant when she said that Akari is attracted to me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But for me to… Akari?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Maybe you don’t realize it yourself, but from a situational point of view, that’s all I can think of. Maybe being attracted to her is a little over the top, but… maybe you dumped Akari-chan to face me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I don’t know if “dumped” is really the right word, but what she says is correct.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m very happy about that feeling… But in the end, Yusuke couldn’t erase Akari’s existence from his mind. You’ve been thinking about it all day, and that’s why you looked so unhappy, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Indeed, it’s true.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Maybe, you’ll never get rid of those feelings. No matter how much you try to shake it off, Akari is your family. Even if you don’t want to, you’ll see her, and you’ll be related to her for the rest of your life. Don’t you think there is only one answer that can come out of facing me in that situation?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Then Nanami grabbed my shoulders as I was lying on my side and turned me over and sat on top of me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Wait… Nanami”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t move my body even if I tried to resist. It was not good, the stun gun was so powerful that I don’t feel like I can do anything at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">While on top of me, Nanami continued to speak while untying her hair.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“And then I thought. I don’t think I can go on in my current state. You probably don’t have time to think about me… But you know, I’m not the kind of person who can give up on you easily either.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She leaned forward and put her face close to mine.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It will be over soon. You’ll take responsibility, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She whispered in my ear, and her lips slowly moved closer to mine. Unable to resist, I simply followed her lead.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“We kissed, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami looks down at me with a satisfied look on her face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Apparently, she wasn’t joking, she was trying to establish a bond.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nanami, you can’t go any further.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I would like to have a beautiful marriage instead of this, but I don’t want to wait for that anymore… And I’m happy for you, Yusuke. Now you don’t have to worry about Akari-chan, okay? From now on, all you have to do is to look only at me, and I promise everything will be fine.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As she said that, she put her mouth over mine to kiss again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Mmh… hmm… nhm…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Unlike before, I felt as if Nanami was sucking me in. I couldn’t breathe well and my consciousness seemed to be fading away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The only thing I could feel was the soft, warm sensation that covered my …… lips.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“*<em class="calibre7">Slurp</em>*… Hah… Hey, does that feel good?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">While asking me this question, Nanami slowly moves her hand. I don’t have to answer that. I knew that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Was it because of the stun gun, or was my body subconsciously refusing to resist? I found myself gradually feeling less and less uncomfortable in the state of being treated and touched.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t find any words to say to Nanami, who was slowly unbuttoning her uniform in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was so confused that I felt like surrendering myself to her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What do you think of this, my body?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Her white skin and breasts, which were covered by her uniform, were exposed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">With a little more clarity and awareness, I saw her naked body.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She was beautiful.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I thought about that absentmindedly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">If it weren’t for this situation, I would want to tell her firmly. Her body had so much feminine charm.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Big breasts and puffy nipples.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was inexplicably exciting to see my childhood friend, who I had been with all my life, in a way I hadn’t known yet.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You wanna touch them?”</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hFzqfh4/235-1.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As she said this, she grabbed my hand and pulled it to her breast as if to guide me. I felt a soft touch from her skin, and my body reacted a little.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ahn…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">With a soft touch, I heard her squeal of pleasure.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Her moans echoed through the room, and I felt like I was about to run out of reason.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Mmm…<em class="calibre7"> slurp</em>… ahh, nhm…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">With my hand on her breast, she kissed me again and again. Her voice became more and more lustful as if various pleasures were surging through her at the same time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After doing this, she put her hands on my clothes and unbuttoned and removed the shirt that I was wearing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We were half-naked, exposing our upper bodies to each other.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When she finished removing my shirt, she slowly leaned into me, just like before. The only difference is that the feeling of direct contact is much more than before.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Feeling her bare skin, I suddenly realized what was about to happen. The lower half of my body, which was reacting more than ever, became even hotter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Let’s get started.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She whispered in my ear, and put her hand on my belt.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">*Pinpon*</span></em></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Let’s get started.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She whispered in my ear, and now I put her hand on my belt.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">*Pinpon*</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Just when she was about to move further, the doorbell from the front door rang.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When we heard that sound, Nanami, who was leaning over me, stood up silently.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She went through my bag and pulled out my smartphone. Looking at it, she muttered something, took a glance at me, put it back in the bag, adjusted her messy clothes, and walked to the front door.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… What just happened?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">My body was slowly regaining its senses, but I still couldn’t stand up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was left alone in the room, and a little while later, I heard someone running up the stairs.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“ONII-CHAN!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari, how…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After her, Nanami silently came inside.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari, who was standing close to me, shouted angrily at Nanami.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What were you doing?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This was the first time I had seen her in such a state of emotional turmoil.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What? You know everything…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami, on the other hand, seemed to be somewhat calm.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">No, it’s not that she was calm, it’s more like she couldn’t speak properly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yes, I heard everything! I’ve been listening to everything on my Onii-chan’s smartphone with a listening app! I can’t believe it!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Huh, an app?</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">With the sudden appearance of Akari, everything that has happened up to this point begins to spin around in my head, and I become more confused.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I need some time to calm down…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m glad I got here in time… If I had been a little late, Onii-chan would’ve been…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari, who was in emotional outbursts, and Nanami, who looked somewhat ashamed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The two of them were the complete opposite of how they usually behave, and they were facing each other like enemies.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“And this room…! This and that is all my Onii-chan’s…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Her anger won’t subside.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">In response to her, Nanami remained silent.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari was getting wound up in a one-sided situation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">No, I have to take care of this</span></i><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Akari, calm down. Let’s just settle down for now.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was still trying to wrap my head around the situation, but first I had to calm her down.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The two of them are now at odds over me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Onii-chan…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yusuke…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I had been silent until now, but now I called out to them, and they turned to me and closed their mouths.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Humph…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I got up. The effects of the stun gun Nanami had given me had finally worn off, and I was able to at least sit up.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Onii-Chan… are you okay now.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari approached me with worry.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I managed to… It’s okay. Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… I see, thank god.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari looked relieved at those words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">In the meantime, Nanami looked somewhat uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That was… Yusuke…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nanami, as you can see, I’m fine, so you don’t have to look so worried. For now, I want to sort out the situation, so let’s talk about it later.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There was so much I wanted to ask about this room, the stun gun, and… Nanami’s attitude earlier. There were so many things I wanted to ask her, but to find out all of this, I would have to reveal it from the beginning.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, it would be bad to put Nanami and Akari together now. It would be better to talk to each of them individually, slowly, and face to face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“First of all, let me talk to Nanami. I’m fine now, so please wait for me at home. We will talk when I get home.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“But…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“About yesterday and everything.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari hesitated at my suggestion, but when I told her about yesterday, she said in a small voice, “… Okay,” and left the room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I have to thank her later.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari walked away, and there was a moment of silence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Perhaps Nanami was thinking about what she did a while ago, and she seems to be having trouble deciding if she should cut to the chase first.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Because of me, Nanami did this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nanami…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I called, she reacted with a jolt.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m sorry Nanami. Because of me, things went so far, and I gave you such a hard time.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When she heard my words, she looked at me as if she couldn’t believe it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Why?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Why you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Why aren’t you blaming me? I tricked… you and even did this… Why are you apologizing?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She came close to me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">“The blame is all on me</span></i><span class="calibre9">.” That’s what she seems to be implying.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… True, it might be your fault for what happened earlier. But the reason why you did that was because of me. If I had been clearer, this would not have happened.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That was…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You told me, right? The reason you suggested pretending to go out with me was that you want me to look at you too. I don’t think there was anything wrong with that. It may sound strange coming from someone who was confessed to, but I understand your feelings, Nanami. What’s wrong is that I didn’t notice it. I was thinking of being open with you after the confession, but I couldn’t get Akari out of my mind until the end.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I believe Nanami was just in a hurry.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I never answered her confession and she didn’t mean to attack me like this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t blame her for this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m sorry…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">*Drips*. Nanami murmured.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t believe that the always cheerful Nanami could be this weak. As if I was looking at a different person.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I knew I shouldn’t have done that. I knew it was wrong. But when I thought that Yusuke was going to be taken by another girl… Akari, I can’t…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami let out a cry.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m sorry, too. I guess we’re even now.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I said this, Nanami came closer and hugged me but… </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">yeah, I’ll let her do what she wants for now.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You know Nanami. You are very important to me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When both of us had calmed down a bit, I tried to be honest with her about my feelings.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“We’ve been together since we were kids, and for me, Nanami is like… an inseparable part of my life.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I continued to speak with Nanami, who kept her head down.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“When you confessed, I was honestly happy. But I didn’t know if my feelings for you were as a childhood friend or a woman.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…hm”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“But… my half-hearted decision hurt you badly. So it is I who should apologize. I’m sorry, Nanami.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Even if what she did was wrong, it was all because of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“So, in answer to your confession, I’m sorry. I don’t think I can respond to your feelings right now. I like you, but in the end, I still don’t know if I like you as a childhood friend or as a woman. To respond to your feelings in such a way… I mean, I can’t.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I answered back to the confession she made back then.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I finally said what I wanted to say to her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Okay.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… When she heard my answer, she gave a small nod.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“But…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And then I told her the other thing I wanted to say,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I don’t want this to be the end of my relationship with you. You may think I’m saying this after rejecting your… confession. But you know, I can’t imagine my daily life without Nanami in it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami looked up with a surprised expression on her face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, I can’t keep pretending to go out with you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Are you sure? I’m not like you, I probably like you a hundred times more than you think.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… It’s fine. Guess we’ve to do something about this room and I’d like you to stop spying on me if you can.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I looked around the room again.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Yeah, these things are just too much.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’ll take care of that…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Really! Thank you…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wanted to get rid of all the photos as soon as possible, preferably right now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmmm… So, Nanami. About what I said earlier…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m sure I’ll never forget what happened today. But I don’t mind knowing that side of you. Well, I’m used to it… And I won’t hate you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… hm”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“If you’re okay, can we go back to normal?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… You really are strange, Yusuke.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She muttered, and finally, her usual smile returned.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Thus, the incident with Nanami was over for the time being.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After that, Nanami told me,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“If Yusuke will allow me to continue as before, I would love to ask him to do the same. I know it won’t change the way I feel about you, but it’s okay.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I nodded.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I might not be able to respond to her feelings, but it’s up to her to decide if she still likes me. I don’t think it’s right for me to say anything about it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Besides, Nanami seemed to be regretting her actions and promised that she would never do anything like that again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Then it was a good thing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m going to make a fair and honest approach to you so that you’ll fall for me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t respond to that, but…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">No, how should I…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well then…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I left Nanami’s house and came back to my house.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I walked up the stairs and stood in front of Akari’s room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I have a lot to say…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I have a lot more to tell Akari than Nanami.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What I’ve done, what I did yesterday, and what happened today.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I don’t know how she will react, anyway…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Akari…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I knock on the door.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I usually sneak into her room, but today, I’m going to do it with manners.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… It’s fine, come in.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">A few moments later, Akari opened the door for me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah, sorry to bother you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was a familiar room. The memory of reading her notes here almost every day for two years suddenly comes back to me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Following her instruction to sit down, I sat down on the cushion she had prepared. In the same way, she sat down in front of me across the desk. It was the first time we’ve faced each other head-on like this except at the dinner table.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Well, first things first.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“First of all, thank you. About earlier, if you hadn’t come, I probably wouldn’t be able to return.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Hm”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">If she had not come, Nanami and I would have crossed the line. If that had happened, our relationship can’t return to normal. And it would’ve made things tough for all of us.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, I noticed that from the app…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She took out her smartphone and showed me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“When did you install this app?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Friday night. Because the next day, you said you were going on a date, so I prepared it to follow you.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The next day was the day I went on a date with Nanami.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wondered how did she interrupt us at the most inopportune time, but I guess she was listening to the whole conversation…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, I also wanted to tell you everything. Cut to the chase.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I told her that, Akari shuddered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She knew that the main topic of the conversation was about yesterday.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“First of all, everything I said yesterday is true. When I was in the third year of junior high school, I went to your room to borrow some textbooks, and I happened to find that notebook.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Did you read it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah, I was hesitant to read it without permission… But when I saw “Onii-chan Note,” I couldn’t control my curiosity… And that’s how I found out about you. About the wiretapping, about the cameras, about everything.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… But I didn’t notice it at all. Onii-chan, you never showed any signs of it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“At first I thought it would be better to talk to mom and dad about it. But I couldn’t do it. I didn’t know how they would feel, and I thought I should just keep it to myself.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Is that so.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I thought that if we graduated without any problems and moved away from each other, your love for me would disappear. That’s what I used to believe… But then the other day, I found a notebook with your plans written in it, and I realized that if I didn’t do anything, I would be in big trouble.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Yes, if I hadn’t known about the plan, I would still be living the same life as before. I wouldn’t have pretended to go out with Nanami, and we wouldn’t have been chatting like this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You know Akari when you distanced yourself from me and was trying to show everyone that we didn’t get along. I decided to do the opposite and get closer to you. That way, your plans could’ve been failed.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I told her that, she said in a quiet voice,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Onii-chan, you were trying to stop my plan, right? If that’s the case, you’ve succeeded. I don’t want to go through with that plan anymore.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She said it…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I had a suspicion that my plan would fail, but it turns out that it was successful.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“At first, I was unsure. I was so happy that you were talking to me, and I had to ignore you because of my plan…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I knew that because it was written in her notes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I knew that she was confused and that she found the situation difficult.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“When I heard that Onii-chan had started dating Haruse-san, I thought I couldn’t go on like this. And before executing my plan, Onii-chan would be taken away from me. So I decided to start talking to you again.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… I see why your attitude changed all of a sudden. So you’re saying that you didn’t want to carry out the plan anymore?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, I won’t do that anymore.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Oh, thank God. I’ve been through so much today, but I think I’ve accomplished my original goal.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I was relieved, Akari continued,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I like you, Onii-chan. But I also know that it’s not normal. I know that siblings can never be together and that I shouldn’t have these feelings. But I still couldn’t give up on you. Because I like you because I love you. I couldn’t erase those feelings.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s why you made that plan?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Yes. I thought that if it was not normal, then the only way we could be together was unusual. The reason why I was writing notes, using cameras, and listening in was that I was having a hard time keeping you at a distance and I wanted to relieve my loneliness.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari had always known that the feelings she had were wrong.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But she still liked me more than anyone…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Thank you, Akari.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Why?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, I just wanted to thank you for loving me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I finally realized that I was genuinely happy about Akari’s affection.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I didn’t want to make everyone sad,” it was just an excuse. Maybe that’s why I overlooked her actions until today.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I love you too, Akari. As siblings, of course, but that feeling hasn’t changed since we were little… Well, I’d be more than happy if you won’t spy on me anymore. I’m kinda glad that you like me. Yup.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I was in junior high school, I was so sad because all of a sudden she stopped talking to me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But not anymore, I’m glad we’re back to normal.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t give up on her.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Maybe it was all because I cared about her so much.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Umm, Onii-chan…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You don’t hate me, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Why?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m your sister, so maybe you hate that I have these feelings for you because…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“&mdash;It’s not normal, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As if to interrupt her, I said the words I wanted to say the most today.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yesterday, you said the same thing, right? It’s not normal. But I can’t decide who you should like or not. Nor I’m asking you to hate it. Yesterday, you left without listening to me until the end, and I was wondering what to do, but I’m glad I told you now.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">At first, I was just confused.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I didn’t know how to face the fact that my sister had taken a liking to me. That’s all I could think about.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… You don’t mind if I continue to love you, Onii-chan?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yes, it’s okay. I will never hate you… However, if possible, I’d like you to refrain from spying or making strange plans in the future… Haha!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">You shouldn’t spy on people. Never.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’ll always love you, Onii-chan. Even if you never look back at me, I’ll love you forever.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s up to you, so I’m not going to say anything. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to live up to your wishes, and I hope that someday you’ll fall in love with someone other than me, but… yeah, I don’t mind if you stay that way for a while.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Whether it was Akari or Nanami. Maybe it would have been better to reject both of them outright.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I don’t know if I’ll be able to return their feelings, and I feel like I’ll just keep doing things half-heartedly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But I don’t think I made the wrong choice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Because. They both gave me such a beautiful smile.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“&mdash;Oh, by the way, Onii-chan…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I finished talking and was about to go back to my room, Akari stopped me in the hallway.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“How did you do things with Haruse-san?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“How far you say…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“A while ago. How far did you go before I arrived?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Oh, so that’s what… she was talking about.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I was wondering how I should respond, Akari gave me a huffy look and said,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Maybe you crossed the line…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No! No! That’s never happened! Just a kiss, yeah. It was just a kiss!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There was a little more to it than that, but I couldn’t answer… honestly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… I see, you kissed.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But I guess she didn’t like my answer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Her voice turned much colder, and she looked like when she intimidates her followers.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“But that was unavoidable…! And after that, Nanami apologized to me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I desperately tried to patch up my excuse…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Chuu~”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Suddenly, a soft touch pressed on my lips.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…!?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I came to my senses, her lips were right in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Wha&mdash; Wha&mdash; What?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“~~~~”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">While I was confused, she went back to her room, hiding her blushed face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I did nothing but stand there in a daze for almost fifteen minutes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The summer of my second year of high school.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I kissed my childhood friend and my little sister.</span></p>
