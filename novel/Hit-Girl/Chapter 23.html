<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; Gift For The Most Beautiful Girl</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>With the advice of Hiiragi-san from my part time job, I finally chose a gift for Saito. On the day of her birthday, I was sitting nervously, waiting for Saito to come.</p>
<p>Normally, I would stay at the library until closing time, and leave as soon as she left, but I’m not sure at what point would be a good time to give her the present.</p>
<p>After some time, she arrived. She glanced at me and our eyes met, but she quickly looked away and sat down on a chair.</p>
<p>It was her birthday, and yet she was reading as usual. She didn’t seem to be conscious of it and spent her time naturally.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but sigh, not knowing when to give the present to her.</p>
<p>However, momentum is important for this kind of thing, and there’s no point in hesitating. I clenched my fist and made up my mind to go and give the present to her.<br />
I looked away from the book I was reading.</p>
<p>She must’ve noticed my presence and the scraping sound of the presents in the paper bag as I walked towards her.</p>
<p>Her beautiful and clear eyes looked at me and then moved to the paper bag in my hand.</p>
<p>[Here, take it. It’s your birthday present]</p>
<p>After all, it’s nerve-wracking to give someone a gift, and a bit embarrassing to give it to the opposite sex, even if you’re not conscious of it.</p>
<p>I put the paper bag in front of her, though it was a blunt way to keep her silent.</p>
<p>[Well, Thank you&#8230; Did you find out from my student handbook by any chance?]</p>
<p>[Yeah, I happen to remember]</p>
<p>I thought she would be surprised if I suddenly handed it to her, but she seemed to have figured it out and didn’t seem surprised.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I was somewhat fidgety.</p>
<p>She seemed interested in the paper bag I gave her, and kept on glancing at it.</p>
<p>[&#8230;.. Can I open it?]</p>
<p>[Yeah, of course]</p>
<p>I nodded, and she slowly opened the paper bag.</p>
<p>Somehow, it was uncomfortable and nerve-wracking to have the gift I gave her opened in front of me.</p>
<p>The book I got her was exactly the one she wanted. It’s a new book, so it was easy to find in a bookstore, where it would be displayed.</p>
<p>I don’t know much about the book, but from what I’ve read on the internet, it’s well received. So I guess it’s fine.</p>
<p>[This is the one you wanted right?]</p>
<p>[Yes, it looks like it&#8230;. I look forward reading it]</p>
<p>When she saw the book, she smiled and received it happily. So I relaxed my shoulders.</p>
<p>I was relieved to see how happy she was, and patted my chest.</p>
<p>In addition to the book, I had put another item as Hiiragi-san suggested, but it was somewhat embarrassing to have it open in front of me, so I wanted her to notice it later.</p>
<p>But my hopes were betrayed, and she began to rummage further in the bag.</p>
<p>She seemed to have found the other present I put in there, and took out the small package.</p>
<p>I had it wrapped as a gift, so the package was a pink based sachet with white lines and a ribbon attached to it.</p>
<p>Watching her carefully open it made me feel more uneasy, and I had the urge to run away.</p>
<p>I’ve seen enough, I’m going home, I thought as she took out the content of the package.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. A bookmark?]</p>
<p>She blinked and stared at the bookmark in her hand.</p>
<p>The bookmark she held was made of metal and was covered with colorful glass that sparkled and shimmered.</p>
<p>Hiiragi-san advised me to get some accessories, but you would have to go out to buy them.</p>
<p>When I think about it, I realized it wasn’t something I would give to someone of the opposite sex who I’m not close to.</p>
<p>I consider her to be my friend, but I’m not sure if I’m close enough to give her ornamental accessories.</p>
<p>At first I wasn’t sure if I should only give her the book, but I still wanted to give her something pretty to make her happy.</p>
<p>I spent my time trying to find something, and I came across this.</p>
<p>I bought it in a store where only girls were inside, so while I was ordering the wrapping, people kept glancing at me, which was uncomfortable and embarrassing.</p>
<p>By the time I finished shopping, I felt twice the amount of tiredness compared to normal grocery shopping.</p>
<p>[I haven’t seen many people using bookmarks&#8230;]</p>
<p>I was so embarrassed that I muttered the reason why I bought a bookmark to no one in particular.</p>
<p>I’m not used to this kind of thing. When was the last time I had given a gift to the opposite sex? I don’t know if I’ve ever given one myself.</p>
<p>I was unsure about the gift I chose and asked her if she liked it or not.</p>
<p>Her eyes blinked in surprise and she froze, but her mouth relaxed after some time and her expression became gentle.</p>
<p>A gentle, soft, and warm smile appeared on her face.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. It’s so pretty. I’ll take good care of it]</p>
<p>She said in a calm, caring voice and clasped the bookmark in her hand to her chest.</p>
<p>It’s a gesture that signals protecting something important and precious.</p>
<p>Her eyes were fixated on the bookmark in her hand. The glass-colored light reflected on her eyes as she gazed at it with great care.</p>
<p>It made her look more charming, and I gulped unintentionally.</p>
<p>The usual cold, blank expression was gone and a gentle smile that was warmer than the smiles I’ve seen so far replaced it.</p>
<p>She looks much more mature and beautiful when she’s looking at the bookmark, more than that, her innocent and pure smile is adorable.</p>
<p>(Crap&#8230;)</p>
<p>If she showed such an expression, I can’t help but be conscious of her. I feel somewhat excited by the fact she only shows these expressions in front of me.</p>

<p>Her eyes were warm and she smiled so cutely that it could charm anyone. I was no exception, and I couldn’t help but stare at her.</p>
<p>I could feel heat building up in my face. When I touched my cheeks with my fingers, it’s obvious it was hotter than normal.</p>
<p>I couldn’t look at her any longer and quickly looked away.</p>
<p>It didn’t look like she noticed my strange behaviour, and she kept her eyes on the bookmark.</p>
<p>She seemed to enjoy the way light reflected off the bookmark and her smile loosened.</p>
<p>The way she squinted her eyes in delight as she looked at it is also adorable, and made me face even hotter.</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230; I’m relieved you like it. I was afraid you might deny it]</p>
<p>I managed to get those words out of my mouth as a way to calm myself down.</p>
<p>Considering her usual attitude, I thought she might refuse any gifts apart from books.</p>
<p>But in the end,she looks very happy to accept my present, so I’d call it a great success.</p>
<p>[I won’t do that. I’m afraid of strangers&#8230; so I’ll refuse it from them… but you’re a&#8230; special friend&#8230;]</p>
<p>[Yes]</p>
<p>Her cheeks were slightly flushed, and she muttered to herself while looking down.</p>
<p>She turned her head away from me, as if she was conscious of saying something embarrassing.</p>
<p>Even though I knew she didn’t say that as a means of someone of the opposite sex, but the word “special” made my heart race.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Thanks for that]</p>
<p>That was all I could say as I was stunned and my mind went blank.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>[&#8230; Thanks once again for letting me borrow your books.]</p>
<p>[No problem, here’s the next one]</p>
<p>I spoke to Saito at the library rather than at her house because I have a part time job today.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten used to Saito lending me her books because it feels like a book delivery nowadays.</p>
<p>Even though I was nervous because I gave her a birthday present yesterday, she acted as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>Looking unconcerned, she took a book out of her bag and handed it to me.</p>
<p>She had her usual expressionless face, and there was not a trace of the gentle smile she wore yesterday.</p>
<p>Of course, this is the normal Saito, but somehow the smile I saw yesterday seemed like a dream.</p>
<p>Well, I would be restless if I had to see the same expression over and over again, so I’ll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>I was relieved to see that she has the same attitude as usual.</p>
<p>As I looked at her again, I realized that she has excellent looks.</p>
<p>She has clear eyes, a well shaped nose, soft lips, and well groomed black hair that was so smooth that you could run your fingers through it seamlessly.</p>
<p>I can understand why so many boys like her, but my heart isn’t beating as fast as it was yesterday.</p>
<p>She surprised me yesterday. I won’t deny that she is normally pretty when I meet with her but my heart raced when she showed me her dazzling smile. It was at that time when I realized that she is, without a doubt, a beautiful girl..</p>
<p>As I exhaled softly, reminding myself that I held no romantic feelings towards her, I noticed something in the book she was reading.</p>
<p>A glittering bookmark could be seen between the open pages.</p>
<p>[What is it&#8230;?]</p>
<p>She noticed my gaze and asked me in a cold voice.</p>
<p>Her voice was cold as usual, but there was a sliver of softness slipped into her tone that somehow decreased the distance between us.</p>
<p>[No, I was just surprised that you’re actually using the bookmark]</p>
<p>I don’t think that she was lying when she said she would use it, but when she actually does it, I feel itchy.</p>
<p>I can see that she really likes the bookmark and what she said wasn’t just empty flattery And as a result, it made me warm inside.</p>
<p>[It’s fine right? It’s up to me to decide whether I use it or not]</p>
<p>[Yeah, use it however you like]</p>
<p>She replied in her usual cold way, but that was normal for her. I shrugged my shoulders and chuckled.</p>
<p>Her words are blunt as usual, but they seem to be less thorny.</p>
<p>Maybe she forgave me because I’m her friend.</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.. Just so you know, it’s mine now and I’m not giving it back even if you ask, okay?]</p>
<p>[I won’t say that]</p>
<p>She must’ve misunderstood me when I looked at the bookmark, because she quickly grabbed it and covered it.</p>
<p>She must’ve really liked it. The way she hid it from me was funny and made me laugh.</p>
