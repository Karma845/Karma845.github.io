The Most Beautiful Girl Wants To Read A Book Anywhere</h2>

<p>[Hey, do you ever read a book when you go home?]</p>
<p>I planned to return the book and say goodbye as usual, but since I saw a Saito-like figure yesterday reading a book on my way home, I decided to ask her about it.</p>
<p>[Yes, I do, what about it?]</p>
<p>Saito acted as if it was normal.</p>
<p>It seems what I saw was correct, and it was indeed Saito who I spotted yesterday.</p>

<p>Well, she is a conspicuous girl that anyone would notice, even if she is from a distance away.</p>

<p>[I knew it. I saw you yesterday, how could you go home like that?]</p>
<p>[I’m used to it. I’m reading because I don’t want to waste my free time. Why don’t you try it too?] (TN: Who in their right minds would walk and read with the potential of dying)</p>
<p>I’m aware that I am fond of books, but she took it to a whole other level.</p>

<p>I guess she spends her free time reading, just like I spend my sleep time reading.</p>

<p>In her case, she’s making the most of her time, because she is surrounded by a lot of girls in school, and since she’s smart, she would probably be studying at home.</p>

<p>[I’m not doing it, rather, aren’t you aware of the danger you’re in? You won’t know if you’ll get hit by a car]</p>
<p>The girl I saw yesterday was unsure of her footing, probably because she was distracted by her reading.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to bring up this topic, but seeing her like that makes me worried.</p>
<p>[I haven’t had any problems so far, don’t worry too much&#8230;]</p>
<p>Despite my concerns, Saito said that and ignored my comment.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>[She… She’s walking while reading again&#8230;]</p>
<p>After school, I was on my way home because school was closing, and I spotted Saito again.</p>

<p>Apparently, her house and my house are in the same direction.</p>
<p>I’ve seen her a fair amount of times before I got involved, and then the student handbook incident happened.</p>

<p>She was walking slowly, in a dangerous manner.</p>

<p>Maybe because she was so immersed in the book, she was walking slowly, and she even stopped at times.</p>
<p>She walked in an unstable way, and that made me nervous just by watching.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure if I should warn her or not, because unlike the library where there are few people, we are outside and we don’t know who is watching.</p>

<p>I couldn’t talk to her because of the situation, so I decided to follow her instead.</p>

<p>After watching for a while, I saw a truck coming from the other side.</p>
<p>(TN: Ah, s**t, here we go again)</p>

<p>I thought she would notice the noise as she walked forward, but she showed no signs of that.</p>

<p>[HEY!]</p>
<p>[Wha!?]</p>
<p>I rushed over to her and pulled her arm to the wall.</p>
<p>I slid myself between her and the truck to keep myself safe.</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. U-um]</p>
<p>Saito was pulled against the wall, with her eyes looking down apologetically, as if she understood everything.</p>

<p>[That’s why I told you to be careful]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. I’m sorry]</p>
<p>[Forget it, just be careful from now on. More than that, are you hurt?]</p>
<p>[No, I’m fine, thank you for saving me.]</p>
<p>I didn’t want to blame her anymore, so I decided to ask about her condition and she returned the courtesy.</p>

<p>I hadn’t noticed it earlier because the situation was dire, but I pulled her close and covered her body in a way that protects her, so it’s like a kabedon.</p>
<p>(TN: If you don’t know what a kabedon is, just google it. Although most of you might already know)</p>
<p>In such a position, the girl is looking up to you from a close distance, and once you realize that, you would become uncomfortable.</p>

<p>I’ve never had much luck with women, and this kind of distance is bad for my heart, but right now, I’m in such a position with a beautiful girl.</p>

<p>Even though there are no romantic feelings on either side, I don’t think it’ll be a good idea to stay like this.</p>
<p>She didn’t seem to notice just yet, so I gently put my hands on her shoulder and peeled her away before shame could reach my face.</p>

<p>[&#8230;. Stop doing that from now on, okay?]</p>
<p>[Yes&#8230; I’ll refrain from doing that from now]</p>
<p>Fortunately, she doesn’t seem to notice the position we were in.</p>

<p>She didn’t seem to be aware that we were sticking closely a few moments ago, and had a normal expression on her face.</p>
<p>As for me, I understand why a girl like Saito, who is liked by many men, would be upset, but I couldn’t help but smile when I saw her nonchalant attitude.</p>
<p>[T-that was close…]</p>
<p>It was probably because of the pseudo kabedon.</p>

<p>I didn’t notice the small mumbled voice and the fact that her ears, hidden by her long black hair, were slightly red.</p>
