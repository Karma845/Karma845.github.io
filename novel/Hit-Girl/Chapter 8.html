<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; The Most Beautiful Girl Became My Reading Friend</h3>

<p>[I’m giving it back. It was really interesting]</p>
<p>The next day after school, I visited the library with the book I borrowed.</p>

<p>In the end, the book was so interesting that I was captivated and I stayed up late reading.</p>

<p>I feel a bit sleepy now, but my eyes are still bright filled with excitement after finishing the book.</p>
<p>When I called out to Saito, she slowly looked up and stared at me.</p>
<p>Her eyes widened up in surprise.</p>
<p>[Hey, what happened? You have bags under your eyes you know?]</p>
<p>I haven’t checked in the mirror, but it seems I looked rather unhealthy.</p>

<p>She looked at me with a somewhat worried and melancholic  expression.</p>
<p>[Aah, about that, the book you lent me was very interesting that I ended up staying up late reading]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. I’m glad you enjoyed the book, however don’t forget to take care of yourself, okay?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Got it]</p>
<p>I knew I was doing something I shouldn’t do, but Saito’s worried face made me lose any will to argue, and just obey what she said.</p>

<p>[Oh, thank you for returning the book]</p>
<p>Saito bowed and thanked me when I returned her book.</p>
<p>[No, that’s my line. Well, thanks a lot, bye]</p>
<p>Truth be told, I wanted to talk more about my impression of the book, but she was reading her own book, and I thought she would be bored talking to me, so I quickly tried to leave.</p>
<p>[Oh, wait]</p>
<p>However, I was stopped by a little pinch on my sleeve.</p>
<p>[What’s wrong?]</p>
<p>[Actually, that book is part of a series, and there is a second volume. If you want, you could borrow it as well…]</p>
<p>She took out a book that’s similar to the one I borrowed before and gave it to me.</p>

<p>[I didn’t know it was part of a series. I’d like to borrow it but I can’t borrow too many times….]</p>
<p>Can you borrow someone else’s property for 2 days straight?</p>
<p>Besides, it would be a problem if someone saw the two of us. A mob character like me and the most beautiful girl in school are together. My life would be in danger. School life of course.</p>
<p>Of course, she might not care about me being a mob character, but I’m still a little bit hesitant about being involved.</p>

<p>[I’ve read it already, so rather than being covered in dust at my house, it’d be better if someone uses and reads it]</p>
<p>[&#8230; If that’s the case, I’ll gratefully borrow it then. If you treat me kindly like this, I might misunderstand what you’re doing you know?]</p>
<p>[Well, do you?]</p>
<p>[No, I don’t]</p>
<p>There’s no way I can misunderstand by the way she looks at me coldly, as if she’s saying ‘what are you on about?’</p>

<p>In the first place, I can’t imagine the most beautiful girl in school giving a favor towards me who had nothing to offer and was not attractive .</p>
<p>It often happens in novels that the main character, who is a reticent person, starts to get involved with a girl who is on top of the caste, and starts dating her. However such development can’t happen in reality. (TN: number 1, don’t remind us, number 2, how the tables have turned) (PFN: Shut up ;-;)</p>
<p>Her view of me might be, at best, someone who also likes reading just like her. Maybe I’m also someone she knows.</p>
<p>[Then it’s fine. By the way, I also have that series for quite some time now, so I’ll lend you more when you finish reading]</p>
<p>[Yes, thank you]</p>
<p>She continues reading the book as if her business was finished, so I left her and went to my part time job.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>After finishing my part time job, I quickly began to read the book I borrowed.</p>
<p>[As always, it’s interesting]</p>
<p>The first volume was already intriguing, but it seems that volume 2 was even more interesting, and I couldn’t stop reading.</p>

<p>I didn’t sleep too well today either.</p>
