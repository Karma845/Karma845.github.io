<h3>Chapter 17 &#8211; For The Most Beautiful Girl In School, I am&#8230;</h3>

<p>[Thank you for your help yesterday. You were a great help]</p>
<p>When I handed back a book to Saito, who was waiting for me in the library, she bowed her head and thanked me.</p>
<p>[Yeah, how are you doing now?]</p>
<p>[Thanks to you, I’ve recovered enough to go about my daily life. However, I’m not at full strength yet]</p>
<p>[Well, good to know]</p>
<p>Her complexion is much better than yesterday, so it seems that she recovered to a certain extent. However, her voice was a little rough, so she’s not completely recovered as she said.</p>
<p>[Yes, and here’s the book]</p>
<p>Then she hands me another book of my favorite series.</p>
<p>This series is really interesting. No matter how much I read, unexpected stories keep popping up, and so many layers of foreshadowing.</p>
<p>I can’t stop reading these types of stories. As a result, my reading speed has recently improved, and it now takes me less than a day to read a book.</p>
<p>Maybe the reason why I’ve been feeling unsatisfied lately was related to the lack of books I was able to read..</p>
<p>[Thanks…… One book a day these days are a quick read]</p>
<p>I had no intentions telling this to her..</p>
<p>However, I said that out loud as if I was complaining, and Saito seemed to have heard me mutter.</p>
<p>[Do you want me to bring 2 books instead?]</p>
<p>Hearing my words, she furrows her brow slightly.</p>
<p>[I’m not going to make you do something like that. I’m grateful for what you have done for me up until now. I’d die of guilt if I had you bring me more heavy things everyday]</p>
<p>I lowered my shoulders and denied what she said after she reached a strange conclusion, but she still crossed her arms and thought about it.</p>
<p>She lowered her gaze and seemed to be troubled.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Then, do you want to come to my house?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. What?]</p>
<p>She was thinking for some time and finally opened her mouth, only to say something outrageous.</p>
<p>I couldn’t comprehend the situation for a moment, and let out a dumbfounded voice.</p>
<p>In response to my overflowing soliloquy, I was surprised by her unexpected suggestion.</p>
<p>[If you can come to my house, I can give you a couple books]</p>
<p>[No, that’s&#8230;]</p>
<p>I appreciate her suggestion. I really do appreciate it&#8230;</p>
<p>But would you normally go home with a guy you’ve barely gotten to know?</p>
<p>Even though she lends me multiple books, I am still the opposite sex and she only has known me for a short time. Wouldn’t she feel uncomfortable?</p>
<p>Besides, if I go home with her, rumors will start sooner or later. No matter how hard you try, it will be suspicious. .</p>
<p>Then someone will surely notice and use that as a rumor.</p>
<p>As I don’t want to stand out, I couldn’t possibly choose to go home with her.</p>
<p>[Are you sure? You’ll be able to read more books than before, you know?]</p>
<p>Saito said that as if she’s a little devil persuading someone, making me lose my will to disagree.</p>
<p>She may be saying this as a form of kindness, but please don’t lead me astray.</p>
<p>I know I shouldn’t, but when she said that, I felt like nodding.</p>
<p>[No… even that is&#8230;]</p>
<p>[Well, let’s do this instead. You don’t have to go home with me, just follow me from behind]</p>
<p>Perhaps sensing my reluctance, she made a suggestion that solved my concerns.<br />
If she says so, I can’t refuse.</p>
<p>I wanted to read a lot of books if I could, and I had no choice but to nod when she made such an attractive proposal.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. because I asked for it]</p>
<p>[Yes, it’s fine]</p>
<p>[Don’t sue me for stalking just because I’m following you]</p>
<p>[I won’t do that]</p>
<p>I cowered my shoulders and made a joke, and she gave me a look that said “What are you talking about”</p>
<p>[But are you sure? Do you want this guy to know where you live? What if he does something dangerous to you?]</p>
<p>[If you do, I’ll just take proper action]</p>
<p>[Oh, I see]</p>
<p>If she narrowed her eyes and stared at me sharply, there was no way I could do such a thing. No, I never intended to do it in the first place.</p>
<p>[Besides, you wouldn’t do that kind of thing]</p>
<p>[So you trust me? Thanks for that]</p>

<p>[I have some trust in you, but anyways, you’re not even interested in me, are you? That’s the main reason]</p>
<p>[Ah, there you go]</p>
<p>I think it’s not surprising that she knows, but when she said it to my face, I can’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>[If you had tried to get close to me after you helped me, I would have wanted nothing to do with you.]</p>
<p>[I’m glad you think I’m a trustworthy person]</p>
<p>[Yes, your welcome]</p>
<p>This is how I obtained the right to read a lot of books, and go home with the most beautiful girl in school.</p>
