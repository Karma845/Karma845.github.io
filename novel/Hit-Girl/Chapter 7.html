<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; I Borrowed A Book From The Most Beautiful Girl in School</h3>

<p>I did not have to work at my part time job for the first time in a while, so I decided to read a book in the library when Saito came as well.</p>

<p>I already noticed the sound of the door opening, however I thought I didn’t need to pay any attention to it.</p>
<p>I didn’t think the other side would strike a conversation, so I was stunned and froze .</p>
<p>[Ah, the title, do you know what it’s called?]</p>
<p>I lifted the book in my hand, so she could see the title.</p>
<p>[Yeah, well…]</p>
<p>This was unexpected. The book itself isn’t famous, so you would have to be a fan of the author, or like suspense stories to know about it.</p>

<p>If she knows about this, she must be quite a book lover.</p>
<p>[It’s interesting isn’t it? When I first read it, I was so immersed that I finished it in one go]</p>
<p>Apparently, this book was her favorite. I guess she came to talk to me because I was reading it.</p>
<p>Saito’s face was expressionless as she spoke eloquently, but her eyes shone brightly, and I could feel her joy was being expressed.</p>
<p>[This book, do you like it?]</p>
<p>[Ah….]</p>
<p>Saito’s cheeks flushed slightly after I asked her. It seems she realized that she was unconsciously enthusiastic.</p>

<p>She cleared her throat and got her composure back.</p>
<p>Her cheeks were still slightly red. It looks like she hasn&#8217;t changed much.</p>
<p>[I like it. Is it bad?]</p>
<p>I feel like I was implicitly told to not enter her zone any further when she said that.</p>
<p>[Not at all. I like reading as well]</p>
<p>As expected, I couldn&#8217;t afford to ruin her mood any more, so I kept quiet and continued to read the book I was holding.</p>

<p>[If you enjoy reading that kind of book, I recommend reading this one. The system is similar, so if you like that book, you would like this one as well]</p>
<p>[Eh, there’s a book like that?! I’m curious. I wonder if they have that here…]</p>
<p>The book I’m reading right now is very interesting, and I am addicted to it for now. If I hear that a similar book is available, of course I’ll be interested.</p>

<p>It was then I wondered if I should stand up and look for the book.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. I can lend it to you if you want. I have it with me right now]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>I froze when I heard her suggestion.</p>

<p>[&#8230; If you don’t want it, it’s also okay]</p>
<p>[Eh? No, I’ll borrow it! By all means, if you have it, lend it to me]</p>
<p>I was surprised that I ended up frozen and silent, and she took it as a declination. So I made it up quickly by saying I do want to read it</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Yes, here it is]</p>
<p>[Thank you]</p>
<p>She searched her bag and pulled out the book, which I took quickly.</p>
<p>At first glance, it certainly looks similar to the book I was reading.</p>
<p>I never thought I’d ended up borrowing a book from someone like Saito.</p>

<p>As I was staring at the book and thinking it was a coincidence, I was approached by a voice.</p>
<p>[Is something wrong?]</p>
<p>[Ah, no, I just think it’s a rare experience to borrow a book from the most beautiful girl in school]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Please don’t say that]</p>
<p>When I mentioned she was the most beautiful girl, she showed clear signs that she was blushing.</p>
<p>She’s embarrassed about being called beautiful. If I were in her position, I’d feel embarrassed as well, so it&#8217;s natural.</p>
<p>Saito’s flushed cheeks and slight teary eyes that’s different from the usual cold and no openings, made me want to tease her a bit</p>

<p>Well, she doesn’t seem to like it, so I won’t tease her.</p>

<p>[I’m really sorry I said that, I won’t say it again. Thank you for letting me borrow the book, I’ll return it when I’m done reading.]</p>
<p>[Yes, don’t worry about the deadline, just read it slowly]</p>
<p>After exchanging a few words, there was nothing more to talk about, so we split up and went to read in our own seats.</p>
<p>I went home, and immediately read the book I borrowed.</p>
<p>[Whoa! This is really interesting!]</p>
<p>As Saito said earlier, the contents are similar to the book I read earlier and it fits my taste.</p>

<p>I couldn’t stop reading the story and kept on flipping pages.</p>
<p>I thanked her in my heart for letting me borrow this book and continued reading.</p>
