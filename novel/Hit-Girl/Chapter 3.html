<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; The Girl at My Part Time Job Is Actually A Good Person</h3>

p>The night of the day I gave the beautiful girl her student handbook, I was working part time as usual.</p>
<p>Since I’ve started working, I’ve been instructed many times, but the impression I had of Hiiragi-san who was somewhat unsociable and cold remains unchanged.</p>
<p>However, whenever she teaches me, she is kind and polite. Also, if I ask her about something that I don’t understand, she’ll tell me without getting angry. So I guess she’s a kind person at heart.</p>
<p>She’d help me out whenever I was in trouble, and for some reason, I had a good feeling about her</p>
<p>[Hiiragi-san!]</p>
<p>[What’s the matter?]</p>
<p>[Thank you again for your help today]</p>
<p>[&#8230;.Did I do something?]</p>
<p>When I finished my part time job and thanked Hiiragi-san, she looked as if she had no idea what I was talking about, and tilted her head curiously.</p>
<p>I guess it wasn’t a big deal for her.</p>
<p>I was a little fascinated by her ability to be gentle so naturally that she didn’t even realize she was gentle.</p>
<p>[When I was having trouble dealing with a client who came in today, you took over and handled it for me]</p>
<p>[&#8230;.Ah, that certainly did happen. Don’t worry about it. It’s my job]</p>
<p>Hiiragi-san seemed to be satisfied with my answers. It seems to be a trivial matter for her, so only a curt reply came back to me</p>
<p>[I can’t just not care about it! Do you have any problems right now? Maybe I can help if you want]</p>
<p>It’s not just this time. I’ve been helped and saved multiple times when I was still new and unfamiliar. I couldn’t afford not to give something back to her after she had taken such good care of me</p>
<p>Having said that, I did not expect my suggestion to be accepted.</p>
<p>Hiiragi-san would probably decline my suggestion, however I want to make sure that she knows I am grateful to her.</p>
<p>When she refused, I thought I would buy some sweets from a famous store and give it to her, but I received an unexpected reply.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Well then, can you help me with one thing?]</p>
