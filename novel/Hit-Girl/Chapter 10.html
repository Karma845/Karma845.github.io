<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; The Most Beautiful Girl Isn’t Good At Relying On</h3>

<p>[Thank you for lending it to me. As always, it was interesting]</p>
<p>As I thanked Saito and gave her the book, she looked at me and let out a small sigh.</p>
<p>[I know you’re enjoying it, but I’ve told you many times, please get a reasonable amount of sleep. I don’t remember giving you a 1 day deadline, and it’s not like the book will run away on its own]</p>
<p>I noticed that I have dark circles around my eyes due to my lack of sleep, but it seems like it’s really showing on my face.</p>
<p>I was told with a face half concerned and half annoyed.</p>
<p>[Yes yes, I get it]</p>
<p>[Haah… I won’t lend you books anymore if you don’t sleep properly, okay?]</p>
<p>When I tried to ignore her, I was threatened with a slight frown on her face.</p>

<p>If I can’t read the book, it’ll make me think more about it, and it’s going to make it harder to sleep.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to give in when she threatened me like that.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. I understand. I’ll sleep properly from now on]</p>
<p>[Yes, now that’s good]</p>
<p>Saito nodded in satisfaction whilst I dropped my shoulder.</p>

<p>Then as usual, I left her and start reading</p>
<p>I had been reading for a while, but since I finished the book I brought, I decided to look around for something else.</p>
<p>[Ah]</p>
<p>As I looked around the library, I spotted Saito.</p>
<p>Saito hadn’t noticed me yet, and she is still trying to reach a book on the top of a shelf. But since she’s shorter than the average height, I don’t think she would be able to reach it.</p>
<p>Instead of standing on one foot, trembling while trying to reach it, why can’t you ask someone to help…</p>

<p>I bet some guys would immediately say okay if she said a few words.</p>

<p>The reason she doesn’t do that is because she’s avoiding them. Well, with their gazes, why wouldn’t she?</p>
<p>I’d like to avoid her, if possible.</p>

<p>She almost got it, but still couldn’t reach it, and she only managed to get one finger to the book and fail and repeat.</p>
<p>(Guess I have no choice)</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll be able to read a book properly if I let her try and fail all the time.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to get involved with her unnecessarily, but I can’t just leave her when she is in trouble.</p>

<p>Also, I hadn’t been able to repay her for lending her books so many times, so I would be a fool if I don’t help her.</p>

<p>I walked over to her, and took the book she was looking for.</p>

<p>When I looked at her and gave her the book, she blinked her eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>She looked at me as if she was impressed.</p>
<p>[&#8230; I didn’t take it with the intention of stealing it from you]</p>
<p>[I know, I know. …. I could’ve gotten it without your help anyways]</p>
<p>She told me that in a cold voice, but I know she was just pretending to be strong.</p>
<p>[It would be more adorable if you indulge me in a time like this you know?]</p>
<p>[You’re saying as if I’m not pretty enough?]</p>
<p>[Of course you’re pretty. However, your cold attitude usually pushes people away]</p>
<p>When I told her that, her mouth was shut and she turned silent.</p>

<p>Her usual cold and sharp tongued attitude towards men is enough to start rumors.</p>

<p>She usually ignores them. But if they are persistent, she’ll definitely say something to drive them away. There used to be a lot of guys around her, but after 6 months of her cold attitude, there were almost none left that tried to talk to her anymore.</p>
<p>It would be more endearing if someone spoiled her even for a bit, but she never relies on anyone. She’s doing everything on her own. She has that kind of ability.</p>
<p>Even so, if she had someone who she could trust a little, she might be even cuter, but she doesn’t seem to have anyone of the sort.</p>

<p>Well, even if she’s like this, she has her own charm, and I’m fine with that.</p>
<p>Using Saito’s silence as a chance, I pushed the book I took to her and walked away.</p>

<p>I felt a hint of panic behind me, but I ignored it and continued to walk away.</p>
<p>I’ve already finished what I came to do, and if someone sees us together, we’re both in trouble.</p>
<p>The both of us were originally two worlds apart that we don’t get involved unless it’s urgent, so after finishing what you did, it’s only right to leave ASAP.</p>

<p>I heard a small [&#8230;&#8230; Thank you] behind me as I walked away.</p>
