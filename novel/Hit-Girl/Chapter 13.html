<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; I Can’t Thank The Most Beautiful Girl Enough
</h3>

<p>Since the day we went home together, I felt like the wall between me and Saito has thinned by a little bit, but that doesn’t mean we’re getting closer.</p>
<p>We have no relationships outside of the library, and even when we’re there, we only make small talks.</p>

<p>The other day, she told me to get some sleep. Her words were harsh, but I realized she is a girl who takes good care of herself and cares about others.</p>
<p>She nailed it down and threatened me, so I slept well and soundly just like before.</p>
<p>[Yes, I understand. Okay, I’ll be on my way]</p>
<p>Today, as I was heading to the library to return a book, I got a phone call.</p>

<p>It seems one of the part timers had to be absent, and they wanted me to fill in for them.</p>

<p>I didn’t have anything to do other than returning the book, so I agreed.</p>
<p>They asked me to come as soon as possible, so I tried to hurry to the library and finish my business.</p>
<p>[Thanks for the book]</p>
<p>[You’re welcome. Anyway, why are you in a hurry?]</p>
<p>She must’ve seen me rushing into the library and asked in a slightly surprised voice.</p>
<p>[Yeah, I’ve got a few errands to do&#8230; ]</p>
<p>I have to keep my part time job a secret, so I’ll cover it up for now.</p>
<p>[Oh, I see]</p>
<p>She doesn’t pursue my words any further, and hands me a new book as always.</p>

<p>I accepted it gratefully and exhaled slightly as she handed it to me.</p>

<p>[&#8230;.. I really appreciate it that you always lend me a book every time, but I’ve never had the chance to tell you that. Sorry]</p>
<p>[I’m not asking you to thank me for anything…]</p>
<p>[Is that okay? I can at least kneel down you know?]</p>
<p>[No thanks, please don’t do that]</p>
<p>I chuckled as she looked at me as if I’m an idiot.</p>

<p>The subtle mix of seriousness is probably because I couldn’t make her open herself more.</p>
<p>She made me come across such interesting books, and I felt bad to keep on doing this day to day. So I wanted to show my gratitude, even if it’s a little bit.</p>

<p>I would like to give her something in the future.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Can I ask you a question?]</p>
<p>[What is it?]</p>
<p>When I asked her that, she tilted her head.</p>
<p>[What’s the benefit of lending me a book?]</p>
<p>As of now, we have a relationship where it is normal for us to talk, but back then, we had almost never met each other.</p>

<p>Normally, I wouldn’t lend something to someone like that. Especially if they’re famous for being cold to others.</p>

<p>I wasn’t going to think that she was quite fond of me, but I can’t help to wonder.</p>
<p>In response to my question, Saito looked up as if she was thinking for a moment, and without a change of expressions, she said [It’s my own satisfaction]</p>
<p>[You are the first book lover I’ve met whose face I knew. And I like to discuss what I’ve read. Besides…]</p>
<p>[Besides?]</p>
<p>[It’s easy for me because you genuinely love books without any ill intents towards me, and it’s satisfying for me to talk about books with you]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Is that how it works?]</p>
<p>[That’s the way it is. So don’t worry about it, and think of it as a good luck that happened]</p>
<p>[I see]</p>
<p>She didn’t seem to have any intentions of asking more questions, so she opened her book and began to read with her eyes focused on it.</p>
<p>(Is that how it is…)</p>
<p>I don’t think I’m someone who you can lend something for free, I thought of that as I headed to my part time job.</p>
