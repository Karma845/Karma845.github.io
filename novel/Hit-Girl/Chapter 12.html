<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; The Most Beautiful Girl Likes Sweets</h3>

<p>Saito and I were going home together.</p>
<p>This was because, although I saved Saito already, I missed the chance to separate with her.</p>
<p>I should have broken up with her after I saved her, but I was too shaken to do that.</p>

<p>Going home together was the last thing I wanted to happen, but I had no choice.</p>

<p>I’m going home with the most beautiful girl in school, so I might as well enjoy it while thanking my luck for this opportunity.</p>
<p>I kept on walking, keeping an eye out to see if anyone was around me.</p>

<p>After walking for a while, Saito stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p>[What’s wrong?]</p>
<p>When she stopped, I turned around to check, and she was staring at something while standing still.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the corner of my eye, I saw a mobile ice cream shop.</p>
<p>[Do you want some?]</p>
<p>[Well… Yes. But I haven’t eaten a lot of those things…]</p>
<p>She was staring at the shop looking like she wanted to eat some, and when I asked her, she said that and caught me by surprise.</p>
<p>[Eh? You don’t eat ice cream?]</p>
<p>[No, I don’t get to go out and play much, so I’ve never had ice cream outside]</p>
<p>I was somehow convinced by her reply.</p>
<p>It’s true that I also don’t go out myself, so I don’t have many opportunities to eat outside either.</p>

<p>However, I still go out and eat with my friends every once in a while, so I felt kind of sad about her situation.</p>
<p>She talks to a lot of girls in her class, but I’ve never seen her get close to anyone in particular.</p>
<p>Maybe they only approached her because she looks good and excels in academics. And maybe that’s all they see in her.</p>
<p>But there must be someone who would see who she is and befriend her, and I wished if she could meet such a person.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Then, would you like to try it out? Let’s go]</p>

<p>There is no way I could find such a person right now, so I invited her to the ice cream shop so she could at least enjoy herself for a bit.</p>
<p>This ice cream shop is quite famous, and they have all sorts of flavors and different toppings, so there’s supposed to be something she would like.</p>
<p>I took Saito in front of the menu, and she looked at it carefully.</p>

<p>Her eyes were glued to the various pictures of ice cream.</p>
<p>Saito doesn’t normally show much emotion, but right now, she seemed to be somewhat excited and bright.</p>
<p>(It seems that she’s enjoying herself, that’s good)</p>
<p>She looked at the menu, looking unsettled, and then pointed to two kinds of ice cream and said [I would like this and this please]</p>
<p>Her eyes shone brightly when I agreed to her as she looked at me.</p>
<p>She looked slightly happy, so I smiled and ordered for both of us at the register.</p>
<p>She waited for a little while and when she received her ice cream, her face shone even brighter.</p>
<p>She seemed to have a hard time deciding on which flavor to eat at first, as she kept moving her spoon back and forth, but she decided to eat the ‘Royal Vanilla’ one first.</p>

<p>She scoops a little with her plastic spoon and puts it in her tiny mouth.</p>
<p>The way she eats it bit by bit reminds me of a small animal cuteness.</p>
<p>It was strangely cute to see her with a spoon in her mouth, her eyes narrowed and her cheeks relaxed slightly looking like she enjoyed the food. Saito is also a girl and seems to love sweets.</p>

<p>She’s usually mature and calm, but now she has an age-appropriate mood, and the wall she usually has came down.</p>

<p>She was enjoying it so much, and I couldn’t help but want to pat her on the head.</p>
<p>[&#8230; What is it?]</p>

<p>I guess I stared too long. The happy expression returned to a blank one, and she glared at me with a slight furrow in her brows.</p>
<p>[Nothing, I just thought you liked the ice cream]</p>
<p>[&#8230;.. Please don’t look without permission]</p>
<p>Even though I thought she was cute, it felt lacking due to her tsundere attitude.</p>
<p>[You&#8217;re so stingy]</p>
<p>[Isn’t that fine? Or do you want me to show you my spoiled figure?]</p>
<p>[No, I’m fine with it. I’m used to being treated coldly]</p>
<p>If you say that to me in a cold voice, I won’t know if it’s a joke or not.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if I’d like to see her spoiled side, but I find her attractive enough as she is.</p>
<p>[A lot of boys won’t go talking to you because they’re afraid of being treated coldly, but I think it’s the best the way it is]</p>
<p>[Even though I’m being stingy?]</p>
<p>[I’m not going to say I don’t care about you. If you treat me well, I’ll know that you’re a nice person, so it’s not a problem even if you’re a bit cold. You’ll have someone come with you to the ice cream shop like this.</p>
<p>[Can you do that?]</p>
<p>[Well, if you can’t go alone, I’ll go with you]</p>
<p>She asked me in an anxious voice, so I told her that so I could try and comfort her.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. I’ll ask you to do that then]</p>
<p>Saito rolled her eyes and froze for a moment when she heard my words.</p>

<p>After that, I chuckled and smiled gently.</p>
