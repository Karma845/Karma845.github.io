<h3>Chapter 22 1&#8211; The Girl In My Part Time Job Is Acting Weird</h3>

<p>I couldn’t get any ideas out of Saito other than the book she wanted, so I wanted to try asking another girl, unfortunately, I don’t have that many connections of that sort.</p>
<p>The only person I could think of was the girl at my part time job. I can’t say that we’re close, but I’ve talked to her about Saito before, and she’s easy to talk to.</p>
<p>I thought that I could get her opinion because she might have a similar taste to Saito. After my part time job’s shift ended, I approached her.</p>
<p>[Hiiragi-san, may I have a word?]</p>
<p>[Yes, what is it?]</p>
<p>When I called out to her, she gave me a strange look.</p>
<p>[Actually, I’d like to ask you something&#8230;]</p>
<p>[&#8230; Go ahead]</p>
<p>I thought she might’ve refused, since we weren’t so close to begin with, but she nodded and accepted my request, though there was a strange pause before.</p>
<p>[It’s almost the birthday of someone I’ve been close to recently,but I’m not sure what to get her&#8230;]</p>
<p>Hiiragi-san reacted to my words with a jolt and froze.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Did the person in question say anything about what she liked or wanted?]</p>
<p>[She’s always been a book lover, and when I asked her today, she said she wanted a new book]</p>
<p>[You are, after all…]</p>
<p>[What’s wrong?]</p>
<p>Her eyes behind her glasses stared at me.</p>
<p>She opened her mouth and wanted to say something, but hesitated and closed it.</p>
<p>[&#8230; No, it’s nothing. If that’s the case, I think a book would be fine right?]</p>
<p>[Hmmm…]</p>
<p>I know it’s the safest option, but it’s still quite tricky.</p>
<p>It’s a birthday present, and so I thought that a book felt a bit dull as a present.</p>
<p>[If it bothers you so much, you don’t have to actually get her anything, you know?]</p>
<p>As I was lost in thought, she suggested that I just don’t buy a present in a cold voice, as if she ran out of patience.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t do that.</p>
<p>[No, I want to give her a present. I’m really indebted to her. Even though she has no obligation to lend me books, she still does so without hesitation and with a happy expression too. Sometimes she’s a bit nosy, but I’m grateful towards her. Well, I’m too embarrassed to say this to her directly though…. Is something wrong?]</p>
<p>It’s not like I don’t want to tell anyone, but it’s still embarrassing to talk about my true feelings to others.</p>
<p>As I spoke more and more, and started to feel embarrassed, Hiiragi-san froze, rolling her eyes behind the lens.</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes and her gaze wandered around as if she was looking away from me.</p>
<p>Her cheeks seemed to be tinted with a bit of color.</p>
<p>[&#8230;.. Don’t worry about me, go on]</p>
<p>I tried to ask how she was doing, but she responded in her usual cold voice.</p>
<p>She sounded unconcerned, so I thought there would be no problem and continued talking.</p>
<p>[Is that so? Well, that’s why I want to give her something in return. I want her to be happy as a way of returning the favor she’s done for me so far. I like it when she smiles happily]</p>
<p>Sometimes she narrows her eyes and smiles happily, which is very alluring, and also soothing to watch and I want to see it again and again. I rarely see her smile because she’s usually expressionless, but it makes me happy whenever I see her smile.</p>
<p>Whenever she smiled, she looked pleased, and there was something about it that charmed me.</p>
<p>[I see… then a book would be insufficient, maybe add an accessory as an extra gift for her]</p>
<p>She told me in a more uptight voice than usual.</p>
<p>[There’s no rule that says you can’t give two]</p>
<p>I wanted to give her the book because I want her to be happy.</p>
<p>I know that she will really like the book if I get it, but the reason I was hesitant was because there’s something she hadn’t shown me a lot.</p>
<p>She’s also a normal girl. The evidence is the fact that she likes sweets such as ice cream.</p>
<p>I also feel like she loves cute and pretty things.</p>
<p>I’ll give her another present. I think it’s a good idea to have a backup gift as well.</p>
<p>[Yes, I think it would be a good idea. Then, I’ll be going now, bye]</p>
<p>[Ah, yes, thank you very much]</p>
<p>After giving me some advice, she quickly left. I watched her leave while thinking to myself.</p>
<p>As she walked away, I thought her ears were dyed a bit red..</p>
