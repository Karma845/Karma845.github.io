<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; I Picked Up The Student Handbook of The Most Beautiful Girl in School </h3>

<p>[What in the world is this?]</p>


<p>A day, after I started working part-time, I walked home after school when I found a Navy Blue notebook the size of my palm on the ground. When I picked it up, I found out it was a student handbook of the school I was attending.</p>

<p>Ignoring it would hurt my conscience, and since I was curious, I decided to pick it up and take a quick look.</p>
</p>

<p>“Reina Saito”</p>

<p>The name written in the notebook was the name of the popular girl in my school.</p>

<p>(What do I do..?)</p>


<p>I am troubled with this notebook. I should give it to her since I picked it up, however I don’t have the courage to talk to her in class.</p>

<p>She was famous for her harsh attitude. I could easily imagine that she’d be cold to me if I were to talk to her.</p>

<p>But, since I picked it up, I had to return it, so I sighed and worried about tomorrow.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>After school the next day, I was waiting for Saito near the shoe locker.</p>

<p>I decided to wait here, thinking that after school, it would be less crowded, so there would be less chance of rumors.</p>

<p>After waiting for a while, she showed up.</p>

<p>With her long, shimmering black hair and her excellent appearance that attracts people&#8217;s attention, she certainly is the best looking in the school.</p>

<p>[Can I have a word?]</p>

<p>When I called out to her, her bright eyes turned to me.</p>

<p>Her face was as beautiful as ever. I’m sure that if she smiled, it’d be a dazzling smile that could charm anyone.</p>
<p>But now, a hint of caution crept into her black eyes, the thought of being spoken to by someone whom she had no contact with.</p>

<p>[&#8230;What is it?]</p>


<p>It was clear she was building a wall from her cold tone, that didn&#8217;t allow me to enter inside her zone.</p>

<p>I’m a little hurt by her response. But even I would be on guard if a stranger approached me.</p>

<p>In the first place, she seemed to have been approached and confessed to by boys from all over the school, regardless of the grades, so she probably doesn’t want to get involved with the opposite sex too much.</p>
<p>Maybe she thought I had ulterior motives, or I was about to make a confession.</p>

<p>[Here, I think this is yours]</p>


<p>I didn’t want to get involved any further, and I didn’t want people to think I was approaching her with ulterior motives, so I bluntly told her and gave the student handbook to her.</p>

<p>[Eh?]</p>

<p>Suddenly, her hollow eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>Saito received the notebook and froze with her eyes blinking rapidly.</p>

<p>[Well then, see you later]</p>

<p>Since I was done with my business, I quickly left before Saito could move her lips.</p>
<p>I had returned the lost item, so I was sure no one would complain about my lack of politeness, and I left school without thinking about it further.</p>

<p>I’m not going to be a part of this anymore. There’s no connection between us and this is it.</p>

<p>That’s what I thought as I walked home. Up until that moment.</p>
