<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; I Talked To The Girl At My Part Time Job About It</h3>

<p>I’m grateful to Saito. She lent me books so many times, and even though it’s only 1 book, it must be quite a hassle to bring them everyday.</p>
<p>But she still brings them to me properly and lends them to me, and I’m starting to worry about her sincerity these days.</p>
<p>Since she has been good to me, I wanted to give her something in return, so I came up with the idea of helping her to make someone she could call her ‘best friend’.</p>

<p>Even though I have the idea, I don’t know how to execute it and help her.</p>
<p>When I thought of something that could be helpful, I remembered the girl from my part time job.</p>

<p>She has an air about her that is somewhat similar to Saito, so if I ask her, I might be able to get some clues.</p>

<p>[Hiiragi-san, can I have a word?]</p>
<p>[Yes, what is it?]</p>
<p>When I asked her after the shift was over, Hiiragi-san slightly tilted her head.</p>
<p>[Hiiragi-san, do you have anyone you can call your best friend?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;.. Yes? Why ask out of the blue?]</p>
<p>Her voice sounded somewhat alarmed. After I started talking, I think I skipped too much of the conversation.</p>

<p>In a hurried manner, I explained how I came up with the question to lower her guard.</p>
<p>[Oh, no, actually…]</p>
<p>[I see, that’s what you meant. If that’s the case, please explain it first. You surprised me, you know?]</p>
<p>She let out a small sigh, and said [Huh] in a dumbfounded manner.</p>
<p>[Sorry about that]</p>
<p>[Well, it’s all right. As it turns out, I don’t have anyone I trust that much. I have friendships, but I’ve never been close to anyone in particular]</p>
<p>Hiiragi-san tried to cut the conversation off with a chilly voice. She frowns as if she remembered a bitter memory somewhere.</p>
<p>Her response was predictable in a way. I only talk to her in my part time job, so I don’t know her all that well, but after working with her so many times, I inevitably know her personality to some extent.</p>

<p>She was somewhat unsociable, cautious, and tended to be shy, which I discovered when she began to teach me at my part time job.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect her to have lots of best friends. If she had one person close to her, I was going to ask that as a reference, but apparently not.</p>
<p>[Oh yeah&#8230;]</p>
<p>[Maybe&#8230;]</p>
<p>[Maybe?]</p>
<p>I was about to give up after she said she doesn’t have any, but she quickly said something again and I listened to her.</p>
<p>[You remembered the person who helped me before, right? If you mean someone who could be a good friend, I think it’ll be him]</p>
<p>[Is that so?]</p>
<p>[Yes, he’s the most carefree person I’ve met, and I feel like he accepts me for who I am, so I feel comfortable talking to him. It hasn’t been that long since we met, and I’ve never met anyone like him before, so I don’t know yet..]</p>
<p>Hiiragi-san became soft and fluffy when she talked about him, and told her thoughts in a warm voice.</p>

<p>I can’t help but be drawn in by the gap of her usual demeanor and this one</p>
<p>(TN: Pretty sure it’s called Gap Moe)</p>

<p>I could tell she was opening up to that person by the way she talked about him.</p>
<p>(Oh, this is it&#8230;)</p>
<p>The way she smiled, her mouth slightly relaxed and softly speaking was like a flower, and was very attractive, and from the way she spoke, I could imagine that she trusted him more than before and that they became closer.</p>

<p>I don’t know if he’s a friend or not, but she seems to favor him a bit.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. You’ve met a nice person]</p>
<p>[Yes, but I don’t know if it’s useful information for you]</p>
<p>[Well, it’s enough]</p>
<p>It wasn’t something I expected, and we both looked at each other and laughed.</p>
<p>After all, <i><b>a trustworthy person has a strong element of coincidence</b></i>, and there’s nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>I’ll let Saito do her best on her own.</p>

<p>I came to that conclusion and discarded my plan to help her.</p>
