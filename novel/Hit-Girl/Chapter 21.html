<h3>Chapter 21 &#8211; What The Most Beautiful Girl Wants</h3>

<p>I am very grateful to Saito. She has lent me books so many times that I’ve lost count. Even now, I’ve been lent 2 books every day.</p>
<p>Although she doesn’t bring the books to school like she used to, she still has a man visiting her house almost every day. That would still have to be stressful.</p>
<p>Even so, she still lends me a lot of books, and I can’t get over how she’s very sincere nowadays.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to give her something in return since she’s been very nice to me.</p>
<p>I’ve been in her care for too long, and I don’t think I can repay her for everything.</p>
<p>But, if I do have a chance, what better way to return the favor than on her birthday?</p>
<p>If I gave it to her as a thank you gift, she’d probably refuse. However, if I gave it to her as a present, she wouldn’t be able to refuse it, right?</p>
<p>I know when her birthday is. I happened to see it when I picked up her handbook, it’s exactly 2 months after my own birthday, so it’s not too hard to remember.</p>
<p>I can’t let this great opportunity pass by.</p>
<p>[Hey, is there anything you want?]</p>
<p>Normally, when you’re giving a present to someone, you would want the recipient to be happy, though in my case, I have no clue what she would like.</p>
<p>There’s nothing I can come up with other than to ask her what she wants.</p>
<p>I should’ve thought of a better way to question her. When I asked her bluntly, she had a puzzled look.</p>
<p>[What is it, all of the sudden?]</p>
<p>I could tell she put her guard up fromher voice.</p>
<p>[No, it’s just that… I don’t know much about you and what you like]</p>
<p>[There’s no need. It’s pointless to tell you either way]</p>
<p>[Don’t say that. I’m curious. Tell me something]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Fine]</p>
<p>I might’ve been a bit too persistent, but when I asked her like that, she gave a small sigh and agreed.</p>
<p>Luckily, she didn’t seem to notice I was asking with the intent to get her a present.</p>
<p>It might be a given. Since, on her side, she doesn’t realize I know her birthday, that thought<br />
never came to her mind.</p>
<p>[Hmmm&#8230;]</p>
<p>She crossed her arms and lowered her eyes, she looked like she was thinking very hard.</p>
<p>But as time passed, she kept being silent, and didn’t open her mouth.</p>
<p>[Is there anything?]</p>
<p>[Even if you ask, I don’t have a lot of personal belongings to begin with]</p>
<p>She’s trying to think of something to respond with, but it doesn’t seem like she could come up with anything, and looked annoyed.</p>
<p>[Hmm&#8230; Ah, there is one that I do want]</p>
<p>[Oh, what is it?]</p>
<p>[It’s a new book called □□] (TN: Yes, it is listed like that)</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Books, huh]</p>
<p>Even knowing her, I was still taken aback by her answer.</p>
<p>It seemed a little out of place for a beautiful high school girl to ask something like that. Normally, they would want cosmetics or accessories, not a book.</p>
<p>I could only laugh at the unexpected answer.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Why don’t you buy it yourself?]</p>
<p>[It’s not that I can’t, but I don’t know if it’s good or not because it’s a new book. It’s also expensive because it’s a hardcover.]</p>
<p>[I see]</p>
<p>She never expected to get a birthday present, so she just said what she wanted.</p>
<p>But is it okay to give her a book as a present? I’m sure she’ll be happy if I give it to her, but it doesn’t feel right.</p>
<p>In the end, I had no clue what to get her. She looked at me with a curious expression and looked a bit confused.</p>
