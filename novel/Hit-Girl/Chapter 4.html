<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; The Girl At My Part Time Job Asks For Advice</h3>

<p>[Huh?]</p>

<p>I didn’t expect to be asked for advice, and a stupid voice came out.</p>

<p>[I don’t mind if you don’t do it]</p>

<p>[No, no, I was just surprised. It’s okay! I’ll listen to your problems!]</p>

<p>The fact that I froze suddenly and didn’t respond was taken as rejection, and I hurriedly explained and tried to make it up by giving a testy manner.</p>

<p>It was something unexpected, but since she asked me to do it, I listened to her, and was determined to do what I could.</p>

<p>[&#8230; Today, I was approached by a man I didn’t know. I was cautious when he came, but he returned an item that I lost. I wanted to thank him there and then, but I was too surprised to do so&#8230;]</p>

<p>[In other words, you want to ask me what you can give to him as a thanks? That’s quirky&#8230;]</p>

<p>I’d like to help her, however I can’t do much with that little amount of information.</p>
<p>Even if we know about his clothes or age, it still would be difficult to find him.</p>

<p>[No, I know he is from my school, so I can find him myself. I’m thinking of giving him a little snack tomorrow as a thank you, however I do not know what he likes. So I’d like to have opinions, since I have never gave anything to the opposite sex&#8230;]</p>

<p>[Ah, so that’s what it is, I see]</p>

<p>It seems normal for her to say thank you to him.</p>

<p>As long as it’s a gift, she wanted something reasonable, so she asked me, who is a man, for my opinion.</p>

<p>I was thinking hard about it, trying to be helpful to her.</p>

<p>[First of all, I suggest avoiding something too sweet]</p>

<p>[Are sweet things a no go?]</p>

<p>Hiiragi-san looked at me curiously and was puzzled by my words</p>

<p>It’s very cute seeing her having an expression, compared to her usual expressionless face.</p>

<p>[No, it’s not like it’s bad, however boys, myself included, don’t like overly sweet things, so I’d prefer something less sweet]</p>

<p>[&#8230;.I see]</p>

<p>The serious expression on her face when she listens to me shows that she wanted to thank him properly.</p>

<p>[I think it’s better to avoid cakes and things similar to that, because raw food is not good. Cookies, madeleines, or even… cupcakes might be good]</p>

<p>[That’s the kind of thing…. I understand. Speaking of which, wouldn’t this bother him?]</p>

<p>Hiiragi-san lowered her eyebrows and asked me. Perhaps she was feeling anxious if he would be disturbed by this.</p>

<p>[It’s okay, I don’t think it is annoying or unnecessary]</p>

<p>If you have such a feeling, it will be felt by the other party, since it’s food related, I don’t think it should be a nuisance, so I strongly encouraged her.</p>

<p>[Is that so….]</p>

<p>I guess she wasn’t used to handing something to other people often. She seemed to be unable to shake off her anxiety, even after hearing my words, and looked somewhat worried.</p>
