<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Reunited With The Most Beautiful Girl in School</h3>

<p>As expected, Saito and I have never been in contact since then.</p>
<p>She was a stranger to me in the first place. The fact that we were able to talk 2 days straight was a miracle in itself.</p>
<p>Just because you talked to someone twice, doesn’t mean your relationship changes. We’re still strangers.</p>
<p>If something has changed, maybe it’s the fact that a few people glare at me when I walk in the hallway during break time.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I can see Saito sitting in another classroom.</p>
<p>She’s surrounded by many girls and was friendly to them, however there were no boys in sight.</p>
<p>I guess it’s because it’s widely known that she becomes cold when boys talk to her.</p>
<p>But, just by glancing at them, I could tell that the boys were looking at her with passionate gazes, or with gazes that more or less held ulterior motives.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’d feel comfortable at all if someone looked at me like that.</p>

<p>Her beautiful appearance might be a good thing, however looking at her circumstances, I was a bit worried for her.</p>
<p>I don’t know how it happened, I somehow got a gift from Saito, but we live in different worlds.</p>

<p>There was no way she and I could possibly get along.</p>
<p>People from the upper caste are only attracted to the same caste.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that I, who was self conscious and being a simple mob character, would have anything to do with Saito, a beauty who attracts almost everyone.</p>
<p>Yes, I didn’t think I would even get involved with her again.</p>
<p>[What book are you reading?]</p>
<p>This was overturned when I was doing my hobby of reading a book in the library.</p>
