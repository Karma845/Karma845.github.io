<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Aftermath Of The Advice I Gave To The Girl In My Part Time Job</h3>

<p>Since then, every day I borrow a new book and every time I return it, I inevitably talk to Saito more often.</p>

<p>There was nothing that changed drastically, but if there is one, then it would be that I had to stay up late to make sure I can return the book by the next day. Then I was told to stop that habit.</p>
<p>And since the complaints were coming out of concern for me, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to argue with them, and it began to become my daily routine to listen to them quietly every time.</p>

<p>[You look awfully sleepy]</p>
<p>There were no customers that came at all, and as I was yawning during my part-time job due to boredom and sleepiness, Hiiragi-san, who hadn’t taken a shift in a while approached me.</p>
<p>[Yeah, I&#8217;ve been addicted to something lately, and I&#8217;m a little sleep deprived…]</p>
<p>[Is that so.. But you should take care of yourself, okay? Even if you&#8217;re young, you can still easily get sick]</p>
<p>[Someone else told me the same thing the other day]</p>
<p>[I’m sure,that person is also worried about you]</p>

<p>Saito&#8217;s manner of speaking was similar to that of a mother to her son.</p>
<p>She was too young and pretty to be a mother, but I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to reject her concern and caution.</p>
<p>[I guess so, I do think it’s a bit of nagging, but I’m listening to it properly]</p>
<p>[Either way, you are just listening to it and not reflecting on it, right?]</p>
<p>When I shrugged my shoulders, she responded with a sigh.</p>
<p>[Well anyway, was the thank-you gift well received? ]</p>
<p>It seemed like I would keep on getting blamed if I continued on this topic any longer, so I decided to bring up a topic that I was curious about.</p>

<p>[Yes, thank you very much for that time. Since I was told that it was delicious, I think it was well received.]</p>
<p>[Oh, well, that&#8217;s good to hear.]</p>
<p>Hiiragi-san bowed her head and thanked me. It was typical of her that she took the trouble to lower her head.</p>
<p>I was worried about her because she seemed quite anxious, but she seemed to have succeeded, and I inwardly patted my chest in relief.</p>
<p>[What kind of person was it who picked it up for you?]</p>
<p>[He is a nice person. In fact, I&#8217;ve had some interactions with him since then, and I&#8217;d say he&#8217;s an honest and kind person.……though he doesn’t seem to listen to my words]</p>
<p>Hiiragi-san let out a small, exasperated breath as if to say, &#8220;Oh dear&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although she was breathing out a sigh, she seemed to be enjoying herself.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but stare at Hiiragi-san&#8217;s unexpected reaction.</p>
<p>[……What is it?]</p>
<p>[No, I was just surprised that you interact with men. I thought you didn&#8217;t like to interact with people]</p>
<p>She was only talking to me because she had to because of the job, and I had never seen her talking to anyone else in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>[Ah, I see. It&#8217;s true that I&#8217;m not good at interacting with the opposite sex and I refuse to do so, so you&#8217;re right, Tanaka-san. However, he doesn&#8217;t have any ulterior motives, and he&#8217;s not really interested in me, so I can talk to him in peace.]</p>
<p>Hiiragi-san&#8217;s expression, as she said this, was not as unsociable as usual, and she had a very soft smile on her face .</p>

<p>（Wow, Hiiragi-san can make this expression as well）</p>
<p>Her soft smile, which she rarely showed, was a combination of charm that more than made up for her plainness, and I suddenly thought that most men would fall for her if they saw her like this.</p>

<p>I was curious because she was making that normie comment despite her unremarkable attire, but I&#8217;m sure this smile was the reason.</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m glad to hear that. It seems like you&#8217;ve made a good friend]</p>
<p>He must be a really nice person if he can make her smile like this. She has a personality that makes people who she meets for the first time feel a barrier between them.</p>
<p>When I said that as a congratulations, Hiiragi-san&#8217;s eyes fluttered and she froze.</p>

<p>[Friend&#8230;&#8230;. So this is what you call a friend huh..]</p>
<p>When she mumbled those words, her voice was bouncing just a little, and she loosened her mouth slightly.</p>
