<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; The Most Beautiful Girl In School’s Contact Information</h3>

<p>[Let’s go to your house then]</p>
<p>[Yeah&#8230; Oh, wait a minute]</p>
<p>I wanted to read as soon as possible, so I rushed to Saito but she stopped me.</p>
<p>[What’s wrong?]</p>
<p>[That&#8230; Please tell me your contact information]</p>
<p>I guess she’s not used to asking for people’s contact info, as she was a little reluctant to say it. Or it could be an entirely different thing.</p>
<p>She understands what it means to ask for the contact info to the opposite sex, and she may be reluctant because of that.</p>
<p>Of course, I wouldn’t make that mistake of thinking she sees me as someone of interest.</p>
<p>[What? Why?]</p>
<p>[You can’t come home with me everyday, can you? Please call me if you have something you have to do. I’ll bring the books to school that day]</p>
<p>[Oh, I see]</p>
<p>It’s certainly inconvenient to not be able to tell her when you need to do something. If I had a way to contact her, she wouldn’t have to come to me while feeling ill anymore.</p>
<p>Then, I thought, I’ll show her the QR code of a certain messaging app. I held it up to read the code and she froze.</p>
<p>[Thank you… What? Minato Tanaka?]</p>
<p>Her eyes widened as she looked twice at her phone as if making sure of something.</p>
<p>[Hm? Yeah, that’s right. I didn’t tell you?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;.. Yeah, I never heard about it. You didn’t introduce yourself to me when we started talking, and I wasn’t particularly interested in you either]</p>
<p>She glanced at me a few times, and then her usual cold voice came back.</p>
<p>[Oh, really?]</p>
<p>She really has no interest in people huh. I chuckle at her typical thoughts as usual.</p>
<p>[Once again, I’m Minato Tanaka. Nice to meet you]</p>
<p>[Yes, nice to meet you too]</p>
<p>Thus we introduced ourselves once again.</p>
<p>It’s really strange. She’s someone famous in school, and I should have nothing to do with her, yet we’re exchanging contact info right now.</p>
<p>I looked at her account that I exchanged with her with a mix of happiness and annoyance.</p>
<p>[What’s wrong?]</p>
<p>[No, I was just wondering how it wasn’t as difficult as I thought it would be to get the contact info that every boy in the school wants so badly]</p>
<p>After exchanging contact info, I realized it’s not easy to get the contact info of the most beautiful girl in school, especially when the person you’re exchanging info with is known for being cold and isn’t telling her info to most people.</p>
<p>I sigh in my mind, feeling like I’m in for more trouble.</p>
<p>[Don’t spread it around, okay?]</p>
<p>[I won’t do that. If they know I have it, they’ll stare at me. I can’t stand it]</p>
<p>How could I do that when I know that the rest of the class would turn against me if it came out.</p>
<p>At first, even though she was forced to do so, she trusted me to some extent and told me her contact info, and I have no intentions of betraying the trust she had in me.</p>
<p>[Well, let’s get going. I can’t wait to read]</p>
<p>I hurried her along, turning a blind eye to avoid further trouble, and decided to enjoy the books for now.</p>
<p>[The books won’t run away you know?]</p>
<p>She giggled, and her mouth loosened up at the sight of me</p>
