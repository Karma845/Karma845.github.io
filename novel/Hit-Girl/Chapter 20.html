<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211; The Most Beautiful Girls Vulnerable Side</h3>

<p>[You… What are you doing?]</p>
<p>Saito, who should have left school earlier, stopped in front of an ice cream shop sign.</p>
<p>How long has she been there?</p>
<p>In order to let her get ahead of me, I left about 5 minutes after she left, but the fact that I caught up with her means she’s been stopping at the sign for quite some time.</p>
<p>[I was waiting for you]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>[There’s a limited time offer for ice cream that ends today. Please come with me]</p>
<p>[Why do I have to go&#8230;]</p>
<p>[You said that you’d go with me if there was no one else to go with, right?]</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I did say that. I said something like that the last time we went here together.</p>
<p>At that time, it was just to put her at ease though&#8230;</p>
<p>[I did say that… But why don’t you go alone?]</p>
<p>[It’s because&#8230; I’m nervous if I’m alone&#8230;]</p>
<p>Unlike her usual self, her slightly sullen look was very cute and amusing, causing me to laugh.</p>
<p>[What are you laughing at?!]</p>
<p>[No, it’s nothing. Let’s go then]</p>
<p>It seems that she liked ice cream a lot that made her willing to eat in an unfamiliar place. Or maybe she’s interested in the limited time offer.</p>
<p>Saito is still a girl after all.</p>
<p>I was somehow convinced by her reason for going, and I had no choice but to go with her.</p>
<p>[I feel like I’m treated as an idiot]</p>
<p>Her cheeks puffed up, and she looked as if complaining about me laughing at her.</p>
<p>[I’ll be the one ordering this time. What would you like?]</p>
<p>[Oh, thanks. Then I’ll get a matcha flavored]</p>
<p>[All right]</p>
<p>When I told her what I wanted, she walked to the cashier, but I wondered if she’d be fine.</p>
<p>There are other things to order besides the ice cream, though.</p>
<p>[What?! Toppings as well…? What should I do&#8230;.]</p>
<p>Sure enough, I heard her say that.</p>
<p>I managed to place my order, hesitantly.</p>
<p>She seemed to finish her order, somehow. And looked as if she completed something great.</p>
<p>[Number △△]</p>
<p>They called our number and we went to get our ice cream.</p>
<p>She held the ice cream awkwardly, probably because she wasn’t used to it.</p>
<p>I burst out in spite of the appearance of her holding it with a tense face.</p>
<p>[What is it?]</p>
<p>[Don’t worry. It’s nothing]</p>
<p>I just found it amusing that she’s still tense because she’s nervous.</p>
<p>But I don’t want to laugh anymore, because I felt like she’ll glare at me with a serious look if I do.</p>
<p>I sit down on the chair of the place, and she sits next to me.</p>
<p>I almost laughed again based on her awkward movements, but I refrained myself cause she’s next to me.</p>
<p>She sits down and looks at the ice cream in her hand, with eyes that seem like they are shining.</p>
<p>[Well, let’s eat]</p>
<p>[Yes, I’ll eat it]</p>
<p>When she said “itadakimasu”, she brought the ice cream close to her mouth, and ate it carefully.</p>
<p>Limited time offers usually have a different flavor, but is it good? I asked her.</p>
<p>I looked at her, and she seemed to be enjoying it. She rolled her eyes as she described the taste, and her mouth relaxed slightly.</p>
<p>Lately, I felt like the amount of her being expressionless has decreased drastically.</p>
<p>Every time I take a bite of the ice cream, my face naturally relaxes as I enjoy the taste.</p>
<p>[&#8230;? What is it?]</p>
<p>She realized I was staring at her intensely, and tilted her head curiously.</p>
<p>[I just thought you’re enjoying the food]</p>
<p>[Of course. Because it’s delicious]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. I see]</p>
<p>She smiled softly and said “it’s delicious”. She had a face of a flower blooming, and was very eye-catching.</p>

<p>It felt unbearable to look at it, so I looked away quickly.</p>
