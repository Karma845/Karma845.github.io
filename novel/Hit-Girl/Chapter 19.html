<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; The Most Beautiful Girl And Umbrella</h3>

<p>Since then, I’ve been going to Saito’s house to borrow books, and nothing unusual has happened so far.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising. We don’t walk side by side, and it’s not like we had any kind of relationship.</p>
<p>If there was something that changed, it’s that I started to talk to her a little longer in front of her house since I no longer had to worry about being seen.</p>
<p>The two of us are book lovers. The time passed naturally as we exchanged impressions of the book we read.</p>
<p>Another thing that changed, is that I’ve slept less, and as a result, I’ve been getting small complaints more often, but this is not a problem.</p>
<p>I was about to leave school and head to Saito’s house in order to enjoy more books.</p>
<p>[Ah, rain&#8230;]</p>
<p>As I walked out of the school&#8217;s shoe lockers, I saw it was pouring outside.</p>
<p>The sound of rain hitting the ground echoed in the air.</p>
<p>It was sunny in the morning, so when did it start to rain? I’m not exactly fond of sunny days, but the fact that it’s raining lowered my spirit.</p>
<p>I had just taken out my folding umbrella when I saw Saito standing at the entrance.</p>
<p>She looked up at the sky and stood there as if she was troubled.</p>
<p>[Did you forget your umbrella?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Yes]</p>
<p>I could only think of one reason why she would be here, so I asked her, and I seemed to have hit the mark.</p>
<p>Normally, I would never talk to someone in such a public place, but this time, Saito’s eyebrows were furrowed as if she was in trouble, so I couldn’t help but call her.</p>
<p>It is indeed hard leaving someone in trouble, especially if it is someone you know.</p>
<p>I wondered if I should go buy an umbrella, but I remembered that there was no convenience store nearby.</p>
<p>There was only one way I could help her, but it was not the most comfortable solution.However, I have no choice.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Do you want to join me?]</p>
<p>[No, thank you. I’m fine]</p>
<p>I suggested the only option, but she bluntly replied to me in a cold voice.<br />
[Then how do you plan on getting home?]</p>
<p>[That’s….]</p>
<p>Saito stuttered. If she had some way home, she would’ve left ages ago. If she hadn’t left, that means she didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>She still doesn’t know how to rely on people. When you’re in trouble, I wish you would rely on me. Or I won’t have any chance to return the favor.</p>
<p>[Come on, let’s go]</p>
<p>[But….]</p>
<p>I opened my umbrella and urged her to come in, but she was still reluctant.</p>
<p>She seemed to be worried about me. Maybe she’s worried that it would start a rumor, or that I’ll get into trouble.</p>
<p>[Just to be clear, I’m not trying to do the umbrella cliche. I’m doing it for myself, I can’t borrow the books today without you, can I?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Then, please]</p>
<p>It’s a bit forceful, but after I gave her a reason, she slowly walked into my umbrella.</p>
<p>The distance between us is closer than I thought. Her shoulders are right next to mine, and if I move even a little bit to the side, I’ll bump into her.</p>
<p>A soft floral scent entered my nose. She smells sweet and nice, it’s the same as when I lent her my shoulders before.</p>
<p>Inevitably, I felt uncomfortable to be reminded that she is the opposite sex, so I picked up the pace to her house.</p>
<p>[Now, the book, please]</p>
<p>[&#8230;.. Please wait a moment]</p>
<p>When I arrived at her house, or rather, her apartment, she glanced at me and went inside to get the books.</p>
<p>I don’t know if she lives alone. The only thing I could see from her room is that it’s not exactly populated, and it has that lonely atmosphere.</p>
<p>I waited at the front door of her house, and she opened the door. In her hands were a book and a few pieces of clothing.</p>
<p>[Here you go]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. What’s with the clothes?]</p>
<p>[It’s my fault that your shoulders are wet, right? Please change your clothes]</p>
<p>Apparently, she noticed that I was leaning my umbrella towards her when we walked.</p>
<p>The umbrella I had was a folding umbrella. There was no room for two people, it was barely enough for one person.</p>
<p>I secretly tilted it towards her so she wouldn’t get wet, but I didn’t realize she knew.</p>
<p>[N-no, I’m just going to leave&#8230;]</p>
<p>[No. What will you do if you catch a cold? I’m not saying this for you. I’d feel bad if you catch one because of me]</p>
<p>I had no choice but to nod my head when she gave me a worried look, and said it the same way I did to her before.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Got it]</p>
<p>When I reluctantly tried to take off my clothes, she turned her head away.</p>
<p>[Wait until I am gone!]</p>
<p>When I looked at her, her cheeks were tingled with vermillion and her voice was rather flustered.</p>
<p>Unlike girls, boys don’t need to hide their chests, but I guess she’s not immune to bare skin, so it was understandable if she’s flustered.</p>
<p>Her cheeks turned slightly red as she turned away and walked hurriedly to the back room.</p>
<p>The fact that she seemed sluggish is because she’s embarrassed.</p>
<p>Her ears, which I could see from the back, were slightly red, so I could tell she’s very embarrassed.</p>
<p>I watched her go into her room, and looked at the clothes she gave me.</p>
<p>The clothes she gave me were a bit bigger than her own size, so I could probably wear this.</p>
<p>[&#8230;. Are you done yet?]</p>
<p>Perhaps she heard the sound of the clothes rustling stop, as I was called from the other side of the door.</p>
<p>[Yeah, I’m done]</p>
<p>When I said that, she peeked from the door, and had a relieved expression.</p>
<p>I guess she was relieved I changed my clothes already.</p>
<p>[Then, I’ll be borrowing this, thanks]</p>
<p>[It’s okay, be careful]</p>
<p>[Sorry for the trouble]</p>
When I left her house, I could smell her scent from the clothes, which I hadn’t noticed before.</p>
<p>It was somehow unsettling to be conscious of the fact that the clothes had her scent.</p>
