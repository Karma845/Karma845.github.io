<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; I Was Approached By The Most Beautiful Girl in School</h3>

<p>After school, I picked up my shoe from the shoe box and was on my way to leave when I saw Saito standing at the doorway.</p>

<p>Our eyes met. No, I felt like it did.</p>
<p>I’ve only interacted with her once yesterday, and I’m sure she had no more business with me.</p>

<p>She probably doesn’t remember that I’m the one who gave her the handbook back. She must’ve forgotten about this mob character.</p>
<p>Just as I was walking her, I thought that it wasn’t me who she was waiting for.</p>
<p>[Can I have a moment?]</p>
<p>The voice was dignified and clear as day.</p>

<p>The tone itself wasn’t soft, but it was less cold compared to the one yesterday, and it reached my ears.</p>
<p>[Eh, me?]</p>
<p>What could she be doing here? It’s probably related to yesterday but I had no idea.</p>

<p>…. Maybe I returned the notebook properly, but some of the contents were torn, and she came to complain?</p>
<p>[Just so you know, I didn’t tear any part of your notebook. If there was a scratch it would be when you dropped it. I didn’t do it]</p>
<p>To avoid any complaints, I tried to check the situation ahead of time. But it seems I missed the point. And Saito shook her head.</p>
<p>[Hmm? The student notebook is still intact and clean though?]</p>
<p>[Eh, is that so? Then what do you want?]</p>
<p>I’m embarrassed that I was wrong.</p>
<p>I can’t think of anything that isn’t related to the student notebook.</p>
<p>If she isn’t complaining, then why is she talking to me?</p>

<p>[Um… I’ll give you this]</p>
<p>With a nervous look on her face, Saito took out what looked like a small bag she kept behind her.</p>
<p>It was a reflex for me to receive what she gave to me.</p>
<p>It wasn’t heavy. In fact, it was rather light.</p>
<p>[What is this?]</p>
<p>[Thank you for delivering my student notebook. That’s my way of thanking you.]</p>
<p>So that’s what it was!</p>
<p>I understand why Saito tried to talk to me and was relieved</p>
<p>It was nice of her to thank me in a way she wasn’t used to doing.</p>
<p>I changed my impression about her slightly after the initial cold and blunt encounter.</p>

<p>[I understand, thank you]</p>
<p>[&#8230;. it’s nothing]</p>
<p>She should’ve been done with me, but she was still looking at me and didn’t leave. She was still staring at the bag with a nervous look on her face.</p>

<p>[Can I open it?]</p>
<p>Is something bothering her?</p>
<p>I was wondering what she was doing, but I asked if I could open it since she gave this to me.</p>

<p>[Eh? Yes….]</p>
<p>For some reason, she tightened her mouth, making her nervous expression more explicit.</p>
<p>She looked as if she was preparing her heart or something.</p>
<p>I opened the bag and watched her change her expressions with a side glance.</p>
<p>What’s inside was a cookie. The cookie is topped with a choco chip and looks delicious</p>
<p>It looked delicious, so I took one and tried it.</p>

<p>[What!?]</p>
<p>I thought it was a normal chocolate chip cookie. Turns out I was wrong. There was a slight refreshing citrus flavor slipped in.</p>
<p>It’s crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside, it makes me want to eat another piece.</p>
<p>The sweetness was moderate, and even I, a boy, could enjoy it.</p>

<p>It was so tasty I can’t help but let out a few comments.</p>
<p>[This, is really good]</p>
<p>[!? I-is that so. I’m glad it suits your tastes]</p>
<p>Apparently, she was worried how I would react.</p>
<p>When I complimented how good it was, she returned from her tense face to an expressionless one, and relaxed her mouth slightly.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but look at the slight smile on the usually expressionless face.</p>
<p>(I think I understand why people around me says she’s cute)</p>
<p>I think Saito is indeed a beautiful girl, but nothing more came to mind. She’s pretty and cute, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>She had an image close to a painting, as if I was looking at a manufactured beauty.</p>
<p>Until now, I couldn’t understand what was cute about her being so unfriendly and cold. However, seeing her act this way, her cuteness made her seem more human. And now I understand why.</p>
<p>[What is it?]</p>
<p>The smile that appeared for a moment disappeared in an instant. And I felt like that was a waste.</p>
<p>[No, it’s nothing. Thank you for this. See you later]</p>
<p>[Yes, goodbye]</p>
<p>I quickly departed to disguise the thought that came to my mind.</p>
<p>I never thought I’d be talking to the most beautiful girl in school again. I was surprised by the unexpected event, but I guess I won’t have to deal with her again next time.</p>
<p>I went home, thinking it was worth seeing her smile, even for a bit.</p>
