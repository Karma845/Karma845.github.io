<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; The Most Beautiful Girl Is Still As Popular As Ever</h3>

<p>[I heard the class next door has a research project today?]</p>
<p>[Seriously?! Then Saito-san would be there, wouldn’t she?]</p>
<p>[Seriously, she’s too pretty, I’m too scared to talk to her, but just looking at her is a feast for my eyes]</p>
<p>[That’s right]</p>
<p>They weren’t exactly whispering, so I could hear the conversations of my classmates.</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>Right now, I’m on my way to the library, even though it isn’t after school. The reason is because I have a class called “research study”.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, this is a class where students use the library to research and present their findings, however in the era with smartphones, this method is pretty inefficient.</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>Well, complaining isn’t changing anything, so I moved to the library quietly.</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>As I walked into the library, I noticed it was a little noisy and the people there were talking and walking around, even though the library is usually not very popular.</p>
<p>From what I heard before, another class is also coming for the research study.</p>
<p>。</p>

<p>Feeling somewhat uncomfortable with the different atmosphere, I began to search for books.</p>
<p>I already decided on the topic for my presentation, so I gathered the related bookss and quickly took my seat.</p>

<p>A lot of people have already sat down, so if I don’t hurry, I won’t be able to get a seat.</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>I let out a sigh of relief, and I suddenly remembered the conversation my classmates had.</p>
<p>(Is she here?)</p>
<p>Sneaking a glance of the surroundings, I found a girl sitting at a table diagonally in front of me with a figure that stood out even in the midst of the crowd.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how she attracts the attention of everyone around her even though she’s just reading.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of boys that looked at Saito, who was sitting and reading her book silently.</p>
<p>It took me a moment to look at her, but she happened to look up at that moment and my eyes met hers.</p>

<p>I looked at her from a distance, but our eyes met, and when I awkwardly let my gaze wander, a small smile appeared on her mouth.</p>
<p>[Oh, wait, she smiled?! Hey, didn’t she just smile, that Saito-san?!]</p>
<p>[Sorry, I didn’t see it. But I must have seen it wrong. Saito-san is famous for her harsh and cold attitude. No one has ever seen anything else but a blank expression, so why would she smile here?!]</p>
<p>[It’s true! I swear she smiled!]</p>
<p>The person sitting next to me also saw her smiling face and was telling his friend about it, however his friend snickered and refused to believe.</p>
<p>I guess it’s a given. No one could imagine that she would smile. I was just as surprised when she did that the first time.</p>

<p>Compared to the days before, she became more expressive, so I wonder if she’s favoring me in any way.</p>
<p>I looked at her one more time, still unable to draw a conclusion of what it’s like to be acquainted with the most beautiful girl in school.</p>
