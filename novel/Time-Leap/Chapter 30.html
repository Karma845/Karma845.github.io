<h3>Chapter 30 &#8211; School Trip (5)</h3>

<p><em>The second night.</em></p>
<p>Fujimoto and the rest of the guys were a lot less energetic than the first day, and since they were tired, they quickly fell asleep. Even though I was hoping for some sort of pillow fight&#8230;</p>
<p>Everyone was sleeping soundly. I was thinking that I too should go to bed when the phone that I put down next to me began to vibrate.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>In order to not wake people up with my light, I end up wrapping myself up with my blanket.</p>
<p><em>“Are you still awake? I want to see you, Seiji-kun.”</em></p>
<p>Guu… Hiiragi-chan threw out a straight ball of an invitation.</p>
<p><em>“However, Sensei, isn’t it already lights out?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Mou, such a meanie~!”</em></p>
<p>Cute…</p>
<p><em>Moving on to a later point in time.</em></p>
<p>Everyone is now asleep, so if I leave now, it probably won’t be found out. Well, I did say that there wouldn’t be any problems after lights out, so let’s go see this goddess that is way too cute. After arranging my yukata I checked how I looked within the mirror and left the room.</p>
<p>“Ah, you came out!”</p>
<p>“Uwah!?”</p>
<p>I was captured by Hiiragi-chan who was waiting in anticipation.</p>
<p>“Wait, this is the hallway!”</p>
<p>I tried my best to peel her off as she was trying her best to stick to me. I was so surprised… Well, I guess she thought that I would definitely come out?</p>
<p>Dammit, she’s right though.</p>
<p>“Sensei, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Hiiragi-senseei, is currently… on patrol!”</p>
<p>Funya, Hiiragi-chan made a salute. She definitely drank again… She was in a yukata, and instead of her hair in a ponytail, it was all let down.</p>
<p>“Since it’s past the time for lights out, as a teacher, I’m checking to see if there are any bad students that are still coming out of their rooms to play.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“A bad student, I just found one.”</p>
<p>Funi funi, she played around with my cheeks. She’s drunk…</p>
<p>“But still, you called me out—”</p>
<p>“Stealing Hiiragi-sensei’s heart, you’re a bad student.”</p>
<p>She made a sloven smile. Uugh, she’s completely in her drunken mode. Come on, your chest, I can basically see it! You aren’t wearing a bra again, really?</p>
<p>…Well I guess that’s just how a yukata is…?</p>
<p>“Seiji-kun, you’re staring too much. You pervert ♡”</p>
<p>“Be quiet. I’ll do my best. Aren’t you in the middle of work?”</p>
<p>“Yup.”</p>
<p>“Because you do stuff like this, when you sober up, you’ll end up regretting it you know?”</p>
<p>“… Alright, I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan’s “fun gauge” was visibly diminished in that instant. Ah, I’m the one that’s feeling bad now.</p>
<p>“Since I’m one of the younger ones, I was pushed into patrolling, you see? Mou.”</p>
<p>While voicing her complaints, Hiiragi-chan pouted. She fixed her slipping yukata, and walked off towards no particular destination. If we were caught walking out like this after lights out like some riajuus, I have no idea what would happen. Such a drunken and defenseless Hiiragi-chan, there’s no way I could just let her go, so I followed after her.</p>
<p>“Since I’m worried, I’ll accompany you.”</p>
<p>“Bad students will be detained.”</p>
<p>She said, as she grabbed my hand.</p>
<p>“Me too, I found a defenseless, erotic, and cute teacher.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“Detain her.”</p>
<p>I as well, gripped her soft hands in return.</p>
<p>“I guess the both of us caught each other.”</p>
<p>Come on, don’t say something so sweet. I’ll end up loving you even more.</p>
<p>While talking and patrolling, Hiiragi-chan walked away from any sign of other people. Over here, there aren’t any students that live in these rooms. We proceeded down the halls and over a bridge, over to an unrelated building.</p>
<p>Nearby, there was a small break room, and across a large glass barrier, there was a beautifully arranged courtyard. In order to take in the view, we sat down on a sofa and held our hands like that silently for a while. Hiiragi-chan then set leaned her head against my shoulder.</p>
<p>While not completely sober yet, I could feel the heat from her ears and cheek transmitted through the yukata. The lights were all gone now, with a little bit of the silver moonlight now shining through. Nnnnnnn… the vending machine in the background was making a small groaning sound.</p>
<p>“… You know, this place is really nice, and I was always thinking of coming here with you Seiji-kun.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know anything about how good or bad the garden was. However, now I couldn’t help but stare at it. It seems like how you see it changes depending on the person you’re with. Then, we spoke to each other quietly. Events that happened today. I thought that, oh, I thought this… It was truly a meaningless conversation.</p>
<p>“One year and ten months more.”</p>
<p>“Until I graduate?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. And well, it’s somehow a little bit sad. Secretly sneaking notes in the staff room, feeding each other bentous, or kissing each other in the preparation room. That won’t happen anymore.”</p>
<p>Last time when I graduated, all I could do was look at Hiiragi-chan from afar, without even asking for her contact information and without expressing my feelings to her. I have come to the realization that if you put in your thoughts and effort, your life can change.</p>
<p>“That’s true, but if it’s the weekend, we can see each other, right?”</p>
<p>“This and that are different things. If Hiiragi-sensei doesn’t have Seiji-kun, she won’t be able to do her best…”</p>
<p>“A hard working Haruka-san is something I like.”</p>
<p>“I… will do my best!”</p>
<p>I wonder if it’s alright to be so easily satisfied… I mean, that part of her is cute too.</p>
<p>Let’s try to tell her something that I’ve been thinking about for a while now. It’s a somewhat serious conversation. If it’s now, I should be able to say it.</p>
<p>“Haruka-san, you had said that after I graduated, there was no need for me to work, or continue with school, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ll care for you.”</p>
<p>“About that though, I think I will work.”</p>
<p>“Eh, why’s that? It’s fine, there’s no need to push yourself.”</p>
<p>It really isn’t me pushing myself. That’s what I try to express as I explain further.</p>
<p>“You’re doing your best as teacher even though it’s hard work, right? Me too, I would like to try my best in something for your sake.”</p>
<p>“And that would be a job?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right.”</p>
<p>“That’s quite a mature thing to say… even though you’re just in your second year of highschool…”</p>
<p>Surprised, Hiiragi-chan blinked multiple times. As an adult on the inside, I believe that I understand what it means to be working a job.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that it’s good just to push all the troublesome things onto Haruka-san. Besides, if I introduce myself to your parents, then wouldn’t it be bad if I’m seen as unemployed.”</p>
<p>“Uuuuu, you’re still a high school student with lots of options for the future though…”</p>
<p>Whining a little bit, Hiiragi-chan was on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry.”</p>
<p>“But I’m so happy… that you’ve been thinking about our future together…”</p>
<p>Fumiii, and in a strange way, she lets her tears fall. However, if I don’t say this properly, my life will end up being a grey almost cattle-like life. I would think that if it’s for the person that I love, then I should be able to do my best while doing a boring job.</p>
<p>Gusu gusu, after blowing her nose, HIiragi-chan wiped her tears.</p>
<p>“It’s something that I wish I could do… but if Seiji-kun says something like that, it’s okay if I give up on it. It’s just my own selfish wish after all…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… If you’re going to work anyways, why don’t we end up working together?”</p>
<p>“Hmmm? Together?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. If you graduate and go to college, you can become a teacher. Then Seiji-kun can return to your alma mater.”</p>
<p>“Haa… a teacher… Haa!?”</p>
<p>“I mean, you’re smart… and I just thought that if you were going to work, than it might be nice to work together… Then, it can be like a workplace marriage.”</p>
<p>“If I were to do that, would you be able to wait until then…?”</p>
<p>When I graduate from high school, with the patience that she’s had until now, it seems like a limiter would be released at that point in time.</p>
<p>“I-I can wait. …Ah, but, marrying while you’re still at school, is also something that might be possible… maybe…”</p>
<p>She was immediately shaken!?</p>
<p>“Well, apart from whether I should or should not become a teacher, let’s think about it. Together.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Together.”</p>
<p>Kotsun, we bump our foreheads together and kissed. When I opened my eyes Hiiragi-chan was looking at me, and I somehow became embarrassed and the two of us ended up laughing at each other. Until it became bright outside, the two of us flirted and stuck together just like this.</p>
<p><em>At a later date.</em></p>
<p>The mugs from the ceramics workshop arrived at school. The finishing touches made for this second time turned out pretty well. Borrowing a ribbon from the home economics room, I decorated it like a present. During lunch break, I put it in a paper bag, and brought it to the world history preparation room.</p>
<p>“… Sensei. I have something I want to give you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Me too, I have something to give to Sanada-kun.”</p>
<p>As planned, it was a harmonious present exchange. Still, she was pleased.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’ll treasure it!”</p>
<p>Hugging the paper bag, she showed her best smile.</p>
