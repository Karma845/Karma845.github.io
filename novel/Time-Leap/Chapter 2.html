<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; We are Now Dating</h3>


<p>[Thank you very much!! Thank you for the message!!]</p>
<p>After replying to the message, it was about seven o’clock in the evening before a reply came back.</p>
<p>[Take care of me as well ♪ I also said this after school today, but texting during school is forbidden alright? Promise?]</p>
<p>If it came from another teacher, it might have felt like a nosy warning, but for some reason when it’s from Hiiragi-chan it makes me happy…</p>
<p>[Then, does that mean calling is okay?] I sent her a bit of a joking message.</p>
<p>When I did, I immediately got a reply.</p>
<p>[Playing around with my words is also banned.]</p>
<p>Ah~. Ah~. This is bad. Her reactions are also cute.</p>
<p>Fuheh, fuheheh</p>
<p>A strange laughter leaked out.</p>
<p>“What are you laughing at?”</p>
<p>My mother, who was at the dining hall, looked at me suspiciously.</p>
<p>“I-it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>After I finished eating dinner, I returned to my room and thought about what to write as a reply. Suddenly, the question that I first came up with came to mind.</p>
<p>[Why did you say okay? I did confess to you though.]</p>
<p>[My heart went doki when you held my hand. I was really happy. Also, seeing you work so hard was cute ♡]</p>
<p>[I’m so happy my nose bled.]</p>
<p>[That’s not good! You need to give the back of your neck a light tap!]</p>
<p>[Because it was an okay, you recorded your address into my contacts?]</p>
<p>[Yeah ♡]</p>
<p>I can’t. Just one heart emoji causes my happiness gauge to fly away.</p>
<p>[If this is found out, wouldn’t it be quite dangerous?]</p>
<p>[Eh? Why is that?]</p>
<p>Why… well, a teacher going out with a student, a teacher doing this and that with their student wouldn’t be good, right? I mean, isn’t it not allowed? Even I know that a teacher shouldn’t be personally messaging their students, that’s not right, right? Isn’t it also wrong for you to record your mail address onto a phone that’s been confiscated?</p>
<p>Considering the risk of a teacher like Hiiragi-chan actually going out with a student, ignoring the fact that I confessed, Hiiragi-chan should have refused.</p>
<p>[If it’s found out, you might have to quit school and you won’t be able to be a teacher, right…?]</p>
<p>[Ah, I see.]</p>
<p>I see… that’s so casual.</p>
<p>[But still, it can’t be helped. Having my heart go doki and the feeling of electricity running through me, I ended up liking you ♡]</p>
<p>Ended up—?</p>
<p>Liking me—?</p>
<p>♡ —!?!?</p>
<p>It can’t be helped. If she puts a ♡ then it can’t be helped. If she ended up liking me then it can’t be helped. In order to accept all of Hiiragi-chan, I’ll give her my 100%. Risk and the other stuff. Common sense can go to hell. No, but, wait a moment. Calm down me.</p>
<p>There is a need to reduce the risk of getting caught to zero. It seems that Hiiragi-chan’s common sense is a little bit fluffy. I have to hold firm here.</p>
<p>[Let’s decide on rules. At school, we won’t meet alone.]</p>
<p>[Eh~!? Since texting is banned, if we can’t do that we can’t talk, right?]</p>
<p>This teacher, she planned on being along together and flirting at school…!?</p>
<p>[Withdrawn. It’s alright to meet alone at school.]</p>
<p>I have a reputation of taking things back after all.</p>
<p>[Rooggeeerrr.]</p>
<p>[However, since it seems that putting brakes on the whole thing is not possible, we will meet somewhere during the 10 minute break period, and only once.]</p>
<p>[Eh. What about lunch break!? That’s the main event!?]</p>
<p>[That’s a little… If we meet for long periods, we might be suspected.]</p>
<p>[Muuu. Sanada is quite a serious person. I always make a bentou for lunch, so don’t I have to make an extra one now?]</p>
<p>Ah. I understand. Hiiragi-chan, aren’t you a bit of an useless adult. If I want to keep our romantic relationship, I need to protect Hiiragi-chan. What’s inside of me is older than Hiiragi-chan at least. I must have everything together at least.</p>
<p>[I’m happy for the bentou. But, there isn’t any place to eat it, is there? A teacher eating bentou with her student every day, that’s really suspicious.]</p>
<p>[Inside the World History Preparation Room. I’m the teacher managing it after all ♡]</p>
<p>!? … C-calm down me. I</p>
<p>…I-I have to keep firm.</p>
<p>[Really?]</p>
<p>[Yeah ♪ Before fifth period starts, sometimes other history teachers will come. But, I have a strong grasp on what days those will be ☆]</p>
<p>[Then during lunch, on days other than those?]</p>
<p>[No one will come, you know?]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[For side dishes, I like karaage.]</p>
<p>At this time, my common sense has completely died.</p>
<p>[Understood. I’ll put it in tomorrow ♡]</p>
<p>It sunk. It’s already impossible. I couldn’t resist the temptation. Anything is fine now. Secretly being alone with Hiiragi-chan, eating bentous that Hiiragi-chan made, there’s no way I would miss such a dreamlike situation.</p>
<p>I immediately told my mother that I didn’t need a bentou tomorrow. I made up a suitable reason to go along with it.</p>
