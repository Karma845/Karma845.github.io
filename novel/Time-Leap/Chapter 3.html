<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Secretly Written Notes</h3>


<p><em>The next day.</em></p>
<p>I immediately used my one tryst in the morning. Even though I say it’s a tryst, it was just that I was going to the staff room to see Hiiragi-chan, that’s all.</p>
<p>When I entered and looked over at her desk though, she wasn’t there. That’s weird. Since I didn’t say I was coming to see her, it can’t be helped that she’s not there, I guess?</p>
<p>“Wah!”</p>
<p>“Nuwah!?”</p>
<p>I was so surprised… Turning to look behind me, my angel, Hiiragi-chan, was there. It seemed like she was returning from class as she was holding a collection of history textbooks and materials. However, rather than looking like a teacher, she looked more like a 24 year old girl with that teasing smile of hers.</p>
<p>… Dammit, so cute.</p>
<p>“Were you surprised?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was very surprised.”</p>
<p>“Is there <em>something you don’t understand</em>?”</p>
<p>“Ummm, yeah that’s it”</p>
<p>“Come in come in”, she said. It was if she was bringing me into her room. Hiiragi-chan then sat me down by her desk. She opened up the world history textbook and began a personal lesson.</p>
<p>“On the 21st page….”</p>
<p>While giving a random explanation of the textbook, she wrote something on the back of the printout.</p>
<p>[Isn’t this so exciting?]</p>
<p>Hey. You 24-year-old. What are you doing being so excited in the staff room during lunch? I’ll hug you, you know?</p>
<p>“Aah, I see.”</p>
<p>I gave a suitable response. Acting like I was taking notes, while writing a response.</p>
<p>[Today, you&#8217;re wearing a skirt.]</p>
<p>“They’re foreign words, so the names of people and places are hard to remember but…”</p>
<p>She was seriously explaining the textbook with her mouth, but her ballpoint pen was writing a completely different thing.</p>
<p>[Does it suit me?]</p>
<p>[It’s cute.]</p>
<p>“Mou, that’s a little bit unfair…”</p>
<p>She whispered that in a small voice. Hiiragi-chan was seriously embarrassed as her mouth loosened.</p>
<p>She then gave my arms a small poke.</p>
<p>“Making another surprise attack like that again…”</p>
<p>While seeming angry in a joking way, she pulled out some manjuus from a drawer underneath.</p>
<p>“The manjuus have come out again?”</p>
<p>“Eh. You don’t like it? Yesterday, you seemed so happy, so I bought some more…”</p>
<p>“No. I love them.”</p>
<p>“That’s great.”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan, it seems like you’re completely spoiling me. At this rate, the manjuus will probably come out tomorrow again.</p>
<p>A teacher across from us was staring at us.</p>
<p>“Umm… Would you like some too, Sakai-sensei?”</p>
<p>She offered some manjuus to my homeroom teacher, Sakai.</p>
<p>“Sorry. Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>He was in charge of teaching math, wore black glasses, and was past his 30’s.</p>
<p>“Sanada, let me tell you this. Manjuus and personal lessons…”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Hiiragi-sensei. There aren’t a lot of chances to be taught like this by a beautiful teacher like her.”</p>
<p>Ah, ahahah, to the old man’s special flattery, Hiiragi-chan gave forced smile.</p>
<p>[Are you bad with Sakai?]</p>
<p>[Ah, I got found out?]</p>
<p>With her eyes laughing, she restarted the fake lesson. As she did that, Hiiragi-chan put my hand on top of her lap.</p>
<p>Hey. You 24-year-old. What are you doing secretly holding your students hand in the staff room? I’ll hug you, you know? I also faced my palm up and grasped her hand back.</p>
<p>[Isn’t this exciting?]</p>
<p>The excitement from doing something that we weren’t supposed to do, the excitement of possibly being found out. Also, the excitement of holding hands with the person you like.</p>
<p>These various feelings mixed within my head so that I couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>“Your face, it’s red you know?”</p>
<p>Kusu, Hiiragi-chan giggled like a small demon as she teased me.</p>
<p>Even though you’re a little red yourself!!</p>
