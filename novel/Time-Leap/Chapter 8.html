<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Career Survey</h3>


<p>One day during lunch break.</p>
<p>Just like usual, I entered the world history preparation room while being wary of my surroundings. I didn’t go the the staff room this morning, so this would be my first time meeting Hiiragi-chan today. Hiiragi-chan normally would have said, thank you for your hard work, but she instead faced me while looking like she was in a bad mood.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>There were bentous for two people set on top of the table, and next to Hiiragi-chan my seat was placed on standby.</p>
<p>“Earlier, I fished this off of Sakai-sensei’s desk.”</p>
<p>Sakai-sensei is my homeroom teacher.</p>
<p>“Heeh. Wait, don’t snoop around other people’s desks!”</p>
<p>“He was in class anyways, and the staff room was basically empty.”</p>
<p>“That’s a reason!?”</p>
<p>“I had something that I was curious about, so I did a little bit of investigating.”</p>
<p>It was quite a self-righteous statement that she made. Please someone teach Hiiragi-chan about the general manners of society. As a student, I believe that the teacher should lead by example.</p>
<p>Regardless, what did she want to investigate on my homeroom teacher’s desk…?</p>
<p>“Then, sensei, what did you find out?”</p>
<p>“It’s not Sensei, it’s Haruka-san when we’re alone, right?”</p>
<p>Busubusu, Hiiragi-chan pokes my cheek with her finger. As expected, when she’s pouting it’s cute.</p>
<p>“The reason that I’m in a bad mood, do you not know, Seiji-kun?”</p>
<p>While talking about how she was in a bad mood, she didn’t forget to continue feeding me the bentou. Today, what I was being fed was the same karaage as before. It’s really good.</p>
<p>“Did I do something?”</p>
<p>“Doing something like that, I think it’s a little bit awful.”</p>
<p>“Awful? I didn’t do anything like that.”</p>
<p>Doing something that would make Hiiragi-chan sad would make me guilty. It’s a rule that I swore in my heart. Did I do something which I thought was alright, but it was really not?</p>
<p>“Ah. Did you not like it when I talked to the other girls in class?”</p>
<p>I say talk, but it was only to the extent of saying stuff like, “Ah, it seems like it’s now a self-study period”, or “Ah, thank you”.</p>
<p>“If it’s only a high school girl, I won’t get jealous of her.”</p>
<p>After her say it out loud I muttered to myself in a small voice, “… of course”.</p>
<p>“Besides, there’s no way a second-year high school girl would be able to draw you away, right? I mean, I’m a college graduate and I also have a teacher’s license. I’m a hundred times better.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you focus on?”</p>
<p>It seems talking about a high school girls made Hiiragi-chan frustrated enough to bring out societal standings.</p>
<p>“Mukii”</p>
<p>She said it outloud. It seems like what she’s angry about is something else entirely…</p>
<p>“It’s alright, it’s alright. Haruka-san has a lot of good points.”</p>
<p>“Uuu~. Even if you try and avoid it like that…”</p>
<p>As I comfort her by patting her head, her expression becomes softer and softer.</p>
<p>“I, Hiiragi Haruka, am mad at you Seiji-kun…”</p>
<p>Her face wasn’t convincing at all.</p>
<p>“Haruka-san, isn’t it about time you told me? Why are you mad?”</p>
<p>She rummaged around in her bag until she fished out a single sheet printout. With it in her hand, she slammed it down on the table with a loud sound as if challenging me to a duel.</p>
<p>[Career Survey Second Year Class B Sanada Seiji]</p>
<p>It was the career survey that I had turned into to my homeroom teacher before this.</p>
<p>“??”</p>
<p>Ignoring me, who had many questions come up in my head, she spread it out in front of me.</p>
<p>“Look at this. Do you still intend to act dumb?”</p>
<p>In her angry mode, Hiiragi-chan pointed with her finger at what I had wrote for my first and second choices.</p>
<p>My first choice was a local public university, while my second choice was a private university. By the way, I ended up going to the university that I wrote in as my second choice for four years in the future.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by acting dumb? Isn’t it normal? Didn’t I do it properly? It isn’t even the summer of my second year, it’s normal for me to write a few schools I’m interested in.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that! Why are you going to college?”</p>
<p>“Why is that… well, it’s basically a bureaucratic society after all. There isn’t anything else that I want to do in particular either.”</p>
<p>“Even if you go to college, there isn’t much meaning to it. I guarantee it.”</p>
<p>“What do you guarantee? Well, it’s true that when I went there I didn’t take my classes seriously and instead ended up doing part-time work all the time.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t take classes seriously and did part-time jobs…?”</p>
<p>“Ah… it’s something that I hear often.”</p>
<p>The things that I happened to be thinking about leaked out of my mouth. After taking a skeptical looking at my face, Hiiragi-chan gave a nod, apparently convinced by my cover up.</p>
<p>“That’s right. College is a scary place. It’s a hellish world made only for the enjoyment of riajuus [1]. There are also a lot of mean girls. It isn’t a place where Seiji-kun should go.”</p>
<p>I agree with the part about the enjoyment of riajuus. It seems like Hiiragi-chan wanted to talk about how scary college is to make me have a bad impression of going to college.</p>
<p>“Even if you graduate, you’re only receiving the title of being a college graduate.”</p>
<p>“Let’s stop talking about real life.”</p>
<p>Me going to college, does Hiiragi-chan not like it?</p>
<p>“Ah, I got it. Me going to a place where you can’t reach, are you worried?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Not at all.”</p>
<p>“You won’t?”</p>
<p>“I won’t lose to a girl with no skill. I’m great at cooking after all.”</p>
<p>“Then, what is it? What are you mad at?”</p>
<p>“I told you that I would take care of you, then why are you going to college!? Seiji-kun, all you need to do is be dependent on me!”</p>
<p>The point of her anger is completely opposite from normal! Having a boyfriend being completely dependent and not working is something you should be sad and/or mad at. I’m doing things properly, and yet, it seems like I made her mad.</p>
<p>“As such, all you needed to write at the time was husband ♪.”</p>
<p>She erased the words on the printout. Then, she used a mechanical pencil and wrote [Husband ♡] in large words.</p>
<p>“I’ll anger the homeroom teacher if I wrote that!”</p>
<p>The second choice was written as [Help out with housework].</p>
<p>“That’s basically a NEET!”</p>
<p>The third choice was [A luxurious unemployed life].</p>
<p>“That’s also another way to call a NEET!”</p>
<p>Mou! Hiiragi-chan, whether she was annoyed at me or the retorts I was making, hit the desk.</p>
<p>“To be honest, it would still be better to not put down that you want to be dependent!”</p>
<p>“A complete change!?”</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped because it’s you, Seiji-kun…”</p>
<p>She erased everything that was written.</p>
<p>“You won’t have any complaints if it’s this, right?”, as she rewrote it.</p>
<p>[A groom]</p>
<p>“It got even worse!”</p>
<p>There’s a little bit of cuteness when a girl writes something like that, but for a boy, no one would think that. I stole back the printout, and rewrote my original choices. Muu, Hiiragi-chan looked at me with a dissatisfied face.</p>
<p>“Since this school is a pretty technical school. I need to write something like I’m going to college despite what I really want. This way, the homeroom teacher can’t complain.”</p>
<p>“Eh… Seiji-kun, you’re a genius!”</p>
<p>Well well, I got her to accept it.</p>
<p>“Sanada-kun? From now on, don’t sadden your teacher like this. Okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I got it.”</p>
<p>After suddenly switching to her teacher mode, Hiiragi-chan faced me, closed her eyes, and stuck out her lips.</p>
<p>“Nn…”</p>
<p>“We’re in school…”</p>
<p>“… quickly.”</p>
<p>After closing the open curtain, I gave her a kiss.</p>
<p>“This is the last time we do this in school, okay?”</p>
<p>“Eh. Why so strict…?”</p>
<p>It’s because it’ll escalate. Probably.</p>
<p>“One more time.”</p>
<p>“I was saying…”</p>
<p>“Nn ♡”</p>
<p>In this way, Hiiragi-chan and I continued to make out.</p>
