<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; Pool 2</h3>

<p class="calibre4">“Haru-chan, you really won’t leave Thief-kun’s side at all… you’re completely stuck to him.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Eh? Really? Isn’t it always like this?”</p><p class="calibre4">For me, it was also pretty normal, so until Natsumi-chan mentioned it, I didn’t notice it at all. It’s true though, she was clinging on to me.</p><p class="calibre4">Since we were tired from playing around, we bought yakisoba and takoyaki and were now eating it together at the poolside.</p><p class="calibre4">“I should’ve made some bentous for us…”</p><p class="calibre4">“This is also part of the experience, Haru-chan. It’s cheapness of it that makes it so good.”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan tilted her head while questioning that.</p><p class="calibre4">In terms of the quality of the yakisoba and the takoyaki, it could be better. However it’s true that buying it in this way feels easier.</p><p class="calibre4">After standing up, I went to go throw out the trash, and as I turned the corner, I bumped into someone.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ouch!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Kyahn”</p><p class="calibre4">“Sorry. Are you… okay…?”</p><p class="calibre4">In front of me, Sana was there, sitting down on her butt.</p><p class="calibre4">“N-n-n-no it’s, my bad…”</p><p class="calibre4">Her shy mode in full throttle, she looked away from me. She was wearing a swimsuit that revealed her unblemished body.</p><p class="calibre4">Why is she here…!? Ah, if I remember correctly, she did say she was going out today…</p><p class="calibre4">Just as I was about to turn my back towards her, Sana took a sidelong glance at me and noticed.</p><p class="calibre4">“Nii-san?”</p><p class="calibre4">“You’ve got the wrong person…”</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s Nii-san isn’t it? The mole on your back, it’s the same one as Nii-san’s.”</p><p class="calibre4">Resigning myself, I stopped my feet.</p><p class="calibre4">“What are you doing here?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Sana is here, hanging out with Kana-chan. What about Nii-san? What are you doing here when you don’t even have friends?”</p><p class="calibre4">“What you said there was definitely an exaggeration.”</p><p class="calibre4">That’s right, I can technically say that Fujimoto is my friend. He’s just barely over that line though. Ah, this is bad. I came with Hiiragi-chan and Natsumi-chan. Considering Hiiragi-chan, she didn’t bring anything for a disguise&mdash;no, wait. I can just act as if I coincidentally met the Hiiragi sisters while I was here.</p><p class="calibre4">“W-who did you come with…? There’s no way you came alone, right…?”</p><p class="calibre4">Sana looked at me with squinted eyes, as if doubting me.</p><p class="calibre4">“T-that’s how it is though? I thought I would go out swimming on my own.”</p><p class="calibre4">“H-hmmm… since Nii-san seems quite pitiful… as an exception, Sana will allow you to join us, okay? It’s an exception, just an exception.”</p><p class="calibre4">At this point, I really don’t know if I can say that Sana was nice, or not. However, I have to stay firm and refuse here.</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s fine. I’ll take your thoughts though.”</p><p class="calibre4">“D-don’t just accept the thoughts. It wasn’t meant in that weird way anyways, okay?”</p><p class="calibre4">Why is her face turning red?</p><p class="calibre4">“Thief-kun, what are you doing? Haru-chan is&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre4">Uuooooh!? In this situation, the most annoying person ended up coming!? It was a chance meeting between the younger sisters.</p><p class="calibre4">Looking at Sana, Natsumi-chan gave me a cold look.</p><p class="calibre4">“Who is this?”</p><p class="calibre4">“How…. H-how…. H-how about you? W-who are you…?”</p><p class="calibre4">Sana activated her shyness, and started speaking politely. During which, she moved to hide behind me.</p><p class="calibre4">“This girl is my little sister… we just happened to bump into each other.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Ah, so that’s what it was. That’s a relief.”</p><p class="calibre4">Natsumi-chan’s smile returned.</p><p class="calibre4">She definitely misunderstood and thought I was cheating, right?</p><p class="calibre4">“Nii-san, this girl with a bad mouth, who is she? Didn’t you come alone…?”</p><p class="calibre4">With my eyes, I tried signaling to Natsumi-chan.</p><p class="calibre4">I was trying to make sure that she knew that we couldn’t let anyone else know of my relationship with Hiiragi-chan. She winked back at me twice as a signal of confirmation.</p><p class="calibre4">“I’m a third year at Shinjoukan Woman’s High School, Hiiragi Natsumi.”</p><p class="calibre4">Natsumi-chan had assumed the air of a refined lady, as she brushed her hair off her shoulders. Since she wasn’t normally this sort of character, I can somehow understand that she was just putting up an act.</p><p class="calibre4">“Shinjoukan… it’s where all those rich ladies go… Sanada Sana… N-nice to meet you. S-sana goes to… Hasumori High School… the same as Nii-san. It’s my first year…”</p><p class="calibre4">While faltering multiple times, Sana was finally able to finish her self-introduction.</p><p class="calibre4">Nice nice, before, she wouldn’t have been able to greet anyone she was meeting for the first time, nor could she talk properly. She really has grown a lot… Though her chest hasn’t grown at all.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ummm, Natsumi-chan is Hiiragi-sensei’s sister. It seems that the two of them came here together today. And so, after coming alone to swim, I ended up bumping into them.”</p><p class="calibre4">What a coincidence, hahahaha, as I let out a laugh, Sana started to look at Natsumi-chan, who responded with her own fire.</p><p class="calibre4">“I see… With an intruder detecting infrared sensor like little sister like this, it’s no wonder that Thief-kun can’t get a girlfriend. Haru-chan really has it tough…”</p><p class="calibre4">“W-who are you calling an infrared sensor!?” This time, it was Hiiragi-chan who came, “Ah, it’s Sana-chan! Hello. What are you doing today? Did you come with Ii-san?”</p><p class="calibre4">As Hiiragi-chan was walking, the parts that should be shaking continued to shake, causing Sana to shake.</p><p class="calibre4">“W-what’s with that… Sensei… breasts… Eh. No way…”</p><p class="calibre4">Sana touched her own chest.</p><p class="calibre4">No matter how many times you touch it, Sana, I’m sorry to say, but what isn’t there won’t be there. You’re breasts remain flat, paved over by a barren land, unable to allow for even a single weed to grow…</p><p class="calibre4">“Yeah, Imouto-chan, I also understand your feelings…”</p><p class="calibre4">Natsumi-chan also depressingly dropped her shoulders.</p><p class="calibre4">The sisters had faces that looked similar, but their bodies were not similar at all.</p><p class="calibre4">“Umm. Sana was planning on meeting up with Kana-chan later… currently, Sana is alone though…”</p><p class="calibre4">“You’re currently alone?”</p><p class="calibre4">“I-it has nothing to do with Nii-san…”</p><p class="calibre4">While pouting, she looked the other way.</p><p class="calibre4">And here she was thinking that I was the one who was lonely. This girl…</p><p class="calibre4">“If Sana-chan wants to, why don’t you come hangout with us?”</p><p class="calibre4">As if she understood my intentions, Hiiragi-chan invited Sana to join us.</p><p class="calibre4">After meeting my eyes with hers, Hiiragi-chan made a small smile. She really understands what it is that I want to do.</p><p class="calibre4">“If you’re fine with it, then it’s okay…”</p><p class="calibre4">“If Haru-chan is okay with it, then Imouto-chan should also come. Let’s play!”</p><p class="calibre4">Kaku kaku kaku, Sana nodded as if she was a tin toy. [1]</p><p class="calibre4">She’s probably not used to hanging out like this. I mean, if I were in her position, I would probably be nervous as well.</p><p class="calibre4">Natsumi-chan grabbed Sana’s hand as she walked away. During this, Hiiragi-chan looked over the two of them with a smile.</p><p class="calibre4">“Isn’t that great, Sana-chan?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Sorry about this. It was our precious pool time too.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Don’t apologize. I know that Seiji-kun is a nice brother that cares for his little sister. That makes me happy to know that.”</p><p class="calibre4">The two of us then followed after Sana and Natsumi.</p><p class="calibre4">“Caring for my little sister makes you happy?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Rather than caring for your little sister, it’s more that seeing you cherish your family in that way makes you more likeable.”</p><p class="calibre4">I don’t really understand it very well, but I guess that’s how it is.</p><p class="calibre4">We arrived at the water slide. It had quite a bit of height, and was the type with lots of different twists and turns. If there were a lot of people, there would probably be a decently long wait, but today, we were able to use it without anytime waiting. It was one where you go down in pairs while riding a vinyl boat.</p><p class="calibre4">“We… should split up among siblings… that would be good, right…?”</p><p class="calibre4">Sana came closer to me, and smoothly grabbed onto my arm.</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan, on the other hand, made a slightly sad expression.</p><p class="calibre4">“What are you saying? We should group up as little sisters!”</p><p class="calibre4">Oooh, good one, nice thinking.</p><p class="calibre4">After I gave a push to Sana, Natsumi-chan grabbed onto her.</p><p class="calibre4">“T-this is the first time we met. We can’t go down together. It’s embarrassing.”</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s not embarrassing. It’s okay, it’s okay. I’ll be gentle ♪”</p><p class="calibre4">“Sana feels her chastity is in danger.”</p><p class="calibre4">It’s not in danger. You’re just going down the slide, what are you even imagining.</p><p class="calibre4">Natsumi-chan was grinning from ear to ear.</p><p class="calibre4">“Aaah, I see, I see. Then Imouto-chan wants to slide down with her beloved Onii-chan, right? I’m sorry about that, I can’t really read the mood very well.”</p><p class="calibre4">“F-fuun. It’s not that Sana wants to do it with Nii-san. There’s no way that’s the case. It’s just that Nii-san seemed like he wanted it like that, so Sana just made the suggestion first.”</p><p class="calibre4">“If it’s not true, then isn’t it fine. Just come with me!”</p><p class="calibre4">Firmly grabbing onto Sana’s thin arms, Natsumi-chan began to pull Sana along. Natsumi-chan was totally aiming for this. Such a sly person… However, as long as she’s our ally, it really puts my heart at ease.</p><p class="calibre4">With eyes that seemed to say that she felt betrayed and sold out, Sana stared at me, but with Natsumi-chan’s pressuring, she was pushed onto the vinyl boat. Kyaah, Natsumi’s enjoyable scream could be heard, overlapping with Sana’s real scream.</p><p class="calibre4">Uwah. That’s quite some speed…</p><p class="calibre4">The person in running the attraction then gave us a brief explanation, “Please sit down and hold on tight.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Seiji-kun, which do you want? The front or the back?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Let’s see…”</p><p class="calibre4">If I were to sit in front and brace myself while sitting… those weapons, those breasts would definitely touch my back. It’ll become something that’s not just about the water slide.</p><p class="calibre4">“Okay, I’ll be in the back.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Understood ♪”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan sat down at the front of the boat, and I sat down just behind her. The person running the attraction then told me to hold on tighter, so I hesitantly did as I was told. We were stuck quite close together. It was to the point where Hiiragi-chan’s butt was touching between my thighs.</p><p class="calibre4">I failed! Like this, I fear Hiiragi-chan might be able to notice the changes within me! Holding my hands firmly, Hiiragi-chan spoke quietly to me.</p><p class="calibre4">“Since it’s a water slide… even if there was some sort of, <em class="calibre5">accident</em>, then Sensei won’t get mad, okay? There’s nothing to worry about.”</p><p class="calibre4">Accident…? What the heck? Just as I was tilting my head in wonder, the person running the attraction gave us a push, and all of a sudden, we started sliding down.</p><p class="calibre4">Uooooh, it’s faster than I thought it would be!? If it’s like this, no wonder they were screaming earlier. My hands that were grabbing on tight, began to slip and move out of position.</p><p class="calibre4">This is bad, I might fall of the boat. However, I was somehow able to grab on to Hiiragi-chan.</p><p class="calibre4">Funi.</p><p class="calibre4">What?</p><p class="calibre4">Funi funi.</p><p class="calibre4">T-this feeling&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!?</p><p class="calibre4">“Fuguu…”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan is writhing in embarrassment!?</p><hr class="calibre6" /><p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre2">*censored*</p><p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p><hr class="calibre6" /><p class="calibre4">Ah. Am I going to die to day? The moment I thought that, zabaaan, I was thrown out into the water.</p><p class="calibre4">Poking my head out of the water, I couldn’t find Hiiragi-chan.</p><p class="calibre4">Where is she…? Ah, she’s probably by the flipped over boat.</p><p class="calibre4">After diving down and moving in that direction, I found her there, just as I thought.</p><p class="calibre4">“Fuguu… Seiji-kun did so many things to me…”</p><p class="calibre4">While remember everything that happened, she covered her face with both hands.</p><p class="calibre4">“Well. About that, sorry. About half of it was an accident… the other half, I believe was something that was unavoidable as a living being.”</p><p class="calibre4">“The accident part was okay… B-but, I didn’t think the accident would continue for that long. Even I was surprised… next time, Seiji-kun’s in front!”</p><p class="calibre4">“Y-yeah… About my general, I’ll do my best to hold it back…”</p><p class="calibre4">For the next time, her breasts ended up hitting me in the back a lot.</p><p class="calibre4">As for my general… as expected, I couldn’t do anything about it.</p>
