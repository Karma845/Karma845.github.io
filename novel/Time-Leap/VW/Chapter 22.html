<h3>Chapter 22 &#8211; Summer Festival 2</h3>

<p class="calibre4">After having a flirting break in the dark, I walked around with Hiiragi-chan, aka Red, to look for a quiet place where the fireworks could be seen easily.</p><p class="calibre4">“Hmmm, there are couples everywhere.”</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s to be expected, everyone’s probably thinking the same thing.”</p><p class="calibre4">Yeah, Red chuckled to herself. She was holding a cup of lemon-flavored shaved ice as she brought a spoonful of it to the mask’s mouth, only to have it spill all over it.</p><p class="calibre4">“Aauu. I messed up again.”</p><p class="calibre4">It seems Red has gotten completely used to the mask and sometimes forgets that it’s there.</p><p class="calibre4">As it got closer to the start time for the fireworks, the number of people around rapidly increased. If we were to lose each other, it would probably be a pain to find each other.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ah. Nii-san!”</p><p class="calibre4">Ugeh, Sana!? Wearing yukatas, Sana and Kanata appeared directly in front of us.</p><p class="calibre4">Looking at Hiiragi-chan, she once again had the spoon crash into the mask. She once again failed to eat. A-alright… if she stays as Red, then it probably won’t be found out. Panicking, I covered my face with the clown mask that was on top of my head.</p><p class="calibre4">“Nii-san still came in the end.”</p><p class="calibre4">“No. I’m just a clown.”</p><p class="calibre4">“… Nii-san, it’s kind of late for that, you know? ”</p><p class="calibre4">“… Seiji-kun, you can’t escape Saa-chan with that level of a disguise.”</p><p class="calibre4">I accepted that and returned the mask to the top of my head.</p><p class="calibre4">“Rather, Sana, you still ended up coming. Even though you said you weren’t going to come.”</p><p class="calibre4">“K-Kana-chan said she wanted to go, so Sana is just accompanying her…”</p><p class="calibre4">That’s what she said, but it’s probably the opposite in reality…</p><p class="calibre4">“Who’s the woman next to you?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Eh? Aaah, this person is… just a lost Red.”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan nodded along.</p><p class="calibre4">“Lost despite being the leader!?”</p><p class="calibre4">“… That’s so sad.”</p><p class="calibre4">“A-and so, we were just about to look for the other members. I wonder where they got separated…”</p><p class="calibre4">Like a cat that was fully on guard, Kanata continued to stare at Red.</p><p class="calibre4">“… I feel like I’ve seen someone with that body before…”</p><p class="calibre4">As Kanata tried to come around the side to get a closer look, Hiiragi-chan prevented her by holding her arms up in a guard.</p><p class="calibre4">“… As expected of Red… really capable…!”</p><p class="calibre4">What are they doing?</p><p class="calibre4">“W-we were going to go look for a good place to watch the fireworks right now … Nii-san is probably just going to watch alone, right? I’ll let you join us, though?”</p><p class="calibre4">“I’ll have to pass. I more or less have a previous engagement.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Eh… W-with who…? It can’t be&mdash;with Red!?”</p><p class="calibre4">Red fidgeted around with embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre4">“Y-you can’t, Nii-san! Red has to w-watch with the other members!”</p><p class="calibre4">That was just me trying to find an excuse though, there really aren’t any other members.</p><p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it fine? Stop being such a busybody.”</p><p class="calibre4">“… Nii-san, stupid!”</p><p class="calibre4">“… Saa-chan, it’s okay, it’s okay.”</p><p class="calibre4">Kanata patted Sana-chan, who was frowning.</p><p class="calibre4">They really are on such good terms with each other.</p><p class="calibre4">“As such, I’ll be taking the lost Red to the festival’s office&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre4">When I turned around, Red wasn’t there anymore.</p><p class="calibre4">“H-hmmm? Where’s Red?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Ah. You’re right… did she get pulled away by the waves of people…”</p><p class="calibre4">“… Red… became lost again…”</p><p class="calibre4">“S-see you&mdash;!”</p><p class="calibre4">I waved my hand at the two of them, and pushed myself into the crowd.</p><p class="calibre4">Where did she go? She was probably just dazed off eating shaved ice, and then got lost in the crowd. Even when I tried to call her, she didn’t answer the phone. Since her phone was in her bag, it can’t be helped if she didn’t notice.</p><p class="calibre4">Pushing my way through the crowd to search for Red, I arrived at a clearing by the stalls.</p><p class="calibre4">That’s a relief, I found her. However, she was involved with 3 men. C-could this be that, the&mdash;Onee-chan why don’t you come hang out with us&mdash;kind of situation!? I-I have to pull myself together. I’m still an adult. I have to protect Hiiragi-chan.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ummm… this is a little troubling…”</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s fine, right? It’s just for a little bit!”</p><p class="calibre4">This is bad, it’s just like the usual template!</p><p class="calibre4">“But, I’m with someone right now…”</p><p class="calibre4">Red looked very unhappy. I have to do something…!</p><p class="calibre4">“Then, how about until that person comes?”</p><p class="calibre4">“That’s right. We have a lot of time right now.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Just for a little. Really, just for a little bit.”</p><p class="calibre4">In that moment, the three men put on three different kinds of masks.</p><p class="calibre4">“““&mdash;Please become our Red!!”””</p><p class="calibre4">What type of pickup line is that!!</p><p class="calibre4">“I’m Blue!”</p><p class="calibre4">Shakiin, he took a stance by himself.</p><p class="calibre4">“I’m Yellow!”</p><p class="calibre4">The next person went, shakiin, and took his own stance.</p><p class="calibre4">“And I’m&mdash;a clown!”</p><p class="calibre4">Can’t you at least be a color! It seems, she got involved with people that liked special effects. I don’t know about the clown though.</p><p class="calibre4">“Umm, Red is with me. Do you need something?”</p><p class="calibre4">I broke out in between the men and Hiiragi-chan.</p><p class="calibre4">“We just want to act as rangers together.”</p><p class="calibre4">“It just so happens that we’re missing a Red.”</p><p class="calibre4">The clown nodded along. Then he looked at me closely and raised his voice, “Ooooh…! A comrade.” He grabbed my hand firmly.</p><p class="calibre4">Ah. I was mistaken as an friend.</p><p class="calibre4">“No, that’s not it. I just happened to buy this one.”</p><p class="calibre4">As I tried my best to deny it, someone patted my shoulder.</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s okay, it’s okay, there’s no need to be embarrassed.”</p><p class="calibre4">What? Is showing tendencies of liking clowns something to be embarrassed about!? Is it treated like some sort of unpopular minor character!?</p><p class="calibre4">“A-anyways, we were trying to look for a place to watch fireworks when we got separated.”</p><p class="calibre4">“If that’s the case, comrade. Behind the shrine, there’s a narrow path. If you go up that path, you’ll come upon a small observation area. If you go, there probably won’t be anyone there.”</p><p class="calibre4">This clown, he ended up being a character that had important information in advancing the story.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ah. Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Good luck, young clown.”</p><p class="calibre4">“I’m telling you that I’m not a clown!”</p><p class="calibre4">I once again thanked the clown, and pulled Hiiragi-chan along as I began walking.</p><p class="calibre4">“I was really surprised since you suddenly disappeared.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Aaah…I had a lot of incoming messages… Sorry. By the time I noticed, you guys were already gone. ”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan once again held on to my hand, and at the same time linked arms with me.</p><p class="calibre4">“Thank you for earlier. They probably weren’t bad people but… I was quite troubled so you really saved me.”</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s okay. It was good that I helped out before anything weird happened.”</p><p class="calibre4">Kara koro, the sound of Hiiragi-chan’s geta could be heard as we moved away from the hustle and bustle of the festival.</p><p class="calibre4">The shrine itself was quite deserted since the rituals had ended. It was only a few people going in and out of the office area.</p><p class="calibre4">I wonder where the path behind the shrine is?</p><p class="calibre4">“Seiji-kun, isn’t this it?”</p><p class="calibre4">Where Hiiragi-chan was pointing, there was a narrow staircase that might be able to fit one person passing through. To keep from falling, we held hands as the two of us walked upwards. After a while, just like the clown had told us, there was a small observation platform.</p><p class="calibre4">Despite calling it an observation platform, it was really just a small alcove. It was only to the point of having a small roof, wooden table, and maybe a bench for two.</p><p class="calibre4">The lights from the stalls could be seen below, and a starlit sky spread out above. The wind blowing in felt comfortable.</p><p class="calibre4">Sitting down on the bench, we looked around. It didn’t look like anyone was around.</p><p class="calibre4">“This is a great place.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Who was that clown anyways…?”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan, who took off her mask, remembered what happened earlier and laughed to herself.</p><p class="calibre4">“Isn’t he your friend?”</p><p class="calibre4">“No, that’s not true.”</p><p class="calibre4">Ahahah, Hiiragi-chan raised her voice in happiness. She treating it as someone else’s problem.</p><p class="calibre4">While we continued on with such exchanges, the time came for the fireworks to start. Don, the dark night sky was lit up by colorfully blooming flowers.</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s beautiful.”</p><p class="calibre4">How long has it been since I’ve seen fireworks? As I was dazed off thinking about that, Hiiragi-chan closed the distance between us until our shoulders were touching. After I faced the palm of my hand upward, she put her hand on top of mine as if she was waiting for it. Between the fireworks, we secretly kissed each other.</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s absolute, okay?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Eh? What is?”</p><p class="calibre4">“The promise to come back next year… It’s absolute, okay…?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Yeah. I promise.”</p><p class="calibre4">As I hugged Hiiragi-chan, who seemed anxious, she wrapped her arms around my back.</p><p class="calibre4">“Seiji-kun, I love you. I really really love you.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Me too.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Will you say it properly?”</p><p class="calibre4">She firmly grabbed my cheeks and stopped me from escaping. Her mouth was loosened into a satisfied smile.</p><p class="calibre4">No matter how many times I say it, I’ll never get used to it…</p><p class="calibre4">“Haruka-san, I love you.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Fuguu… T-thank you…”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan held her chest down.</p><p class="calibre4">“An embarrassed Seiji-kun is so cute that I want to see it, but if this happens, rather than you being embarrassed, I’m the one who ends up like that…”</p><p class="calibre4">What’s with this person? She’s so cute.</p><p class="calibre4">From start to finish, we were just like this, watching fireworks from the small observation platform where no one came while flirting with each other.</p></div>
