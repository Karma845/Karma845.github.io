<h3>Chapter 27 &#8211; Summer Assignment</h3>

<p class="calibre4">“How is it going?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Umm… well, so so I guess…”</p><p class="calibre4">“I see! Do your best!”</p><p class="calibre4">“… Yeah, thanks…”</p><p class="calibre4">While giving a half-hearted reply, I worked on the problems given for our summer assignment.</p><p class="calibre4">“Coffee? Or would you rather have tea?”</p><p class="calibre4">“For now, I’m okay. Thanks.”</p><p class="calibre4">This situation originated yesterday. I told her that I was going to the library to work on my assignment since my house was hot. Hearing that, Hiiragi-chan offered for me to go to her place to work on it.</p><p class="calibre4">However, does she not need to go to work…?</p><p class="calibre4">“Ah. Seiji-kun, just now you were probably thinking something like, Haruka-san seems so free. Despite how it looks, I’m not free.”</p><p class="calibre4">With a super smug expression, Hiiragi-chan brought out her laptop from her work bag and opened it across from me.</p><p class="calibre4">“Seiji-kun, it’s Sunday, you know?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Aaah… I see.”</p><p class="calibre4">While giving another unenthusiastic answer, I continued to solve my classical literature problems.</p><p class="calibre4">“Your reactions just now were all kind of weak… It makes me quite sad!”</p><p class="calibre4">“Be quiet.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Okay…”</p><p class="calibre4">Pachi pachi, she started hitting on the keys, before jumping into explanation about the work she had as a teacher.</p><p class="calibre4">“Bringing out personal information from school isn’t allowed, but if it’s grading, making problems, or preparing materials and such, then doing it at home is fine.”</p><p class="calibre4">“…”</p><p class="calibre4">“I-I was ignored… that’s quite saddening…”</p><p class="calibre4">The problems consisted of 5 different subjects. Math, classical literature, English, and biology. There’s nothing super troublesome like in elementary school where there were things like self-guided research, drawing pictures, or book reports. However, there was quite a large amount to work on.</p><p class="calibre4">There was a high amount of deviation between scores at our school. As such, just after the holiday there would be a talk about future career paths and there would also be a test on academic ability. At this point, I was thinking that there really weren’t that many great things to return to in the second year of high school.</p><p class="calibre4">Since she was continuing to stare really hard at me, I unconsciously stopped my hand.</p><p class="calibre4">“Is something wrong?”</p><p class="calibre4">“No. I was just thinking that the serious look in your eyes was kind of cool.”</p><p class="calibre4">“R-really…?”</p><p class="calibre4">“That’s right.”</p><p class="calibre4">Speaking of which, there were quite a few times where I also felt the same way about her. For instance, during world history class, as I’m watching her hard at work from my seat.</p><p class="calibre4">“By the way, Seiji-kun, are you good with laptops?”</p><p class="calibre4">“I wouldn’t say I’m an expert at it, but I would say that I’m at an acceptable level.”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan spun her laptop around to face me.</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s about Excel though… I want to do this part of it a little better…”</p><p class="calibre4">Listening to her explanations, it seems that in preparing her materials, she wanted to input data in a certain way.</p><p class="calibre4">“Aah. If it’s that…”</p><p class="calibre4">I returned the laptop to facing Hiiragi-chan and sit down next to her. Then, I begin pointing at the screen in order to give instructions.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ah. It’s done! Seiji-kun, you’re amazing!!”</p><p class="calibre4">“No, I’m not amazing at all. Excel is the one that’s amazing.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Now you’re just being humble.”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan started to teasingly poke my cheek.</p><p class="calibre4">“Stop it.”</p><p class="calibre4">After showing my dislike, she became depressed.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ah… sorry.”</p><p class="calibre4">Ah. This is bad. I might have said that kind of harshly… No, but, I was originally intending to go to the library to work on my assignment today… I came here today because I thought that HIiragi-chan was going to be at school working. It slipped my mind that she could be working at home. I did forget it was Sunday though.</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan started grab at me, like she was a dog that wanted to be paid attention to. If this was in class, I would be really angry.</p><p class="calibre4">“…”</p><p class="calibre4">“…”</p><p class="calibre4">This is awkward…</p><p class="calibre4">In truth, I was going to invite her to hang out at night after finishing up a certain amount of my assignment. No, but, Hiiragi-chan is bothering me too much during my studying. She’s also talking to much. For just a bit… I should have her repent. Just a tiny bit.</p><p class="calibre4">Every time I take glances at her, the depressed Hiiragi-chan seems to wither even further.</p><p class="calibre4">“…”</p><p class="calibre4">“…”</p><p class="calibre4">This is awkward…</p><p class="calibre4">However, I think it’s wrong for me to apologize here… Eh, am I just being stubborn? No, that’s not true. Definitely not. It’s not that I don’t want to apologize.</p><p class="calibre4">I take a glance at her once again, causing my mouth to turn into a frown.</p><p class="calibre4">…</p><p class="calibre4">Still, my way of saying things might be somewhat problematic. Dammit. What’s with this? I can’t concentrate on my questions at all!</p><p class="calibre4">“… I’ll be in the bedroom…. If something happens, just call out to me.”</p><p class="calibre4">With a level of energy lower than ever seen before, Hiiragi-chan grabbed her laptop and disappeared into the bedroom.</p><p class="calibre4">Ugugugugu… This feeling of guilt…! At a time like this, the only person that I can really confide in is Natsumi-chan. However, I don’t really know how to contact her…</p><p class="calibre4">[For a situation like this, is it the acquaintance that’s in the wrong?]</p><p class="calibre4">Explaining the situation from the start, I sent a text as if I was just an acquaintance to the person involved.</p><p class="calibre4">Twenty seconds later, a reply came.</p><p class="calibre4">That was fast.</p><p class="calibre4">Fujimoto is totally free.</p><p class="calibre4">[Aaah, that’s complex! Rather, going to your girlfriend’s house over break to work on your assignment, that person should just die!]</p><p class="calibre4">Ah. This is bad. Fujimoto might once again fall to the darkside. I see though… for a person who doesn’t have a girlfriend, this would be a luxurious worry…</p><p class="calibre4">Last time during the break of my second year of high school, I just did my assignment, and then played RPG’s all day and night. Without even doing anything summer like, I holed up and filled my days with games. In a sense, you could say that’s very much like a summer break. Well, a non-normie’s summer break should be basically that. Thinking along those lines, this times break is already quite fulfilling.</p><p class="calibre4">[The girlfriend is an older beauty I heard.]</p><p class="calibre4">[Please die…]</p><p class="calibre4">Let’s fan the flames a little more.</p><p class="calibre4">[Large breasts, beautiful legs, and a great body to be proud of.]</p><p class="calibre4">[Please die… Who is that guy anyways…]</p><p class="calibre4">It’s me though.</p><p class="calibre4">[He was let into his girlfriend’s place, where she lives alone.]</p><p class="calibre4">[A summer break filled with sex… I’ll definitely kill him…]</p><p class="calibre4">We haven’t gone that far yet though.</p><p class="calibre4">I waited a little bit for Fujimoto, who had seemed to hit a breaking point.</p><p class="calibre4">[The next time I see someone, I’m going to kill them by hand…]</p><p class="calibre4">Everyone around Fujimoto. Run.</p><p class="calibre4">I was now satisfied after being able to egg him on further. As expected, for a normal second year high school student, it is natural to envy a situation like this. It was enough to cool down my head.</p><p class="calibre4">[You know, if you were going to say something like, oh, I was actually talking about myself, you should stop it.]</p><p class="calibre4">…</p><p class="calibre4">“There’s no way that would be the case, comrade.”</p><p class="calibre4">[I know right. lolololol. There’s no way a guy like you could ever get a girlfriend. Lololol.]</p><p class="calibre4">[This is the last warning that I am going to send you… when you go out walking at night, you should watch your back.]</p><p class="calibre4">[Bring it on! Come at me!]</p><p class="calibre4">Even as I make my way towards the bedroom behind me there wasn’t a single sound that could be coming from it. Maybe, she’s crying while hiding on her bed…? Well there’s no way an older lady like that would do that, right?</p><p class="calibre4">Kon kon, I knock on the bedroom door.</p><p class="calibre4">“Haruka-san?”</p><p class="calibre4">“…”</p><p class="calibre4">I heard something from the other side of the door.</p><p class="calibre4">“Earlier, the way I worded things was bad… About that, sorry…”</p><p class="calibre4">The door opened a bit as Hiiragi-chan poked her head out.</p><p class="calibre4">“No… Me too, I’m sorry. I was probably a little bit annoying… You were in the middle of studying after all…”</p><p class="calibre4">Her eyes were a little bit red.</p><p class="calibre4">“Were you crying?”</p><p class="calibre4">“I-I wasn’t crying…”</p><p class="calibre4">“The truth?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Just a little bit.”</p><p class="calibre4">Just as I thought, she was crying.</p><p class="calibre4">At school, Hiiragi-chan seems to be a lady that has a good grip on her life. However, when it’s around me, her mentality seems to become more immature.</p><p class="calibre4">“When I’m near Seiji-kun, I somehow end up just really wanting to talk to you, or wanting you to pay attention to me…”</p><p class="calibre4">“You’re like an elementary schooler that found someone they liked.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Muu~ I can’t say anything against that though…”</p><p class="calibre4">While pouting a bit, Hiiragi-chan looked downwards.</p><p class="calibre4">“But, this is the first time I came to like someone like this… so becoming like an elementary schooler like that, forgive me for that…?”</p><p class="calibre4">Kuu. So cute…</p><p class="calibre4">If she were to open the door right now, it would instantly turn into flirting mode. I’ve got to endure it. Endure it.</p><p class="calibre4">“At night, I want to go somewhere with Haruka-san… But before that, I would like to complete a certain amount of my assignment.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Eh? Where?”</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s over on top of the mountain. During the summer, you can see the stars really clearly.”</p><p class="calibre4">“So romantic! I want to go!”</p><p class="calibre4">“Then, until then we should each do our own work or assignment and finish, okay?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I’ll do my best! If it’s like this, I can definitely give it my all!”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan is always so honest when it comes to hanging out with me.</p><p class="calibre4">Still, since I would get distracted, Hiiragi-chan stayed in the bedroom, while I was in the living room studying. When I finally was able to finish it, there was a feeling of liberation after settling such troublesome things, and so we ended up flirting more than usual.</p><p class="calibre4">“You really did your best, Seiji-kun. Now I need to reward you.”</p><p class="calibre4">“No matter how you put it, it feels like I’m the one on the giving side though.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Once again, your saying something so mean…”</p><p class="calibre4">“Do you hate it?”</p><p class="calibre4">With her lips that were pouting in complaint, Hiiragi-chan gave me a kiss on my cheek and on my neck.</p><p class="calibre4">“… I love it ♡”</p><p class="calibre4">As if we were animals marking our territory, we continued to give and receive kiss marks throughout the night. When I returned home, I was once again found by Sana, and was completely disinfected.</p></div>
