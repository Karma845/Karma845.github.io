<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Discussion 2</h3>

<p class="calibre4">Once the two of us arrived at Hiiragi-chan’s place, we were let inside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“As usual, it’s quite clean, Haru-chan’s place.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s because I’m a girl, it needs to be clean. I heard that your room, Natsumi, is quite messy as usual.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not true! It’s just a little bit messy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I listened while smiling to the conversation between the two close sisters, Hiiragi-chan passed me a cup of coffee, and Natsumi-chan a cup of tea.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Natsumi-chan stared closely at Hiiragi-chan’s movements. Hmmm… I don’t doubt it, I get a feeling that we may be caught.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I heard that Natsumi-chan wanted to meet me…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, yes, that’s right. I forgot because of what happened earlier though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The case with the stray cat?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“As far as I know, the only male that Haru-chan is on good terms with is you, so I was curious what type of person you were.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eeehh? That’s not true.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In response to Hiiragi-chan’s denial, Natsumi-chan shook her head firmly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It is true. I mean, this is the first time, you’ve ever gotten close to a male and went out of your way to let me know. I can’t help be curious about who this is.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Is that it, Hiiragi-chan said as she tilted her head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I once again told Natsumi-chan about the reason for the meeting between Hiiragi-chan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Since then, I say hello every time I see her at school… Hiiragi-sensei then became the advisor for the club that I was a part of. And that’s that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Natsumi-chan put the saucer on top of her lap, and then took a sip of the tea. Maybe because it was because she went to a rich lady’s school, her movements seemed to be of a higher class. Do they teach them manners in class, I wonder? The person herself seemed a little bit unrefined though.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haru-chan, you’re an advisor?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. Isn’t it amazing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I mean, it’s probably some club with no motivation and where half the members just go home, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">““…””</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because she was right on the mark, Hiiragi-chan and I kept silent. Now that I think about it, recently, we haven’t done anything that really seems like club activities…</p>
<p class="calibre4">We only talk and play games, and if Hiiragi-chan comes, we listen to her complaints about work… that’s all. It ended up turning into a going home club that was called the home economics club.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So I was right? What type of teacher is Haru-chan at school?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mou, stop it… it’s fine, it doesn’t matter!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s fine, I just want to know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">… A long time ago, during my third year of high school, this sort of three-person interview was something I saw before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hiiragi-sensei is quite bright and energetic, and is a good teacher that is well favored by everyone regardless of gender.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t need to hear about some fake nice front that she puts up. What do you think about her? I want to know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her excited face was saying, <em class="calibre5">“I want to know! What do you think? Let me hear it!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">How should I say this?</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I end up saying the truth, the relationship between Hiiragi-chan and I might be doubted even further. However, if I try saying something fake, the strangely smart Natsumi-chan wouldn’t accept it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“From how I see it, there are places where she’s quite careless, but she’s at least doing her best… As a result, I don’t think any of the other people around see it, because if they did, she would probably feel closer, or something like a more loveable character? That’s the type of teacher she is.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan fidgeted around and looked like she was so moved that she was going to cry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haru-chan, why are you crying?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I haven’t started crying yet…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Receiving the handkerchief that Natsumi-chan handed her, Hiiragi-chan covered her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… You really are looking at her.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s how I see Hiiragi-sensei, but I don’t know how other people think of her.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Returning the saucer and cup to the table, Natsumi-chan looked at me straight on. She properly arranged her legs towards the right as she placed her hands on her lap in a high-class way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">… Wh-what is it? She’s really staring at me. Both the way she’s sitting and her posture are all so refined</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Earlier, when we were eating okonomiyaki, I was thinking, and now I’m just confirming&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Dokin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Wh-what is she trying to confirm…?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haru-chan, she likes you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Funya!? Wh-what are you saying all of a sudden, Natsumiiiiiii!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan began shaking Natsumi-chan’s shoulders with everything she had.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sei&mdash;Seiji-kun is going to be surprised, right!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So you aren’t going to deny it at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ugi…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, she’s right… In an argument, it seems like the younger sister rather than the older sister is better at strategizing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was quite in disarray last time and wasn’t quite sure, but I just wanted to know what type of person Haru-chan liked. That’s why I called you out here today.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-It’s not like I like him or anything like that! Don’t misunderstand me like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her lie is terrible!? That’s like a tsundere way of saying <em class="calibre5">“I like you”</em>! The more she tries to hide it, the more obvious it is. What kind of situation is this?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“M-mou, Natsumi-chan…. ”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She kept looking back at me. Stop looking towards me embarrassingly. If you do that, it’ll be even more obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You as well… don’t think of Haru-chan badly, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s, yeah. That’s right.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll keep saying this, but it’s the first time seeing her like this. Being so happy when you were here, and immediately becoming sad once you were gone. When I asked her about you and when she told me about you, she had so much pride in it… She likes you. Probably.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“M-mooouuu, stoooop iiittt.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">While having her face turn red, Hiiragi-chan hit Natsumi-chan with a cushion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sei!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The cushion was immediately stolen from Hiiragi-chan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Be quiet. I’m talking right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The old sister is so weak.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But, Natsumi-chan wanted to say something. Is she going to deny Hiiragi-chan her feelings feelings, or is she going to support it?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m quite worried about Haru-chan. I can’t even see the m in male around her, and yet she’s already twenty-four.” [1]</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My age is perfectly fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan, who was trying to steal the cushion back, was easily prevented.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Muuu…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Meeting you like this today, I can see that you’re quite calm despite being younger. I feel that I can leave the airheaded Haru-chan to you. If you were some weird guy, I would have stopped it though…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, of course.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Natsumi-chan, after evaluating me was now pushing Hiiragi-chan towards me, despite how much she cared about her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If it was me, then you could leave Sensei to me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you are fine with it, that is.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But, I’m just a second year high school student.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Didn’t I say it earlier? If it was someone that I could depend on, then I would support Haru-chan’s love. Is age really something to consider when it comes to love?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Alongside her, Hiiragi-chan nodded along, acting like an expert in the field.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We’re talking about you, you know?</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I thought, Natsumi-chan isn’t looking at people based on title, but actually looking at them. Rather than the part where I am a high school student, and Hiiragi-chan is a teacher, it was more about Sanada Seiji and Hiragi Haruka as people. Really, she’s such a good child.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This… is plan B.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">“If it has already been found out, or if there was no problem for her to find out, then we will be open about out our relationship.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">“Yeah. Alright. If it’s Natsumi, I think she would accept it if we explain it to her, so if it comes to that, it’ll definitely be alright.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">That was plan B. It is one of the plans we made when we met in advance. Locking eyes with Hiiragi-chan, I nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haru-chan, there isn’t many other timings like this, so you should just say it! I threw out a bone for you. Moreover, I don’t feel like Thief-kun is bad, definitely&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ummm, Natsum&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before Hiiragi-chan could say anything, I spoke first.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Natsumi-chan, Sensei and I, we’re already dating.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Shocked, Natsumi-chan looked at Hiiragi-chan as if to confirm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. It’s true.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Saying that, Hiiragi-chan came to my side. Natsumi-chan’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh? S-since when?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Since the middle of April. It’s been just over three months.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, that talk last time about the thief stuff…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry about that. That was just something made up. A lie.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whaaaaat… Tell me about this earlier…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We thought that you might be against it, so it made it hard to say… But this time, Seiji-kun said that if it looked alright, then we should be open about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tears started pouring out from Natsumi-chan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I won’t be against it… I even support it… don’t hide it… it makes it worse that way.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan once again apologized to Natsumi-chan before hugging her and patting her on the head to stop Natsumi-chan from crying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It wasn’t just that time, I’ve thought about it a hundred times. Today as well, you didn’t bring out tea, but coffee, serving it without any milk or sugar, completely black, and yet Thief-kun didn’t give a word of complaint… coffee rather than tea, moreover black as well… you know someone like that Haru-chan, I thought… But, if it was someone that you were deeply involved in, Haru-chan would tell me… so I was wondering what it was.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As expected, she was a sharp detective… But, the fact that she supports Hiiragi-chan and I is a relief.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is great…! Haru-chan, this is really great. Con&mdash;grats…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With a tear strewn face and broken words, Natsumi-chan blessed us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Dank jou…! Najumi, fer zuppording uz, dank you…” [2]</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan as well! She’s also crying!! Why is the person on the receiving end of the support crying more!</p>
<p class="calibre4">In this way, the relationship between Hiiragi-chan and I was revealed to her little sister, Natsumi.</p>
