<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; A Certain Holiday on the Veranda</h3>


<p class="calibre4">She’s super super overworked.</p><p class="calibre4">That’s what Hiiragi-chan’s eyes showed.</p><p class="calibre4">Although we do go on dates together, we aren’t able to spend much time outside together, and so we end up spending our time over weekends at Hiiragi-chan’s place.</p><p class="calibre4">More than anything else, we end up watching DVD movies. Today, as well, Hiiragi-chan had borrowed a recently popular action movie, and we were planning on watching it together, but her eyelids looked so heavy…</p><p class="calibre4">Every time she blinked, the amount of time that her eyes were closed increased. Hiiragi-chan was the type to sleep anywhere. Once she’s asleep, she becomes a deep sleeper.</p><p class="calibre4">“Haruka-san, you’re sleepy, right?”</p><p class="calibre4">“N-no, I’m not sleepy at all. I can still stay up for another 50 hours or so.”</p><p class="calibre4">She’s so easy to read. It’s so easy to see that’s she’s lying…</p><p class="calibre4">“You’re tired from work, right? Why don’t you take a short nap?”</p><p class="calibre4">“I won’t… it’s my long-awaited time with Seiji-kin.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Look, you’re speaking has started to fall apart.”</p><p class="calibre4">It seems she’s spending time with something grey. [1] Well, she probably just bit her tongue or something.</p><p class="calibre4">She then shook her head with all her strength and gave it her all to keep her eyes open.</p><p class="calibre4">“I was looking forward so much to having fun with Seiji-kin this weekend…!”</p><p class="calibre4">“Well yeah, of course you’d look forward to it… I guess you can go on a trip with tax money.” [2]</p><p class="calibre4">“… Hah!? I’m not asleep, not at all!”</p><p class="calibre4">“Not listening. Rather, with that type of reaction, you’re definitely falling asleep.”</p><p class="calibre4">I paused the DVD playback.</p><p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong?” She asked.<br class="calibre10" />“I’m a little bit tired. Do you mind if I take a nap?”</p><p class="calibre4">“If that’s the case, then of course it’s fine. Yes, come over here.” Spreading out her arms, HIiragi-chan gave me permission to come closer. Whenever Hiiragi-chan shows her maternal nature, I always end up wanting to be spoiled by her…</p><p class="calibre4">But no, it isn’t that at all.</p><p class="calibre4">Rather, I’m not sleepy at all. If I sleep now, then Hiiragi-chan, who lost the need to do anything, would fall asleep. Or at least, that’s the plan.</p><p class="calibre4">If I don’t do this, it seemed like she would continue to say “No, I’m not sleepy.” Despite the fact that she’s tired from work, and is forcing herself to stay awake.</p><p class="calibre4">“Today, it’s fine…”</p><p class="calibre4">“Hmm? That’s unusual?”</p><p class="calibre4">“I can sit on the sofa and sleep.”</p><p class="calibre4">“But if you do that, your body will become sore, right?” Pulling out a blanket, Hiiragi-chan spread it out on top of her lap. “Come on. Over here. Come.”</p><p class="calibre4">Ton ton, she patted her thighs.</p><p class="calibre4">I-if I give in here, then Hiiragi-chan won’t be able to sleep…! That’s what I think, but the level of spoiling is to high, and I’m not strong enough to go against it…!</p><p class="calibre4">“But, if I do that, then you won’t be able to move, right?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Mufufu… it’s fine as long as I get to look at Seiji-kin’s sleeping face.”</p><p class="calibre4">When will she start calling me Seiji-kun again, I wonder.</p><p class="calibre4">“Haruka-san, if you’re tired, you don’t need to force yourself to watch the DVD…”</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s not like I’m forcing myself to, though?”</p><p class="calibre4">In the end, I didn’t win against Hiiragi-chan’s temptation, and borrowed her lap. Since it was hard for me to move away from her, she ended up coming in with a kiss. Pat pat. Pat pat. She petted me as if I was a pet cat. It felt so nice that by the time I noticed, I ended up falling asleep.</p><p class="calibre4">When I woke up, Hiiragi-chan’s movements had also stopped, her eyes closed and looking down. The plan was half a failure, and half a success.</p><p class="calibre4">Suu suu, the peaceful sound of her sleeping breath could be heard. In order to not wake her up, I carefully sat up from her lap, and slowly lay her down on her side.</p><p class="calibre4">“Thank you for your hard work, Sensei.”</p><p class="calibre4">From around her hip, a little bit of her panties could be seen.</p><p class="calibre4">“!!?”</p><p class="calibre4">I move the blanket to cover that up, so that it was okay to look at her. Whether it is because she’s just unaware, or whether it is on purpose… sometimes things like this happens, and it’s a little troubling…</p><p class="calibre4">The fact that she was looking forward to being with me honestly makes me happy. However, even if she wants to have fun, if she’s tired then she’s just tired. Sometimes, it’s fine to have days like this.</p><p class="calibre4">The room seemed to be cleaned pretty nicely, so there was nothing for me to do there. It was now around 5 in the afternoon, and the outside had just begun to darken.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ah, that’s right. Laundry…”</p><p class="calibre4">If it’s dry I should bring it in and if needed, I can fold it too. As such, I head out onto the veranda from the bedroom. There, whether it was the clothes that I saw a lot at school, or her clothes that she wore outside of work, they were all hung on hangers drying. It was all dry, so I brought in what I could, but then stopped my hands at the leftover clothing.</p><p class="calibre4">What was left, was her underwear.</p><p class="calibre4">“…”</p><p class="calibre4">I-is it really alright for me to bring this in…? Rather, is it really alright for me to be seeing this??</p><p class="calibre4">I swallowed a bit of saliva.</p><p class="calibre4">“N-n-n-normally, it’s a t-top and b-bottom as a set right…?”</p><p class="calibre4">There was underwear which I had seen once before, and others that I had never seen before. Half of it is just strings… H-Hiiragi-chan, you wear erotic things like this…</p><p class="calibre4">… I swallowed my saliva again. This is bad. My eyes are throbbing. Maybe because of all the color, my eyesight is shaking. That’s right, this feeling, it’s like I entered the R-18 section of the video rental shop for the first time…! The strong stimulation from the information being drawn in through my sight…</p><p class="calibre4">The ones that are being worn, are many times more erotic than ones that you just see. However, in its state of being dried out in the open, feeling of life seems to be mixed in, as such…</p><p class="calibre4">I can’t help but stare.</p><p class="calibre4">This… I need to bring it in, and fold it…!? Panties are safe. I can somehow fold those correctly. However, as a man, it is a completely unknown existence&mdash;the bra, how do I fold that!?</p><p class="calibre4">If I fold all the other laundry, and just leave the bras like that, it seems kind of weird.</p><p class="calibre4">“Hmmm? Seiji-kun, you didn’t fold the bras… Ah, maybe you felt embarrassed? For a guy, it would be embarrassing to fold a bra after all. So cute, Seiji-kun.”</p><p class="calibre4">The thought of Hiiragi-chan grinning while teasing me like that came to mind. The same thing would happen if I were to leave all the underwear unfolded.</p><p class="calibre4">“You didn’t bring any of the underwear in… Ah. I see, I see. It’s embarrassing, right? Even if it’s your girlfriend’s, you were embarrassed… So cute, Seiji-kun.”</p><p class="calibre4">She would definitely be grinning while saying that… Still, it would be tedious to return all the stuff that I had already brought in.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ugh… What should I do…?”</p><p class="calibre4">“You’re quite enthusiastic, Seiji-kun.”</p><p class="calibre4">Hearing a voice from behind me, I jumped up.</p><p class="calibre4">“Uwaaah!?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Staring so hard at my underwear… I bet you were thinking something perverted, right?” Hiiragi-chan grabbed me from behind and started playing with my cheeks.</p><p class="calibre4">As I took a sidelong glance, she was grinning as expected.</p><p class="calibre4">“I wasn’t thinking anything like that!”</p><p class="calibre4">Well, even if I say that, it isn’t very convincing.</p><p class="calibre4">“You’re at that age, right? It’s okay, it’s okay, Sensei doesn’t mind at all ♪”</p><p class="calibre4">“You’re misunderstanding. I was just thinking about taking it in, and if I bring it in, how I would fold it… Rather, when did you start watching?”</p><p class="calibre4">“From when you had walked out onto the veranda.”</p><p class="calibre4">“That’s basically from the start! Can’t you call out next time!?”</p><p class="calibre4">“I mean, I was wondering what you were doing. Wondering whether you wanted my panties or something…”</p><p class="calibre4">“… I-I don’t want it.”</p><p class="calibre4">Hmmmm? While grinning, Hiiragi-chan took peeked over at my face, “You didn’t say that very strongly? I guess you didn’t really want to deny it?”</p><p class="calibre4">“I don’t want it.”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan softly spoke into my ear, “If you want it, I’ll give you one ♡”</p><p class="calibre4">“… I-I’m saying that I don’t need it!”</p><p class="calibre4">“Just now, you hesitated, right? Do you want it?” She poked me with a finger, and told me that my face was red, while taking a peek again at my face, “If you were going to get just a glimpse of my underwear, which one would you want me to wear?”</p><p class="calibre4">“This one.”</p><p class="calibre4">“As expected, it’s this one! Then you want this one!”</p><p class="calibre4">“T-t-that’s not true! I don’t really like playing around in such perverted ways.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Didn’t you answer immediately? The question of which panties are the best. Even if you respond like that, it’s not very convincing, you know?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Ha-Haruka-san, you perveeeert.”</p><p class="calibre4">Uwaaan, I struggle to get off the veranda, but Hiiragi-chan didn’t let go with her arms at all.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ahahaha, Seiji-kun, you’re so cute~”</p><p class="calibre4">That day, I continued to be teased in this way. Though, as a souviner, I was given the panties to bring back as I was leaving.</p><p class="calibre4">“I don’t need it.” I said, as I threw it back.</p><p class="calibre4">“Mou, Seiji-kun, you’re so easily embarrassed~” Hiiragi-chan narrowed her lips.</p><p class="calibre4">In some strange ways, Hiiragi-chan can become completely shameless, and sometimes, she would become a woman who I had no way of handling at all.</p>
