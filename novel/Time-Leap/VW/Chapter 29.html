<h3>Chapter 29 &#8211; The Secret Part-time Job</h3>

<p class="calibre4">◆Hiiragi Haruka◆</p><p class="calibre4">Seiji-kun seems to have started a part-time job.</p><p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">“Eeeeh? Did you want an allowance? If it’s only about 30,000 yen a month, then I could give you one.”</em></p><p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">“Nononono! I won’t accept that. Doing something like really makes it feel like you are seriously trying to make me into a useless person…”</em></p><p class="calibre4">When I told him that, Seiji-kun was amazed. I think that it’s good for a student to diligently do part-time work, as it serves as good work experience, but… Is Seiji-kun troubled with money? Does he maybe have something that he wants?</p><p class="calibre4">“If that was the case, then he could have just mentioned it to me…”</p><p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong, Haru-chan?”</p><p class="calibre4">Since it was now summer break, the frequency in which Natsumi would come over had increased. Today as well, she was eating dinner with me at my place.</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s Seiji-kun, he started a part-time job… if there was something he wanted, he could have just told me though.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it fine? Being a working student is better than spending summer break lazing about and doing nothing.”</p><p class="calibre4">“How about you? Haven’t you been coming over almost three times a week? What about your future?”</p><p class="calibre4">“I have a recommendation to go to college, so isn’t it fine for me to play for a bit.”</p><p class="calibre4">Muuu… She’s the exact opposite of Seiji-kun.</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s okay, Haru-chan.”</p><p class="calibre4">“What is?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Thief-kun isn’t the type of child to do something without thinking, right? I’m sure that there is some sort of reason for it.”</p><p class="calibre4">“But still… even if that were the case… I’m worried…”</p><p class="calibre4">“Uwaaah… super protective.”</p><p class="calibre4">Natsumi pulled back a bit.</p><p class="calibre4">The place that he works at is part of the food industry. It seems to be a small café.</p><p class="calibre4">“If you’re that worried, just go to the store.”</p><p class="calibre4">“…”</p><p class="calibre4">The place where Seiji-kun is working… I want to see it…!</p><p class="calibre4">“Uwaah… your face became so much like that of a maiden in love…”</p><p class="calibre4">“Let’s go!”</p><p class="calibre4">… As such, over the weekend, I went with Natsumi to the café that Seiji-kun was working at.</p><p class="calibre4">Our school wasn’t that strict when it came to working part-time. You would be given the okay as long as you tell your homeroom teacher beforehand and finish some simple paperwork. There were quite a few students that properly followed the proper procedures, but a large majority of them did not.</p><p class="calibre4">Driving to the shopping district in my car, we parked at a suitable parking lot, and arrived at a side street close to the station.</p><p class="calibre4">At night, the café was supposed to become an Italian restaurant and its outer appearance was quite fancy. Looking through the window, a lot of female customers could be seen.</p><p class="calibre4">“Thief-kun, isn’t he wearing uniform for bartenders?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Oh my god. I need to take a picture.”</p><p class="calibre4">“You’re like his guardian. One of those super overprotective guardians!”</p><p class="calibre4">Within the store, there were also a lot of female workers carrying drinks and dishes. I understand… I understand it very well… it’s super easy to get along with coworkers…! All of them are female college students that are younger than me…! They’re so young…!</p><p class="calibre4">“Haru-chan, wait, can you stop letting out some weird aura. Specifically speaking, there’s a bunch of that miasma like black smoke coming out of you. Also, don’t start growling at people. Stop glaring at people as well.”</p><p class="calibre4">Being told that, I took a huge breath.</p><p class="calibre4">A female waitress had come over with a notepad to ask for our order. After ordering two pasta lunches, we waited for it to finish cooking.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ah”, hearing that sound come from Natsumi, I looked in her direction, and saw Seiji-kun.</p><p class="calibre4">“Hello, Thief-kun.”</p><p class="calibre4">“…”</p><p class="calibre4">His expression was subtle as he stood there holding the salads for our sets. He was wearing a dress shirt, with black slacks and an apron wrapped around his waist.</p><p class="calibre4">“Here are your salads… What did you come here for?”</p><p class="calibre4">“I was just wondering whether Seiji-kun hard at work.”</p><p class="calibre4">Also, observing the workplace.</p><p class="calibre4">“Thief-kun, you’re in charge of carrying out the dishes?”</p><p class="calibre4">“No, there weren’t enough people, so I’m just helping out for a bit. Normally, I’m in the kitchen… Also, I’ll call you later, so when you’re done just go home, okay?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Okaaay.”</p><p class="calibre4">Turning around, Seiji-kun walked into the back.</p><p class="calibre4">“Haru-chan, are you satisfied with this?”</p><p class="calibre4">“I am satisfied… but my worries have increased.”</p><p class="calibre4">As I was stabbing my salad with a fork, a different worker carried our pasta over. Muuu… it’s different female worker again. (She’s younger and cuter than me, and also college student probably.)</p><p class="calibre4">After we finished eating the delicious pasta, we conversing with each other while drinking iced coffee. It’s a nice and quiet restaurant. The shops furniture and decorations are quite fashionable. I kind of get why a girl would want to work part-time here.</p><p class="calibre4">If I remember correctly, Seiji-kun gets off at around evening time.</p><p class="calibre4">“Maybe I should wait until he’s done and then drive him home…”</p><p class="calibre4">“Haru-chan, that’s really stalker like. You even found out when he gets off of work.”</p><p class="calibre4">“I-I’m not a stalker.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Even if you’re his girlfriend, if you go overboard, you’ll still be hated, you know?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Seiji-kun won’t hate me just because of that….”</p><p class="calibre4">W-what would I do? What if he actually ends up hating me.</p><p class="calibre4">What if he goes out for food with his co-workers once they get off of work? <em class="calibre5">“Sanada-kun, you’re a high schooler? You’re so mature that it surprised me.”</em> If he were praised by a female college student like that… they’ll get on good terms… what am I going to do…? Ugugugugu.</p><p class="calibre4">“Wait, Haru-chan. It’s coming out again. The miasma. Keep it inside.”</p><p class="calibre4">“What will I do if Seiji-kun goes out for food with another girl…?”</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s fine if he goes though, right? Does he seem like the type to cheat on you, Haru-chan?”</p><p class="calibre4">“No, but…”</p><p class="calibre4">“Just trust him then. Thief-kun, really does love you, Haru-chan.”</p><p class="calibre4">How nice would that be if I heard it from his own mouth. Recently, he’s been quite embarrassed and hasn’t said it as much to me…</p><p class="calibre4">He didn’t tell me his reason for starting this job, and I feel like he’s hiding something from me. If it’s about Seiji-kun, I want to know everything. But that might be really annoying…</p><p class="calibre4">Becoming a little nervous, Natsumi spoke to me secretly.</p><p class="calibre4">“Hey hey… Have you had sex with Thief-kun yet…?”</p><p class="calibre4">“W-w-w-what’s with that all of a sudden?”</p><p class="calibre4">“It looks like you still haven’t then.”</p><p class="calibre4">“… Isn’t that fine, it has nothing to do with Natsumi. We told each other that until we were married, things like that are a no go…”</p><p class="calibre4">“Fufuun? Now then, here’s the problem. Between a girl that’s easy to talk to, cute, and OK with a physical relationship, and a girl that’s cute, perfect at everything, but a NG on a physical relationship… which do you think a boy would like more?”</p><p class="calibre4">“The first person?”</p><p class="calibre4">“That’s right. The more you treasure him, the easier it is for him to be stolen away, you know?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Seiji-kun said he was okay. He said he would endure it…”</p><p class="calibre4">“That would be good if that were the case.”</p><p class="calibre4">Muuu, Natsumi is definitely having fun making me feel more anxious… She’s definitely grinning right now.</p><p class="calibre4">“When he said he was okay, it’s because he’s okay using some other girl as a replacement, right?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Se-seiji-kun wouldn’t do something like that!”</p><p class="calibre4">“Fufufu. Yeah, that’s true. Sorry for teasing you like that.”</p><p class="calibre4">B-but still, none of that till marriage, might be going too far…?</p><p class="calibre4">In the end, we didn’t wait for Seiji-kun and went home. A little bit after I finished eating dinner, a call came from Seiji-kun.</p><p class="calibre4">“Sorry for bothering you today.”</p><p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">“No, it’s okay. I was just a little surprised.”</em></p><p class="calibre4">I should say it. The fact that I’m super worried.</p><p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">“… Then, why did you end up coming? All of them have boyfriends it seems, so it’s okay.”</em></p><p class="calibre4">“Ah, is that so?”</p><p class="calibre4">My worries ended in vain.</p><p class="calibre4">“There is that, but the most important part would be why you started working part-time all of sudden… You didn’t tell me anything at all.”</p><p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">“If I tell you, then the effect would be cut in half so I didn’t tell you.”</em></p><p class="calibre4">The effect would be cut in half?</p><p class="calibre4">While I remained unconvinced, the next day, Seiji-kun came to my house. He was holding a stuffed animal bear.</p><p class="calibre4">“W-what is that!?”</p><p class="calibre4">“What day is it today?”</p><p class="calibre4">“It isn’t my birthday… Ah, anniversary!”</p><p class="calibre4">“Yeah. That’s right. This… is an anniversary present.”</p><p class="calibre4">I was handed the large and fluffy bear. It feels so nice to hug it…</p><p class="calibre4">“Then… the part-time work…”</p><p class="calibre4">“I’ve been thinking for a while that it would be nice, and so this time, I forcefully obtained a bit of money to buy it.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Mo-mooouuuu, Seiji-kunnnnnnnn.”</p><p class="calibre4">I hugged the bear tight. It’s so soft and nice.</p><p class="calibre4">“It was just as Natsumi said.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Hmm? What about Natsumi-chan?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Fufuun, it’s a secret ♪ Thank for you this. Let’s decide a name together for it?”</p><p class="calibre4">Mou, he didn’t need to give me a surprise like this…</p><p class="calibre4">With the stuffed animal, I hugged Seiji-kun.</p><p class="calibre4">“Wah, wait, we’re still at the entrance.”</p><p class="calibre4">It seems that since then, Natsumi had gone two to three more times and had decided that he was a good hard-working man.</p><p class="calibre4">Yeah yeah… a working Seiji-kun is super cool.</p><p class="calibre4">After going through this, I once again fell in love with Seiji-kun.</p>
