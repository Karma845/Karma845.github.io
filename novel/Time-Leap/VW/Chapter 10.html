<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; About the Future</h3>

<p class="calibre4">Night. I entered Hiiragi-chan’s house, and waited for her to return. As usual, her room was tidy and the kitchen had no dishes left and was flawlessly clean.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I’m home…?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Ah, welcome home.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“How unusual, for you to come on a weekday. What is it?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />She takes off her coat and sat on the sofa.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“It’s about your little sister Natsumi…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“About Natsumi…?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />It was about last time I was released by the time leap. When I had visited Hiiragi-chan’s home, it didn’t seem like I received a good response. The condition was to have an annual income of 10 million yen, but I don’t know if that was meant as just a condition, or whether it was made since I was not properly acknowledged as a marriage partner.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“To a certain extent, it would be better for me to be acquainted with her.”</p><p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre10" />“Why’s that?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I was just thinking that maybe if we had our relationship acknowledged by one of your family members, talks of the future might be able to proceed more smoothly.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“We’ll expose our relationship to Natsumi-chan?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“No. I don’t mean to expose our relationship. We’re still a student and teacher in the same school after all. The point is, that if I’m recognized, then if I say, ‘We’re in a relationship!’, then the response would be like ‘I see! If it’s Sanada-kun then I can leave Onee-chan to you!’ or something like that.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Fumu fumu. I see.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />She nodded her head as and then looked at me<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Eh. What?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“…This may be something obvious, but as a high schooler, I feel that it’s quite a mature way of thinking.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />I only wanted to take down the flag that appeared after returning to the present time period.<br class="calibre10" />Attaining the approval of the little sister should be at the very least some small form of protection.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />The me in the future was after meeting Hiiragi-chan’s father, but for now, I had not met him yet. Since I was still a high schooler, there was no way I could be introduced, the only thing I can do now, was to make my way around the target.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Rather than being a mature way of thinking… I was just thinking about our future together.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Really?”</p><p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre10" />“Yeah. Really… Why, do you doubt me?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan was now fidgeting on the sofa and pursing her lips..<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“It’s not that you are interested in Natsumi, I’m quite on alert for that.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />When our eyes meet, *pui* Hiiragi-chan turned her face away.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I won’t take interest in her, I won’t! Why do I have to be interested in someone who I met for the first time?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“But… your age is closer to Natsumi… You’ll want to get along, right…?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />*kurun* She turned her back toward me. Is she pouting…?</p><p class="calibre4">“I want to get along with her because I want an ally who would recognize our relationship.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I-I thought that it was just your excuse!”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />So you say, but what’s with that child-like remark.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Natsumi is a good child. She’s athletic, and has a bright personality. And, she’s only a year older than you…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“If a reason is because her age is near mine, then why wouldn’t I date one of my classmates instead?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />It seems that Hiiragi-chan cares a lot about our age difference.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“If I wanted to meet Seiji-kun, I would’ve rather met you while I was still in high school. Going home after school together and taking detours on the way, studying at each other’s homes for tests, going to festivals while wearing a yukata…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Apparently, this is one of her complexes. I never thought of it that way, but Hiiragi-chan was different.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Even with all of this, I’m quite uneasy, you know?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Her back was towards me, and she wasn’t looking in my direction at all.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Maybe you’re feelings would change all of a sudden…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />The world of a working adult and a highschooler is so very different. Since I have experienced both, I understand that well. Compared to the ever repeating daily work of a working adult, the life of a highschooler was much more exciting. It would be natural to value them differently.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Even if I say it’s okay, it wouldn’t be easy to erase the anxiety. <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />I hug her from behind.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />*pikun* I felt her shoulder twitching a bit as she fidgeted around.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Being uneasy, I also feel that way, you know?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Re-really?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Yeah. I’m really worried that there’s some strange bug after Haruka-san in the staff room. I don’t even know what goes on at the drinking parties.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“It’s okay! Don’t worry! I’m very cold towards any of those male teachers.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Even if you say that, you’re really popular, Haruka-san.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I’m not that popular, you know? It’s you who’s popular, Seiji-kun.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“No no, I’m not popular at all.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />The two of us were like equivalent to an idiot girlfriend with her idiot boyfriend.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan nodded her head while speaking, “Don’t worry, Seiji-kun”.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />I laughed unintentionally.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Eh? What? Is something funny?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Nope. Now you know how I feel, right? I also told you, it’s okay, don’t worry, there’s no need to worry, didn’t I?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Ah, I see.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“First, let’s trust in each other.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“That’s right.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan agreed as she points her pinky finger and I too stretched out my pinky to hold her’s.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“If you lie, your finger ♪, will be cut with a knife ♪”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />S-scaryyyyyyyy!! Why is she singing that?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Well, if that doesn’t happen, then it’ll probably be fine… But, why are saying something like that suddenly?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Because, Seiji-kun wanted to become closer with Natsumi…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Ah. I understand. You’re sulking because you’re jealous?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Yo-you’re wrong. I won’t become jealous of my little sister”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />She frantically tried to untangle my arms from around her. With this response, it’s certain. She seemed to be really embarrassed as she said that too.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“What is it truly?”</p><p class="calibre4">“……… I was.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan suddenly becoming obedient sure is cute.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I’ll be worried, I’ll be concerned, and then, it becomes jealousy! Th…that’s why I treasure and love you so much!”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Gufu… You don’t need to say it like that when it made your ears so red… But, I do want to hear it once more…<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“What about Seiji-kun…?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Same.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Then, please say it…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I get worried and anxious, because I treasure you so much… Haruka-san, I love you…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />I got embarrassed part way through, and my words ended up becoming formal. Hiiragi-chan was holding her chest and curled up.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Gufu… Cause of death, because Seiji-kun made my heart beat wildly.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“You’re still alive, aren’t you?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />The two of us who are similar, were still an idiotic couple like usual.</p></div>
