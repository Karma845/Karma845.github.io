<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; A Certain Saturday</h3>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre9">“Seiji-kun, you know…”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Seemingly apologetic, Hiiragi-chan spoke over the phone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre9">“This Saturday, I was invited to a drinking party…”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Aaah, is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That was not to say, that we had made plans for the two of us at that time. It was just going to be us lazing about over the weekend together, so going out for a drinking party every once in a while, is okay.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Friendships between working people are somewhat fragile. I truly don’t want to do anything that might lower the number of friends that Hiiragi-chan has. Just as I was going to encourage her to go, I finally understood why she seemed apologetic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre9">“Simply speaking, it’s drinking with teachers from another school. There are some other male teachers there that I happen to know personally.”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“He&mdash;heeh…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Good thing this was over the phone. Most likely, if she saw me, it would be really obvious that I was quite shaken right now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre9">“A teacher that I’m always indebted to told me, ‘If you have no plans on Saturday, then please!’ They had asked me about this last week… I tried to refuse them multiple times…But before they had asked, I had accidentally mentioned that I was free Saturday…”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">If I were to tell her my own personal feelings, then I would tell her not to go. But, if it’s someone she’s indebted too, then it must be a senior from the workplace. As a member of society, I am familiar with the importance of human relations within the workplace. </span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">If because of this case, Hiiragi-chan’s relationship at work gets worse, I wouldn’t be able to help. In some sense, I am part of her workplace, but it’s not like I am someone that is working in the staff room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This is where I show how big of a person Sanada Seiji really is. At the very least, I’m older than Hiiragi-chan on the inside, so I shouldn’t say something so petty.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah. I got it. It’s fine if you just go enjoy yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre9">“…Really? The people coming are just all the other teachers, so you don’t have to worry.”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… I’m not worried or anything so it’s okay.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That’s a complete lie! I’m super worried!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">If that was clearly the purpose of the party, then I would have definitely said that I didn’t like it. However, she was invited to a drinking party on a day off by someone she knew, and the person was even from the same workplace. In a broad sense, it could be called a place where people within the industry exchange information.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre9">“I’ll be late going home, maybe getting back around 10, okay?”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Don’t mind me and go enjoy yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Although you could say that it wasn’t my true feelings, but it really showed that I was still an adult on the inside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was hoping that maybe, it might be cancelled due to rain, but on the day of, as if I was being laughed at, the weather was good.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After intruding upon her for lunch, I tried to encourage Hiiragi-chan as she was slightly tense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I wonder… would I be able to go through this without saying anything careless. Going to a drinking party with people I don’t know very well, it’s been a while since I did something like that…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“As long as you don’t do anything rude, it’ll be fine. Even if you think you did, if you apologize nothing will happen.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Y-you think…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“If you apologize in person, humans are the type to be surprisingly forgiving. Besides, when it comes to drinking, people would think that mistakes are going to happen.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Hiiragi-chan started to stare at me with a weird expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“W-what?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Seiji-kun, are you familiar with drinking parties?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Most likely, I was even more used to it than Hiiragi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“T-there’s no way that’s the case.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah, I know, right? It just seemed that your opinions were so on point, that it just made me think that you were so dependable as usual.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She gave her goddess smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And then, as it became time, Hiiragi-chan started her preparations. I told her that it was quite cute and that it suited her, as she changed into casual clothing. But really, it was quite a complicated feeling. Moreover, i-it seems like she’s putting more effort into her makeup than usual… Normally, I feel like she does it more lightly…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Is this just the me that did not want her to go to the drinking party twisting reality into something worse?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Your makeup, you’re really doing it more carefully this time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Eh? Isn’t it always like this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There was no choice but to trust the words of Hiiragi-chan, who was looking confused. Now that she mentions it does seem the same, or maybe not. For now, I just complimented her clothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Hiiragi-chan gave me a kiss as I saw her off at the doorway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“If you get bored, it’s fine if you just go home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah. If that’s the case, I’ll make sure to lock the door.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">With a goodbye, she left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I started watching television but it was somewhat boring. It was around when the time turned to 6:30. By now, she’s probably drinking a bunch and having a lot of fun talking with everyone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre9">“Hiiragi-sensei, do you have a boyfriend right now?”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre9">“Aaah, ummm, not right now…”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Or some sort of conversation like that… Today, maybe it’s okay for her to say that she has a boyfriend… ah, but there are teachers there from the same school still. Aaaah, I really hate this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There was a moment where I thought that I would follow her. If I was the same age group, then maybe secretly going to an izakaya would be just fine, but if I were a high school student, it would definitely be suspicious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s not like I’m her guardian, so there’s no other thing I could do beside wait for her and give her my trust.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I didn’t feel like eating dinner at Hiiragi-chan’s place, or at my own house, so I decided to eat a ramen place nearby. I took a picture of it, and sent it through a text.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, there wasn’t any response.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Good good, my Hiiragi-chan is a proper lady that knows the proper time and place. She isn’t the type of person who can’t read the mood when they are focused on their phone at the bar. </span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After that, the variety show that I was watching wasn’t very interesting, nor was I interested in it, so I sent another text. </span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Once she’s had a couple of drinks, it might be okay for her to let it slip that she has a boyfriend. But wait, there are older teacher’s there so it might not be good? A shield to defend Hiiragi-chan from other men, or a shield to defend other people from finding out about our relationship, it seems like the two purposes contradict each other today.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It turned 8:30 at night. I wasn’t doing anything, when I heard a sound from the entrance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m back?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ah. Welcome back. That was early.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">With a slightly tired smile, Hiiragi-chan gave me a hug. She then started patting me on the back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“The drinking party, how was it? Did you have a good time?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nope. Not at all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I breathed a sigh as I let my chest drop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“If Seiji-kun isn’t there, it’s not fun at all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I see. Then, I guess it was an unfortunate drinking party.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Hmmm…? She was speaking normally, and her mood was pretty close from when she would come back from work.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Did you not drink?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah. I said that I wasn’t good with it, so after the first toast, I just had oolong tea.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Aaah, there are those types of people too. </span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As she held me tight, Hiiragi-chan spoke out earnestly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Haaah… it’s so calming.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s probably because the izakaya place was loud, and since you spoke a lot with people you didn’t really know very well&mdash;”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nope, well, that’s also true, but it’s because Seiji-kun is here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Ton ton, Hiiragi-chan lightly patted me on the chest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You’re the most calming.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I was thinking about having a round two with just the two of us, right here, right now. What do you think?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… I’m in.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I kissed Hiiragi-chan, who had made a small smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I need to buy some more alcohol!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“There were about four bottles in the fridge though..”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“For today, that won’t be enough ♪”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">How much are you intending to drink?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“The supermarket is going to close soon. Come on, hurry up!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After becoming energetic, Hiiragi-chan and I went to the nearby supermarket while holding hands.</span></p></div>
