<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; The Robber Incident</h3>

<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre3">◆Hiiragi Natsumi◆</strong></p><p class="calibre4">*Pin Pon*</p><p class="calibre4">“Huh? She should be in her apartment because today is a Saturday”</p><p class="calibre4">*Pin Pon**Pin Pon**Pin Pon**Pin Po&ndash;on*</p><p class="calibre4">I mashed the doorbell as much as possible. But, is this not the right room? This is the room “205”, it shouldn’t be wrong. I even said that I would come to play Saturday…</p><p class="calibre4">“Haru-cha~an? Your cute little sister has comeeee~”</p><p class="calibre4">I knocked on the door, too… No reaction… Muu. She’s not home. Even though I wanted to surprise her… Now then, let’s get inside with the key I got from mom. As I entered the bedroom, however, I heard something.</p><p class="calibre4">“Haruka-san, did you buy too many ingredients?”</p><p class="calibre4">A boy’s voice…? Is-is it her boyfriend’s?</p><p class="calibre4">“It’s okay. It’s an okonomiyaki party after all. It’s not good if it’s not enough, right?”</p><p class="calibre4">She said that she had no boyfriend when I asked her before…</p><p class="calibre4">*gasa-gasa* as the sound grocery bag and footstep echoed louder, it seemed that they went into the living room…?</p><p class="calibre4">It got quiet? What type of person is her boyfriend I wonder… I snuck a peek at the living room. The Haru-chan that I knew better than anyone else was locking her arms around her boyfriend neck. Uwawawa. It’s still before noon….</p><p class="calibre4">I’m so worried that I couldn’t stop looking at them. I know I shouldn’t look but, I’m so curious that I just can’t move my eyes away.</p><p class="calibre4">*gulp*</p><p class="calibre4">“Nnn…”</p><p class="calibre4">Fugyaaaaaaaa!! Th-they started to kiiii~iiising!? But, this is not a “mere” kiss. They are doing it fullyyyyyy ~ The-they have to be dating!</p><p class="calibre4">Uuuu… I don’t want to see it as a family member. W-w-what should I do…? If they go any further than this, then… Despite that, my eyes continued to watch…</p><p class="calibre4">*gulp*</p><p class="calibre4">The boyfriend pulled himself from her.</p><p class="calibre4">“Wa- You wanted to make delicious okonomiyaki, right?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Yes. I wanted to…? But, I want to recharge my Seiji-kun’s energy first”</p><p class="calibre4">She has that womanly face and all….. Even though she’s was always a good girl in home or at school.</p><p class="calibre4">Ah! Then… He’s a bad man who tricked Haru-chan? With her naiive nature, that seems like it could happen. As far as I know, he’s her first boyfriend too.</p><p class="calibre4">“What is this Seiji-kun’s energy thingy. Moreover, this is not okonomiyaki party… It’s just you and me, Sensei.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Muu, don’t call me Sensei, it’s Haruka-san, right?”</p><p class="calibre4">When they changed places, I caught a glimpse of his face.</p><p class="calibre4">As I thought what is his face before, it was just a normal, handsome face. Then it’s good. His face looks young. Huh? But, doesn’t he looked too young?</p><p class="calibre4">He looks younger than me…. right? Definitely. Eh? I’m a 3rd year high schooler though? But, younger means… A high schooler as well?</p><p class="calibre4">And, that “Sensei” just now…. Maybe, she was called “Sensei” just now because of her line of work, but if that’s not true then… Then, these two people…</p><p class="calibre4">“In school, I’m Hiiragi-sensei, but now, I’m your girlfriend”</p><p class="calibre4">Then, they are a teacher and her student, and dating each other?</p><p class="calibre4">N-no way…. The serious Haru-chan wouldn’t do something like that…</p><p class="calibre4">It seemed that I lost my timing to make an appearance. But, I don’t want to hide here and secretly observe them all day long either.</p><p class="calibre4">“Wh-what should I do&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?”</p><p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre3">◆Sanada Seiji◆</strong></p><p class="calibre4">Hm… did… I just hear someone voice?</p><p class="calibre4">*Chuu* As Hiiragi-chan started to kissing me again, and I stopped her with my hand.</p><p class="calibre4">“Please wait.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Hmm?”</p><p class="calibre4">I-it’s not a thief, right? The voice came from the bedroom. Did the thief just come in, and we just happened to come back? I heard a faint sound.</p><p class="calibre4">“Ah, is it a thief?”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan looked stiffly at me. It seems she also heard the sound.</p><p class="calibre4">“I need to phone 110&mdash;” [1]</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan takes out her phone…</p><p class="calibre4">“Se-Seiji-kun, what’s the number of 110!?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Haruka-san, please calm down. it’s one-one-zero”</p><p class="calibre4">“A-ah, yeah”</p><p class="calibre4">“&ndash;Eh? 110? somehow this is gotten out of hand!? Wa- that’s not good!”</p><p class="calibre4">I heard a voice from the bedroom. Sounds like they were listening in on us. They were speaking to themselves, but it seemed like… a woman’s voice.</p><p class="calibre4">“Haru-chan, STOP!”</p><p class="calibre4">*Ban* As she slammed the door, a short haired-woman appeared.</p><p class="calibre4">Haru-chan?</p><p class="calibre4">“Ah? Natsumi! Why is Natsumi here?”</p><p class="calibre4">“Uuu. I was hiding to surprising you”</p><p class="calibre4">“I see. you came here to play! Ah, Seiji-kun, this child is my younger sister, Natsumi”</p><p class="calibre4">I made a small bow&nbsp; and said, “hello”.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre4">The little sister known as Natsumi-chan also awkwardly lowered her head.</p><p class="calibre4">“He-hello… Good evening”</p><p class="calibre4">“So, who’s this boy?”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan became frozen solid. The fact that Hiiragi-chan and I were dating can’t be known to the public. For that reason she would always say that she had no boyfriend. These two things, for the sake of continuing our relationship, are solid and unbending.</p><p class="calibre4">Well, it would turn troublesome when introducing to each other. Rather, we can’t to introduce each other in a situation like this. A student meeting a teacher, who was living alone, in private was something that was weird. Regardless of whether it’s a student from the same school.</p><p class="calibre4">“Uum… uhhh… what should I say…?”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan started to panicking. Her eyes were not focused and her eyes started to spin.</p><p class="calibre4">“Th-th-this person is a burglar I met just now”</p><p class="calibre4">She was influenced by the mention of a thief from just nooowwww!? I don’t know anymore… But, as I can’t introduce myself as her boyfriend, I lowered my head a bit.</p><p class="calibre4">“He-hello…I’m a burglar”</p></div>

<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">The Robber Incident 2</b></p><p class="calibre4">After being introduced as a thief, I had no other choice but to call myself a “thief”. There was no other way for me to introduce myself, and even if I were to say, “No, I’m not a thief,” I wouldn’t know what to say after that.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />That’s why, I’m now a thief.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Though, if I really was a thief, I would be thrown out instantly.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Look. Hiiragi-chan is even putting on a face that seems to say, “Ah, what should i do now…?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Ha-Haru-chan… you would kiss someone like him…? Someone you met for the first time…?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />A lot of contradictory points came out now. Now, what do we do? Her sister, Natsumi-chan, was looking at Hiiragi-chan anxiously. Rather, she really shouldn’t be ignoring the keyword of “thief” like that.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan was sweating hard, as she turned and looked away.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Y-yes, I would? It’s just a kiss. Even if it’s someone I just met.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />She bulldozed her way through it!! No doubt, it makes her seem even more like a bitch!<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />I’m a “thief”, Hiiragi-chan is a “bitch”.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“You’re not Haru-chan that I used to know!?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />I know right. Most likely, she, herself, doesn’t even understand what she’s saying.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Until now, I’ve just hidden it. Natsumi just never knew about it.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Everyone, including me, had on a confused expression of wondering what to do next.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“An-anyway, let’s sit down first…?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />As a thief that she just met, I offered Natsumi-chan a seat on the sofa.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Just because we wanted to conceal the relationship between Hiiragi-chan and I, our first meeting formed a triangle relationship of a thief, a bitch-teacher, and an innocent little sister.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />What should i do nowwwwwww?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I’m… going to put the ingredients I just bought in the refrigerator. Also, I need to make preparations for lunch…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan ran away while grabbing the plastic bag from the supermarket.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Umm… Thief-kun’s name is Seiji, right?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Ah, yes… Your older sister… I just happened to run into Sensei…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />It became a story about a thief, who just happened to meet his teacher, and ended up having her listen to his circumstances over lunch&mdash;a story full of holes.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I see…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />She believed it!?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“How old are you, Seiji-kun?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“17 years old.”</p><p class="calibre4">“Then you can’t! You can’t be a thief! You’ll get caught by police.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Maybe because Hiiragi-chan’s bitch-like statement was too much of a shock for her, her suspicions of our relationship were all blown away. Anyways, for now, leaving that sort of misunderstanding there would be a good play.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Yeah. I didn’t know that Hiiragi-sensei lived at this apartment complex…. But thanks to that, it only stopped at an attempt.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />I acted like I was repentant. Let’s make it that I know Hiiragi-chan, but Hiiragi-chan doesn’t know about me.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I never knew that Haru-chan was such a slovenly woman…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />As expected, Hiiragi-chan’s bitch-like statement was too much of a shock for her.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Anyways, it’s because Natsumi came so suddenly that something weird like this happened, you know&mdash;!!”</p><p class="calibre4">Hiiragi-chan who heard our conversation poked her head out of the kitchen. She seemed to be really unhappy. Of course she would be. Last night, she seemed so happy about our okonomiyaki party after all.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />What Hiiragi-chan said was reasonable. If you want to come, then only come after making an appointment beforehand, it’s part of an adult’s common sense.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I just wanted to surprise you, Haru-chan… But you guys started kissing… so I couldn’t come out…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“S-so, you saw it…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />The red-faced Hiiragi-chan immediately return to the kitchen. Her embarrassed reaction is cute but, please don’t forget about the setting of being a bitch. <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan then brought out a hot plate, but I decided to help her carry it because it looked heavy.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Ah, Seiji-kun… Thank you.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“It’s okay”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Natsumi-chan stared at me as I prepared the table.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“What is it…?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“It’s not your first time here, at Haru-chan’s place, is it?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />How did she know?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“No, that’s not true. It-it’s my first time…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“The placement of the outlet, you didn’t need to confirm it, right? You weren’t confused at all.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Geh. Are you a detective or something?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I just noticed it by chance.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Really…?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hmm… Does she still suspect something? She keeps staring at me. She’s quite stubborn… She’s even better than Sana at picking out specific details.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Muun, Natsumi looked at me suspiciously, and then tried to look at what Hiiragi-chan was hiding behind her back. Hiiragi-chan then brought out a large bowl and began cooking a portion of okonomiyaki for everyone.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />The finished okonomiyaki was piping hot and delicious…<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Haru-chan, you’re an amazing cook as usual.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Right? If you practice, you might be able to get a boyfriend.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hey, Hiiragi Haruka. Don’t look in my direction.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I’ll think about it”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />*munch munch*, Natsumi started eating her okonomiyaki. Hiiragi-chan seemed to be relieved, but in truth, it was the exact opposite.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />After I finished eating the okonomiyaki, and took a short break after eating, I made as if to leave and go home as quickly as possible.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Thank you for today. You even made lunch for me.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan became depressed. Our time together, even including the time spent on the trip to the supermarket didn’t even amount to an hour. With a lonely expression, she waved her hand in regret. If she shows an expression like that, it’ll be painful for me too.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />I was reluctant, but I still went home<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Hey, Thief-kun”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />As I started to ride my bicycle, Natsumi-chan peeked out from the upper floor.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Are you really a thief?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Perhaps.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Geez, are you, or are you not…?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />I know that Natsumi-chan is not a bad girl, it’s just that she had bad timing. I peddle my bike while waving back with my hand. After all of this, I hope that Hiiragi-chan will skillfully brush this incident over, and ensure that Natsumi would not pursue our relationship any further.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><strong class="calibre3">◆Hiiragi Natsumi◆</strong><br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />After seeing off Thief-kun, I return to Haru-chan house. There, I see Haru-chan sitting on a chair while holding her knees.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“What is it?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Nothing… it’s just… “<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />No matter how you look at it, she’s depressed. From my impression of when we were all eating together, I would say that Haru-chan, at the very least, holds Thief-kun in good favor. It’s close to how it would be if he was her cute younger brother.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />My sister is not the older sister that I know, making such a bitch-like statement like that, or maybe she just said that in the heat of the moment. Because Thief-kun’s aloof attitude never collapsed, I don’t even know what to think.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Eh? If it’s an act, it’s quite amazing. <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Haru-chan tension fell sharply when comparing the time when we were eating lunch to after he’s gone. She wasn’t even working on cleaning up after lunch, and was just collapsed unenergetically on the table.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“You lied about not knowing about him right? The truth is, you like thief-kun, right?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I’m not lying. That’s… not true…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Eh? Then, is that me being mistaken?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Do you see Thief-kun often at school?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Hmm. Not at all. It seemed like he knew about me though.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hmm hmm. As expected, from Haru-chan’s side, it would be like a first meeting. Haru-chan’s school is far from mine so, I can’t check… <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />That kiss… was that my misunderstandment? Did I just see that because I was too excited?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Natsumi, you should go get a boyfriend. It’ll be really nice, you know? Every day becomes so much nicer.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Haru-chan spoke out in a dull tone, while lying sideways on the sofa and began using her cell phone. Even though she was so quick and full of energy earlier, she’s just like a lazy cat now.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />That Thief-kun, who is he?</p></div>
