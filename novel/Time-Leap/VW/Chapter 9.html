<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Rooftop</h3>

<p class="calibre4">*Pinponpanpooon*<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“2nd year class B Sanada-kun, 2nd year class B Sanada-kun. Please come to Hiiragi’s office in the staff room. I repeat&mdash;”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />The school wide announcement came out after the first morning class.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />*zawa zawa* Everybody in class looked at me<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Hey, Sanada. What did you do?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />My neighbor, Fujimoto asked me happily. This guy, he’s expecting me to be in trouble. I’m sorry, but it’s definitely not that. <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Rather, why was that broadcasted within the school? In the end, after what happened over the weekend, we didn’t end up contacting each other. Today’s announcement must be a solution to that, right?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />After being called out by the goddess, I immediately make my way towards the staff room, find Hiiragi-chan, and walk to her side.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Sensei, what did you called me for?”</p><p class="calibre4">When I called out to the working Hiiragi-chan, she raised her head.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Geez, it’s not sensei, but Haru&mdash;ka, san….”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />She’s already broken down in the morning! I realized it midway, and made a panicked face. It’s good that her voice was not too loud and the staff room is empty, so no one found out.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />As usual, I pull over an empty chair that was beside me.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I need… to talk to you… about club… activi… ties.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />She’s so close to being completely gone that she’s talking like a robot!?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“About club activities?” I asked, puzzled as I sat down in the prepared chair.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“It’s about today’s activities.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />After starting off by speaking, she finished her words in writing.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />[Today, let’s eat lunch together, just the two of us!!]<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />It’s payback for being unable to spend time together over the weekend! Moreover, she’s being very forceful about it!<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“No, but, about <em class="calibre5">activities</em> today…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Wh-what about it…? Do you have problems with it?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Looking at me so sadly is such foul play. I give up. It isn’t like I don’t want to spend time with her either.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Alright.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Also, after school, let’s prepare for our next activity by heading out to go shopping.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Understood.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I’m looking forward to it ♪”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan who’s mood was suddenly improved, casually held my hand under the desk. Hiiragi-chan continued the conversation on top, but even when I tried to stand up at a good time, she never let go of my hand until the very last moment. She finally let go of my hand when the chime rang, and slipped something into my pocket.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />I insert my hand into my pocket as I make my way to the class. There was a note in it.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />[Come to the rooftop during lunch break, okay?]<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Rooftop? Is something there?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Sanada. Your face says that you’re not satisfied. Was she angry? I be she was angry. Hiiragi-chan. You’re hated by her now, right?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />First things first, I gave Fujimoto, who asked happily, a punch the shoulder with all my strength.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Oof… If it’s with your left hand, maybe you could do it, the world is…!”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Shut up.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Dazing off in class, and lazily answering the questions that came my way, it became lunch. I texted Sana, telling her that I had business during lunch, so I won’t be going to the home economics room.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />While taking caution of my surroundings, I head to the rooftop. I grabbed the door handle and tried to turn it and open the door, but it was locked tight as I expected. Tilting my head a bit, I see a person’s shadow on the other side of the frosted glass. Or rather, that was Hiiragi-chan’s silhouette .<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Password?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“What password?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“A-ah! … Who is Sanada Seiji-kun in love with?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Eh? That’s the password?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />The shadow was nodding furiously. More importantly, you don’t need a password if you know that I’m the only one that will come.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Umm… There person that I’m in love with, is Hiiragi Haruka-san.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Kufuu… T-that’s too much…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Is she getting shy, embarrassed? The shadow was writhing around in agony. You wanted me to say it, didn’t you!?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“V-very well…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />*kachin* The door was unlocked, and I finally arrived out onto the rooftop.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Oh you, Seiji-kun…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan, who was lying in wait, was now hugging me energetically.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“What do you mean by that!? You were the person who made me say it.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I mean, it would be bad if it was a different person, right?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“That’s true, but no one else would come here in the first place.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />It’s not like there’s anything on the rooftop to see. Besides, beyond the sorry looking iron fence, the only thing below was cold hard concrete, and a water tower. It was a place with terrible scenery. But now, Hiiragi-chan had prepared a picnic sheet on the ground and placed a bento on top of it.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“The key was given for when the contractor came for inspection. Other than that, there’s no other way to open it.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan showed me a key with the tag “rooftop” on it.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“But, why are we meeting on the rooftop today, again??”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />It’s fine it’s fine, she said she pull my hand and made me lay down in her lap as usual on the picnic sheet. The weather is nice. The sky’s so blue, it’s dazzling to my eyes.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“It feels good right? Being outside. Especially on the rooftop.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />*pat pat* She started a conversation as she pet my head.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />I asked her whether anything happened after I left.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“In the end, the fact that we were dating wasn’t found out. I just casually said that everything’s a lot more enjoyable when you have a boyfriend. To my sister that is.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Hiiragi-chan’s self accomplished face is also cute.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“But your sister definitely saw us kissing, right?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“D-don’t say that.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />However, if Natsumi-chan didn’t appear at that time, I probably would’ve been pushed down onto the sofa. Hiiragi-chan was that happy to be with me.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“But, I mean. I live from day to day, just to meet with Seiji-kun over the weekends.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“You would go as far as to say that?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Ah, but, I do remember. No time over the weekdays. Coming home, eating, sleeping, waking up, working, as I pass my daily life. Work wasn’t even that interesting.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />… There were many times where I would wonder what it was that I lived for. If me being here allows Hiiragi-chan to do better at work, then that would be good.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Yeah, having a purpose in living is important.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“That’s right~ If some hindrances appear, I’ll fly into a rage like a mother bear that wants to protect her baby bear.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Why are you using a bear as an example?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Seiji-kun, do you have something you live for, or look forward to?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Let’s see… maybe something like, I want to make sensei happy?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />She didn’t say her usual line of, it’s not sensei, but Haruka-san. In place of that, I was kissed. Staring at each other, we kissed two more times.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I-is that a proposal…?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />With her face turning red, Hiiragi-chan looked straight at me. Her eyes were serious.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“&mdash;T-too close…”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“G-geeeeeeez, Seiji-kun, you end up saying something like thaaaaaaaaaat.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />*poke poke*, *poke poke poke poke poke poke*.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />She might have been hiding her embarrassment as Hiiragi-chan started poking me consecutively with her index finger. I don’t mind her using her index finger to poke me but please, don’t pinpoint your finger at my nipple!<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Please graduate from high school sooner.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I’ll do my best.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“But, I’m quite happy for now though, okay?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“If that’s the case, then it’s good”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“… Do you want to see my panties?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I don’t! Why did you change the subject suddenly?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I just thought that Seiji-kun would be happy that way. I’m wearing pants today, but once it’s unhooked, it’ll quickly come off.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“No, it’s not like I want to see it, so it’s okay.”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Ah. I see I see… You can also peek if I pull down the zipper, you know?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I don’t want to peek at it either!”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Seiji-kun, so you’re this type of person when it comes to pants?”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“I don’t know what you’re talking about when you say this type of person!”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />“Seiji-kun is so cute when you’re seriously retorting at me~”<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Where’s the appeal in that at all?<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />In the end. She gave me a short glance. It was black.<br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" />Just like that, we spent our sweet lunch break together.</p>
