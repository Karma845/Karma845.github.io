<h3>Chapter 31 &#8211; A Day with a Cold</h3>

<p><em>“Today, I’m taking a break from school.”</em></p>
<p>After sending that message to Hiiragi-chan, I threw myself onto my bed. Whether it was because of the flirting that I ended up doing with Hiiragi-chan that night on the school trip, or because of some completely different reason, I ended up catching a cold.</p>
<p>“Eeeeeeeh… Nii-san, is he okay…?”</p>
<p>“It’ll be alright, it’s just a cold after all.”</p>
<p>From downstairs, I could hear the exchange between Sana, who was about to go to school, and my mother.</p>
<p>“If Okaa-san is going to work, then Nii-san will end up being alone, right? Sana, will look after Nii-san then.”</p>
<p>Unusually, Sana was saying something pretty considerate. I guess that since I caught a cold, she ends up showing a little bit of kindness… Oh little sister, you shouldn’t care about your brother and just go to school.</p>
<p>“If you’re staying at home watching him, then you’ll probably just be in your room playing games, right?”</p>
<p>“T-t-t-t-that’s not true! I’ll do both!”</p>
<p>Both of them. Stupid Sana, just go to school… I can’t even put any energy into my retorts… As the conversation continued it became farther away, until I completely lost conscious. I didn’t know how much I slept, but with a cold feeling on my forehead, I ended up waking up.</p>
<p>“Hot. Why don’t we measure your temperature?”</p>
<p>As I opened my eyes slightly, I ended up seeing Hiiragi-chan. It’s a dream… There’s school today, after all… Bibibi, I heard an electronic sound as something was stuck into my armpit.</p>
<p>“Muuuun… 38.7 degrees… it’s high…”</p>
<p>Goso goso, after a little bit of rustling, the blanket on top went supooon, as it was pulled off.</p>
<p>“A-as expected, Seiji-kun’s body… is nice…”</p>
<p>Susususu, she used a finger to trace my body. I ended up feeling a chill from cold weather or something else. D-don’t poke my nipples… Maybe it was because of my fever, but my vision was blurry.</p>
<p>“Let’s raise your arms.”</p>
<p>My arms were pulled up and a wet piece of cloth was stuck to my armpits. It’s cool.</p>
<p>“It feels so nice…”</p>
<p>“Hmmm? You’re awake?”</p>
<p>“… Hiiragi-chan… do your… work…”</p>
<p>“Even in your sleep talk you’re telling me to do work…? So serious…”</p>
<p>“… My throat… it’s dry…”</p>
<p>“Wait a moment.”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan, with her blurry outline, approached me.</p>
<p>Buchuu, and as our lips met, a liquid sports drink began flowing through the open mouth. It’s cold and tasty…</p>
<p>“O-one more time… alright?”</p>
<p>As I was kissed, I was once again made to drink the sports drink. It’s cold and tasty… Hiiragi-chan, won’t you end up catching my cold…</p>
<p>Ah, it’s a dream so it’s okay… A clattering sound was heard as someone pulled on the curtains and shutters. Then something began to move within my futon.</p>
<p>“Let’s sleep together.”</p>
<p>A fuzzy Hiiragi-chan appeared in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>“You’re work… at school… in the morning…”</p>
<p>“Even at a time like this you’re worrying about me…!?”</p>
<p>I was then caught as she began to pet my head.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright. If I do this, then you’ll become better soon, alright? Uuu. I would love to be just like this and continue to have you rest and take care of you like this.”</p>
<p>“Nii-saan, I brought back some medicine!”</p>
<p>Sana spoke in a loud voice from the first floor.</p>
<p>“Ueeh!? Sana-chan!? Didn’t you just leave the house! You probably instantly took a U-turn as you were going to school, right?”</p>
<p>Tototo, the sound of Sana’s footsteps could be heard.</p>
<p>“T-th-this is bad. What should we do… ah?”</p>
<p>Dotabata, and with some sound, Hiiragi-chan disappeared. As expected, it was just a dream…</p>
<p>“Nii-san, how are you feeling?”</p>
<p>From the door, Sana showed herself still in her uniform.</p>
<p>“You… what about school…?”</p>
<p>“I-it’s nothing, today is fine…”</p>
<p>That isn’t good, or that was what I wanted to say, but I only had the energy to leave it as an I see and let it go.</p>
<p>“Here, take this medicine. I think this will help with your fever.”</p>
<p>“Yeah… a little bit later… I can’t take it right now…”</p>
<p>“… Well, since you have a cold, it can’t be helped… S-sana will help you take it.”</p>
<p>Don, a loud sound came from the closet.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Just now, was there a big sound…?”</p>
<p>Saying that Sana forced something into my mouth.</p>
<p>“Your eyes, close them okay? Don’t open them. Definitely don’t open them.”</p>
<p>“Got it…”</p>
<p>Since I had no energy to resist, I did as I was told and obediently listened to Sana. Don don, there was a loud sound from the closet, but Sana paid no heed to it. If that Hiiragi-chan wasn’t a dream… then it would seem that she is in that closet.</p>
<p>There’s no way that’s possible. It’s currently a weekday morning. She should be working at school right now. Hiiragi-sensei, please do your best during class… With the soft feeling of something on my lips, some water entered my mouth.</p>
<p>“Swallow it properly.”</p>
<p>“… Yeah.”</p>
<p>“… A Nii-san that will listen to anything… is so cute…”</p>
<p>Don, another loud sound was heard.</p>
<p>“There’s been loud noises for a while now…”</p>
<p>“!!”</p>
<p>“It’s probably a… Zashiki Warashi…” [1]</p>
<p>“Those exist!?”</p>
<p>“Z-zashiki Warashiiii…!?”</p>
<p>“Ah. Just now, there was a voice…!”</p>
<p>“Please don’t push it any further…”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah… S-sana, d-didn’t see anything, nor did she hear anything!”</p>
<p>It can be said to be something that means good fortune, but if you look at it another way, it could be mistaken for another demon.</p>
<p>“… Sa-Sana, needs to go to school now, so Nii-san, make sure you take your medicine, okay?”</p>
<p>After taking a look around, Sana left the room with her bag in hand. Fui~, a loud sigh was heard.</p>
<p>“Since it’s easy for you to catch the cold, it really isn’t a good idea to feed water through the mouth, at least that’s what I think… Besides, you guys aren’t even lovers, moreover, you guys are siblings.”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan came out of the closet, and stared at the direction that Sana left in. What? Why did Hiiragi-chan, who’s supposed to be at school, come out of the closet…? Is the closet in my room somehow… connected to school…? There’s no way that’s true. Aah… I guess it’s a dream. Pin pon, pin pon, the doorbell rang and after a little bit a voice could be heard saying, “Sorry for the intrusion.”</p>
<p>“Who is it this time…?”</p>
<p>Once again, Hiiragi-chan entered the closet. Then, Kanata entered the room.</p>
<p>“… Seiji-kun, are you feeling alright?”</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming to see me…”</p>
<p>“… I brought over some medicine that might help with the fever.”</p>
<p>“Is that so… if it’s drinkable medicine, then I have some here…”</p>
<p>Like a dying medicine, I stretched out my arm towards the medicine that Sana had bought for me.</p>
<p>“… It’s okay. My father also had his fever go down because of this.”</p>
<p>What she ended up showing me was a long thin tablet. I-it’s suspicious… Kanata lowered her head.</p>
<p>“… Please.”</p>
<p>“Eh, eh, eh… what are you asking me to do?”</p>
<p>“Sei!”</p>
<p>Bishi, a shock ran through my head as I lost consciousness. Then, after what seemed to be a long sleep, it was the next day when I woke up. My fever has gone completely down, and it seems like I can go to school.</p>
<p>“Still, that was a weird dream…”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan coming in and out of the closet, getting kissed by Sana, and even getting knocked out by Kanata…</p>
<p>Well. I’m all better now, so it should be fine. Let’s forget it all.</p>
