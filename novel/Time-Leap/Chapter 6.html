<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Relaxed Park Date</h3>

<p>Of course, I there was no way I would be able to sleep because of Hiiragi-chan behind me.</p>
<p>Or, so I thought, but I had fallen into a somewhat deep sleep before I knew it, until I woke up to a nice smell.</p>
<p>It was still 7 in the morning.</p>
<p>I walked into the kitchen while rubbing my eyes. There, Hiiragi-chan was making something. The sight of a woman cooking from behind somehow gives a pleasing feeling.</p>
<p>“Ah. You woke up. Good morning, Seiji-kun.”</p>
<p>Chuu, she gave me a morning kiss.</p>
<p>“Wait, it’s still morning…”</p>
<p>“Three times, four times, together, together ♪.”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan seemed to be in a good mood.</p>
<p>“Breakfast?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Bentou. Since we’re going on a drive to a place where no one will be.”</p>
<p>A place with no one there? I wonder where she’s talking about. She told me that breakfast was already done, and so I looked at the table. There was toast, fried eggs, and a salad prepared.</p>
<p>“Ah, are you the type to brush your teeth first? If you want, you can use this.”</p>
<p>After rummaging around a bag from the supermarket, she brought out a brand-new toothbrush. Why did she already buy a toothbrush for me? Maybe, she already predicted that I would be staying over some time, and had already bought one long before today…?</p>
<p>“Such a bad teacher.”</p>
<p>“Today, I’m not a teacher ♡.”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan had already finished preparations for breakfast and by the time I ate and brushed my teeth, she had also finished preparing the bentous. With everything ready, we left her house. I got in her round mini car, and she started driving.</p>
<p>“Ummm, umm…”</p>
<p>Seeing her struggle to enter her destination into the navigation while waiting for the light, I take it from her and quickly enter it. Our destination was a green filled forest park just outside of the prefecture.</p>
<p>“Seiji-kun, you’re so good at navigating!”</p>
<p>I can’t tell her that in truth, I owned a car with navigation on it.</p>
<p>“Ah… I’m good with electronics that’s all.”</p>
<p>“That’s quite reliable… I’m so bad at it after all. Ahaha.”</p>
<p>It was just at the level of being able to operate the navigation. I didn’t think that it was as great as she was making it out to be. The drive lasted about two hours, and it was quite fun to say the least. She spoke about various different teachers and revealed different secrets about them to me. We also found out that we liked the same rock band. All in all, we both got pretty into it.</p>
<p>Finally, we arrived at the forest park. It was quite deep into the mountains, so maybe because of that, there weren’t very many cars in the parking lot.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan failed at backing up her car into the parking spot. “Haruka-san, are you perhaps, bad at this?”</p>
<p>“I-I’m not bad at it! Just not great at it.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s basically the same thing… what do you do when you commute to school?”</p>
<p>“I have someone else do it for me.”</p>
<p>Is she for real?</p>
<p>Giving the key to someone so that they can park it for you, it sounds like a celebrity, but in reality, she just can’t park.</p>
<p>“Switch with me.”</p>
<p>“Eh. Can you do it, Seiji-kun?”</p>
<p>“Well, just a little.”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan let out a shocked voice, but since there was no one else around, she switched with me and let me drive.</p>
<p>No, I have to say this but, Hiiragi-chan, isn’t this bad? You can’t let a high school student who doesn’t have his license drive, right? Well, having a teacher going out with a student is already forbidden, so I guess it’s like pouring water on a hot stone [1].</p>
<p>“Good luck!”</p>
<p>And, as soon as she said that, I parked the car instantly.</p>
<p>“Why!? How do you do it so cleanly…”</p>
<p>“Ummm… ah. It’s probably because of the driving games at the arcade. Yeah, that.”</p>
<p>“Heeeeeeh”</p>
<p>Racing games probably don’t have something so boring like parking, but I was able to convince her for now. I didn’t say that I could do it because I actually had a license.</p>
<p>“This is a secret, okay? Having a teacher let her student drive her car.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean, isn’t our relationship already a secret?”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s true.”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan laughed and stuck out her tongue. She’s so cute.</p>
<p>We walked for about 20 minutes while holding our bentous. After climbing a small hill, we sat down on a bench. Looking far out, a small town could be seen, and beyond that the ocean.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this a nice place?”</p>
<p>“Haruka-san, have you been here before?”</p>
<p>“Nope. I looked it up before, and made it one of the choices for us to go to today.”</p>
<p>… She had refused to go to the after party the other day. Hiiragi-chan, she was so ready to hang out with me today.</p>
<p>“Then, what’s this?”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan made me lie down on my side as she gave me a lap pillow.</p>
<p>“Do you not like it?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t like it but…”</p>
<p>“Then, it’s okay.”</p>
<p>This teacher, it feels like she doesn’t want me to do anything. Or so I thought, as she continued to feed me like a mother bird, continuing to put food into my mouth with her chopsticks.</p>
<p>“When I’m with you, I feel like I’m becoming worse and worse…”</p>
<p>“Keep eating, keep eating~♪”</p>
<p>“Is this alright?”</p>
<p>“Yup. Once you graduate, I’ll continue to take care of you ♡.”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan was the type of woman to make any man terrible.</p>
<p>“Then… I’ll leave it to you.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Until then, I’ll do our best to keep our dating a secret ♡.”</p>
