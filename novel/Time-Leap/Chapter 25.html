<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; Let’s Head Into the City (2)</h3>

<p>Heading into the shopping district, Hiiragi-chan and I walked side by side with our arms interlocked.</p>
<p>“It’s perfect! No one would ever notice!”</p>
<p>“Is that so…?”</p>
<p>I was somehow able to get out of crossdressing and was now wearing a cap to cover my eyes. That alone can’t give a perfect disguise, right? Hiiragi-chan was also wearing a disguise which included a wide-brimmed hat and a pair of sunglasses.</p>
<p>“This is the first time we’ve had a date in the town like this, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>Until now, we have only been together in places where other people wouldn’t notice.</p>
<p>“This way, this way, I have been wanting to go to a place around her for a while now.”</p>
<p>Excitedly, she pulled me along as we walked. The place that she wanted to go to seemed to be a crepe store. Hiiragi-chan was as excited as a child would be, as she waited her turn in line. She even ended up buying a portion for me. I took a bite of the crepe that she bought for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was good.</p>
<p>“You have cream on your face, you know?”</p>
<p>As I was being absorbed into the crepe, it seems like we’re going to do something cliché. Hiiragi-chan wiped off the cream that was stuck to my face with a finger and stuck it into my mouth.</p>
<p>“You weren’t going to lick it yourself?”</p>
<p>“Kufufufu”, she leaked out a strange laugh.</p>
<p>Since she seemed to be having fun, it can’t be helped. After that, we exchanged the crepes that we bought, then, after eating we entered into a clothing shop, and Hiiragi-chan seemed to be in good spirits through all of it. Because of the high tensioned sunglass wearing girl beside me, I drew more attention than usual.</p>
<p>“Next is this store!”</p>
<p>The store that she pointed to was a lingerie shop.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this a little bit too high of a hurdle…”</p>
<p>Disregarding my complaints completely, Hiiragi-chan grabbed my arm and ushered me inside. Uwaaah, the amount of pink that was covering my field of vision was quite troubling…</p>
<p>During all of my panicking, Hiiragi-chan ended up bringing two sets over.</p>
<p>“Well? Which one is better?”</p>
<p>“… Ah, yeah. Isn’t either of them alright…?”</p>
<p>“Eeeh~?”</p>
<p>“Umm, then, this one.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t look at it straight… rather, why did she want me to pick…? As a diverted my eyes, I noticed people that I recognized.</p>
<p>“Ummm, dear customer… the size of your chest is a little…”</p>
<p>“I-it’s fine, it’ll grow bigger after all.”</p>
<p>The person throwing a bit of a tantrum as they were conversing with the store clerk was my little sister.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, until it grows larger, a smaller size would be—”</p>
<p>“Please don’t mock Sana’s chest. I was told, I’ll grow bigger in high school, after all.”</p>
<p>How much are you expecting from your growth exactly? Rather, who told you that? She then took a sidelong glance over in this direction. Ah! She made a surprised face. This is bad. I was noticed…!?</p>
<p>“&#8230;. Sensei!”</p>
<p>That’s what she noticed!? In a panic, Hiiragi-chan waved back.</p>
<p>“Y-you’ve made a mistake. This isn’t Hiiragi.”</p>
<p>She’s so bad at hiding it!</p>
<p>“Eh, why are you hiding?”</p>
<p>Suka suka, Sana came in my direction.</p>
<p>As I was trying was trying to escape, Hiiragi-chan grabbed onto my clothes and held me back.</p>
<p>“If you leave now it would be suspicious.”</p>
<p>“No, but…”</p>
<p>Aaahh, Sana arrived.</p>
<p>“Sensei, you were wearing a hat, so I was wondering who it was. You were also wearing sunglasses as well.”</p>
<p>She gave a quick glance in my direction, then returned to looking at Hiiragi-chan.</p>
<p>“Today is… your boyfriend? Going shopping with him?”</p>
<p>Made it…</p>
<p>“Sana-chan also wanted to buy underwear?”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan grasped her hat with two fingers like Jigen [1]. Then, she made a posed expression.</p>
<p>… It seems like she thought it was cool.</p>
<p>“That’s right! Nii-san was making fun of me, so I came to buy some.”</p>
<p>“Heeeh, is that so? Sanada-kun? He was making fun of you?”</p>
<p>Please don’t look this way with such a teasing expression.</p>
<p>“T-that’s right…”</p>
<p>“You want to show it to Sanada-kun?”</p>
<p>Sana seemed embarrassed as she fidgeted around.</p>
<p>“I-i-it’s not like I want to show him… but, Sana just want him to check it while it’s drying…”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan looked at me with eyes shining like glass.</p>
<p>“Checking his little sister’s underwear… I see, I see…”</p>
<p>I tried to shake my head without Sana noticing, but it didn’t seem like Hiiragi-chan saw me. She was looking somewhere else.</p>
<p>“The ones that Sensei are holding, both are quite cute.”</p>
<p>“Earlier, Onii-chan said that this one was good.”</p>
<p>Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey!</p>
<p>Hiiragi Haruka, come baaaaaack! A word that shouldn’t have been said was let out so easily! Gaku gaku, I grabbed her shoulders and shook her, but no matter what, the Hiiragi-chan’s soul would not return.</p>
<p>“O-onii-chan?”</p>
<p>The color of my face changed as I tried to make a follow up.</p>
<p>“Haruka-san’s brother, he was here a little earlier but went off somewhere.”</p>
<p>“Ah, is that so. Even though they’re siblings, she still shows it… I guess that kind of thing is normal…”</p>
<p>Sana, who had just graduated from sports bras, still didn’t understand the common sense behind bras it seems. … This could work. On behalf of the relieved Hiiragi-chan, I will extinguish the fires.</p>
<p>“But, showing it to your brother might not be normal…?”</p>
<p>Anyways, I need to get rid of the impression that I’m a siscon brother that checks his sister’s underwear. I probably can’t change it into Hiiragi-chan’s Friend A. I haven’t checked it though! It’s because Sana said something that could so easily be misunderstood.</p>

<p>“S-so it’s normal for it to be like that… then it was just that Sana didn’t know…?”</p>
<p>“A-also, Onii-san’s are only supposed to see it every once in a while, I don’t think it’s that they check it?”</p>
<p>“I see… So it’s like when Sana looks closely at Nii-san’s underwear and thinks… S-so he wears stuff like this… Stuff like that happens right?”</p>
<p>No, well, I don’t know how it is from the little sister’s perspective.</p>
<p>“Yeah, there is.”</p>
<p>I gave her a random suitable response.</p>
<p>“That’s good. Sana was worried that she was being a pervert…”</p>
<p>You were just one step away. Aren’t you worse than me? Since other stuff my spill out if we continue, I end up pulling Hiiragi-chan, who was still unfocused, out of the store. At some point, it had become evening and the amount of people had started to dwindle.</p>
<p>After we sat down on a park bench,</p>
<p>“What does it mean that you check Sana-chan’s underwear? Depending on the answer, Haruka-san might go and cry into her pillow, okay?”</p>
<p>Because she was spacing out the whole time, it seems that Haruka didn’t hear anything of what was going on.</p>
<p>“When she’s drying it, it just so happens that my eyes sometimes end up looking in that direction. That’s all. It’s not like I actually have any interest in them.”</p>
<p>“Really? You don’t end up rolling up the ones that are drying or putting them over your head?”</p>
<p>“I don’t. I don’t have any wish to do so either.”</p>
<p>“… However, when you were holding mine, it was different, right?”</p>
<p>“Well… it’s because it belongs to the person I like… that’s why I end up staring.”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan held down her chest. I don’t really understand why, but I somehow ended up moving her heart a bit.</p>
<p>“Seiji-kun… you’re so cute…”</p>
<p>After turning towards my back, she hugged me from behind. Chu, chu, Hiiragi-chan ended up kissing my neck.</p>
<p>“Wait. Come on. It’s the park. If it’s noticed—”</p>
<p>“That’s why we have a disguise, right?”</p>
<p>The moment that I turned around to try to warn her.</p>
<p>As if she was aiming for it all along, Hiiragi-chan gave me a kiss on the lips.</p>
<p>“Fungu!?”</p>
<p>“Nnn… ♡”</p>
<p>I diverted my face and retreated.</p>
<p>“We’re… in the park where people can—”</p>
<p>As I was showing just a bit of a gap, in the dim-lit park, Hiiragi-chan once again held down my lips. After calmly looking around, it could be seen that any of the nearby benches were filled with flirting couples. Without me knowing, I had taken the two of use to a place like this. After that, we had dinner at a restaurant and returned home.<br />
As I was reminiscing about the day within my room, a knock came from my door.</p>
<p>“Nii-san, I’m coming in…?”</p>
<p>“Eh? Aah, come in—Buu!? W-w-what are you doing? ”</p>
<p>Sana had come in wearing her only her underwear. Her cheeks were dyed in embarrassment as she put her legs close together.</p>
<p>“Y-you might not k-know, Nii-san, but doing something like this is n-normal. I just bought this underwear today… what do you think…?”</p>
<p>With her face looking down and her eyes turned up towards me, Sana looked at me. How does it look…? Should I say that it looks cute?</p>
<p>“… You, have a really really flat chest.”</p>
<p>“~~~~! N-nii-san’s and idiot!”</p>
<p>Sana got a cushion from the sofa.</p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate the power of <em>growth during high school</em>!”</p>
<p>“Who told you that?<em> Growth during high school</em> is a myth— buhe!?”</p>
<p>Sana hit me in the face with the cushion. No matter how much she moved, it wouldn’t shake, nor would it spill. Sana’s chest is safely set in place.</p>
<p>After that, the attacks from my half naked little sister continued in the form of kicks.</p>
