<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211; <strong>Hot Springs Trip With Hiiragi-chan (2)</h3>


<p>After enjoying a luxurious meal with many seafood dishes, it became time for a bath.</p>
<p>“Please go ahead and go first.”</p>
<p>Since Hiiragi-chan had said that, I ended up taking her up on the offer. As I was dozing off idly in the cypress bath, the door slid open with a loud noise.</p>
<p>“Wah. It feels better than I thought ♪.”</p>
<p>When I turned around, there was Hiiragi-chan, wrapped in a towel.</p>
<p>“Uwaahh!? Why!? Didn’t you say I could come in first!?”</p>
<p>“Well, I mean, if I came in first you wouldn’t come in with me, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>Ever since I started dating her, there are often times where I end up seeing her in her underwear, or with her panties in full view. However, having just one towel, seems even more erotic than being completely naked…</p>
<p>“I’ll clean your back for you. Come here.”</p>
<p>“You said to come…”</p>
<p>Everything for me was completely unguarded, what should I do? I had zero armor. I didn’t think that anyone would come in, so I didn’t bring a towel with me…</p>
<p>The body towel was now currently in Hiiragi-chan’s hand, being lathered in soap with full force. … It would have been fine if I was in my underwear, but I didn’t want Hiiragi-chan to see my important parts.</p>
<p>“Quickly, quickly.”</p>
<p>“I’ll wash myself so it’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Eeh. I was looking forward to this the most though… bathing together and washing each other’s back without caring…”</p>
<p>Dammit… isn’t that unfair? She said that to me, while knowing that I knew that she had worked hard to get to this point.</p>
<p>“…I’ll go over there, so… U-umm… C-can you close your eyes?”</p>
<p>“Seiji-kun, you’re so cute! It’s like you’re a girl.”</p>
<p>“Be quiet.”</p>
<p>Basha, I threw some hot water on her, to which Hiiragi-chan let out a “Kyah!”</p>
<p>“I’m not in a towel right now.”</p>
<p>“Heeh, I see… Eh? That means you&#8217;re completely out in the open!?”</p>
<p>“T-that’s right!”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan who was originally excited, screamed and her face turned red.</p>
<p>“W-why don’t you have one? Didn’t you know that I would come?”</p>
<p>“If I knew, I wouldn’t be this shaken.”</p>
<p>“I-I-I got it. I definitely, definitely won’t open my eyes.”</p>
<p>She kept her eyes shut as she hit the expensive looking wooden seat in front over her. It seems that <em>“I want to wash Seiji-kun’s back,”</em> ended up winning over <em>“I going to be embarrassed from almost seeing Seiji-kun’s most important part,”</em> I made my resolution and got out of the tub. With an agility that seemed like a crab, I moved myself and sat down in the seat.</p>
<p>“I-it’s fine. You can open them now.”</p>
<p>“Yeah… I will modestly carefully allow me to open my eyes.”</p>
<p>She was so modest it became almost incomprehensible.</p>
<p>“Wah. Amazing. It’s such a beautiful and wide back…”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>Goshi goshi, Hiiragi-chan began to wash my back.</p>
<p>“Is it too strong? Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s just right.”</p>
<p>“Is there anywhere that’s itchy?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. Rather, is this a beauty salon?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me as I move to the front.”</p>
<p>“You won’t be doing that.”</p>
<p>As she tried to move her arms beneath my arms, I grabbed them and stopped them in their paths. More importantly, the back. It’s basically almost touching… Since I’m starting to get a little bit excited, I wish she would separate a little bit…</p>
<p>“I’ll wash the front myself! Lend me the towel.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“If you do insist on washing the front, I’ll end up washing Haruka-san in the front as well, okay?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Unable to say anything, she handed me the towel. I’m glad that she understands. Once she finished washing, Hiiragi-chan adjusted the hot water for me. Because of how the towel was wrapped, it looked like it was about to fall… Moreover, the wet towel sticking to her seemed erotic…</p>
<p>Zazaza, after being washed by Hiiragi-chan, our positions switched.</p>
<p>“I-if you think it’s troublesome, you don’t need to wash me, you know?”</p>
<p>“Even after I said how much I didn’t want it, don’t you think that you running away from this is a little bit unfair, Sensei?”</p>
<p>She unwound her towel a bit and showed me her back. It was a pure white and beautiful back.</p>
<p>“Excuse meee.”</p>
<p>“Hyuu”</p>
<p>Goshi goshi, goshi goshi.</p>
<p>“How is it?”</p>
<p>“It might feel kind of nice.”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan tried to wrap herself a little more with her towel.</p>
<p>“How about here?”</p>
<p>I grab her elbows and raise them.</p>
<p>“The armpits are baaaad!”</p>
<p>“You’re arms are quite soft.”</p>
<p>“Mooooouu, don’t squeeze me like thaaaaat!”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan becomes really cute when she turns bright red to the ears, so I just had to tease her a bit. I was urged to go on ahead and to wait in the open-air bath. After a little bit, Hiiragi-chan also came. She seemed to have left her towel behind as she was holding her chest with her hands. I ended up seeing it, but quickly ended up diverting my eyes.</p>
<p>“You really reserved such a nice inn, Haruka-san.”</p>
<p>“It’s the only chance we’ll have for a while after all. Do you like it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Well, we were able to have this because Sensei worked hard.”</p>
<p>“When we’re alone, it’s not Sensei, but Haruka-san, right? Mou, you did that on purpose, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>I ended up saying that accidentally. Acting like she was angry, Hiiragi-chan grabbed my cheeks and squeezed them.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t me that worked hard, you know?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Then, who is it?”</p>
<p>She wrapped our arms together inside the hot water, and leaned her head on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Seiji-kun, you motivated me to work hard.”</p>
<p>“Even if you said that, I didn’t do anything though?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. You being here for me, is already enough.”</p>
<p>“That’s just because you’re making it sound nice.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that ♪.”</p>

<p>Just like that we had some meaningless conversations between each other. The moon was out in the sky, and the atmosphere was outstanding as well.</p>
<p>“It’s starting to dizzy, so how about we get out?”</p>
<p>“Hiiragi Haruka is already… a little bit… light headed…”</p>
<p>“Eh, are you okay?”</p>
<p>She seemed a little embarrassed as she spoke in a small voice.</p>
<p>“I was leaning on you… so, I got a little hot… I’m definitely not alright… How about you?”</p>
<p>Saying something like that with her cheeks dyed red, I really think it’s so unfair.</p>
<p>“I’m also hot.”</p>
<p>Hiiragi-chan closed her eyes and stuck out her lips.</p>
<p>Answering her request, I gave her a quest.</p>
<p>“One more time…”</p>
<p>Chuu.</p>
<p>“More… It’s not enough…”</p>
<p>My reason was blown away by her sweet-sounding voice. After that, maybe because we flirted too much, but we both really ended up becoming light headed.</p>
