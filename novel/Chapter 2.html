<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; </h3>

<p class="calibre4">“All right, let’s start with a greeting.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Monday, early morning…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I turned off my alarm clock. Today, I woke up early with a determination that this will be my day.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The target is my sister, Akari.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Someone once said, “The things you want to accomplish are best to say out loud. Also, once you say it, you must strive to go for it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Okay, this will work.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I feel confident. It’s like the power is surging through my body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s as if someone is telling me, “You can do it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, I am concerned about one thing. That is the same thing yesterday.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry. You can do it… It’s a simple greeting, ‘Good Morning’. That’s all I have to say…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Greeting my family…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had no idea it would be such a challenging mission.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After rolling my sleeves, I took deep breaths five times. Now’s the time when Akari should be ready to leave. What should I do, if she saw me in the living room?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Don’t fret over little things, I had greeted her before like at her birthday party.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s all I have to say to convince myself. I made up my mind and grabbed the door…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“GACHA…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t expect her to be late.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t expect that Akari would come out of her room at the same time as me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Whoa! …….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My voice leaked out accidentally. It couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari heard me scream.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She took a step back in surprise and looked at me with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her expression lasted only for a few seconds before she turned her eyes away and went downstairs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">[Stay away from me.]</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her intimidation in this sheer silence was so frightening that I was unable to move a single finger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">No!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Don’t give up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Don’t repeat the same mistake as yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;Akari!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I unconsciously shouted. It was sudden like a gut feeling telling me to call her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was now or never…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I found myself in a dilemma.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I called her by her name for the first time in several years.</p>
<p class="calibre4">********</p>
<p class="calibre4">”As expected, she ignored you completely… then…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At Nanami’s words, I gulped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The scene from this morning came to my mind. I sank down on my desk with a sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I already knew it. If I try to say something, Akari will ignore me. But it hurts to see her commitment as she shunned me. I mean…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wasn’t much worried about being ignored. What makes me uncomfortable that if this continues then my future is uncertain…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I have to push through.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry, it can’t be helped. You’ve to gradually close the distance in this kind of relationship, right? Yusuke, you knew it wouldn’t work from the start, you can ask me, I’m here to help.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s a little different … I failed to implement Yoshiki’s advice right away. But consulting with both of them was not necessarily a waste of time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The only reason why I asked Yoshiki and Nanami was simply that I wanted to insure myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I have to stop Akari’s plan. To make it possible, I must show her that I was making an effort to get along. That way Akari’s “TRUST*” would collapse, and it might come in handy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’ll be a good thing if I could get the most out of it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">[#TN: reference to chapter 1]</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, stopping Akari’s plan is still the most obvious thing, But … In this way, changing the impressions of my friends will reap more benefits.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yusuke, what are you going to do now? Just because she ignores you once, doesn’t mean you have to give up, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I won’t. I’ll give it another try when we leave for home.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not a matter to falter just because she ignored me once or twice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rather, if she had responded to the greeting, I’d be worried about how weak Akari’s intentions were in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After school, I’ll try Yoshiki’s advice to leave together from school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Anyway, this week the club activities are off. thanks to that, I can spend some time with Akari after school.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’ll use this chance and slowly improve our relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… What’s going on?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was thinking about this, I saw a crowd of people in the direction of the cafeteria.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Students usually enjoy and relax when school is over. Especially couples who stand out among the crowds. But now there seems to be a group which was the center of attention.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Is that… Akari?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari, she was in the center of the crowd.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was a large number of students gathering. But I don’t think they’re surrounding her, rather they’re trying to approach her in fondness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And, no, they’re definitely not her friends.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Come to think of it, Yoshiki once told me that multiple fan clubs adore Akari.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that time, I thought of it as a ridiculous joke, but now that I’ve seen it, I understand. I may be a heretic in their perceptive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, this is a huge problem.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Today I was planning to bump into Akari while leaving school, making it look like a coincidence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I could’ve asked her to come home with me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But this event is trying to change my plan before it even started.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Namiki-san, are you leaving for home right now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I moved closer to the crowd, I heard their conversations.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then Akari replies to the female student.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”…Well, yes, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s been about four months since Akari entered high-school. This is the first time I’ve seen her talk to someone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hid behind a nearby seat so that Akari and the others wouldn’t find me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, what do you usually do, Namiki-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Usually?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I’m curious about it as well. I’d like to know how you spend your holidays”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, no private questions!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">What’s up with these questions?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I watch movies at home.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Movies is it…? Oh, it must be cute pets soothing videos, and such! I sometimes watch them too!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Too bad for ya! She watches soothing videos of this “Onii-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari is still not very friendly, but she’s enduring their questions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was quite surprising.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…And it seems like she’s definitely not enjoying this conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… And how about keeping a diary?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A diary. If you ask me whether she keeps a diary or not, then my answer is yes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Though, It’s just a record of my daily routines.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”By the way, Namiki-san, do you have any brother or sister?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">One of the girls asked this question and it piqued my interest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Compared to Akari, I have almost no presence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even at school, there is no way I can stand out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it’s frustrating, these idiots probably don’t even know I exist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No one other than the schoolgirl who asked this question seems to mention me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… I have a big brother.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh, now you’re going to answer honestly?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, it’s true, she can’t lie in this situation. It’ll be a hassle if it gets exposed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hee~! Namiki-san’s Onii-san, then he must be a pretty cool guy!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’d love to see him!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sight of this unseen brother excites a group of female students.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m sure they’ll get bamboozled when they see me. I’m not a cool handsome Onii-san, just a regular male highschool student. Sorry to disappoint you girls and don’t get so high about my looks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I stifled the urge to say so and listened to the story.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”…… I’m not on good terms with my brother. I don’t think I’ll be able to live up to your expectations.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari showed some displeasure in her expressions. The people who heard it said, “I won’t hate you Namiki-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong with your brother?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is he a bully?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Wait a minute…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hold on…</p>
<p class="calibre4">What the hell are they talking about?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m not the perpetrator, I’m the victim, you know.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then a guy came forward and said, “Don’t worry Namiki-san. Rest assured. If your brother tries to harm you, I will protect you. If you wish, I can teach him a lesson as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He looks like he’s from an athletic club.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He must be eager to earn charm points by coming forward as a bodyguard. That irritating face of his is full of confidence like he’s saying, “you can count on me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">To be honest, I’m only able to exercise at a humanly acceptable level. I’m not sure I’d be able to win against that guy if he came at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You dare to teach him a lesson, is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari murmured in a chilling voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that moment later, the surroundings froze as everything stopped moving.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Uh, um, … is something wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">That guy probably didn’t expect that response from Akari. That ugly confidence is nowhere to be seen as he looked around in a panic.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…No, whatever. I was just thinking about my brother for a minute.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">For a moment, Akari shows her killing intent, but she immediately returns it back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Ah, that’s right! Um, I think we should stop talking about your brother.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, right. Besides, it’s time we should go home.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After that event of awkwardness, all students started to leave in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As for Akari, her expression was the same as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Well then, Namiki-san, See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hm..”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After school, I saw from a distance how that group had disbanded in front of the station.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…… Eh? Could it be that they were following Akari? And not her real friends.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But what about me now…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari is standing there alone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I should behave like it is a coincidence that we met here. Just a coincidence that we met by chance because we were going the same way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t have the time to make an excuse to anyone, I went up to Akari’s side and got on the train.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The purpose, of course, is to spend some time with Akari.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Should I say, “Ah! … What a coincidence. I didn’t know that Akari was in the same coach.” That’s right, I could do that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I am traveling in the same coach as Akari but it’s hard to talk to her on the train. I guess as soon as I get off the train, I’ll bump into her and start a conversation. Yes! That’s right, let’s go with this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was surprising, Akari was getting a lot of attention.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked at the men around her. Everyone from students like us to office workers, they were all looking in her direction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Well, when you look at it like this, you can see that Akari’s appearance is actually quite outstanding.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I see her face almost every day, and I don’t think there’s something different … but in this situation, after what happened today, I think she looks quite attractive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Next stop is Shinome. Shinome Station.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oops, we’re almost at the station.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Okay, let’s go for it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I go down on the platform and get fired up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I followed her through the gates.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, Akari!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I continue “I happened to see you,”</p>
<p class="calibre4">And so I called out to Akari, who was walking in front of me as if I had seen her by chance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She heard my voice and stopped for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But then, she walks again just like what happened this morning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, You know, we’re going home the same way, do you want to come with me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t greet her properly, but walking together is a different story. Our destination is the same, so it should be natural to invite her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari didn’t reply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She kept her mouth shut and increased her pace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”No… by the way, it’s been a long time since we are walking together.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I walked by her side, I told her a few words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She ignores them, of course, but I don’t want to give up just yet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”You’re not in any club, right? But today you’re quite late.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, today’s my day off. I had to stay at school for a few things, that’s why I’m late this time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">No reaction, as usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her gaze remained straight as if she didn’t realize that I’m right next to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After being ignored so thoroughly, I feel tempted to make her reply, even if she was wilful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Speaking of which, Akari…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just as I was about to ask her about the confession from Yamamoto-senpai, I heard a horn from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I turned around, I saw a car approaching us at a fairly fast pace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Watch out… !”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a narrow alleyway.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In just a matter of time, I grabbed Akari and pushed her to the wall to protect her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was distracted in the conversation with her, but if I had reacted a bit later, it could have been a close call.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hah… It was dangerous. Akari are you all right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The car disappears from view and I turn to the front to adjust my stance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari, were you okay?</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was about to ask that question, I saw Akari, who was standing and slumped against the wall, with her face bright red.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked closely at her face that was almost touching mine. Her moist eyes, the glossy plump lips, the pure white skin that makes you want to unintentionally touch, she’s right in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We were so close that our lips almost overlapped.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Only then I realized the significance of what I had done.</p>
<p class="calibre4">… Isn’t this what you call “Kabedon”?</p>
<p class="calibre4">(EN: Kabedon, basically a “forceful” way in which a guy (usually confesses)corners the girl against a wall with 1 hand on the side of the wall. I am pretty sure you people might have read it in mangas)</p>
<p class="calibre4">”I-I’m sorry!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hurriedly moved away from Akari.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although it is getting darker, this scenery is relatively bright. That’s why we can see each other’s faces firmly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That…Akari?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari, who is still standing with her flushed face, seems to be unable to answer like she has no voice, rather than ignoring my question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The silence continues for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”~~~!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She let out a silent scream and ran away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I did it”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The first day of the strategy to gradually shorten the distance. It wasn’t the distance between the minds, but the physical distance…</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s the end of today’s story…</p>
<p class="calibre4">That night, in Akari’s room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">[ July 6th, Monday</p>
<p class="calibre4">What should I do … I never thought that Onii-chan would talk to me so suddenly …</p>
<p class="calibre4">I ignored him without a second thought, but I hope he won’t hate me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’ve been keeping my distance all this time to carry out my plan, but now… I wonder what’s happening.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Could it be that… Onii-chan is also interested in me?</p>
<p class="calibre4">He used Kabedon… Maybe he’s really?]</p>
<p class="calibre4">NO, that kabedon was an accident!</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t mean to do it!</p>
<p class="calibre4">But by the way, Akari, the text in today’s notebook is very sloppy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">[ But, it might interfere with my plans…</p>
<p class="calibre4">For now, I have to continue to pretend that we’re strangers whenever he tries to call out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Anyway, I’m glad that Onii-chan spoke to me after a long time. I really love you ♥️]</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was some progress.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the past week, day or night, I tried to call out to her without any particular reason. But, it would look suspicious to do this every day, so I just took a day off.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, Akari never replied to me. Not even once.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But, “the notes” tells a different story. Akari is troubled, and the evidence is that since the first day I called out to her, her sentences have become funny.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In short, this experiment was somewhat successful, though there is still no visible change.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This situation is pretty weird. If this continues, nothing will change.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nanami replied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I considerably changed the information and discussed it with her. Since I can’t tell Nanami about “the note”, as a result, I only tell her that I kept saying hello to her and I’m slowly starting to see some reactions.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Because if you don’t speak in the first place, you won’t even have a decent conversation …”</p>
<p class="calibre4">We can’t get closer if we don’t even talk.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I continue to greet her, perhaps there is a possibility that Akari might respond, but I think it would waste too much time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’ll be meaningless if I don’t get the results before she starts to suspect me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”So… let’s see. How about if I step in?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mediate?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I’ll help you directly. I said this before, remember? We’ll go with that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, this weekend?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yup.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nanami laughs while waving her hands, and says, “Well, there’s no guarantee it will work.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I appreciate the thought, but I’m honestly worried… It’s my fault because I’m hiding the truth, but she’s right, for us siblings to get along we need help from a third party.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, we need new ideas, and try different actions. We’ll talk again after school, just wait for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After saying that, Nanami leaves.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Guess I’ll leave it up to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, let’s go to class now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">.</p>

<p class="calibre4">.</p>
<p class="calibre4">.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she said, Nanami indeed called out to me after school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, she didn’t tell me what she was going to do and got ready to leave.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re going home… I thought you were going to help me out?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I asked her that, she replies</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course I’ll help you. Let’s go to your place.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a matter of course, Nanami uttered this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My place?… Wait! What are you gonna do, Nanami?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m still thinking about it, but is there a problem?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, no, no, that’s very bad.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’ll get very bad if someone comes into my room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After all, My room is still being closely monitored by surveillance cameras.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s impossible to let anyone in such a room… If by any chance Nanami finds out about the hidden cameras, it’ll get very troublesome.</p>

<p class="calibre4">And, then, there’s a microphone as well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If we discuss “The plan to get along with Akari” in my room, Akari will learn about this and it’ll be game over.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now that you mentioned this, it’s been a long time since I’ve been to your room… when was the last time… ah! Since elementary school, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s right, I was careful not to invite Nanami to my house.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The thing is, Nanami… are you really going to come? Look, there are other options for you to help us out too…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I desperately try to find an excuse to stop her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Nanami ignores me and continues.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm, what did you say? Come on, let’s go!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can’t go, my room is off-limits to strangers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the way to our home, I tried to make an effort to divert Nanami’s attention, but it was all for nothing. The next thing I knew, I had arrived at her home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We stopped by Nanami’s house, as she had to sort out some things, and ended up coming back within five minutes. This didn’t even give me time to think of a viable plan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, arriving at Nanami’s house is the same as coming to my house, because we’re neighbors.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Hm? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s nothing…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She gives me a suspicious look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">”What? Could it be that you’re hiding something you don’t want me to see?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She grinned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the thing she meant is the so-called “R-18” stuff. Which most of the high school boys want to hide.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wholeheartedly agree that it was still better to be in a situation where they were hiding an erotic book.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But now that I’ve come this far, it can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, I have to make sure that Nanami doesn’t find out about the surveillance cameras and microphones at all costs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry to bother you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I opened the front door and checked the shoe rack, I didn’t see any of Akari’s loafers. Perhaps she hadn’t come home yet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I checked the living room to be sure, but I couldn’t see my mother, let alone Akari. It seems that we are the only ones in this house right now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your room is still upstairs?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Yes, it hasn’t changed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Okie!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She said as she quickly climbed up the stairs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nothing is “Okie” for me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Or rather, I feel that the original purpose of cooperating with me has been switched to checking out my room. That’s how quick Nanami thinks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”It’s been a while since I’ve been in here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I open the door and look around the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A study desk, a bed, a bookcase… Oh, wait a minute. That bookcase, I don’t want her to look at it too much because there’s a camera set up on it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Nanami took a quick look at them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sigh…It’s just a normal room.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She muttered boringly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve told you, there’s nothing there ……. I didn’t want to invite too many people over simply because it’s next door to Akari’s room.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh, so the next to it is still Akari’s room.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, but I don’t think she’s home yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see”, and Nanami glanced at the wall and sat down on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ah, that’s…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Nanami, why don’t you sit over here instead ?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">”What? I don’t mind. But… Yusuke, you don’t want me to sit on your bed?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh, kinda, I guess.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s the perfect place from which she could find out about the camera hidden inside the clock.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t check the footage with my own eyes, so I don’t know for sure, but Akari wrote in her notebook that among the cameras installed in this room, that position provides the most “spectacular” footage.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s… what’s the best footage to watch. Is my room some kind of playground?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, Nanami…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, I don’t have time to waste.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t know when Akari will return, so I have to ask her about the details of her plan before then.</p>

<p class="calibre4">”You said you were going to help me, but what exactly are you going to do?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, come to think of it, I haven’t explained it to you yet. But even if I say that this strategy is not likely to be executed, because Akari-chan has not come back yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean? Why Akari?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You want to speak with Akari, right? Well, it won’t happen without her.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“First of all. Yusuke, do you know why you’re being ignored by Akari-chan?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s because she doesn’t like me, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ignore the actual reason.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, that. So, then tell me, do you know why Yusuke is disliked by Akari-chan?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… As I said before if I knew that, I wouldn’t have a hard time. I’m worried about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I told her, she said, “There it is!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">And continues,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know. Yusuke and Akari-chan were close when they were little. By the time we were in junior high school, you had grown apart from Akari, so I don’t really know much about her after that, but at least we weren’t close in the past.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Back in elementary school, or… I’m pretty sure I was talking normally with Akari back then, too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, when Yusuke and Akari-chan were in junior high school, Akari suddenly started to distance herself from you. But isn’t that strange?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Strange?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There must be a reason why the sister who loved her brother so much suddenly became distant without any sign.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nanami continues,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It should be puberty, but isn’t that a long time to be…? I think there’s a family reason that you don’t know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nanami’s reasoning was really spot on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t know on what basis she is saying this, but at least it’s not a mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari’s stubborn attitude is for a good reason. She’s right that she doesn’t simply dislike me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…I mean, isn’t this storyline a little wrong?</p>
<p class="calibre4">And as I was continuing to question and answer with Nanami, I heard a voice from the first floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh. Maybe Akari-chan is back home?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I don’t know, it could be my mother.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Or rather, I want it to be my mother. In fact, it’s even better if Akari doesn’t come back right now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Either way, we need to check it out. Yusuke, can you go and see?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">”… Hm. Okay, I’ll go.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I left very unenthusiastically.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My footsteps down the stairs were awfully heavy, and the door to the living room felt massive as if it was made of steel.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I opened the door, it wasn’t my mother, but Akari.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was surprised when the door suddenly opened and her gaze shifted to this side.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But, as usual, when she noticed my presence, she turned her eyes to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Ah, Akari…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can’t go back to my room without saying anything, since it’s Akari who came back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For now, I have to tell her the most important thing at present.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Actually… Nanami is here and right now she’s in my room.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">*Gasp*</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari stopped, she was going to the kitchen, but now she stopped with a snap and turned around to look at me with tremendous momentum.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akari, who is always calm and does not show any impatience, now is looking at me with a panicked expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What happened…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can’t help but get surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Ha!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">However, she took a deep breath, and quickly regained her usual calmness, and turned away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Looking back at the Kabedon incident the other day, it seems that Akari is the type of person whose impatience shows in her attitude. She seems to be vulnerable to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, I’m really sorry for the sudden intrusion. I have to call her now, she wants to talk.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, it’s Akari-chan! Long time no see!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was asking Akari, the person of the topic came into the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”… Hi, it’s been a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nanami looked at me and turned again to reply. Although Akari had been stubbornly keeping her mouth shut when I talked, but, it seems that this was not the case with Nanami.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She showed the same poker face as usual and looked at Nanami again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”It’s been a long time since the three of us got together like this. Since I became a junior high school student, I’ve become estranged from Akari-chan…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nanami said so, but honestly, I have never seen them getting along with each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This is because until now, Akari has never wanted to get along with Nanami. It seems that she is not on good terms with her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Obviously… I’m the reason.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems that Nanami is “the greatest enemy” to Akari. I saw it in “the note” several times.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, the girl who is closest to me is and always has been Nanami…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… So, Haruse-san. You want to talk to me about something, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akari asked Nanami, who didn’t try to talk about her business.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the way, even though she said that she would cooperate, I hadn’t heard the important content yet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Hey, Akari-chan. Would you like to go on a date with Yusuke and me, just the three of us?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Eh?”</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Going on a date with a girl on a holiday, isn’t it just wonderful?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Now….</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">&nbsp;How about a date with two girls, well… isn’t that like a harem?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And what if I tell you both the girls are extremely pretty… that should be even better, right?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But… It would have been perfect if the beautiful girls aren’t my younger sister and a childhood friend.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">On Friday evening, Nanami proposed, “Let’s go on a date, just the three of us”.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari tried to reject the proposal, saying, “…No, Why should I go with the two of you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As she was about to reject the offer, my mother returned. And the situation developed in our favor… I think?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh my, Nanami-chan! It’s been such a long time! Aha! Maybe the three of you are planning to go out on Sunday? It’s such a good idea to get along with each other.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Thus, it was settled by my mother’s serious tone. Akari, who had rejected the proposal, quietly went along with Nanami’s invitation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And because of this, I was able to appeal to my mother that I was gradually improving my relationship with Akari. But I’m sure Akari was lamenting the fact that it interfered with her plans.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">With that in mind, I opened “the note”.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">[ July 10, Friday</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">I’ve been having a lot of interactions with my Onii-chan. Because, I feel like he’s giving a lot more attention to me, what happened to him?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">I’m not sure, maybe… Onii-chan has fallen for me.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">What should I do ?… What about my plan… but to make him mine, I’ve to go with the plan.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">But I can’t, because of some unexpected reasons, I am going on a date with Onii-chan ❤️.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Onii-chan, you’ve become much more manly, Kyaaaa! I’m going crazy ……❤️.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Love you ❤️.]</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That was some horrible misinterpretation listed here.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami, who invited you in the first place, was listed in the note as “unexpected reasons”.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The way it’s written, it sounds like a date between just the two of us, right?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I want you to apologize to Nanami.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">…Well, at any rate, isn’t it helpful that she had the wrong idea that I’ve fallen for her?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s a relief that Nanami isn’t mentioned in the note. And if things go as I plan, then she will have to abandon her plan.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, apart from the plan, I have a bad feeling that some other problems may arise.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">***</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was just before 11 o’clock according to the hands of the clock.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There’s still some time left…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wonder if this was Nanami’s plan, but meeting at my house was kinda bad. Not sure if she will be coming to pick us up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">While wondering I left my room to kill some time in the living room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ah!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I stepped into the living room, I saw Akari there. She had already made the preparations. I was surprised.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She was sitting on the sofa, in her casual outing clothes. How typical of her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, she ignored me and continued to watch TV.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">For a moment, I thought I should go back to my room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">&nbsp;Well… isn’t this the right time to start a conversation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">So I sat down on the adjacent sofa.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I pondered for a moment about the Kabedon incident the other day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Apparently, Akari is vulnerable to unforeseen circumstances. Normally, she shows a calm and composed face, but when an unexpected event occurs, she panics and her proud poker face crumbles.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">So, now’s the best chance to interact with her in a slightly different manner. I’m sure she will ignore me if I behave normally, so I should say something that would make her aware of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Words that I never say, but that are perfect for this moment… well then, let’s try it out.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Akari..!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I called her, who was sitting on the sofa,&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You look great in that outfit. That’s cute.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s not unnatural to compliment a girl’s outfit before a date. Even if the partner is my sister. So just keep it that way.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And to tell you the truth…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">My sister Akari, she’s a perfect beauty, and anyone who has seen her get the same impression that she’s super cute.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">So I praised her honestly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She doesn’t seem flustered and was looking at the TV screen with a resolute expression on her face, but with a slight blush.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I had predicted that much… but it was embarrassing for me to say it upfront.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Oh, what’s that… there’s a weird smile on your face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Are you holding back?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There was complete silence. I don’t know if a person who was praised by me should be embarrassed to shut up. I was disappointed and had no more words to say.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I mean, she’s obviously wiggling, even if you didn’t know about “the note.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wonder what’s in her mind…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And for those who were in trouble, I’d like to say…</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">&mdash;&mdash;Ping-pong.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The bell of salvation rang.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, it must be Nanami!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I mumbled and headed to the front door.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Phew, thank goodness…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Good morning, Yusuke.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I opened the door, there was a very beautiful girl standing there.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s not that this is the first time I’ve seen her on holiday. Maybe because of the Kabedon incident, I have been tempted to look at Nanami that way as well.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">In contrast to Akari, she has a rough style dressed in brighter colors. Somehow, I feel that both of them have a personality in their clothes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Thank you, it was nice of you to be here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, It’s fine. What about Akari-chan?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…Wait a minute, I’ll go get her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I turned around…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Sorry I made you wait.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">At the right time, Akari appeared on the scene.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Alright, now that the three of us are here, let’s get going.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Guided by those words, we left my house.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami and I walked side by side, with Akari following us behind.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Now then… what’ll be our destination?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ehm…, Akari-chan, is there anywhere you wanted to go?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">On the way to the station, Nanami asked Akari.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Since there is no exchange between me and Akari, we’ll be talking in patterns… “Akari and Nanami” then “me and Nanami”.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It is like a foolish word game, but with this, you can understand the content of the message by listening to the conversation beside you without bothering to face another party. So that’s the only way possible.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, nothing in particular.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She snapped off with her usual lack of affability.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm, that’s fine. By the way, what about you, Yusuke?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Same for me… I don’t have a specific place in mind, so I’ll leave it to you, Nanami.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Okay, then how about the shopping mall in front of the station? We can just hang out there without any reason.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Indeed that’s a good place.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The mall offers a wide variety of fashion items such as bags and shoes, games, and miscellaneous stores. Also, there’s a big restaurant as well.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s a popular place.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well then let’s go!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Thus, the destination is decided.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">A very long day was about to begin…</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After some time, we arrived at the mall.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, we’re here, but there’s a…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That’s a hell of a lot of people as far as my eye can see as if there’s a festival.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’ve been thinking about hanging out with no particular goal in mind… but now looking at the situation… we will just get tired of it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I wanted to eat something, but as you can see, the restaurant might be full as well.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Indeed, it’s about lunchtime, and it will be crowded at this hour.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Why don’t we go to the store first and explore a little?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I agree with Nanami’s opinion. Akari remains silent, but in this case, it’s okay to say she agrees.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“So where should we start?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I don’t have a particular store I want to go to just like Akari. Well, it’s better to follow Nanami.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm, will you guys be fine?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I don’t mind.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It sounds awfully implied.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Is it okay with you, Akari-chan?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I don’t care.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Okay, then follow me! It’s just over there.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">So we followed Nanami and arrived at…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Swimsuit store? Wha&mdash;why?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I learned in an instant when I saw the mannequins placed outside the store. It is a store that deals with swimwear. And we’re in… a women’s store.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s the most popular store in the city. Summer vacation is coming up, and I’m thinking of buying a new swimsuit.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Wait Nanami, I said I’m fine anywhere but… this place is a bit…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s fine. See, there’s a guy over there too, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Looking at the store, I saw a few male customers. However, they were with their girlfriends.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, I’ll wait outside, you girls go check the swimsuits…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nope… You’ve to choose our swimsuit.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Why?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s how it is! You have to help me choose the best one, that’s the reason we come here, you get it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Choose? But why me?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Wait a minute…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I was confused, Akari, who had remained silent, says,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I just heard, We!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Huh? Don’t you want to buy one? Ok then it’s just me, I don’t mind.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami answered casually.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s fine, I’ll check something as well.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari went ahead and entered the store.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Leaving me and Nanami behind, Akari quickly went into the shop. It can’t be helped. When I was about to follow Akari into the shop, Nanami whispered…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“By buying swimsuits to show others that you liked Akari-chan… Isn’t this a good excuse for a date?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Excuse for a date? You mean we’re going for a swim?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah, that’s why I’m also considering buying a swimsuit.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami laughed while saying that, and I could only smile bitterly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Maybe there’s something else in her mind…&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">So it’s been about fifteen minutes since I entered the store. I’m not sure how many men are here, but this store is only selling women’s swimwear.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s such an awful feeling of being left out.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hey! Which one you prefer?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Amid the restlessness, Nanami walked over to me with two swimsuits in her hands. Both are cute bikini-type swimsuits … I wonder if I have to decide.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Umm…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami had two outfits in her hand, but both are totally different.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">One was a slightly flashy swimsuit with flower patterns.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The other was a plain white, adult swimsuit.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">To be honest, I think Nanami would look great in any of them… probably she’ll reject that answer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m going to try it, let’s see what you think.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Seeing me unable to decide, Nanami turned to the dressing room. Ah, I knew it, this is getting out of the way…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, last year I saw her in the swimsuit, so it should be… fine.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I remembered that last year I went to the beach with my club members.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Come to think of it, Nanami at that time seemed to stand out from the rest of the club members.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Perhaps everyone will go somewhere again this year. I’m not sure if I’ll swim or not, but if so, I have to choose my swimwear.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">…Yeah! Let’s choose it seriously.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I followed Nanami and waited in front of the dressing room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm? Akari you’re going to try as well.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari silently entered the other dressing room. She was also holding two swimsuits.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This is a good thing, I wonder if I should also choose a swimsuit for Akari.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m not sure which one is better,” Nanami said,&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari keeps silent.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Maybe I should just look for something as well, but it might be a bit awkward.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“He~ya, how’s this?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The curtains open from both sides.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">”How is it? Does it look good on me?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">First Nanami unveiled her flowery swimsuit. It’s a perfect fit just like her cheerful personality.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I think it’s good. It looks good on you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I can’t help but be attracted to her figure.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nLJr4MF/099-1.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Heck, I’ve seen her in a swimsuit last year, and I’m sure I’ve been used to it since I was little… Why am I so embarrassed right now?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I wonder if it’s good…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami checked her appearance while looking in the mirror.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wonder what? You look great!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’ll try the next one, as well.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">With that said, she closed the curtain and went back to change.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This mission to choose a swimsuit is more difficult than… I imagined.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">&mdash; I should think a little harder.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Suddenly, I felt a glance from behind. Wait! which means…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I turned around, my eyes met with Akari, who was looking at me in her swimsuit. She noticed my gaze and quickly looked away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari was wearing a black swimsuit that looked great on her.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Basically, she is the type who doesn’t wear clothes with a color that stands out, but this time the swimsuit is a different option.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You-u have changed! Perfect! You look cute!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s a far cry from when I complimented her outfit at home this morning. My tone slipped a little…&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">My eyes were fixed on her…&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Idiot! Stop staring at her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Even if she’s my dating partner for a day… She’s my sister. It’s not good. I desperately try to tell myself, but I’m really embarrassed about her look I’m not used to, and I was unknowingly staring at her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">At the same time, she also turns to look at me, and our eyes meet again…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Our eyes were interlocked. And both of us were unable to speak.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This mood, how can I explain? And that was when…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“This one is good, too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I suddenly overheard a female customer choosing a swimsuit from the next row.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yes, but isn’t that a little too revealing?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s fine! It looks good on you!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Hmm, just a normal customer. It’s nothing to be worried about.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s supposed to be…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">”&mdash;&mdash;!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Hearing the voice, Akari suddenly pulled my arm and closed the curtain. She seems to be in a hurry, and I get confused about what’s going on.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">”Ah, Aka&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Then, as I was about to raise my voice, Akari’s covered my mouth with her hand.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The awkward atmosphere that we had earlier suddenly disappeared.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Ah, I don’t know why the rush? But this position is a little bad.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">To begin with, the dressing room is for one person to use. Obviously, the size is not enough for two people.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Also, Akari is currently in a swimsuit… in other words, she’s exposing everything except the important parts.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ok, I get it… I’ll be quiet, so…please”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She finally realized the situation and tried to distance herself from me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Wait… it’s dangerous.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She was about to hit the wall with great momentum… I grabbed her hand and pulled her towards me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Ah! Thank goodness.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Are you okay?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I protected her from falling. However, as a result, we were hugging each other…&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Our eyes met… her moist eyes were shining and her cheeks were blossom red.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The time stopped at that moment.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ah! Well… “</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I carefully release her by making sure not to bump into the wall and remove the arm that was behind her back.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Stop looking a little sad… Don’t give me that regretful look…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s… no good. I know what she’s thinking. Her face is easy to read… especially in a situation like this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I turned away and peeked through the curtain. Then, a female customer who seems to have been talking earlier comes into view.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Oh, I see, that’s what it was all about.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The two girls look familiar.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">They were those girls who had gathered around her in the past.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’m not exactly sure, but looking at Akari’s reaction, that’s probably the right thing to say. Obviously, she would behave like that if anybody saw her choosing a swimsuit with a boy.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Of course… with a guy like me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, this is a women-only store. If by any chance there is a man in the dressing room, it could be a bit of a fuss.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I can’t leave at this point, Nanami is in the other dressing room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And above all… Akari is next to me in her swimsuit.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Gulp, let’s wait for the right time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I took off my shoes and hid them while peeking through the gap.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Hmm, if I stay close to the curtain, there is a chance that I might get caught. Better keep a little distance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Thinking so, I stepped back towards the wall…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">”Hmph!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">An awfully soft feeling came through my feet.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was a feeling I had never felt before. I also felt it’s raw warmth.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What is this softness? It’s almost like a fabric.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was curious and looked down at my feet and saw…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ah!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">At the same time, I was about to scream.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The clothes that Akari had just worn were neatly folded and placed there. And the black… underwear that she was probably wearing a moment ago was below my foot.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There is no doubt about it. Right now I’m stepping on Akari’s…&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m sorry!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was bad that I panicked there.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The moment I moved my body to move my feet, I lost my balance. Because of the underwear.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">*Slip*</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">*Thud*</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was in a position to hug Akari as close as possible.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The situation was very similar to the previous Kabedon. However, this time I’m fully covering her whole body.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“ah…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Along with her sweet voice, a faint scent tickles my nose which was transmitted from zero distance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I felt her warmth through the soft bare skin!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m sorry!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I quickly leaned back and looked at her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She was just frozen with a dumbfounded expression.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What was I doing just now…! This is like…!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nooo? Yusuke isn’t here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And as we were silently troubled, I heard a voice from the other side. It was Nanami, who had just finished dressing and opened the curtain.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Maybe he went to the bathroom? I wanted him to take a look at me because I changed…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Sorry Nanami, I don’t think I can come right now…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, if he’s not there, it’s no use. Let’s try the next one.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As soon as I heard the curtain closing, Nanami’s voice was cut off. It seems that she had returned to change her clothes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">”Akari-chan… are you ready?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami called her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, Akari remains stunned as if her words are not reaching.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After a while…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I glanced outside and saw that those girls from earlier had gone somewhere.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, Akari didn’t give me permission to leave. But to escape… there is no better time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Then, while paying close attention I slowly left the dressing room and moved to the front of Nanami’s dressing room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, you’re back.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Uh-huh, yeah… I had to use the washroom.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">While acting innocent, I looked at her new outfit.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Haah! I’m glad I didn’t get caught.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After that, I ended up looking at her different getups, so we moved through the cycle of pick and choose. And finally decided to buy the first flowery swimsuit.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’m not sure if this was the right swimsuit for her, but I think I reacted most to that one.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">On the other hand, Akari didn’t show up since then. She finished shopping before us and waited alone on the bench in front of the store.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was kinda curious about which swimsuit she picked up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But still, how am I supposed to face her after this…?</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Speaking of which, Nanami what are you planning to do next week?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After we had shopped, we took a break and stopped by a restaurant for lunch.</p>

<p class="calibre4">While listening to my Onii-chan’s conversations, I, Akari Namiki, sipped on the coffee.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just how… What just happened?</p>

<p class="calibre4">Why &amp; How did I end up in this situation?</p>


<p class="calibre4">Everything was going so well…</p>

<p class="calibre4">I managed to deceive everyone including my mother, father, my brother, and all of our acquaintances.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yes, everything was supposed to go just like I had <em class="calibre7">planned</em>…</p>

<p class="calibre4">But for some reason, there has been a strange change in Onii-chan’s behavior.</p>

<p class="calibre4">And that’s the root of all my worries.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Why does it feel so blissful being on a date with him?</p>

<p class="calibre4">But… I’m worried about what has been happening, like, he greets me whenever we meet. This morning he even called me cute. A while ago, he hugged me twice and he was even staring at my underwear.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But if I want to succeed, I have to keep a distance. That’s why I’ve worked so hard and composed until today. It’s not like I hate his company… I’m really glad to see that he is being affectionate towards me.</p>


<p class="calibre4">But I think I’m lost…</p>

<p class="calibre4">Should I continue to ignore him in order to carry out <em class="calibre7">my plan</em>, or should I just give up on <em class="calibre7">my plan</em> and get along with him like in the past?</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even if I choose the latter, I’ll have to execute the last part of <em class="calibre7">my plan</em>, though I don’t have the confidence to say if it’ll succeed or not.</p>

<p class="calibre4">At the very least, I want to know the reason for my brother’s change of heart…</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just when I was lost in my thoughts…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh… a phone call… sorry, I’ll be back in a minute. May I?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Onii-chan’s smartphone started ringing…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okie! No problem. Akari-chan?”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Nnnn…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">So I acknowledged.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s unpleasant to be left alone with <em class="calibre7">this person</em> (Nanami).</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thanks, I’ll be back in a few minutes, wait for me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Saying that Onii-chan left the place.</p>

<p class="calibre4">So… What should I do now?</p>

<p class="calibre4">I don’t care for anyone except my Onii-chan. To be honest, <em class="calibre7">this person</em> is just downright irritating.</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Akari-chan, are you enjoying the outing?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I was thinking about her, she opened her mouth to speak.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I dunno…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s not that I don’t enjoy it. It’s been a long time since I went out with my Onii-chan, and I can feel the bliss by just being together with him. I am glad I came.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But I don’t want him to have fun with <em class="calibre7">her</em>.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Speaking of which,”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Which one did you buy in the end?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The first one.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm… the one seen by Yusuke?”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“No, he didn’t see it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That was a lie.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The truth is, I bought the swimsuit for the sole reason Onii-chan said it was cute.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s not like I’m looking forward to a beach date, or anything like that, with him, but he said it looked good on me, so there’s no reason not to buy it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s nice. Uhh…it’s a little off-topic, but I haven’t yet said why I invited you today. Akari-chan, do you know why?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, I don’t… I….to be honest, I am curious.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Perhaps it has something to do with Onii-chan’s change of heart.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Actually, you know, Yusuke was asking me for some advice.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Hmm…? What advice??”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Umm… You really want to know?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Because that’s where I can find answers to the questions which worry me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">So, I’d love to hear it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I replied, she just said, “I see,” and started to tell me what happened.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well…to be honest, Yusuke told me that one of his acquaintances likes you, and he wants to be friends with you. But you two don’t get along well. So, Yusuke is trying to fix his relationship with you.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Oh…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“And then he asked me about it, and I agreed to help him out. I’m sure you’ll be happy to know, that’s why I invited you on a date.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is that so…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It was a good idea to buy a swimsuit as well, if you have it, it will come in handy. I’m not sure about you, but maybe I’ll use it on a date this summer.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“A date…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That means she’ll go with someone she likes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">What a pity…</p>

<p class="calibre4">What was I expecting…</p>


<p class="calibre4">I thought that, <em class="calibre7">maybe</em>, Onii-chan had fallen in love with me. So that’s the reason why he’s trying so hard.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was just a waste of time hoping for such a thing.</p>

<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre7">Maybe</em>, I shouldn’t have…</p>

<p class="calibre4">I knew it. Such a thing is not possible…</p>

<p class="calibre4">So why did I believe… Just why?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is something wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre7">What are you even saying?</em></p>


<p class="calibre4">My mind is blown.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I knew that such fate was not possible, that’s why I came up with this plan.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But still… Why do I have to feel so sad?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, I have to leave for a moment.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m afraid to look in his (Onii-chan’s) eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Huh? Oh, I don’t mind, but will you be fine by yourself?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She asked in a worried tone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">If I stay here, I won’t be okay. So, I gave a small nod and left.</p>


<p class="calibre4">Anywhere is fine. I just don’t want to be here…</p>

<p class="calibre4">Right now, I just want to go to a place far away from Onii-chan.</p>

<p class="calibre4">And so, I left the coffee shop, and as I was walking…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do you have a minute?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A man called out to me.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Haaa… I was kind of startled by that sudden call though.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After hanging Yoshiki’s call, I quickly returned to the coffee shop. However, no one was there. As expected, Akari was angry at me. I guess I shouldn’t have left.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“They must be nearby…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I left the store in a hurry and walked down an unfamiliar street.</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Ah… I’m lost.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I moved to a less popular corner.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Guess I should contact Nanami, maybe she’s with her.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I quickly sent her a message saying…</p>



<p class="calibre4">|| “Where are you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">||”Ah Yusuke, you were right.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">||”What? What happened?”</p>



<p class="calibre4">||” Akari-chan left…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">||”Where? Tell me which way!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">|| “I thought she’ll come back soon…”</p>



<p class="calibre4">While having this conversation, I saw someone…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? Is that Akari?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I went towards the familiar figure.</p>


<p class="calibre4">She’s definitely Akari.</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I went closer, I saw her talking to someone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait, isn’t he Yamamoto-senpai?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m sure he’s Taichi Yamamoto, who confessed his love to Akari and was rejected by her.</p>


<p class="calibre4">I texted Nanami again;</p>


<p class="calibre4">||”I found her…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">||”You know Yamamoto-senpai?”</p>


<p class="calibre4">II”Yamamoto? Yama-moto, um…? Yes! He’s the one who confessed his feelings to Akari-chan right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">||”Yes, he’s with Akari.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">||”What? Why’s he with her?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">||”I don’t know…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">||”Hmm. Wait, I’ll head over there. Where are you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">||”Um… You know a store named Kureha?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">||”Okay, I’ll look for it. Wait for me.”</p>



<p class="calibre4">After her reply, I watch over these two.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akari seems uninterested while Yamamoto had an annoyed expression on his face.</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Uh, I can’t hear them…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She is definitely not in a good mood.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Well, because she dumped him, and it’s a bit unlikely after that they’ll have a friendly chat after that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">”&mdash;Yusuke! There you are.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Whoa! Nanami.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">In the meantime, Nanami arrived.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, it’s true, she’s with Yamamoto-senpai.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Did she say that she was going to meet Yamamoto-senpai?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I ask that, Nanami denies while shaking her head.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, I don’t think so.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">So, it’s likely that they ran into each other by accident.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s a little hard to hear the conversation… Should we move a little closer?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sure, I wanna know as well.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Both of us agreed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">We gradually close the distance between us so that they don’t notice.</p>


<p class="calibre4">“I’m telling you…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I heard his frustrating voice while arguing over something.</p>

<p class="calibre4">He says, “At least tell me his name. I’m curious about what kind of boy you like, Namiki-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I see.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Apparently, he did not like the fact that he was rejected by Akari. She rejected him because there’s someone she likes, and so he wanted to know about him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait… Akari-chan is in love? With who?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What did you say?”</p>


<p class="calibre4">Nanami mumbled, but when I asked her, she replied, “Nah, it’s nothing.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Maybe I misheard.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It has nothing to do with you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akari was frustrated and responded in a sharp tone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s rare for her to get angry… but when she does, you’re doomed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Look, if you can’t answer, then there’s no such person. Be honest and go out with me”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Stop screwing around, I have told you again and again, there’s no reason for me to lie.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The conversation started to heat up.</p>


<p class="calibre4">It’s obvious that both of them are in a bad mood.</p>

<p class="calibre4">We’ve only seen the interval of the film, so we don’t know what’s going on. But from the way they’re talking, it looks like the same question has already been asked and answered multiple times.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I think we should stop them.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While I was trying my best to hear their conversation, Nanami whispered in my ear.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I saw Yamamoto’s expression was getting darker, perhaps because he was not happy about the fact that things didn’t work out as he planned.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If that’s the case then..!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">At that moment…</p>


<p class="calibre4">That bastard Yamamoto, he raised his hand, as if he had finally run out of patience.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Without giving a second thought. My body moved on its own and before I realized I was standing in between them as a wall to protect Akari.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What are you doing with my sister, Senpai?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I don’t care about the note, or the plan, or anything like that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I just want to protect my sister. That’s all.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…! Who are you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With my sudden appearance, he retracted his right arm. And glared at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m her, Akari Namiki’s Onii-chan.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">My voice was surprisingly deep.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Am I angry?</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yeah, I’m furious seeing he dares to hurt my sister.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You? Her brother?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He moves closer while saying so.</p>

<p class="calibre4">He’s a sportsman, a gymnast, and also a jack-of-all-trades, such that I’m not even worth comparing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">To be honest, I was enduring his intimidating glare, but I hate to back down. I put all my strength on my legs to stand up face to face against his demeanor pressure.</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Haha, such a disappointment. I knew she had a brother, but I didn’t expect someone like this shit.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He laughed…</p>

<p class="calibre4">This little shit… in other words he’s comparing himself with me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I thought that he’s just a good old popular boy in the school, but who could have thought that he’s a complete jerk…</p>

<p class="calibre4">His cursing continues.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Look at yourself, such an ugly face. Tsk, this kind of shit dares to get in my way.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While looking at my face he continues…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, I don’t know if you’re actually her brother, but you’re definitely not a righteous person, right? Perhaps a Sis-con.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s not it. It’s just that I can’t just sit tight and let my sister get involved with a jerk like you, you know.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then, with a big sigh, he says,</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Aaah, I know your sister beautiful, but don’t get carried away…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He turns towards Akari.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I said I’ll give you everything if you become mine, but it seems you don’t know your place.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">What the hell! He’s spouting nonsense.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This jerk tried to slap my sister just because she rejected him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey! Look at my face when I’m speaking.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Now he yelled at Akari.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I know he’s angry. But it doesn’t mean he can yell at her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">While listening to their conversation, I’m pretty sure that It’s not her fault.</p>

<p class="calibre4">There’s nothing wrong with rejecting a love confession.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mark my words, The next time we meet at school-”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Senpai, Will you please shut that filthy mouth of yours.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I just couldn’t help myself when I said that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">”What?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yamamoto looked at me with a mixture of anger and surprise.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Haha… maybe I said something bad…still…</p>

<p class="calibre4">This jerk is the most popular boy in the school, and I’m sure I can’t even compete with him even if I face him head-on.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t you dare utter a single word to my sister.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I know he’s strong… but I can’t overlook his nonsense.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know why you’re so angry,”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He taunts,</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re just a creepy Siscon, aren’t you? Don’t get in my way.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After hearing those words, I say,,</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You can call me whatever you want. Yes, I’m a Siscon, so what? I can’t overlook that shitty attitude of yours.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I declared in clear words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I don’t care what she’s thinking, or about the note or her plan.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s fine… I’m just a Siscon.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s natural for a brother to protect his sister.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Eww, so you admit. That’s disgusting.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t need your comment. Even if I’m such a creep… it has nothing to do with you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He grinned at my words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“But that’s just what you think, isn’t it? Look at your sister, she’s not saying anything. Your lovely sister is embarrassed.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I turned towards Akari, she was indeed looking down. It’s a good thing that she’s not looking at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">And his bickering continues, “Your sister is disgusted by a pervert like you. I don’t care what a pervert thinks, but I feel sorry for you, Namiki-san, loved by a useless brother who has nothing to offer.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">At this moment,</p>

<p class="calibre4">*Slap*</p>

<p class="calibre4">Senpai had a confused look on his face, not knowing what had happened. Even I’m not sure what just happened, because it was too sudden.</p>

<p class="calibre4">However, Akari slapped Yamamoto.</p>


<p class="calibre4">…That was the truth.</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Stop badmouthing my Onii-chan.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">She said in a serious and cold voice, I never heard that before.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her voice was so cold that it froze everyone at that moment. She was angry and staring him in the eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’ve said what you wanted, but… don’t you dare to say anything bad about my brother”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Uhh…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yet being overwhelmed by her pressure,</p>
<p class="calibre4">Senpai who was slapped on the cheek still does not change his expression.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“This time, I’ll tell you clearly. Senpai, you seem to be quite confident in yourselves, but I don’t find any appeal in you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Hearing those words, he finally opened his mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t tell me you think, this shit is better than me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes. My brother is a hundred… no… thousands times better than you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her voice was clear. I saw truth in her eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Hmm? Wait a minute.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s that? Not only the Brother but his Sister is also… No, it can’t be. Don’t tell me you love him?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Seeing the two of them heated up, I, on the contrary, regained my composure.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I listened to their exchange, I thought, This is not good.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I have to stop them.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you want to hear that badly I’ll say it, I’ll say that I love&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oii-, Nanami! I’m sorry, but can you go get a security guard or someone!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As if to interrupt Akari, I called out loudly to Nanami, who was still hiding in the shadows.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wha…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He turned in the direction of where I shouted, and he finally realized that there was another person here.</p>

<p class="calibre4">He saw Nanami, who rushed to look for someone upon hearing my words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">He clicked his tongue and escaped.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That was a close call…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Apparently, Akari was troubled realizing what she just said. She was about to declare her love, which she was hiding for a long time.</p>

<p class="calibre4">If I didn’t stop her, I might have made a pretty dangerous statement.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Akari, are you okay… Akari?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her face was dyed red, which was not rare for me. Perhaps she remembered her remarks. And turned her back towards me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I… I’ve to go.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She ran away…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait, where are you go&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was so abrupt that I couldn’t end my sentence.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was left alone… seriously?</p>
