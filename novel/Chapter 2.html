<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Get a juicy knowledge with cheat! ~Magic Edition~ ②</h3>

<p>——Well, let’s talk about serious stuff. About the way of how a villager can become stronger…… the first step of it.</p>
<p>Before that, I should explain the skill wisdom.</p>
<p>Skill: Wisdom</p>
<p>Books are ranked differently from Rank S ~ Rank B in this world. This skill allows me to read every book below Rank B (and Rank B itself) in my head and it was the skill that I had in my second life.</p>
<p>Ranks are roughly given based on two criteria.</p>
<p>Simply because the secrecy of the information is high, or the information itself might be dangerous.</p>
<p>You can somewhat know the reason why highly confidential information are ranked as such, but I am sure that you would need an explanation on how the information might be dangerous.</p>
<p>It’s not like in the spy movies, knowing things that you shouldn’t know and you will be erased for it…… not in that sense of danger, but it is more like the knowledge of the information itself is the danger.</p>
<p>As an example, if you read a grimoire that has magic cast upon it, the mentality of the person reading it will get contaminated, I am referring more to that sense of danger……</p>
<p>And, Skill: Wisdom allows me to browse through books up to Rank B, therefore that kind of danger was completely eliminated.</p>
<p>In the last tutorial, I was trying to acquire various knowledge by reading books in my head while I was a toddler.</p>
<p>–And this time, the knowledge that I am applying is from a historical book…… it was banned because it is morally repugnant and was given a Rank B for it.</p>
<p>The contents written was too extreme and the background of the book was quite heavy. Well, it was a book placed a little too deep in a library of some magic academy…… and the browsing for it was only acceptable if you obtained special permission.</p>
<p>Firstly, let me explain the background of the book.</p>
<p>To speak of it bluntly, it was written by a certain magician organization– regarding human experiments</p>
<p>So, that group of magicians who were a bit too into their religious cult, they are<em> very</em> <em>great</em> people.</p>
<p>Speaking of the contents of the book…… it will make an elegant aunt who is a PTA president knit her brows after the first few lines of the <em>wonderful</em> contents of the book.</p>
<p>Well, it was just a group of mages who had a screw loose in the head, experimenting on humans however they liked…… moral values aside, the academic value is simply high.</p>
<p>First of all, when thinking about why a religious group would do something like human experiments…… it seemed like that religious group was seriously aiming for world domination through those experiments.</p>
<p><em>A world conquest, they want a WORLD CONQUEST……. </em>what a funny joke<em>.</em></p>
<p>So, the book states the methods and the results of human body modifications to foster the strongest soldier.</p>
<p>As such, the methods described in the book are such that showed terrible side effects with doping (doping: using drugs to temporarily increase some specs, in this case, MP) and written about the fusion experiments of a human and a demon. (tl:’chimera human’ get it?)</p>
<p>Even if I did become strong with such method, it does not really mean anything if I got strong in <em>that </em>sense.</p>
<p>About temporary doping…….Well, even if they expect to make it more efficient in the future (with less side effects), I would like to pass on the opportunity in making my internal organs tattered as written in the book.</p>
<p>And, so, it showed the descriptions of the method used that could be ignored until…… there was one section that caught my eye.</p>
<ul>
<li>About the increase in MP capacity during early childhood</li>
</ul>
<p>To clearly explain this item, you must first understand the concept of soul and life energy that is related to the universe-…… Well, there are various things that need explanations.</p>
<p>However, to explain all of it clearly could be long, I will only explain the appropriate portion of it.</p>
<p>To speak of it bluntly, the talent of a baby is amazing. It is to the point that it is ridiculous.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p>…………If I finish explaining here, it seems like someone (some bitches) from someplace would cause a riot, therefore I will further explain a little more.</p>
<p>It would be easier to explain if I say that the children in modern Japan have strong spiritual intuition, they can see ‘things’ that a normal adult can’t see.</p>
<p>In addition, the learning absorption rate of a child is really ridiculous.</p>
<p>And in this world which the concept of mana literally exist.</p>
<p>So, what would happen if I used my mana till exhaustion…… let’s say in a more traditional way.</p>
<p>—— Baby, Mana, Absorption Rate, Really Extraordinary (for those who wants it in romaji: akachan, maryoku, kakuchouritsu, maji hampanai )</p>
<p>So that is the gist of it.</p>
<p>So, in that sense, it means that I have a tremendous advantage.</p>
<p>This is because, ordinary babies do not know how to use their MP.</p>
<p>Well, you can be a genius with over-powered skills and use magic instinctively while being a baby…… even so, babies would not use their MP till it is exhausted.</p>
<p>It’s because it is quite dangerous to use your Magic Point until it reaches zero.</p>
<p>Just like the phenomenon of ‘hunger knock’ on Earth where over exercising causing sudden fatigue due to glycogen depletion, causing the body to be temporarily immobile due to lack of nutrition.</p>
<p>At a level similar to that, you can say that it is pretty dangerous to reach zero MP.</p>
<p>It may be better to say it is similar to the human body structure, even adults who start to use muscles which are seldom used will suffer from muscle pain.</p>
<p>And, in the case of mana deficiency, it causes a headache worse than a muscle pain.</p>
<p>Actually, now, I am being attacked by a ridiculously painful headache.</p>
<p>One  (blast of magic) every ten seconds, makes me feel like my cerebral cortex is being hit with the full swing of a metal bat……. the headache is at least that painful.</p>
<p>With Skill: Indomitable activated, I am able to somehow withstand the pain but it is still taking a toll on me.</p>
<p>That is why I could not use this method despite knowing it in the tutorial.</p>
<p>No, it is more accurate to say that I had tried this a couple of times myself, but was not something that I could endure without any sort of skill.</p>
<p>Even if I did become stronger that way (without using skills to endure it), who in the world would be so masochistic to bear the pain of piercing his stomach (切腹: seppuku) every day.</p>
<p>Well, this method is at that level where…… it is a very reckless special training method.</p>
<p><em>However</em>…… I smiled.</p>
<p>That was why, despite the world being so wide, only I can use this method.</p>
<p>A pain that even with the memories of my adult self could not endure, let alone infants to train with this method.</p>
<p>There are no such things.</p>
<p>In my blurred vision and a domineering headache…… as expected, my smile doesn’t fade.</p>
<p>The domineering pain in my head means that my mana will expand without limit</p>
<p>The older I become, the pain of MP depletion felt will become a smaller feat.</p>
<p>Instead, the expansion rate of my MP will drop in the future.</p>
<p>–Certainly, I’m a villager</p>
<p>But, as far as the MP expansion rate of an infant is concerned– it has reached the rate where it expands a few hundred times more than a normal adult.</p>
<p>The Heroes, Sages, Saints, nor the Demon Kings– None of them can match the growth rate of my Magic Point.</p>
<p>It’s a big head start for me.</p>
<p>Currently, I am definitely the strongest two-year old.</p>
<p><em>However</em>…… I thought,</p>
<p>Heroes, Sages, Sword Saints, Phantom Thieves, Holy Knights.</p>
<p>As if set by the laws and rules of the world, they would surely close the distance between us.</p>
<p>After all, there is a despairing difference in talent the moment we were born.</p>
<p>No matter how much effort an ordinary man puts in, still, geniuses will catch up fast.</p>
<p>Maybe it means that there are limitations to a ordinary person’s talent, or is it just an impossible feat to win against a genius.</p>
<p>Whatever blood and sweat were put in, there is always a peak where you can never reach.</p>
<p>That is also a fact that I understand.</p>
<p><em>However.</em>….. and I thought,</p>
<p>— Then, before I am caught up to…… I will create a larger margin between us. Even if it is a place were a villager can never reach…… I will use a way that is extraordinary…… to climb to the peak to show <del>those idiots</del> them……</p>
<p>— And two years had passed uneventfully.</p>
<p>My 4th birthday.</p>
<p>I had gotten my status plate from the city’s priest.</p>
<p>Even though it is more common to find reincarnation web novels in Japan that makes you get your status plate in some guild…… Here, everyone can get one of those from the church at their 4th birthday.</p>
<p>The numbers in the status plate can only be seen by the person owning it themselves.</p>
<p>I lied to my parents (about my status).</p>
<p>Of course I would do that.</p>
<p>If my numbers were known by others, I will surely be attracting weird attention</p>
<p>Yes…… this is something at a level that will disrupt the world if my status were to be publicized.</p>
<p>After all, my status is as follows.</p>
<p>Race                    :Human</p>
