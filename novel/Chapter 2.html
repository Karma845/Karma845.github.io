<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Future Plan</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Our
destination is a city in the Dwarf Kingdom, far to the southwest of my
homeland.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
city was built right on the border of the Elf Queen Country.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
reason why it was built so close to the border is that a useful dungeon was
discovered there. As a result, people gathered and built the city.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
seems that the Dwarf Kingdom and the Elf Queen Nation have been disputing for a
long time because the city location is too close to the border.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
the city is famous for its dungeons, it is home to various races, including the
Dwarves and Beastmen.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">We have
chosen this town as our base for adventuring because it is a busy town with
dungeons, and three years ago, the Race Union members used this town as their
base.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">We successfully
completed our adventurer registration and stayed on the top floor of the most
luxurious inn in town.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"[Infinite
Gacha], [R, Silent], Release"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
also released "R, Detect" and "SR, Magic Interference" to
secure the room.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">After
checking the room for eavesdroppers, observers, and magic items of that sort,
Gold shouts happily.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I never thought we'd be attacked by bandits in such a short time!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
can't believe we were attacked by bandits in such a short time! The surface
world is so dangerous! Our people in Naraku are much more civilized!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
guess I should have taken a carriage instead of walking to town......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
let out a sigh as I sit on the sofa.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">After
visiting the tomb, we used an "Infinite Gacha" card card to move
to somewhere near our destination city.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Instead
of arriving directly at the city, we headed there on foot. I thought that this
would look more natural.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As a
result, we were attacked by Dwarven bandits before we reached the town and had
to do some useless fighting......</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu
tries to comfort me in my depression.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
it's just that the security on the surface world is bad, and Gold's armor
stands out too much! Raito-sama's decision was not wrong! Thanks to you, we
were able to enter the city naturally as you wanted!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hahahahahahaha!
As Nemumu said, we can enter this city safely and become an adventurer. Isn't
that good enough?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......
Yes, that's right. It's a good thing that we can become adventurers without
incident."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
regained my good mood and smiled, and this time Nemumu puffed out her cheeks.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
don't understand why Raito-sama has to start at level F instead of level A. The
receptionist has no eyes for talent."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hahaha,
it can't be helped. You and Gold are a different case, but I'm technically a
12-year-old human. It's normal if I start at the lowest adventurer level."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">In
this world, there are adventurer guilds that rank adventurers into six levels.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
adventurer rank is as follows.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Level
A: Top</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Level
B: 1st class</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Level
C: Skilled professional</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Level
D: Professional</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Level
E: Intermediate</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Class
F: Novice</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">On
top of this, there is S class, but that is the exception, and the basics are
above.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Grade
F is the bottom, the novice level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
I was in the Race Union, I was also an F level adventurer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">So I
don't mind that my new adventurer dog tag is F level.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"And
Nemumu, on the surface world, I am now 'Dark' not 'Raito'. I checked using the
card, this room is safe. We don't need to worry about somebody listening to us,
but be careful while we're on the surface world.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'm,
I'm sorry, Ra--Dark-sama!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu
hurriedly corrected herself.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">At
first, I had planned to become an adventurer as Raito, but if the former
members of the Race Union heard about me and get suspicious, my revenge plan may
fail.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">So I
used a fake name, wear the SSR Clown Mask. It has the effect of creating
illusions and preventing recognition. I returned back to the surface world to
register as an adventurer.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">While
sitting on the sofa, I reconfirm our objective.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Why
do we went all the way to the surface world and became an adventurer? I want to
confirm our objective again."</span></p>

<p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst"><span class="calibre15"><span>·</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Investigate
and contact the Nation's underlings like Garou, who is looking for the
"Master".</span></p>

<p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst"><span class="calibre15"><span>·</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gather
information on powerful people.</span></p>

<p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst"><span class="calibre15"><span>·</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Raise
our rank to get more information and connections.</span></p>

<p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst"><span class="calibre15"><span>·</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
possible, secure the "Masters" that the nation has not yet found.</span></p>

<p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst"><span class="calibre15"><span>·</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gather
other information</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That's
all.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gold
raises his hand to confirm that.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"My
Lord, do we have to earn money? If we're going to be active on the surface
world, we'll need it. Right?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Don't
worry, the people who are gathering information on the surface world is earning
money as merchants. If it's not enough, we'll make fake money again. Money is
important, but I don't think we need to worry about it."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Six
months ago, my subordinates disguised as merchants and others departed to
gather information on the surface world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
asked my subordinate, who specialize in counterfeiting, to make gold and silver
coins for each country using the gold and silver bars from the "Infinite
Gacha".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
succeeded in producing gold and silver coins that were completely
indistinguishable from the real thing.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
Gold heard that I had made fake gold, his voice sound impressed.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"As
expected of the Lord! I never thought we can prepare money in that way!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">What
an extraordinary idea! And it's also a good way to pay back the other races
that looked down on our Lord, killing two birds with one stone! ...... But if
they find out it's fake money, there's going to be a problem. Is that OK?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"It's
OK. It's perfectly made, and it's not meant to disrupt the economy, so we only
brought in a minimal amount."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
might destroy the economy. But for our use, it has no impact.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Next,
Nemumu raised her hand.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
understand why we became an adventurer on the surface world, but I don't think
it's necessary for Dark-sama to do it personally. Even though Dark-sama is
powerful, the possibility of an accident is not zero. If we think about safety,
you can command us from inside Naraku."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
couldn't finish her words until the end.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"
...... Nemumu is going to take revenge away from me?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
no......, I'm not......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Or
is Nemumu going to get in my way?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hiii,
I'm, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I was out of line!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu
wiped the sweat from her face and whole body. She got down on her knees.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
clasped her hands and prayed as if he were worshipping a God and began to
tremble with tears in her eyes.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"
Wa-ha-ha-ha!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Because there are things that a man must
do with his own hands, even if he knows it is dangerous! The Lord wants to take
revenge with his own hands and not leave it to others. Isn't that truly
admirable for a man! As expected from my Lord. The Lord of this Gold, the
Golden Knight! Hahahahahahahahahaha!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gold's
laughter brought me back to my senses.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
it comes to revenge, I tend to get angry and lose my cool.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
don't know if I should be happy that the flame of revenge hasn't died down yet
even though almost three years have passed, or if I should consider it a
negative thing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
get up from the couch and pat Nemumu's silver hair as she continues to pray.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Sorry,
I got a little too emotional. I'm sorry for questioning Nemumu's loyalty."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
it's my fault that I acted out of line! Please allow me to offer my loyalty to Raito-sama
once again!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Ah,
yeah. Well,"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
name has switched to "Raito" again, but I'm not in the mood to
correct it, so I let it go.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
sit down on the sofa again, take off my right shoe, and give it to Nemumu.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Excuse
me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu
grabbed my right foot with a red face as if she were handling a jewel made of
sugar candy and gently put her lips to it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
could feel Nemumu's warmth through my right sock.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
kiss on top of the foot means "slavery".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
is why everyone often asks for it as a reward.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
embarrassing, so I am not used to it......</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gold
muttered to himself as he watched the interaction between Nemumu and me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......Is
this some kind of a fetish play?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Bastard!
Don't call our sacred offering loyalty ritual to Raito-sama in a disgraceful
way!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"But
doesn't it look like an old slut fawning over the feet of a 12 or 13 years old
boy? As I said earlier, I don't like the way you're so blatantly showing off
your loyalty."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'm
not showing off! I'm just overflowed with my loyalty to Raito-sama! First of
all, there's no way I'm gett..... gett.... getting sexually excited! I'm only
pledging my loyalty to, Raito-sama!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Don't
worry, Nemumu, I will never question your loyalty."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Raito-sama......!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu
is so touched by my words that her cheeks blushed and her body tremble.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gold
shrugged his shoulders with his palms facing up as if to say, "Your
sickness can't be healed".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I chuckle
at their little argument and continue my talk.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"For
the time being, I'm going to explore the dungeon tomorrow to raise my
adventurer rank. However, if Ely finished preparing for the revenge toward
Sasha the Elf, I will prioritize that. Please keep that in mind."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Understood,
Raito-sama!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Tomorrow
in the dungeon, I will show you the Golden Knight's real power!"</span></p>
<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
nodded, satisfied at their replies. </span></p></div>
