<h2>Chapter 2: Whether It’s a Subjugation Match, Or A Secret Meeting with Her, That’s the Question</h2>

<p>The day after the golem attacked the academy.</p>
<p>In front of the half-destroyed school building, all the academy students were lined up. An old man stands in front of them.</p>

<p>“As you know, because of the Northern Demon (Tempest) which suddenly appeared last night, a part of the school building was partially destroyed. However, it was a blessing in disguise that no one was injured. That’s the most important thing”</p>

<p>He has a long white hair and beard. He’s tall with a stretched back, and was wearing a long robe. His appearance with a long cane, is exactly the image of that of a magician.</p>
<p>President of Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy —— Ernest Greenwood.</p>
<p>The founder of this academy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The damage has been minimized, thanks to the both of the heads, Blaze&#8217;s Haruto and Absolute&#8217;s Iris, who rushed in without delay and defeated the Golem with just the two of them. On behalf of the academy, I express my gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>The students also, sent generous applause to the two.</p>

<p>“You ain’t, need to make a big deal of it”</p>
<p>&#8220;I just did what I was supposed to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>——And, the two respond humbly, but their inner feelings are different.</p>
<p>That Northern Demon (Tempest), is something like Haruto and Iris summoned. Moreover, it was due to a naughty accident caused by the Reincarnation wedding (necromance).</p>
<p>To be honest, they were unwilling to be praised.</p>
<p>However, not knowing these two people’s minds, the students around them extoled them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They’re amazing as expected…&#8230; I wonder how can they be so modest while doing that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it were me, I would be proud of it, but…… it was awesomely cool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every time they hear such voices, guilt pierces their chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will also carry out a repair for the school buildings, so today will be an extracurricular lesson. This is a good opportunity; I&#8217;d like to hold a subjugation competition!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Subjugation…… competition, is it?&#8221;</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-47379013' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-47379013' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p>When Haruto raises his eyebrows, Claude who was behind him, whispers into his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a competition to see about how much you can defeat Demons, in a designated field within a time limit. Of course, as a Blaze, we can&#8217;t lose to the Absolutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>“……Indeed”</p>

<p>Then the students started moving. On the canal that flows beside the academy, there is a harbour. From there, they boarded a ship divided by their country, and left for the Grand Canal Grande.</p>
<p>Grandia, the town on top of a lake, has flourishing water traffic. The Canal Grande, with ships coming out loaded with luggage and people, was always crowded.</p>
<p>When they left the waterway and reach the vast lake surface, the number of ships suddenly decrease. Their destination, is the Blaze territory on the opposite bank. The wide meadows and forests in the place, was their field this time.</p>
<p>The students who landed from the dock, walked through the grasslands.</p>
<p>They didn’t grasp it from a distance, but they noticed that stone pavements continues under their feet.</p>

<p>“Huh? Did people use to live here a long time ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>When a Blaze girl muttered unexpectedly,</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p>&#8220;Ah. There were, until 11 years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto then answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hee, you’re well-informed, Haruto&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I used to live here&#8221;</p>
<p>“Eh…… that’s”</p>

<p>The girl looked apologetic, and kept her mouth shut.</p>
<p>Everyone, knew that Haruto&#8217;s parents died in the Absolute’s raid. However, they didn&#8217;t think this was the place.</p>
<p>Claude anxiously, calls out to Haruto.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t particularly care. More than that, I’ll win this subjugation competition! Let’s beat the Absolute!! Is that fine, you guys!!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p>When Haruto came to life, all the Blaze students are &#8220;Ohh!!&#8221;, they raised a shout.</p>

<p>“Good grief. He’s playing the victim”</p>

<p>The only one who sneers at him, was the Absolute girl wearing a maid outfit.</p>
<p>To the Blaze’s conversation, Francette was listening.</p>

<p>“That battle, was a way to prevent the Blazes from invading the Empire. Besides, our soldiers were also annihilated. Thanks to someone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto remained silent as if to ignore that, but the other students stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, I think it&#8217;s a make-up story! This liar!!”</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Fuhn</em>. Before the demons do it, shall I cut him off?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, Francette&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris quietly reprimanded her.</p>
<p>Francette who pulled out her sword from the apron of her maid&#8217;s outfit, quietly stowed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a thing of the past. Time has passed so much that the truth varies from person to person. Rather than winning the argument, I’m thinking about winning the subjugation competition.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p>While saying that, she glanced at Haruto surrounded by Blaze students.</p>
<p>In reality, she wanted to convey her feelings of apology.</p>
<p>However, she can’t show such feelings on her face. Iris stares at Haruto with cold eyes, and Haruto returns it with a similar look.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there is a piercing voice of Adelina in front.</p>

<p>“Oh my, tu!? That that, there’s already someone here!?”</p>

<p>Indeed, a woman dressed in black stands in the meadow on the way.</p>
<p>With black hair and brown skin. She was wearing magical accessories, and has a mysterious atmosphere like that of a fortune teller. However, the clothes she wore have a high degree of exposure, and if you look only at that place, she looks like a dancer working in a mysterious shop.</p>
<p>Her chest is also wide open, and far from her cleavage, nearly half of her rounded chest is exposed. There was also a deep slit on her skirt, and not to mention her thighs, they could peek through her dark brown skin up to her waist.</p>
<p>Towards the woman who isn’t suitable for the academy by any means, the principal raised his cane as if to say hello.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fatima-sensei. Are you already well prepared?”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>All the students were surprised &#8220;Is this a teacher?&#8221;.</p>
<p>All present stood in line at the place. In front of them, were principal Ernest and Elrick-sensei. And, the beautiful woman who they’ve never seen before, called Fatima-sensei.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everyone, was surprised, I guess. This teacher, is the newly appointed Fatima Nefer-sensei. She’s in charge of dark magic.”</p>

<p><em>——Dark Magic!?</em></p>
<p>The students, try to pull out their swords all at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, wait! Calm down. She&#8217;s not someone suspicious. She&#8217;s a member of the Heroes Guild.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Heroes Guild was —— a guild established with the aim to prevent the invasion of the Northern Demon (Tempest), and the resurrection of the Demon King. Its members are wholehearted magicians who were worried about the crisis of the world, and although their numbers is small, they are full of talented people. They don’t belong to any particular country, and operate independently.</p>
<p>Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy, was founded by this Heroes guild, and the teachers were also selected from the Heroes Guild’s members.</p>
<p>Claude asked a question while repositioning his glasses.</p>

<p>“However, why is there a Dark Magician in the Heroes Guild?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>“Blaze’s Claude. In order to fight, you must first know the enemy. However, the magic of darkness, is the black arts used by the followers of the Demon King. We, legitimate human beings have no full knowledge relating to that. Nevertheless, it’s difficult to win if it’s in actual battle. Right? Elric-sensei.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elric-sensei, nods with his usual refreshing smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree. Even if you do challenge the opponent in actual battle without any information of them at all, it’ll just increase the number of victims. I can&#8217;t bear my students, being sacrificed in vain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why, we at the Heroes Guild were studying the dark magic on our own. The leading person for that, is this Fatima-sensei. Therefore——&#8221;</p>

<p>The wrinkles between Principal Ernest&#8217;s eyebrows became deeper, and his expression became steep.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has nothing to do with the Northern Demons (Tempest), or the Dark Magic Association.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>——Dark, magic association?</em></p>
<p>Haruto turns his gaze to Claude.</p>
<p>But Claude simply shrugs.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“Oy, that dark——”</p>

<p>When Haruto tried to ask a question,</p>

<p>&#8220;I see nodesu.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clara of Luminous, turned to Fatima-sensei, joined her fingers together as if praying, and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;For your consideration of thinking about us. My gratitude nodesu”</p>

<p>However, Fatima-sensei stared motionlessly at Clara, without uttering a word.</p>
<p>After all, it was somehow mysterious —— to put it badly, it was creepy.</p>
<p>And, it was bewitching.</p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>The subjugation competition has begun.</p>
<p>The designated field, ranges from about 1 km square. In varied environments, including grasslands, forests and rivers, there’s a possibility that various demons were lurking.</p>
<p>However, the demons aren’t real.</p>
<p>It’s due to the dark magic of Fatima-sensei.</p>
<p>——Summoning Magic.</p>
<p>It was the first time for Haruto to see a magic that makes a demon appear, and employ them.</p>
<p>The emergence of demons appearing one after another from the black magic circle created by Fatima-sensei were—— slimes, Will-o-Wisps, and goblins, in which the students couldn’t hide their surprise.</p>
<p>However, the demons don’t exist in reality.</p>
<p>It can be said that it’s close to a kind of illusion. The way it looks, its ecology, and the way it fights are just like the real thing, but the damage caused by its actual attack depends on the control of the practitioner.</p>
<p>In other words, safe training would be possible.</p>
<p><em>If Fatima-sensei had really lowered their damage, that is.</em></p>
<p>Thinking about something like that, Haruto unconsciously cut down the goblin that appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>This time, only demons up to level 3 have been summoned. To be honest, it has no response at all, but when he looked around,</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Dammit! Even though it&#8217;s just a goblin, it’s pretty strong, ain’t it!?”</p>
<p>“Nooooo! I know that slimes are weak, but it feels gross and I don&#8217;t like it! Anyone, switch with me!!”</p>

<p>The Blaze students become the melting pot of agonizing screams.</p>
<p>Claude is also, staring at the situation with a painful look.</p>

<p>“It seems that, our guys were on the verge of growing accustomed to the demons, right”</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. But, even these guys are the chosen individuals with the ability. Once they get used to them, they&#8217;ll be able to fight right away. For the present, the other countries are in similar state.&#8221;</p>
<p>“…… That what I’d like to think, but”</p>

<p>Claude pointed to a small hill a little further away.</p>
<p>In there, a wall of golden sparkling light was standing tall.</p>
<p>While surrounded by a wall of light on all side, the Luminous students were lined up with their fingers joined together.</p>

<p>“Is that…… the Luminous defense magic?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><em>If they simply defend their place, and won’t defeat the enemy, they won&#8217;t be able to score points. Is Luminous a group of cowards?</em></p>
<p>Standing in the center of the aligned students, was their leading magician, Clara Strahl.</p>

<p>“Now then, everyone. Let’s sing together nodesu. These lost lambs, invite them to the Luminous Sanctuary of Light——Lux.&#8221;</p>
<p>““Lux””</p>

<p>When she spoke the words of prayer, the Luminous students began to sing together. Like a hymn, a rigorous and beautiful melody resounds in the field.</p>
<p>As if they were being called by those singing voices, the demon beasts turned around one after another, and began to aim for the Sanctuary of Light.</p>
<p>However ——</p>
<p>The demon beast that arrived at the Sanctuary of light, raised a scream of agony, and entirely disappeared.</p>
<p>Clara floated a smile full benevolence.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t go against the temptation of the song nodesu. And, if an evil individual touches the sanctuary of light, they’re destined to disappear nodesu. To save the evil souls and send them to the afterlife, is simply our mission nodesu.”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p>They themselves don’t move, they set up a trap and lure the other party. And then, they try to make them die by themselves.</p>

<p>“If I do say, that strategy sounds good, but what they’re doing is terrible, ain’t it…&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto mutters as if spitting out, but Claude shines his eyes behind his glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they were earning points efficiently. My apologies for Haruto in here, but ——”</p>
<p>“I need to go and work away from this place, is it”</p>
<p>&#8220;As expected. You read my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Good grief…… I’ll rely on you on taking care of these guys.”</p>

<p>When Haruto broke into a run, he rushed up the hill. And then, he jumped into the demons gathering in the Sanctuary of Light.</p>

<p>“Aah!? Haruto-san, what are you doing nodesu!? “</p>

<p>To Haruto, who is slashing the demons gathering around them one after another, Clara raised a panicked voice. <em>(TN: Easy points)</em></p>
<p><u> </u></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Clara! This is easy earnings!”</p>
<p>“Geez <em>mou! </em>You’re sly nodesu!!”</p>

<p>Even if she makes a scowling face, it&#8217;s just cute and not scary at all.</p>
<p>Haruto buried dozens of demons in no time.</p>
<p>However, since the song stopped, the demons no longer gathered.</p>
<p>When he looked at her, Clara who bent her navel completely, was facing away.</p>
<p>As long as Haruto is here, she won&#8217;t sing.</p>
<p><em>At this rate, we may lag behind Absolute and Horizon. </em>With that in mind, Haruto went down the hill and into the woods.</p>
<p>However, he had a bad hunch.</p>
<p>Even if he plans on running blindly, he was anxious that the Reincarnation wedding (necromance) will naturally pull him towards Iris. And, he was expecting it a little.</p>
<p><em>In the depths of the forest, if we could meet alone&#8230;&#8230;,</em></p>

<p>“He~llo~, Ha~ruto-sa~n♪&#8221;</p>
<p>“Uuwaaahhhh!?”</p>

<p>Suddenly being spoken to, Haruto jumped up.</p>

<p>“This laid-back voice is that of Adelina!? Where are you!?”</p>
<p>“I’m~ here~ you know”</p>

<p>As he looked up, Adelina was there standing on a tree. Her pink panties with frills are in full view, but he wonders if the person herself is not aware of it.</p>
<p>The ivy that is entwined with the tree suddenly stretched, and it entangled Adelina&#8217;s body. Then, it slowly lowered Adelina&#8217;s body onto the ground.</p>
<p><em>——Horizon’s Earth attribute magic huh.</em></p>
<p>Just as each country has a different culture, magic also has its own distinction in each country.</p>
<p>Blaze Republic is fire attribute.</p>
<p>Absolute Empire is ice attribute.</p>
<p>Luminous religion is light attribute.</p>
<p>The Horizon Kingdom is earth attribute, and so on.</p>
<p>Earth attribute magic, specializes in magic that uses the earth and natural plants. It’s everywhere in this world. It may look plain, but it has a terrifying ability.</p>
<p>However, there are other problems inside the Horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;What wrong Adelina. Is it okay for you to dawdle around in such a place?&#8221;</p>
<p>“We~ll~, everyone was moving as they like, so I have no~thi~ng to do. Maybe, half of them are having tea somewhere around this time, ain’t they~?&#8221;</p>

<p>Many carefree people are there, probably because of its identity as the southern country farthest from the north, or because of its climate. Putting it nicely they’re free, saying it appropriately, they’re the worst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in the first place, the Horizon Kingdom, doesn&#8217;t feel like becoming the best. It’s a country that has risen in business. It&#8217;s our role to assist everyone desuyo!&#8221;</p>

<p>For some reason, she bent her chest proudly, and her huge boobs bounced up and down.</p>

<p>“I,is that so. But I don’t have any particular business with you right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Re~ally~? You don’t need Adeli~na-chan~?”</p>

<p>In a sweet voice, she snuggles up to Haruto.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I said, I ain’t need you.&#8221;</p>
<p>“I can guide you so that you can be alone with Iris, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>“……<em>tu</em>!?”</p>

<p>Adelina, had a giggly smile floating on her face.</p>
<p><em>This girl…… the hell, what did she know!?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Eh~ but, didn’t the two of you meet alone last night~”</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t meet. We came across by coincidence.”</p>
<p>“In that kind of place~? You really intended to meet in there, weren’t you~”</p>

<p>The level of vigilance within Haruto goes up steadily.</p>
<p>The person who he thought was just a fool until now, seems like a terrifyingly cunning intriguer.</p>
<p><em>Putting on a cat play, was she secretly searching for my weakness?</em></p>

<p>“Don’t wear such a scary fa~ce. Since Adelina-chan, is on Haruto&#8217;s side~&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night, no matter what anyone says, it was just a coincidence. Iris is my nemesis. And my aim is to defeat the Absolute Empire. Currently, I just dedicated my sword, in order to counter the Northern Demons (Tempest).”</p>

<p>Adelina crossed her arms, puckered her eyebrows *, and tilted her head. <em>(TN: the original text is </em><em>眉を八の字; </em><em>Eight in Japanese is </em><em>八</em><em>, so it’s like she’s putting her eyebrows together with the center in upward position, like that of a thinking look)</em></p>

<p>“Hh~mm, it wa~s such a thing hah~. Did Adeli~na-chan, misread it a little~?&#8221;</p>
<p>“You greatly misread it.”</p>
<p>“Well~ but, I’m definitely on Harurun’s side! If anything happens, please rely on Adelina-chan!&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning around, as her facial expression changed, with a large flower-like smile, Adelina struck her chest. With that impact, her boobs shake up and down.</p>

<p>“Well then!”</p>

<p>And, when she raised her hand, the ivies entangled Adelina&#8217;s body again, and it pulled her body up onto the tree. Then, from tree to tree, she made a swinging motion, leaving the place.</p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p>

<p><em>Adelina. Who the hell is she?</em></p>
<p>While heading to the depths of the forest, Haruto was thinking about the Horizon&#8217;s leading magician.</p>
<p><em>To ride a winning horse by putting themselves on the backing of the strong*, seems to be the goal of Horizon. If she really wants to help advance my relationship with Iris, there&#8217;s nothing better than that. (TN: This is actually a quote)</em></p>
<p><em>However, I don&#8217;t know when she would betray me. After all, I can&#8217;t reveal our secret.</em></p>
<p>When he concluded that, he heard a roaring voice in front of him.</p>
<p>That voice is from a goblin.</p>
<p>The fact that he can hear the voices overlapping means that, there’s not only one, but there’s a herd.</p>
<p>Haruto set up his red sword, and started running.</p>
<p><em>On the tall thicket in front. That way.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;『Flame』&#8221;</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>Running flames on his favorite red sword, Phoenix, he jumped into the bushes in one breath.</p>
<p>Due to the tall bushes, he can&#8217;t see the other side, but he has no problem with it. Even if he was attacked the moment he pass through the grass wall, he can respond.</p>
<p>The moment he pierced through the grass, a sharp sword play assailed him.</p>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>Red and blue trails collided, and sparks and ice crystals scattered.</p>

<p>“Eh!? Ha,Haruto-kun!?”</p>

<p>Iris pulls her sword in a hurry. <em>(TN: I knew this is gonna happen)</em></p>
<p>As she tried to separate from him carelessly, her legs got tangled and she almost fell down.</p>
<p>Haruto, who tried to help her, also got out of balance due to Iris’ strong blow. As a result, the two fell over as if they were intertwining.</p>
<p><em>——That was dangerous.</em></p>
<p>Haruto coldly sweated.</p>
<p>If she had been only a moment late, he would have been pierced by Iris&#8217; sword.</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-45374057' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-45374057' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p><em>Compared to that, it&#8217;s a cheap enough thing for me to fall&#8230;&#8230;?</em></p>
<p>His face was sandwiched between her soft and fluffy thighs. <em>(TN: Lucky you)</em></p>
<p>What was displayed in front of him, was her rolled up skirt, and the blue sky with clouds floating. And, two flesh-colored mountains, and a thin white cloth that seemed to be of really high quality, wedging itself into such valleys.</p>
<p>In other words, what he can see in front of his eyes, was the blue sky through Iris&#8217; butt and her panties that digs into it.</p>

<p>&#8220;!?!?&#8221;</p>

<p>When he raised his neck and got up in a hurry, he ended up pressing face between Iris&#8217;s crotch.</p>

<p>“Ahhn❤”</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; seductive moan, echoed in Haruto&#8217;s crotch.</p>
<p><em>How did I get into this position!?</em></p>
<p>Not knowing who to quip with, Haruto speaks between Iris’ crotch at a very close distance.</p>

<p>“Ca,can you get up? Iris”</p>

<p>On top of his body, he found Iris who quivers with a start.</p>

<p>“Ah❤ …… I! I&#8217;m sorry!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris jumped and got up. Haruto also stood up in displeasure as if to hide his embarrassed face.</p>

<p>“Uh, uhmm, Haruto-kun, are you injured?&#8221;</p>
<p>“……Iris too, are you alright?”</p>

<p>Looking at his own feet, about ten goblin corpses were lying down. She seemed to have moved ahead of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you for your concern.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she was worried for him, with delight, she puts her hands on her chest and slightly blushes.</p>

<p>“Just now, it was due to the Reincarnation Wedding (necromance), right?”</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t, I wonder how can we fell down dexterously like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>“……I know right”</p>

<p>Iris floated a wry smile.</p>

<p>“Ah…… well, thanks to that, we happened to meet each other in this wide field.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Fufu, that&#8217;s the only thing that I appreciate with the Reincarnation Wedding (necromance).&#8221;</p>

<p>Shutting their mouths, they strain their ears. All they can hear, is the sound of the wind swaying the plants. Even if they search for signs around them, there were no presence of living things.</p>

<p>“At last, the two of us are alone……”</p>

<p><em>Tap tap </em>…… As she approached him, Iris pinched Haruto&#8217;s sleeves, near his elbows.</p>
<p>She was shyly facing down, but he can see that her ears are a little reddish.</p>
<p>Haruto was, &#8220;Dangerous, she&#8217;s too cute.&#8221;, repeatedly saying in his heart.</p>
<p>There is a wall of grass behind them, but there’s no obstruction in front. It looks like a broad open space inside the forest.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no place to hide here. Let’s enter the forest, which is a little further.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris, silently nodded.</p>
<p>While pinching Haruto’s sleeves, they tried to enter the forest.</p>

<p>“——What!?”</p>
<p>“……!? This is!?”</p>

<p>They should have entered the woods.</p>
<p>However, before they knew it, they were in a crumbling church.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where &#8230;&#8230; where is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>There were no benches where attendees could once sit, and the walls and ceiling were full of holes. At the back of the altar, a Luminous symbol that imitates the brilliance of the sun was hung. But that, is also broken in half.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Is this a Luminous, church?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were certainly walking inside the forest. But they, have moved to a different place in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Looking at their feet, they could see a slight disappearing magic circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Transfer magic&#8230;&#8230; the heck, why is this thing here”</p>
<p>“If something happens, is it for emergency evacuation?”</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t know&#8221;</p>

<p>The thing they didn&#8217;t understand the most, was in front of the altar.</p>
<p>Haruto and Iris approached it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;…It&#8217;s a bed, right.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they can see, it was a new bed.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>In this ruined church, it felt out of place in every sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems that no magic mechanism, have been made &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris, as if to check the feel of the bed, put both her hands on the mattress.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right &#8230;&#8230; its quality isn’t bad. But, why is it here?”</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t know. There’s no inn that can be a resting place here; was it stolen from somewhere, or was it used by a teacher who was preparing for the subjugation competition to support himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto himself, who said that, was completely unconvinced of his answer.</p>

<p>“No way, is this also due to the Reincarnation Wedding (necromance)?&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto and Iris sat side by side in bed.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Most likely&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess …&#8230; No, that&#8217;s right. Maybe, I&#8217;m sure. Definitely.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Iris?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sure I wouldn&#8217;t feel like doing this&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>She puts her head on Haruto&#8217;s shoulder, and entrusts her body to him.</p>
<p><em>Her weight, felt very pleasant.</em></p>
<p><em>I wanted to answer that I felt the same way. With my actions, I want to respond to Iris&#8217; feelings. But that’s not possible.</em></p>
<p><em>Because in exchange for that, the world will collapse.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;Iris &#8230;&#8230; let&#8217;s go back soon. I don&#8217;t know where this place is, but it shouldn&#8217;t be too far from the field of the subjugation competition. That magic circle of transfer magic should be nearby——&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Iris covered Haruto.</p>

<p>“Wha……!?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Iris straddled him, and put Haruto down on the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Iris!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry &#8230;&#8230; Actually, from the time I fell on top of Haruto-kun&#8230;&#8230; I, already……”</p>

<p>In the eyes of Iris, who mutters apologetically, a heart-shaped light is floating mysteriously.</p>
<p><em>——Is this the effect of the aphrodisiac of the Reincarnation Wedding (necromance)!?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, Iris!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been patient until now, but &#8230;&#8230; I can&#8217;t do that anymore❤&#8221;</p>

<p>She unties her collar, and unfastens her shirt one at a time.</p>
<p>From the gap of that, he caught a glimpse of Iris&#8217; white skin, and white underwear.</p>
<p>As he looked at her, Haruto&#8217;s head also began to be faintly hazy, and his desire for Iris increased.</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>&#8220;Hey &#8230;&#8230; stop messing around already&#8230;&#8230;. let’s become ❤ one?&#8221; <em>(TN: Game over)</em></p>

<p><em>Damn! Keep your sanity!! If I don&#8217;t hold firmly, who will protect Iris!! </em></p>
<p>He tried to get rid of Iris. But ——,</p>

<p>&#8220;Kuh!? Move &#8230;&#8230; now&#8221;</p>

<p>His back won&#8217;t move as if it was stuck to the bed.</p>
<p><em>This is…… I’m stuck to the bed by magic!?</em></p>
<p><em>Did Iris do it?</em></p>
<p><em>No, she didn&#8217;t show such a behavior.</em></p>
<p>However, even if it&#8217;s Iris’ magic, this was not her real intention.</p>
<p>It’s the effect of Reincarnation Wedding (necromance). The work of the 『Half body of the Demon King (Juliet) 』 inside Iris.</p>
<p>After discovering that the half body of the Demon King is there inside each other, the two searched all the historical documents and old magic books.</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>And in the old inscriptions which they found, what was written about the Reincarnation Wedding (necromance) is as follows.</p>

<p>『The Demon King’s half body attracts each other. And to interfere with the providence of nature to unite the two hosts, it exerts an aphrodisiac effect. Sex magic, a so-called dark magic. With the power of Sex magic fulfilled by the two bodies uniting, the “Demon King” will be resurrected. 』</p>

<p>&#8220;Iris! If we became one as it is, the world will be destroyed!?”</p>

<p>But Iris floated a lewd smile. Unlike from her usual dignified face, and her cute look when we were alone, it was a bewitching, spine-tingling smile.</p>

<p>“Ku……”</p>

<p>Haruto pulled his sword out of his pocket with his right hand.</p>
<p>His back is stuck to the bed, but he can move his arm.</p>
<p><em>At this rate, I will eventually lose my sanity. And then, the world will perish.</em></p>
<p><em>If it’s this ——</em></p>
<p>Haruto stares at Iris and grasps the red sword in his right hand —— Phoenix.</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“『Vulcan』!!”</p>

<p>Hart thrusts out his sword like a stab.</p>
<p>A red magic circle floated at its tip, and it unleashed a bullet of fire.</p>
<p>That fire, runs toward the innermost altar of the church.</p>
<p><em>The figure standing in front of the altar</em>, was directly hit. An intense pillar of fire flared up.</p>
<p>At that moment, Haruto&#8217;s back came off the bed.</p>

<p>“Iris!!”</p>

<p>He grabbed her shoulders, and shook it violently back and forth.</p>

<p>“Ah…… Haruto……. Kun”</p>

<p>As if she had returned to her senses, she blinked her eyes. And, like it was boiled in an instant, her face is dyed bright red.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, I &#8230;&#8230; I am&#8230;&#8230; ju, just, just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>“You’re fine now! More than that!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto stared at the burning altar, with Iris on his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if it was painful or just itchy at that level~&#8221;</p>

<p>From inside the flames, a figure appeared.</p>

<p>“……splendid”</p>

<p>The figure who muttered so, was wearing a strange mask.</p>
<p>Its left half is a smile, and its right half is an angry expression.</p>
<p>It has a flashy design that it looks like it’s used as a carnival costume. Black glasses is fitted on its eyes, making his appearance completely unknown.</p>
<p>He wore a hood on his head, so they didn&#8217;t even know the color of his hair. And he wore a black costume like that of a mourning dress.</p>
<p>On his chest, hangs an eerie pendant that they have never seen. It’s an inverted pentagram, with eyes drawn in the center.</p>









<p>As if he was impressed, he spread his hands open in an exaggerated manner.</p>

<p>“Wonderfull!! This is exactly the Reincarnation wedding (Necromance)! The time of the revival of the 『Demon King』, is here!!”</p>
<p>““!?””</p>

<p>Iris also pulls out her favorite blue sword, Streptopelia, and lines up next to Haruto.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man, about us…&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ah…… Apparently, he&#8217;s not just a street performer&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; <em>(TN: LOL)</em></p>

<p>Even after receiving Haruto and Iris’ blood thirst, the man was trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>“A festival! Ah, magnificent. It&#8217;s finally coming! The New World!!&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice which expresses joy, has a strange sound somewhere. It wasn’t a natural voice, but a voice that was clearly been altered by magic.</p>

<p>“Oy, out of season festival bastard&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufu, thank you for the wordplay name. Blaze&#8217;s Leading magician&#8221;</p>
<p>“You’re well informed. Does that mean that, you were originally aiming for us &#8230;&#8230; Us being transferred here, is it also your work?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. I prepared the bed, and nailed you to the bed. However, it was not my fault that she became in heat. That was the work of the thing that is within yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Who are you, bastard&#8221;</p>
<p>“Pardon me for being late in saying it! My name is Sazaku. An evangelist who is a member and placed at the tip of the Dark Magic Association 『Prospero』. Glad to be acquainted from here on.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Dark …&#8230; magic association?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun, that was what Principal-sensei said &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto recalled Principal Ernest&#8217;s rugged look. Apparently, they were not on good terms with the Heroes Guild.</p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p>

<p>“So, Prospero&#8217;s Sazaku. Is there anything you want with us?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Hahaha, of course there is. I&#8217;m here to help you fulfill your love!&#8221;</p>
<p>“……Huh”</p>

<p>Iris’ cold cheeks, heats up again.</p>

<p>“You bastard…… are you messing around?”</p>
<p>“……Ha?”</p>

<p>Sazaku’s head, tilted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now, what did you say?&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!? I’m not kidding!? I’m serious! I’m really serious, with thissssssssssss!?”</p>

<p>All of a sudden, Sazaku screamed.</p>

<p>“I thought they were just no-good craps, but these fucking damn kid areeeeeee!! I was told that I was kidding around like this, this bastard!! This issssss! I&#8217;m risking my life!! I&#8217;ll spend everything! Aaaaaahhhh!?” <em>(TN: He’s seriously speaking gibberish here)</em></p>

<p>To the sudden change in Sazaku’s attitude, the two felt creeped out, and they involuntarily backtracked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this guy &#8230;&#8230; is he nuts?&#8221;</p>

<p>When Haruto became so suspicious, Sazaku suddenly went quiet.</p>

<p>“——…… I lose my composure. I apologize.&#8221;</p>

<p>Straightening his tilted head, Sazaku respectfully bow.</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-12318982' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-12318982' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p>&#8220;Now then, in such a calm place &#8230;&#8230; I know this is abrupt, but could you have sex?”</p>
<p>““……Ha!?””</p>

<p>To his too unimaginable demand, the two solidified.</p>
<p>Iris and Haruto&#8217;s cheeks, are dyed red.</p>
<p><em>——Thi ……. This guy, what is he talking about!?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Oh? You don&#8217;t know what that means? It’s, you know, sexual intercourse. It’s sex. It’s the thing you will do at the end. In other words, child making.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn’t ask something like that!! Why did you tell me that I had to do such a thing with you!!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ah, maybe you’re misunderstanding me? I won&#8217;t do it, you know. The two of you who love each other will do it. The ritual of love. Yes, and you will create the crystal of love.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Is this guy’s head seriously crazy? </em>Like that, when Haruto was dumbfounded——,</p>

<p>&#8220;Crystal of love &#8230;&#8230; the 『Demon King』&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“!!”</p>

<p>When Sazaku rotated both his hands alternately, he activated two magic circles at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wha~t, if you flirt a little bit again, you can be sexually excited with the Reincarnation Wedding (Necromance). Then you can no longer, think of anything other than connecting with the other party. It’s wonderful, right”</p>

<p>From the black magic circle, a whip like a tentacle grows. <em>(TN: Tentacle play is here!!)</em></p>

<p>“Tsk!”</p>

<p>Haruto avoids the whip, kicks the floor and jumps out. At that moment, his preparation for magic is already complete. He runs his fingers along the sword, and shouts.</p>

<p>“『Flame』!”</p>

<p>The sword was clad in flames.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“Hah!!”</p>

<p>With a loud scream, Haruto&#8217;s sword slashes Sazaku’s body.</p>
<p>A metallic sound echoed, and sparks fluttered.</p>
<p>Wondering when did he pull out a sword, a sword was also held in Sazaku’s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sword arm is also wonderful. Your suitable for a temporary residence of the 『Demon King』.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Tsk!”</p>

<p>Haruto flicks Sazaku’s sword, and takes a step back.</p>
<p>When Sazaku came forward as if to chase after him, Iris flew in the air, jumping over Haruto.</p>

<p>“『Frost』!!”</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; sword wore a cold air, and it’s blue sword blade frosts.</p>
<p>Spinning her body as if she’s dancing in the air, Iris sent out her sword with that momentum.</p>
<p>Its white trail creates a beautiful curve.</p>
<p>A dull sound echoed in Sazaku&#8217;s crown of head, and his sword collided with her sword.</p>

<p>“『Vulcan』!!”</p>

<p>In that gap, Haruto swings his sword, and shoots out flames.</p>
<p>When Sazaku flicks Iris&#8217; sword, he instantly activates his Material Transfer magic. He made his body jump far back.</p>
<p>But Haruto has also read his movement.</p>
<p>He fired Vulcan in succession, aiming at the place where Sazaku would land.</p>
<p>Explosions of flames occur, and pillars of fire stand.</p>
<p>Haruto smiled fearlessly, and stared at the flames.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were just a festival bastard, but you have what it takes huh.”</p>

<p>From inside the flames, Sazaku emerged.</p>
<p>What floats before him, is a black magic circle.</p>

<p>“……Darkness Defense Magic hah&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“Correct. We, Prospero, have this power given by the great leader &#8230;&#8230;. the soul of the Demon King.&#8221;</p>
<p>“What?”</p>

<p>——The soul of the Demon King, is it?</p>
<p><em>The Demon King’s half-body, which is inside me and Iris. Is that it?</em></p>

<p>“……It seems that, I have a lot of questions for you bastard.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the flames went out, his dark defense magic also disappears. Then, Sazaku slowly rotated his hands in front of his body.</p>
<p>A new magic circle is drawn. After a moment, it spread so wide that it seemed to cover the ceiling of the church.</p>
<p>——huge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now! Nero Behemoth!!&#8221;</p>

<p>From the huge magic circle, a Northern demon (Tempest) that matches its size emerges.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Its total height is 5 meters. The length of its body easily exceeds ten meters. To describe its figure, it seems like a carnivorous giant cow, with abnormally developed muscles.</p>
<p>Its face is big, and its mouth is lined with more than 100 sharp fangs. From the sides of its face, two huge weapons that seemed to be able to crush rocks were protruding forward.</p>
<p>Its jet-black body, is covered with rock-like muscular armor, and it conveyed the destructive power hidden inside its body.</p>
<p>Danger level 12. Among the behemoth species, it is the most ferocious.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great summoning magic, but you can&#8217;t beat me with illusions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufufu, real summoning magic is, not an illusion, you know”</p>

<p>Behemoth heads toward him.</p>
<p>The sounds of the giant’s foot trampling, shakes the church like an earthquake. <em>It&#8217;s as if it really exists——!?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Iris! Let’s get out of this church!&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto and Iris turn their backs on the Nero Behemoth, and run to the exit.</p>
<p>They kicked the door, and jumped out.</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>In front of them is a meadow, and they can see forests and mountains in the distance.</p>
<p>Judging from the scenery, this is not far from the field of their subjugation competition.</p>
<p>However, they have no room to verify it leisurely.</p>
<p>The back of the front of the church, was blown away as if an explosion occurred.</p>
<p>From inside it, the Nero Behemoth rushes.</p>
<p>The distance between them, is getting closer——,</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! 『Movement』!!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two attracted the Nero Behemoth at the last moment, and they divided into left and right.</p>
<p>They used movement magic to flew their bodies directly sideways. Its speed is much faster than running on their own feet.</p>
<p>The Nero Behemoth passed between Haruto and Iris with the sound of the earth. That tremor, is like that of an earthquake.</p>
<p>Nero Behemoth, turns around after running for a while. And it roared as if to intimidate the two.</p>
<p>The ground that it passed by, including the grass that it stepped on, is compacted and dented, leaving clear footprints.</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun &#8230;&#8230; that is, a real entity…&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>They heard a laughter from a distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hahaha! This is the magic abyss of darkness!! Dark magic is a miracle!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sazaku speaks on the church that has collapsed, and turned into a pile of rubble.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the real summoning magic! It&#8217;s somewhat different from the Hero guild&#8217;s imitation! It’s a miracle of the Demon King that can only be achieved with the Demon King&#8217;s soul! It has been carved on that body!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what you’re saying! The soul of the Demon King, what’s that!?”</p>

<p>Sazaku deliberately made a gesture of holding his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You talked a little too much. You are a little too naughty. To make it easy for you to move, how about I say you feed Nero Behemoth a few arms.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>When Sazaku snapped his finger, Nero Behemoth pounced on the two again.</p>

<p>“Haruto-kun, what are we going to do? It would be easy for us if we just ran away&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that Sazaku guy is someone we need to catch, and confess. I&#8217;m gonna kill that Nero Behemoth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If so, I will stop it from moving.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris points the tip of her sword, at the Nero Behemoth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch out, Iris. If you are in danger, I won&#8217;t be able to concentrate.&#8221;</p>
<p>“——Can&#8217;t you trust me that much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true. I just don&#8217;t want you to get hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>“……”</p>

<p>Iris seemed to be unable to concentrate.</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><em>Mou….. at such a time, Haruto-kun! </em><em>❤</em></p>
<p>His feelings of cherish is transmitted to her, making her cheeks hot, and her heart palpitations became intense.</p>
<p>Iris held her cheeks down with both hands to cool the heat.</p>
<p>If she doesn&#8217;t concentrate, she can&#8217;t make magic formulas well. That’s because, it’s something created by thinking in one’s head.</p>
<p>The magic power generated from inside the body is the fuel. A magic formula is like a machine that uses that fuel. The blueprint is made with the mental power ——Namely, magic is activated by flowing one’s magic power according to the magic formula.</p>
<p>And the ways to generate magic power, are different.</p>
<p>There are various method in order to do that, such as by making a contract with an existence called Devil(Majin), and using the miracle of God by worshiping the God of light.</p>
<p>In Iris’ case, it’s the spirit of ice, and the 『Half body of the Demon King(Juliet)』 lurking inside her body.</p>
<p>It’s the strongest source of magic power in history.</p>
<p>Thanks to Haruto and Iris, right now, the door where the Demon King&#8217;s half body lurks has opened a little, and a powerful magic power is flowing out.</p>

<p>“『Freezing』!!”</p>

<p>A magic circle unfolds at the tip of the sword, emitting white smoke from there, and it fired a mass of cold air.</p>
<p>A high-pitched metallic sound echoes, and the smoke that spews out freezes the grass on the ground.</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Then, the cold bullet which had been shot frost Nero Behemoth&#8217;s body, and its hair that covers its whole body is wrapped with white frost.</p>
<p>Iris ran towards the sluggish Nero Behemoth.</p>

<p>“『Frost』!!”</p>

<p>She then slashed the thick legs of Nero Behemoth. It was prevented by its outstanding defense power and she wasn’t able to deeply damage it. However, the cold air which was thrown into it freezes its feet to the ground.</p>
<p>During that time, Haruto was chanting the spell needed for the advanced magic of fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;——The spirit of fire, the devil of flame, I seek an appeal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hot air swirled around Haruto, and a gust of wind violently blew.</p>

<p>“——Explosion, raging fire, scorching heat, hellfire, turn tangible things into ashes, and turn intangible things into dust.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under Nero Behemoth’s feet, a magic circle that burns bright red appears.</p>
<p>That’s the entrance to the hell of fire.</p>

<p>“『Meltdown』!!”</p>

<p>A bright red flash extends toward the heavens.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like a volcanic eruption, or a blast furnace bursting.</p>
<p>The cry of Nero Behemoth&#8217;s death agony resounded.</p>
<p>Its fur, which is supposed to be magic resistant, and its rocky body, which is supposed to bounce off any attack, are completely useless.</p>
<p>The violent flames and heat itself, mercilessly burned its body.</p>
<p>The Meltdown pillars gradually became thinner, eventually becoming a single line, and finally, it disappeared.</p>
<p>Nothing remains, even its trace.</p>
<p>The Nero Behemoth, that should have existed there, has no trace left.</p>
<p>A loud applause echoes in the spot which is out of place.</p>

<p>“I say! That was wonderful. It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve seen the advanced magic of fire. However, I&#8217;ve never seen something this powerful! I never thought that you’ll one-shot Nero Behemoth! As expected of the one who has the half body of the Demon King inside his body!!&#8221;</p>

<p>To Sazaku who clapped his hands in high-spirits, Haruto turned a stern look.</p>

<p>“Next, is your turn”</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, let&#8217;s save the fun. However, I don&#8217;t want you to misunderstand, we&#8217;re on your side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t screw around! Coming and attacking here, what do you mean by your side?”</p>
<p>“Screw around……?”</p>

<p>Sazaku tilted his neck.</p>

<p>“Naaaaaaaaaaahh!? Screwing around, you said!! I’m not fooling arou~nd!! Aaah aaah!? Why won&#8217;t you understand how I fee~l here!? &#8230;&#8230; Excuse me, I lose my composure. I apologize.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto raises his eyebrows, and glares at Sazaku.</p>

<p>“This bastard…… how serious is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sazaku&#8217;s neck returned back to being straight.</p>

<p>“Hahaha, I’m serious, you know. Entirely, all perfect* serious. We wish for the fulfillment of your love and happiness.&#8221; <em>(TN: This one is in English form)</em></p>

<p>Iris sharply narrow her eyes.</p>

<p>“……Happiness, is it?”</p>

<p>&#8220;For further information, I’ll give it in another opportunity. Then, I’ll pray for a future where the two of you will be united!!”</p>

<p>A magic circle glowed under Sazaku&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>“Kuh!!”</p>

<p>Haruto&#8217;s sword which was thrown at him, pierces the ground.</p>
<p>However, by that time, Sazaku had already disappeared.</p>

<p>“Transfer magic huh…… a well-prepared guy.”</p>

<p>When they searched around the area in which ​​Sazaku disappeared at their feet, they found a round stone that was glowing black.</p>
<p>It was a stone as beautiful as a jewel, but it was cracked, and was about to shatter at any moment.</p>
<p>Iris also comes, and peeks at the stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;A magic stone huh…&#8230; he had prepared a magic formula for the transfer in advance using this, didn’t he&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ah. That’s why, he was able to suddenly activate magic without any sign. It was probably the same when we were brought here.”</p>

<p>When Haruto pulled out his sword stuck in the ground, the magic stone simply shattered and disappeared.</p>

<p>“Haruto-kun …&#8230; that guy, who the heck is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Dunno…… but, he knows us. And, there are things we don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Then &#8230;&#8230; Haruto-kun&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. I’ll catch him. I&#8217;m also bothered about the soul of the Demon king that he talked about.&#8221;</p>
<p>“But, how will you find him……”</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m going to think about it from here on&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris floats a troubled smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will come up with a good method, it would be fine, but&#8221;</p>
<p>“Easy peasy”</p>

<p>——Then, at that moment,</p>
<p>A familiar voice called out to them.</p>

<p>“Eh? Haruto-san and Iris-san were here!?”</p>

<p>They heard the familiar voice.</p>
<p>Coming across the meadow, was a young girl with a luminous scepter.</p>

<p>“Clara!? You, why are you in such a place&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that there was an old Luminous church here &#8230;&#8230; since I came to the Blaze territory with great pains, I thought I should go back after a tour nodesu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back …&#8230; wait, what happened to the subjugation competition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? It&#8217;s long over nodesu. My Luminous is No. 1, and No. 2 is Blaze and Absolute at the same position nodesu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p><em>This is bad.</em></p>
<p>The two sweated coldly, wondering what excuses should they make.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather than that, why are you two in such a place?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ah……”</p>
<p>“Tha,that is……”</p>

<p>Clara, hit her palm plop.</p>

<p>“I understand nodesu!”</p>

<p>Haruto and Iris&#8217; hearts, jumped up with a startle——,</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of you were interested in the old church, right!?”</p>

<p>——they lose their strength as if they would touch the ground.</p>

<p>“A,ah…… well, that’s about it.”</p>

<p>To Haruto who had no choice but to talk, Clara made her eyes shine.</p>

<p>“Is that so nodesu! Is that so nodesu! As for the old Luminous architecture in Blaze, it seems to be a valuable thing that’s hardly like any other nodesu! If you’ve never seen this, it&#8217;s natural to think so nodesu!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clara looked around with her excited eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be around here nodesu. But have you found it nodesu?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was hard for them to say that it was the nearby pile of rubble.<em> (TN: It was destroyed. LOL)</em></p>
