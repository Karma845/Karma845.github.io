<h2>Chapter 2 - Senpai is not happy.</h2>

<b>Part 1</span></b></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki, she hates baths, and she didn't fix it when she got to university. Asahi thinks this is amazing&#8212;don't you feel uncomfortable if you don't shower every day? Since childhood, he had said to Aki several times: Aki Nee-san, go take a bath!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, this sentence has another meaning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;&#8212; Aki Nee-san, go take a shower."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi said this, and glanced at the clock hanging on the wall. It was just past 8:35 pm&#8212;Asahi's heart was very anxious. Even though Aki didn't bathe too much, as long as she started bathing, it would take a long time, so now it was appropriate for her to take a bath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Aki firmly refused -</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Not going"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You said you wanted to win, you ran? Asahi was always like this, it's too strong--Ahhh!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shouted Aki. With a sound, she turned her&nbsp;head. The two of them were playing a fighting game indoors. Aki doesn't seem to be playing much of a game lately, and the battles are one-sided. Asahi thought to himself: While toying with himself, Senpai must feel the same way too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi looked away from Aki, and muttered&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aki Nee-san, the shoulder strap is untied."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh?...Ah, is this too lustful for Asahi?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki is wearing a camisole top and lower body. Dressed in hot pants, this outfit makes one wonder where to put one's eyes. She lay on her&nbsp;back on the floor and straightened her&nbsp;shoulder straps back. Aki's black hair was scattered on the wooden floor of the room, like spilled charcoal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The battery is exactly the same as before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No change in personality or appearance. The only thing that changes is lying on your back and stretching the suspenders to a larger chest. Face without make up, wearing rustic black framed glasses. Even though she has a good foundation, she just doesn't dress up. Asahi didn't think she was very similar to Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki slowly got up and picked up the handle she threw back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi, how are you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you mean?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Didn't I write in a text message. Do you have a lover?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's not a boyfriend. However, Asahi didn't want Aki to know about his Senpai's whereabouts. Unlike Tsubasa, from another point of view, letting her&nbsp;know was just as troublesome. From a long time ago, Aki seemed to think of Asahi as her&nbsp;own.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/17fsBnJ/11.jpg" alt="11" border="0"></a>

<p>It was the only love letter Asahi received in his life. The person who wrote the love letter was a girl in the next class. Due to his lack of understanding, Asahi didn't think he would be like him, but these were still sweet and sour memories.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Until the love letter was found by Aki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi recalled what happened back then, and casually replied:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No. Do you want to take an early shower?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ahaha, Asahi doesn't have a girlfriend? You're already a high school student, but you have to show some energy. Could it be that you still think you're still a child?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki seems very happy for some reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"However, this is Asahi. Aren't there any pretty girls in class? Do you have any photos? Let me check. Aki check! Choose the girl that suits you best&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You, you are a student, and you still haven't got a boyfriend."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The battery stops for a few seconds.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;I didn't pay for it, but I didn't pay for it!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's fine, go take a shower."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Wait when I win!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi really cares about timing. If it wasn't for the deal with his Senpai, he wouldn't be like this. Even though Aki got in the way, Asahi knew why she didn't want to stay at his house today. Over dinner, Aki mutters to Asahi's mother: I knew it would be like this, so I lived alone when I was in college.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's impossible to turn a deaf ear and pretend you don't know what's going on between your family members. Asahi understood: In the end, he didn't even have the energy to face his family, he just wanted to run away. After playing with Aki for a long time, Asahi was naturally happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's just that, up until now, Asahi had a higher priority than this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Asahi can only turn himself into a demon&#8212;he has a family heirloom sword. Since childhood, there is a saying that Aki who doesn't take a bath can take a shower right away-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aki Nee-san"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's wrong? Hurry up, stay with me for a while-"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You smell"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This sentence allows Aki to take a fatal blow from a heavyweight boxer, a full blow from a professional baseball player, and an electric shock from a stun gun at the same time. After she fell, the expression she showed was as if she had been sprayed by the newest water spray gun.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">42 minutes, Aki rushed out of the room to take a shower. Asahi heaved a sigh of relief&#8212;he didn't really smell that bad. Sorry, Aki Nee-san&#8212;I said to myself. But this way, time can catch up. Just in case, Asahi walked to the door and planned to lock it. As soon as he stretched out his hand, the door opened with a click.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm back again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Yeah, Aki Nee-san, what's wrong?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A hint of surprise appeared on Aki's face. This sudden attack seemed to make her&nbsp;look at Asahi's anxious appearance. Aki looked around the room and stopped at the clock on the wall&#8212;but she immediately shook her head again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I forgot that it was my first time coming to this house, and I couldn't find the bathroom.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It turned out like this&#8212;Asahi was relieved.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"On the first floor, down the stairs, the sliding door next to it is the dressing room. The dressing room and kitchen are next door. If anything happens, tell my mom. You can use soap or whatever."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see. ... Ah, yes. There's one more thing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Aki turned around, I turned around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was just looking at my phone when I came out of the room. My mom told me to come back tomorrow, otherwise they can't discuss it.... I don't plan on coming back. I'll tell your mom. I'll be staying another night tomorrow."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yes, after Aki left, Asahi waited for a while. This is to prevent her&nbsp;from doubting. Confirming that Aki was no longer on the second floor, Asahi locked the door from the inside. After being locked, Asahi remembered what Aki said. ...Will you stay one night tomorrow?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This matter was indeed very interesting, but now there was no time for Asahi to think. Because today was the first time and the first night&#8212;not because Senpai was summoned, but at the appointed time, on the balcony, the door between the two was opened. From today onwards, Asahi would likely find out what Senpai had not known until now&#8212;this was a double-edged sword prepared for this. Try to avoid making mistakes as much as possible and practice in your brain-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">to Asahi, Senpai was like an invincible fortress.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;Senpai will always exceed his&nbsp;expectations.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi looked at the phone screen carefully, at 9 o'clock, he immediately opened the curtain. Asahi was mentally prepared - even if his Senpai was wearing cat ears, or wearing some other special costume, standing on the opposite side, or full of confidence, slowly opening the curtains to emerge, Asahi could remain calm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But in reality none of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi couldn't help but call out. Senpai wasn't on the balcony. But the window on Senpai was open.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The curtains were wide open, the windows were open, and the screens weren't closed. But there was no Senpai's figure in the room. Asahi opened his bedroom window, and the scent of night wafted through the air.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi took a deep breath&#8212;in this scent, there seemed to be a floral scent that was&#8230; refreshing&#8230; sweet&#8212;this was Senpai's scent. Is this the smell in Senpai's room?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">An LED light shines in an empty room - the room is bright and clearly visible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Did Senpai wash her hands before the agreed time? Or did the family catch them when they went to buy snacks and tea?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Regardless of the actual situation- Asahi had never seen Senpai so clearly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While chatting on the windowsill, that senpai often opened the curtains and walked to the balcony. It's not that he hasn't seen Senpai's room, but Senpai is always standing in front of him, so his&nbsp;eyesight has never been better than now. And once again, Asahi couldn't observe her&nbsp;room in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's better to say that he didn't watch as much, and still put on a "my curiosity isn't that great" expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, this made Asahi feel very refreshed. Senpai's room is a typical girl's room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi had never seen another girl's room except for Aki. Aki's room was always filled with games and comics, which was a complete mess&#8212;It wasn't like Asahi wasn't aware of what a normal girl's room looked like. But Senpai's room was exactly the same as a &#8220;feminine and cute room&#8221; according to Asahi's impression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's room is generally white like cherry blossoms and yellowish white. The furniture is set against the wall, with a shaggy oval rug as the centerpiece, an empty space in the room. On the single bed in the room, the pillowcases and sheets are pulled together into a cat pattern. There was a small bookshelf on the compact study table, next to a small TV set. There was a wicker hanging basket in the wardrobe, and lots of dolls placed in the cupboard-except the cat...the others seemed to be characters in the animation. But looking from Asahi's room, that part became a blind spot, and it was hard to see clearly&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai suddenly jumped out of that blind spot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"--Ha!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi was surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hehe. I surprised Asahi-kun&#8230; Asahi-kun&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's eyes were full of mischief, and the corner of her&nbsp;mouth revealed a satisfied smile. She didn't seem to be laughing because Asahi was surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's voice seemed to be biting its prey tightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Asahi-kun, are you looking straight at my room again?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai&#8230; what do you mean?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You don't have to act stupid. Asahi-kun kept staring all over the corner of my room. You watched it again, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I, I&#8230; I didn't watch it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that true?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai looked at him as if she would see Asahi from start to finish. Asahi felt sweat running down his back. Senpai's eyes, Senpai's taste, Senpai's room, and Senpai's question.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's really hard to keep it hidden.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...........I watched it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi's answer&#8212;at the time of answering, the Senpai suddenly smiled. His senpai was the same as always, her&nbsp;cheeks were flushed, her&nbsp;smile was deep, and her&nbsp;body was trembling slightly. She wrapped her&nbsp;arms around her shoulders, and after she stopped shaking, she walked slowly to the balcony.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She put her&nbsp;hand on the armrest, blowing the night breeze.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai excitedly said--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun, I made you wait a long time. This is an unforgettable first experience. What are we going to talk about? This is the first time you've asked me to come out and chat. Then, let Asahi-kun talk first."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi rubbed his fiery cheeks with both hands, and recovered his composure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Senpai... There's actually a guest from our house today--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi actually thought about it a bit. He wanted to ask a question about Senpai himself after the two of them opened the window. However, it might be better to talk about some topics about Aki today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi eloquently said. The senpai snorted and echoed: This is a topic regarding the Asahi family</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">-she seems quite happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Tonight, it's still long.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The so-called same class meant they found it troublesome and had nowhere to escape to.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">During the day, Asahi saw the line of sight. Asahi didn't know what that line of sight meant, but he knew that it was asking him. As far as possible, Asahi wanted to avoid it. After the class meeting before heading home, Asahi immediately got up from his seat&#8212;but before leaving the classroom, he was caught by his school bag.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Amehashi"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi corrected his path.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...My name is Amaharashi"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">but Tsubasa didn't care about it at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Can I bother you for a moment? I want to hear Ameharashi-kun's opinion. It's about Senpai"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;This senpai is referring to Himi Senpai?&#8230;Why do you want to hear my opinion?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi couldn't resist. As she was dragged to the back of the class, Asahi asked. Tsubasa paused for a moment and turned her&nbsp;head--this was also the case when talking about Senpai earlier. Although it wasn't confusing, Tsubasa's expression looked strange.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;What should I say&#8230; Before this, when I talked to you about Senpai, I couldn't stop&#8230; Why is this? &#8230; After all, you took the same bus to and from school with Senpai. ? I think this could be a reference.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you mean?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Don't you think Senpai looks weird lately?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi still didn't understand the meaning Tsubasa wanted to show. He didn't want to say any extra words, so he answered carefully.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is strange?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Amaharashi-kun, are you saying that Senpai is the same as always? My friend&#8230; He's also a fan of Senpai, and I asked him, she also said that she didn't know. She said that Senpai was the same as before. Same, it's still Goddess-Senpai. But I don't think so. And the Goddess body said that too. Senpai is very happy&#8212;I noticed this morning. I think something happened."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...What's the matter &#8212;&#8212;What do you mean?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;That means something happened that made Senpai never so happy.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi met Senpai this morning. They had no appointments&#8212;after Aki toasted and said goodbye to him, as soon as he left the house, the two of them happened to be walking together. Things like this happen often. Before walking to the bus stop, the two of them chatted for a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At that time, Senpai was very happy. Asahi also felt that she had never been this happy before. Ever since I started chatting on the balcony last night, Senpai was very happy. However, this is only done before walking to the bus stop -</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">on the bus where you might run into other students, and after arriving at the bus stop on the side of the school, in Asahi's eyes, Senpai will turn back into a goddess".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai would make loud laughter like bells, greet peers and juniors without discrimination, and respond to other people's gossip nonchalantly. I didn't see any excitement after seeing Asahi's reaction the night before. That senpai left that secret world completely in secret.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, Asahi was very surprised&#8212;he couldn't help but stare at Tsubasa subconsciously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa immediately asked back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's wrong? Amaharashi-kun have a clue?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Uh, no--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa's feelings for Senpai--she really admires and admires Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Would you notice this under normal circumstances? They hadn't even spoken in the past few days&#8212;but Tsubasa said she noticed this this morning. Senpai might have been very happy from last night until this morning, but how could an ordinary person notice this the next morning?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">... Asahi had to get rid of suspicions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;What do you think makes Senpai so happy?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa frowned in disdain and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't want to think about it at all. If it's true, I'll find out that person and tell him that he's not worthy of being a Senpai. Someone who is worthy of being a Senpai. But&#8230; I'm just setting an example&#8230; I also thought to myself that maybe that senpai was confessed to by someone, or she confessed to someone and got a positive answer."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa didn't seem to notice that Asahi's heart was shaking--she continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;This morning, I met Senpai at the school building by chance. When she wished me good morning, her&nbsp;voice was a little like that. I took a closer look. Although her&nbsp;expression was the same as usual, it was very attractive &#8211; her&nbsp;pupils were shining deeply and she looked very happy. These steps are also very light. The most important thing is that my Goddess body is sending a distress signal."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;... Huh? Goddess body? What's that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's an inexplicable word, very interesting. ...By the way, before this, this word also appeared in the conversation. And Tsubasa's reaction was like explaining common sense&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Whatever, the body of the Goddess is the body of the Goddess."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that... a very tall tree in the temple, or a consecrated spear?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa smiled a few times and showed a satisfied smile on her&nbsp;face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. However, this is not from the temple, but mine... only belongs to my own Goddess body. This is proof of my love for Senpai. Only I will be protected..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She always felt like she was saying some great things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa suddenly looked around the classroom, and she seemed to confirm the sight of her&nbsp;classmates. She changed the angle of her body, and when only Asahi could see it, she quietly took it out of her skirt pocket. Tsubasa immediately showed a drunken look.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm just showing you Amaharashi-kun. It's amazing, isn't it? It took three years to put together with all my hard work. Ah, it's so beautiful..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a bunch of long hair tied with a ribbon.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though the part of the hair inside wasn't new, it still sparkled under the light.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's sacred... Sure enough, it's not something that ordinary people can possess..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh, Tsubasa? This hair... could it be&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi's brain suddenly flashed in the conversation with Tsubasa the other day. Tsubasa said if Senpai dropped something, she would take it. Tsubasa also said another sentence at the time-hair is fine. Asahi was still feeling unclear back then, so now it seems--.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa held the so-called "Goddess body" in her&nbsp;mouth tightly in her&nbsp;arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is Senpai's hair"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">... It is true!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi felt goosebumps all over his body. He wanted to run away, but he had nowhere to run. Wait a minute-why is the person who secretly collects Senpai's hair and calls it the body of the Goddess, can show an innocent smile in local company advertisements, and sometimes also appear on location in information programs? Older viewers who watch TV often call her&nbsp;"Tsubaki, Tsubaki". (TLN: Tsubaki means camellia flower)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This world is really strange.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I will show great compassion and let Amaharashi-kun touch him. You will feel spiritual power, and your body and mind will be purified."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...No need"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ahaha, you have nothing to be ashamed of. I will give it to you for the first time. Others saw this Goddess body. Senpai's hair is more than beautiful to me. It is the essence that combines everything between me and Senpai. It is a symbol of our destiny... . Why do you look like that? Is your face cramping?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...I do not."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really? It doesn't matter. I said, I think timing is fate. Some people think it's just chance, and it doesn't matter who the other party is - but the other party can appear at the right time at the right time. That same time is called destiny. Think about it carefully&#8212;when you are hurt in a broken relationship, if you are treated well by someone, you will hang out with that person, right? Then it is a happy relationship. However, if treated gently is before a broken love, happy times will stop, and people who treat you tenderly will most likely go to waste, won't they? This means that time is the key and starting point for destiny."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa looked into the distance. (Next is Tsubasa's Monologue)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think it's very interesting. Very beautiful.... That's true for me too. Whether it's Senpai's hair or the same junior high school as Senpai. I'm in the first year of junior high school. High school, and Senpai is Third year of junior high school &#8212;even though it's a common thing. I&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220; &#8212;I was very busy with work at the time, and I was a little overwhelmed because I occasionally attended programs that were broadcast nationally. Senpai doesn't seem to have a good impression of me&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8212;You see, I'm not only approachable, but also a beautiful star, and I also talk to a humble boy like Amaharashi-kun. I am a gentle and friendly person. But it's also because I'm looking forward to Senpai, hehehe&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi thought to himself&#8212;'I hope that Senpai won't run into Tsubasa.'</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;But in the first year of middle school, I was wrong. I heard about my Senpai - I heard someone say that there is a very beautiful third year student. So I thought: As a star, I should be prettier. However, the atmosphere I'm showing seems to arouse the hatred of the Senpais&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8212;One day, when I noticed, some of the girls who had been flattering me until then suddenly started ignoring me. At first, I was excited and thought it was no big deal. Because not only girls, but also many boys admire me. ...But that summer, I lost my father. It was really sudden.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi looked surprised and looked at Tsubasa. Tsubasa held the Goddess body and smiled sadly. This was the first time Asahi had seen Tsubasa make that expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm so desperate. Ignored, there's no way to pretend that nothing happened. The combination of my father's incident and being hated at school made me very depressed. But I swore in my heart that I would never cry in front of those idiot girls. So during breaks, I often ran off to the playground alone. Sitting on the edge of the flowerbed, crying alone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai spoke to me at that time.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;How did Senpai know about me? Is it to talk to me and look for me in school? Or were you talking to me when you saw me by accident? &#8212;&#8212;I didn't know about this.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;All in all, that senpai walked over to me and sat next to me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I should have said at that point: What are you doing? I don't remember clearly. I should have said some really hurtful things back then: Go somewhere else, don't sit next to me without permission."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;However, that Senpai smiled at me&#8212;like an angel, a goddess, or a saint.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Then, that Senpai said to me:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;The tears of a beautiful girl will rise to the sky and become a star. I've seen this line in a picture book before. I think this sentence is very good. Things will pass. Noumachi-san cried a lot today. At night, she straightened her&nbsp;chest and said to himself-how! The reason why this starry sky is so beautiful is because of you!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;The timing was absolutely perfect.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai is a very kind person. Precisely because of that moment, I felt more&#8230; It was like destiny, piercing deep into my heart&#8212;whether it was Senpai's words or the sun shining. I thought at that time: Precisely because of Senpai, the sun became so beautiful. The scene was so beautiful that I shed tears again.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Amaharashi-kun&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;can you understand? This is the time. After all, dramatic timing can always turn an accident into fate. Senpai won't fall in love with a dirty ordinary man. Senpai is holy&#8230; However, there will be times like magic attacks in this world- that's called destiny. It even makes people feel like: Ah, the reason why I like this person is because it's inevitable"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Another classmate walked nearby, and while speaking, Tsubasa hid the Goddess's body in her&nbsp;pocket. Did she himself find this embarrassing? Or-or was she based on religious thought, and she felt she would lose her&nbsp;spiritual power when seen by others, so she would act like this?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you come across something at a time like that&#8230; fall in love with a boy who doesn't deserve her - to take the wrong path, even Senpai, it's not impossible. I said, Amaharashi-kun, you can understand what I'm worried, right? If there's something strange about Senpai's appearance&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't think Senpai's appearance was that strange,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi replied. Tsubasa didn't say anything.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Since they are all students from the same school, that Senpai will nod at me when on the bus. That's all. I think Senpai is the same as before"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa sighed as if looking down on him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;That's it. It turns out that Amaharashi-kun is just like everyone else. However, you don't understand Senpai at all. Of course. It's a loss to show you the body of the Goddess.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If possible, Asahi didn't want to see that either.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But it doesn't matter. I know. I know that's enough. If there's a strange figure around Senpai, at least let me know? Or help me get her hair, okay? If it's done well, I'll give you a gift."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa didn't think "The thing that makes Senpai very happy has to do with Asahi."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If there was a strange figure, what would you do?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah? Does that still need me to say? Even if it was a miraculous time and destiny for Senpai, it might not be like this for me. I didn't feel like studying at all. I don't think it's a good thing for Senpai to be happy right now. Because it was Senpai who got hurt in the end. If that Senpai is with a man who doesn't deserve her&#8230;.Even if it makes me hated by Senpai for a while, even if the other party is that night, no matter who&#8212;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With a cute expression, Tsubasa gave a thumbs up and pointed to the side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;It's like cutting the neck.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll let it fly to ashes"</span></p>

<p>... In the next second, Asahi broke out in cold sweat, and a wry smile appeared slightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Very well. Making a mistake is indeed the right answer. Even if you are hated, you have to dissuade others from falling in love - this offensive method is truly full of self-sacrifice. If she disturbed Asahi and Senpai's peaceful world with such heroic awareness - Asahi would definitely have nothing to do with him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi felt that even if she interfered, that Senpai would not be angry. Maybe Tsubasa said that only because she had done it&#8212;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;Asahi thought so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He still didn't know Senpai well enough.</span></p>
