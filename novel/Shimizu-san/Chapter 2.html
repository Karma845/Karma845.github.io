<h2>Chapter 2: Cooking Class with Shimizu-san</h2>

<p>“Let’s start talking about love again today.”</p>

<p>　As soon as I took my seat in the morning, Toshiya approached me and said to me.</p>

<p>“Toshiya, don’t you have morning practice with the soccer team?”</p>
<p>“It’s already done.”</p>
<p>“Are we going to talk about love again? “</p>
<p>“I still have a lot to ask you.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, but do you really still have a lot of things to ask me? “</p>
<p>“Of course. I’ll tell you about me too, please.”</p>

<p>　 Toshiya puts his hands together in front of his face. Toshiya already told me who he likes, so I don’t have any more questions for him. I do my usual habit of checking our surroundings. It seems that no one is listening to us. I am a little concerned that Shimizu-san is already sitting next to me, but I don’t think she is listening since she is wearing earphones and fiddling with her phone.</p>

<p>“Well, whatever. So what do you want to ask me today? “</p>
<p>“I already know that the type of girl Daiki likes is a neat girl. This time I want to ask you what you want her to do.”</p>
<p>“What do I want her to do? “</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. A healthy boy would want a girl he likes to do one or two things for him, wouldn’t he? “</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>　To be honest, it doesn’t really ring a bell. </p>

<p>“That’s how it is. Today we’re going to let Daiki’s desires be exposed.”</p>

<p>　 Toshiya’s face is covered with a smile that could best be described as a grin.</p>

<p>“How to say this, I don’t know what kind of answer you’re trying to get.”</p>
<p>“Don’t make that face. Well, I guess we’re going nowhere, so I’ll talk first. What I want her to do for me is to cheer for me at soccer games! Isn’t it a dream for guys in the sports club to have their favorite girl cheer for them? “</p>
<p>“I can understand that a little bit.”</p>

<p>　I can certainly understand the feeling of wanting to be cheered on by a girl you like when you’re working hard, even though I’m not in the sports club.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you understand. I want you to think about what you want the girl you like to do for you like this.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Give me a moment to think about it.”</p>
<p>“Okay. There’s still time for homeroom, so take your time.”</p>

<p>　My crush is doing something for me… I’m trying to think, but I can’t think of anything.</p>

<p>“Hmm. I can’t think of anything.”</p>
<p>“Selfless? Don’t you have anything you’d like her to do for you? “</p>

<p>　It’s not that I don’t have any particular desires, but I can’t think of anything that would make me go out of my way and ask someone I like to do it for me.</p>

<p>“I have something I’d like Teruno to do for me, though.”</p>
<p>“There’s no point in saying what you want your little sister to do. Gee, you’re still the same as ever with Teruno-chan.”</p>
<p>“I want her to help me with my chores, even if it’s just a little.”</p>
<p>“You sound more like a mom rather than a brother…”</p>

<p>　I have a younger sister named Teruno who is in the third grade of junior high school. Since both of our parents work and don’t come home until late, I do all the housework such as cooking dinner on weekdays, and Teruno is not very willing to help me. We get along well as siblings since we always play games and watch anime together, so I think it’s just because she’s too lazy to do the housework.</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>　Thinking about such a lazy sister, I thought of the answer to the question I was asked earlier.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong? “</p>
<p>“I have something I want her to do.”</p>
<p>“Oh?! What’s that? “</p>
<p>“一一I want her to cook together with me.”</p>

<p>　As soon as I said that, out of the corner of my eye, I saw Shimizu-san’s finger on her phone stopped for some reason.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that what you want Teruno-chan to do for you? “</p>

<p>　 Toshiya looked at me with a puzzled look on his face.</p>

<p>“True, I do want Teruno to help me cook because I usually cook dinner by myself, but I also thought it’d be nice to cook with someone I liked.”</p>

<p>　Since I cook dinner by myself on weekdays and my parents only cook for us on weekends, I rarely have a chance to cook with someone. So, sometimes I wanted to cook with someone.</p>

<p>“I see. I remember that in our previous love talk, you said that you wanted to do something together with the girl you like. So, from Daiki’s point of view, you like a girl who can cook.”</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>　Even if she’s not very good at cooking, I’d be happy if she simply cooks with me.</p>

<p>“Is there something you want to cook together?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t really thought that far ahead, but if I were to cook with her, it would probably be a regular home-cooked meal.”</p>

<p>　If I have someone to help me, I’d like to have fun cooking, so I think I’d rather cook something I’m used to.</p>

<p>“Something like curry or hamburger steak?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, something like that. “</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm. That’s good. The fantasy is getting more concrete.”</p>

<p>　For some reason, Toshiya seems to be happy to hear what I say. I look over at Shimizu-san, who is suddenly tapping her phone quickly. I wonder if she is playing some kind of rhythm music game?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>　I look over at Shimizu-san, who is suddenly tapping her phone quickly. I wonder if she is playing some kind of rhythm music game?</p>

<p>“Daiki, where are you looking? “</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry. Keep talking.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay. But what you just said sounds more like something you want to do together rather than something you want the girl you like to do for you, which is a bit different from what I was asking. Is there anything else? “</p>
<p>“What else do I want her to do… That’s a tough one.”</p>

<p>　I try to think of what I want Teruno to do, but none of them seem to fit the situation.</p>

<p>“If Daiki can’t think of anything, maybe I should think of a situation… right, to connect with what we were talking about earlier. How about having her cook for you?”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, I’d like to help her too.”</p>
<p>“Well, Daiki would have done that…”</p>

<p>　 Toshiya closes his eyes and starts grumbling. After a few dozen seconds, he opens his eyes vigorously.</p>

<p>“No, wait. How about a homemade bentō (lunch box)?”</p>
<p>“A homemade bentō? “</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. Daiki always buys bread from the store for lunch, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>　We are all night owls in my family and are very weak in the morning, so usually, we don’t have time to make lunches. That’s why I always had bread from the store for lunch.</p>

<p>“Then, Daiki probably would be interested in a bentō made by the girl you like, wouldn’t you? “</p>
<p>“That may be true…”</p>

<p>　I usually eat bread because I’m not picky about what meals I eat alone, but sometimes I envy others’ lunch boxes. I think I will be happy if I get a bentō from someone I like.</p>

<p>“Right! You yearn for a homemade bentō from the girl you like, don’t you? “</p>
<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>　 Toshiya’s tension is rising visibly.</p>

<p>“Seto-san’s homemade bento… if there are my favorite foods in it, just imagining it would be dangerous for me…”</p>

<p>　Toshiya was so excited that he was half-immersed in a fantasy world. He may have been completely unaware of it, but he casually mentioned Seto-san’s name. Fortunately, people around us didn’t seem to listen to our conversation.</p>

<p>“What would Daiki like in the bentō?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking ginger pork.”</p>
<p>“Sounds great. Our fantasies are steadily expanding. I like Seto-san whether she can cook or not, but I’d probably cry with happiness if she gave me a homemade bentō.”</p>

<p>　Apparently, Toshiya’s love for Seto-san is quite deep. I have no experience of liking someone that much, so I admire and respect him. I won’t tell him though, because he might get carried away.</p>

<p>“It would be nice if she could make me lunch.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s one of the dreams that I want to make come true.”</p>

<p>　Toshiya is always serious when discussing his dreams, so I guess he intends to make this dream come true as much as possible. While I was thinking like this, the doorbell rang to announce five minutes before homeroom.</p>

<p>“Hey, is it that late already?”</p>
<p>“I guess we’re out of time.”</p>
<p>“Too bad, because I still have a lot to talk about. I guess I’d better go back.”</p>

<p>　 Toshiya reluctantly walked to his seat. I looked around and saw Shimizu-san tapping her phone eagerly. Is she still playing the rhythm game? It’s almost homeroom, so she’d better put her phone away. As I was wondering whether I should tell Shimizu-san so or not, Toshiya came back to my seat.</p>

<p>“I just remembered that Daiki’s wish to cook with someone will come true tomorrow! “</p>
<p>“What’s happening tomorrow? Oh… “</p>

<p>　At first, I didn’t understand what he meant, but then I looked at the timetable and remembered.</p>

<p>“Right. It’s a cooking class! “</p>

<p>　He’s right. Tomorrow is a cooking class. One of the few times I get to cook with my classmates.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>“Damn. I could’ve had Seto-san’s homemade cooking if I was in the same group with her.”</p>
<p>“The cooking class work is divided among the group members, so I don’t know if you can call it Seto-san’s homemade cooking. Or rather, Toshiya, why don’t you go to your own group?”</p>

<p>　On the day of the cooking class, Toshiya was sitting next to me, wearing an apron and lamenting his misfortune. He seemed to be really disappointed.</p>

<p>“Daiki, aren’t you a little cold? Your friend is grieving, so please comfort him.”</p>

<p>　I could easily damage Toshiya’s mental state if I did not choose my words carefully. I put on my apron and let my brain run to the limit.</p>

<p>“Toshiya wanted Seto-san to cook for you, didn’t you? If that’s the case, then the food in this cooking class is a little different. Even if you can’t eat it now, I think the food she made by herself later would be more meaningful for Toshiya.”</p>
<p>“Da-Daiki! “</p>

<p>　 Toshiya’s face lits up.</p>

<p>“You’re right! It’s more meaningful to have her cook by herself for me! I feel better! Thanks Daiki! “</p>
<p>“I’m glad you’re feeling better.”</p>

<p>　Just when I thought the matter was settled, the door to the kitchen rattled open with a bang. It was Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“What was Shimizu-san doing here? “</p>
<p>“You idiot, Shimizu-san will hear you!”</p>

<p>　The classmates in the kitchen were in an uproar. Why were they so surprised? It’s because Shimizu-san seldom comes to the cooking class. She has never been seen in a class where she has to cooperate with others, especially in the cooking classes. Even among the well-informed people, there seems to be a difference of opinion as to why Shimizu-san was able to advance to the next grade.</p>

<p>“Daiki, I’m going to my group.”</p>

<p>　When I turned my head to the side, Toshiya was already gone, and Shimizu-san was standing near me instead. Just like my other classmates, I guess Toshiya was also afraid of Shimizu-san, so he ran away to his own group.</p>
<p>　The seating positions in the cooking class correspond to those in the classroom. Therefore, Shimizu-san and I are members of the same group, but I had forgotten about it because Shimizu-san had never come to the cooking class until now.</p>
<p>　I looked at Shimizu-san, who was standing next to me.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“W-what is it?”</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san, who had finished putting on her apron, turned to me and stared at me.</p>

<p>“We’re in the same group, so let’s work hard together today. Also, that apron looks very good on you.”</p>
<p>“Ughh…”</p>

<p>　I was slightly surprised to see Shimizu-san, but it was the usual Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>　As I was relieved, the home economics teacher entered the kitchen. He looked surprised at the presence of Shimizu-san for a moment, but his expression immediately returned to normal.</p>

<p>“Alright, I see that everyone is dressed and waiting for me. Today, as I told you before, you are going to cook stir-fried meat and vegetables. Please divide the role to each group’s member and cook safely.”</p>

<p>[Yesー,] voices echo in the kitchen. Thus we followed the teacher’s instructions and began to prepare for the cooking.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>　It had been for some time since we started the cooking class, and our group had reached the stage of cutting the ingredients.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span>

<p>“Who was in charge of cutting the ingredients?”</p>
<p>“It’s only me.”</p>

<p>　I answer Kon’no question, who is sitting in front of me in the classroom.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>“Uhh, shouldn’t two people be in charge of cutting the food?”</p>
<p>“There weren’t many people in our group, so I’m the only one who cuts the food.”</p>
<p>“Ah, come to think of it, that’s right.”</p>

<p>　To be precise, the number of people in our group is the same as the other groups. However, we always assume it was reduced by one because Shimizu-san was usually absent.</p>

<p>“Oy.”</p>
<p>“Sh-Shimizu-san? I-is there a problem?”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san’s sudden remark made Kon’no surprised and he panicked.</p>

<p>“W-what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“I’ll do it too.”</p>
<p>“Yes…?”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>　 Kon’no looks like he just heard something unbelievable.</p>

<p>“I said I’d cut the food too. If it’s a two-person job, why not have me do it? Besides, if I don’t do anything, I will be treated as a slacker…”</p>

<p>　She spoke rather quickly, but I guess she meant that Shimizu-san would help me cut the ingredients. However, there is one thing I am concerned about.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you will help me, but have you ever used a knife, Shimizu-san? “</p>
<p>” …no problem.”</p>

<p>　What’s with this pause before her answer? I felt an inexpressible anxiety.</p>

<p>“I’ll ask you again, Shimizu-san, can you use a kitchen knife properly? “</p>
<p>“…it’s not a problem.”</p>

<p>　I asked again, but the pause before her answer did not disappear. I tried to make eye contact with Shimizu-san, but she turned her head away from me. It makes me nervous, but I want to respect her desire to do what she wants to do.</p>

<p>“I get it. Is that okay with you guys? “</p>

<p>　I checked with the other members of the group, and they all nodded their heads in agreement. Some of them looked relieved. Perhaps they don’t want to do the same work with Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Then it’s decided. Let’s work hard together, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>

<p>　Thus, Shimizu-san helped me with the task of cutting the ingredients, which I was the only one in charge of.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, first of all, can you cut the cabbage into an appropriate size?”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>　There are four kinds of ingredients to be cut this time: cabbage, onions, carrots, and pork ribs. I had a little trouble deciding which one to ask Shimizu-san to cut first, but I decided to ask her to cut the cabbage first.</p>
<p>　What should I cut first? I should cut the pork belly last and start with the carrot, which is hard and difficult to cut. Thinking about this, I turned to Shimizu-san, who was staring at the cabbage with a knife in her hand.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san? Can you put the knife down for a moment?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“…uh? Okay. “</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san follows my instruction with a question mark on her head. I look around. Fortunately, our classmates seem to be too absorbed in their work or conversation to look at her. That was dangerous, if someone had seen how Shimizu-san was holding the knife, they might have screamed.</p>

<p>“I want to ask Shimizu-san, what were you trying to do earlier? “</p>
<p>“Didn’t you tell me to cut a piece of cabbage? “</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san looked at me strangely.</p>

<p>“I did say that, but why were you holding the knife like that? “</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>“The way I hold it? “</p>
<p>“Yes. When you cut cabbage or anything, you basically hold it like this.”</p>

<p>　I hold the knife normally and show it to Shimizu-san. Shimizu-san stared at the way I held the knife, and at the same time, her face turned red rapidly.</p>

<p>“I-I was nervous. I usually hold it like that.”</p>
<p>“It’s true that cooking in front of other people can make you nervous.”</p>

<p>　I put the knife back on the table. I have never seen a person hold a knife upside down because of nervousness, but now I know there are people like that in the world.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>“Ah, I was just a little nervous. Now that I know how to hold it, can I cut the cabbage? “</p>
<p>“Okay. If you have any questions, just ask me.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san held the knife normally this time and grabbed a cabbage with her other hand. Then she brought the knife blade close to the edge of the cabbage.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san stop! Hold on for a second! “</p>
<p>“What now? “</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san puts down the knife again with a look of puzzlement on her face.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>“I’d like to say a lot of things, but first of all, how were you going to cut the cabbage? “</p>
<p>“Cabbage is usually shredded, right?”</p>

<p>　Her eyes were clear, and I immediately knew she was not joking.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>“That notion is not wrong, but this time it’s not shredded because it’s used for stir-fried meat and vegetables.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? “</p>

<p>　If I hadn’t been looking at Shimizu-san, my group would have ended up with [Stir-fried meat and vegetables with shredded cabbage.]</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>
<p>“Then how big do I need to cut it? “</p>
<p>“I’ll cut the cabbage and show you how big to cut it later. Now, I’ll tell you how to cut the cabbage. First, cut it in half because if you cut it as it is, it will be round, unstable, and dangerous.”</p>
<p>” …I see.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>　I guess she didn’t know that either. I’m really glad I found it before she got hurt.</p>

<p>“I know how to cut it. Can I cut the cabbage now?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Be careful when you cut it.”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san holds the knife again for the third time. I was getting nervous as I watched her. Shimizu-san held the cabbage firmly with her left hand, put the knife in the middle of the cabbage, and cut it into two pieces without any difficulty.</p>

<p>“Is this okay?”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san looked somewhat uneasy. It might be because I pointed out her mistake twice.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s fine. It’s a clean-cut.”</p>
<p>“I see… That’s good.”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san looks relieved. I think her face looks a little reddish.</p>

<p>“Alright. Let’s keep going like this.”</p>
<p>“O-okay.”</p>

<p>　I gave her some more advice, and then Shimizu-san managed to finish cutting the cabbage.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Next, onions…”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san’s expression was somewhat uneasy.</p>

<p>“Now that the cabbage is done, the onions will be fine too.”</p>

<p>　I had already cut the carrots and pork ribs, so our work would be finished when the onions were cut.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll cut them.”</p>

<p>　Right, I didn’t tell her earlier, but I should teach her how to adjust her hand when she uses a knife.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, do you know what a cat’s paw is? “</p>
<p>“Cat’s paw?”</p>
<p>“When you use a knife, the hand that is holding onto the food should be shaped like a cat’s paw so that you don’t accidentally cut yourself.”</p>
<p>“What shape should a cat’s paw look like?? “</p>

<p>　Of course, the fingers should be lightly folded, but I think it’s hard to convey the idea just by saying it to her. I made my left hand into a cat’s paw and held it out in front of Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“This is the cat’s paw. Shimizu-san, try it too.”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san looked at my hand and made her left hand into a cat’s paw with a stiff movement.</p>

<p>“Like this?”</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0009_s8.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/s8.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>　To see the shape of her own hand, Shimizu-san seems to be posing like a cat instead because she puts her cat’s paw next to her face. I think she is completely unaware of it, but I don’t want to say anything about it because she might get angry if I do.</p>

<p>“Hey, is this wrong?”</p>
<p>“Uh, no, that’s okay.”</p>

<p>　I reply hurriedly. I hope my thoughts didn’t get across to her.</p>

<p>“Be careful when you cut it. And don’t forget the cat’s paw.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san’s knife was lowered to the halved onion.</p>

<p>“I’ll cut it, is that okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s fine. But you might want to reposition the cat’s hand slightly to make it safer for you.”</p>
<p>“Where should I put my hand?”</p>

<p>　I don’t think she can understand it if I tell her to put the tip of her folded middle and index finger of her left hand on the belly of the knife. I don’t know how to describe it. Maybe it would be faster to show it to her directly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to cut some onions, so can you watch me? “</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>*  *  *</p>

<p>　Then I tried several times to explain to Shimizu-san how to cut the onions, but she did not completely understand it.</p>

<p>“What to do――”</p>
<p>“I kind of know I’m wrong, but I don’t know what the right answer is…”</p>

<p>　Words are difficult. I think she can’t get the message just by looking at me. Then the only way left is to actually experience it.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, let me touch your hand for a moment…”</p>

<p>　Before I could finish, Shimizu-san quickly put down the knife and pulled her hands away.</p>

<p>“Y-you, what are you trying to do to me?”</p>
<p>“I was going to hold Shimizu-san’s hand to show you where to put your cat’s paw. Sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel bad.”</p>

<p>　I didn’t really mind touching others, but I guess there are many people who don’t like to be touched by others. Shimizu-san, I apologize.</p>

<p>“It’s not that I dislike it… “</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san seemed to have said something, but I couldn’t catch her low voice.</p>

<p>“…fine.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san? “</p>
<p>“I said it’s fine. So touch my hand and teach me.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? “</p>
<p>“I’m not going to repeat myself. Just show me how to do it now.”</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san is much more innocent than I thought. If you say so, I’ll not hesitate.</p>

<p>“I get it. If Shimizu-san is okay with it, then I’ll do that.”</p>

<p>　I moved quickly behind Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, I’ll touch you.”</p>
<p>“Bring it on!”</p>

<p>　 I slowly put my hand on top of Shimizu-san’s hand.</p>

<p>“Hyaaah――”</p>

<p>　I heard an unexpected scream, and the eyes of the group members were immediately drawn to us.</p>

<p>“… I’m not for show.”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san glares at the other group members around us. With her voice as a trigger, everyone’s gazes quickly scattered. It seems that they are going to pretend that they did not hear her scream earlier.</p>

<p>“Are you okay? Shimizu-san, are you sure you’re not overexerting yourself? “</p>
<p>“No problem. I was just caught off guard earlier. I’m not going to let my guard down again.”</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll do it again.”</p>

<p>　I don’t think I can catch her off guard if I touched her after I said I would touch her, but if she says so, I guess that’s how it is. I touched Shimizu-san’s hand again, but there was no scream this time.</p>

<p>“…So what do you want me to do? “</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san’s voice was a little quieter than before for some reason. I can’t see her expression because I was behind Shimizu-san, but I wonder if it is my imagination that her ears seem to be tinted a little vermilion.</p>

<p>“Take the knife. Then put the knife on the part of the onion you want to cut.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san placed the knife on the part she was going to cut next, as I instructed.</p>

<p>“Then, put your hand here.”</p>

<p>　I moved Shimizu-san’s left hand over the onion.</p>

<p>“Okay. Let’s cut it then.”</p>
<p>“If my hand is in the way, should I let go? “</p>
<p>“…keep it this way.”</p>

<p>　With that, Shimizu-san lowered the blade of her knife and successfully cut the onion.</p>

<p>“That’s good. Do you know what to do next? “</p>
<p>“The knife is there, so my left hand is here?”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san moves her left hand along with mine.</p>

<p>“Yes. I think that’s good. Once you know that, I think you’re good to go.”</p>
<p>“…not a hindrance…”</p>
<p>“What? “</p>
<p>“I said it’s not a hindrance, so just leave it as it is.”</p>
<p>“Uh, okay? I understand.”</p>

<p>　 I’m unsure how Shimizu-san feels, but she may still have some anxiety about using the knife. I have decided to continue assisting her until Shimizu-san says she no longer needs it.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll keep doing this.”</p>
<p>“Yes, here I go.”</p>

<p>　Her voice sounded a little happy. With that voice, the knife started to move.</p>

<p>“Is this okay?”</p>
<p>“Yep. That’s fine.”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san checks with me as she proceeds with the work little by little. While she was stopping the knife, I suddenly looked at Shimizu-san’s ear, which was as red as a tomato.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, are you okay? Your ears are red.”</p>
<p>“Huh? It’s not red! “</p>
<p>“No, It’s red. I don’t have a mirror, so I can’t show you now.”</p>
<p>“Uh, that’s because…”</p>

<p>　Despite being so close, Shimizu-san’s whisper didn’t reach my ears.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’m fine! Come on, we’re late, so let’s do this quickly.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine if Shimizu-san is okay. Let’s resume our work then.”</p>

<p>　In the end, my hand did not leave Shimizu-san’s until we finished cutting the onions.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, I’m glad our stir-fried meat and vegetables tasted good.”</p>

<p>　During the lunch break after the cooking class, we ate the stir-fried meat and vegetables we had prepared. After Shimizu-san and I cut the ingredients, the rest of the group members did a good job of stir-frying and seasoning the meat and vegetables, and the stir-fry turned out fine.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it’s pretty good.”</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san, eating next to me, seemed satisfied with the stir-fried meat and vegetable quality.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear that.”</p>
<p>“…Hondō, can I ask you one thing?”</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san, who had finished her stir-fry, turned her face toward me.</p>

<p>“What is it? “</p>
<p>“How was it cooking with me? “</p>

<p>　I wondered what she meant by this question, then I looked at Shimizu-san’s face again, and there was a subtle sign of anxiety on her face. Perhaps Shimizu-san felt that she had not been of any help? How should I answer her and get rid of her anxiety?</p>

<p>“To be honest, I was quite scared at first. I was afraid that Shimizu-san might hurt herself.”</p>
<p>“Ughh.”</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san turned her eyes away from me as if she had something on her mind.</p>

<p>“But I was happy that Shimizu-san cooked with me until the end.”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san turns her head toward me, and our eyes meet.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san worked very hard, and it was a lot of fun working with you. If you don’t mind, will you cook with me again during the next cooking class? “</p>

<p>　I ended up saying out loud everything I was thinking. I wonder what Shimizu-san thinks about it. After waiting for about 10 seconds, Shimizu-san opened her mouth.</p>

<p>“If…”</p>
<p>“If? “</p>
<p>“If you insist that much, we can do it together again next time.”</p>
<p>“Fufu-ahaha.”</p>
<p>“W-why are you laughing!”</p>

<p>　Oh, gosh. I couldn’t hold back my laughter.</p>

<p>“No, I was afraid you’d say no. Well, I’m looking forward to the next time, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“O-okay. It can’t be helped. “</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san replied while crossing her arms. I think I was looking forward to the next cooking lesson a little more than usual.</p>
