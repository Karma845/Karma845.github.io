<h2>Chapter 4: Shimizu Sisters’ Love Talk</h2>


<p>“I heard about that, Kei! “</p>

<p>　 On the night of the day I handed over the Bentō, Ai suddenly intruded into my room as I pondered over Hondō’s words.</p>

<p>“Who told you what? Besides, I always told you not to enter my room without permission.”</p>
<p>“That’s not important. Because Kei and I have a special relationship.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know the saying ‘There are manners even among close friends’? (親しき仲にも礼儀あ)り”</p>
<p>“Huh, Kei, you think of me as a close friend! I’m so happy! “</p>
<p>“Shut up. So, what did you hear?”</p>

<p>　Since I couldn’t see any way for Ai to quiet down if we continued arguing like this, I decided to listen to what she had to say for now.</p>

<p>“Ah, right! Kei, I heard that you handed over the bento!! “</p>
<p>“…Who did you hear that from?”</p>

<p>　My classmates must be the only ones who know about it.</p>

<p>“It’s a secret. But my collaborator is also in Kei’s class. That’s all. “</p>

<p>　Ai answers with a proud expression, puffing out her unnecessarily large chest. I’ve known for a while that Ai has a wide circle of friends, but I didn’t know she also knew someone in my class.</p>

<p>“Well, that doesn’t matter now. All I care about is that Kei has found someone she’s interested in! “</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb. The story’s already exposed, you know. “</p>

<p>　Ai is grinning at me with her arms folded. If I didn’t have the restraint of reason, I would have given her a good chop.</p>

<p>“What’s the big deal? Handing over the bento was just a gesture of gratitude.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I didn’t know you were going to say it like that.”</p>

<p>　Ai kept her arms folded and swayed her upper body from side to side.</p>

<p>“Are you saying I’m lying?”</p>
<p>“No, I wouldn’t go that far. I’m just wondering, what kind of gratitude was it?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, it was for the cooking class…”</p>
<p>“Right! That’s it! “</p>

<p>　Ai unfolded her arms and pointed straight at me.</p>

<p>“Kei Shimizu-san, I heard about you. I heard that you attended the last cooking class without skipping it.”</p>
<p>“S-so what? It’s not like attending classes is not allowed.”</p>

<p>　It’s allowed, or rather, it is natural to attend the class.</p>

<p>“Of course. But why did you suddenly attend the cooking class? I was very curious. So I asked for more details about it and found something surprising.”</p>
<p>“W-what did you find out? “</p>

<p>　I was so upset that it was reflected in my voice.</p>

<p>“Kei-san, I heard you were cooking with a certain boy!”</p>
<p>“That’s because we were assigned together…”</p>
<p>“That’s not all. An eyewitness testimony tells that the boy took your hand and guided you when you used a knife! “</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>( TN: ‘-san’ suffix is not a mistake, she used it sometimes.)</p>

<p>　Was someone watching us at that time? To be honest, I was so absorbed in the task that I didn’t have time to care about what other people were looking at.</p>

<p>“You, who usually don’t easily let others into your heart, to allow him to do that… He must be a special person to you, isn’t he? Am I wrong?”</p>
<p>” That’s… “</p>

<p>　It’s easy to say no, but my sister (Ane) will unlikely be satisfied with that answer.</p>

<p>“Furthermore, the person you handed the homemade bentō to seems to be him as well, and perhaps he is also the reason why you suddenly dyed your hair black? “</p>
<p>“Muu…”</p>

<p>　Why is it that my sister, who usually whines about how difficult it is to study, is so sharp at times like this?</p>

<p>“I take it that not denying is an affirmation? “</p>
<p>” …right. “</p>
<p>“Huh? Can you say that again? “</p>
<p>“That’s right! You got a problem with that?! “</p>

<p>　Realizing there was no way out, I gave up making excuses and decided to admit it.</p>

<p>“You finally admitted it. I’m so touched that Kei has found someone she likes. I’m about to cry.”</p>
<p>“You’re lying.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe”</p>
<p>“Don’t cover it up with laughing.”</p>

<p>　My sister has a bad habit of laughing while trying to find a way to fix the situation when she’s in trouble.</p>

<p>“Sorry, sorry. So what he’s like? “</p>
<p>“You should know a little bit about him too, don’t you? “</p>

<p>　If there’s her collaborator in our class, Ai must know a little about Hondō.</p>

<p>“The information from others and the person themselves can be quite different. I want to hear directly from you.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to answer that question.”</p>
<p>“Eh~ why not? Even though I’m your older sister? I also have a lot of life experience, you know? I can help you with your love life, okay?”</p>
<p>“You’re only one year older than me when it comes to life experience. And as far as romantic experience goes, you don’t have any either.”</p>

<p>　Ai is popular with both men and women because of her cheerful personality and, though I am reluctant to admit it, her good looks. However, Ai has rejected every confession she’s received so far and has never been in a relationship with anyone.</p>

<p>“It’s because… How can I say it…I didn’t feel any sense of destiny. “</p>

<p>　Suddenly, Ai’s tone becomes weak. The reason for this is obvious.</p>

<p>“It’s because you love Yosuke, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“W-what are you talking about, Kei?! Talking nonsense all of a sudden, you’re really a troublesome little sister! “</p>

<p>　Ai’s voice is clearly unsettled.</p>
<p>　Yosuke is Ai’s childhood friend and the person she has feelings for.</p>
<p>　From childhood to now, I have seen the gradual change in Ai’s expression when she was with Yosuke, and I wondered if that’s how people fall in love.</p>

<p>“It’s not about Yosuke and me now! Tell me more about Kei’s darling (ダーリン)! “</p>
<p>“Don’t call him my darling, and I’m not going to say anything more.”</p>
<p>“Fufufu, is it okay for you to say something like that?”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>　This is the face she makes when she’s holding my weakness. However, I have no idea what that weakness is.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten that I’ve spent the whole week helping you make bentō early in the morning and eating your failed attempts with you, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>　That’s right. For the past week until today, Ai has been helping me make bentō every morning with devotion. Even after the cooking was over, she supported me by eating my failed attempts at making bentō for breakfast. As a result, Ai’s eyes have been losing vitality day by day.</p>

<p>“That face, you completely forgot about it, didn’t you? But even if Kei forgets it, I’ll never forget it forever, okay? “</p>
<p>“What do you want me to say then?”</p>
<p>Think about it. For a week-long period, I was helping Kei to consume some questionable dark matter that could barely be called dishes. Am I not being incredibly virtuous? Don’t you think I’m allowed to get something good with this? “</p>

<p>　It’s a terrible thing to say for my sister, but there’s some room to consider whether the side dishes I’ve been making for bento are not worthy of being eaten.</p>

<p>“But he was happy to eat them… “</p>
<p>“What did you say…?”</p>

<p>　 Ai made an expression as if she can’t believe it.</p>

<p>“He’s willing to eat it? Isn’t this some kind of hallucination that Kei had because she couldn’t accept reality? Or is it possible that the boy is not human? “</p>
<p>“I might get angry for real.”</p>

<p>　What kind of sister is she to treat him as if he’s some non-human creature just because he was happy to eat the bento I made?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>　What kind of sister is she to treat him as if he’s some non-human creature just because he was happy to eat the bento I made?</p>

<p>“Kei-san, aren’t you underestimating the destructive power of that? It’s the thing that eradicated smiles from me, a girl who is known for her smiles, you know? “</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>　Though she may be exaggerating a little, what Ai said is true. In this case, Hondō, who effortlessly finished eating my Bentō without difficulty, might be someone extraordinary.</p>

<p>“Anyway, since I ate those failed dishes with great effort, I demanded the disclosure of information about Kei’s first love as a reward! “</p>

<p>　Certainly, until today, Ai helped me every morning in making Bentō and in dealing with the failed dishes. I knew I should thank her for that at some point. The question is whether or not I should give her information about Hondō as a thank you…</p>

<p>“…Okay. But don’t tell anyone else.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Leave it to me. You see, I’ve been called a woman with a tougher mouth than a diamond!”</p>
<p>“Who said that?”</p>

<p>　I can’t trust her, but now that Ai knows I’ve become interested in someone, she’ll probably come to my room every day until I tell her. That’s very bothersome.</p>
<p>　If it’s going to be like that, it seems like it would lead to a peaceful life in the future to settle the debt right now and talk about it.</p>

<p>“Now, I would like to ask Kei Shimizu-san a few questions. First and foremost, can you tell me the name of the person you gave your bento to?”</p>
<p>” …Hondō “</p>
<p>“Kei’s embarrassed face is here! Huh, isn’t my little sister too cute? What’s his first name? “</p>

<p>　She was sixty percent more boisterous than usual. I didn’t want to tell her because I knew it would turn out like this.</p>

<p>” …Daiki.”</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0014_s12.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/s12.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>“I see, Daiki Hondō. The name matches the one I heard beforehand. Now, onto the next question. Please tell me your first encounter with Daiki Hondō.”</p>
<p>“In the third grade of junior high school.”</p>
<p>“Eh, you went to the same junior high school! And how did you two meet? Tell me in detail.”</p>

<p>　I was going to answer the questions briefly, but it seems Ai won’t be satisfied unless I provide detailed explanations. I felt a little uneasy even before starting the explanation.</p>

<p>“As I said before, I first met Hondō in the third year of junior high school, and it was behind the school building.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me the back of a school building that is a famous place for confessions?! “</p>
<p>“Yeah, I met him after school when I was being confessed to.”</p>
<p>“I see! Did it start with a confession from the beginning? But wasn’t Kei disliked being suddenly confessed by a stranger…? “</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>

<p>　That’s a good point. Having watched Ai and Yosuke fall in love little by little over time, I couldn’t understand the thoughts of those who confessed their feelings without even trying to know what was inside the other person.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t Hondō who confessed to me.”</p>
<p>“Uh, what do you mean? “</p>
<p>“I was being confessed by someone else, and then he showed up.”</p>
<p>“Yes?! What’s going on? Why did Daiki-kun show up like that?”</p>

<p>　It’s natural for Ai to be confused. It’s troublesome, but I have to explain it carefully.</p>

<p>“First of all, I was invited to the back of the school building after school by a stranger, and he confessed to me. Do you understand the story so far? “</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know Kei was pretty popular in junior school too.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“I don’t want to hear that from someone who was more popular than me, but yeah. That day, he told me it was love at first sight or something like that, and I turned him down like I always do.”</p>
<p>“Well, that sounds like Kei.”</p>
<p>“So far so good, but here’s the problem. He didn’t like the fact that I refused his confession, and he started to lose his temper, saying he didn’t like the way I refused him.”</p>
<p>“Was it okay?”</p>

<p>　 Ai’s expression suddenly changes to a serious one. Even though it’s a story from junior high, she seems to be nervous, as if it happened just now. Ai tends to be a bit worrier when it comes to me.</p>

<p>“If I wasn’t okay, I would have told you right away.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you’re right. I’m glad everything turned out fine.”</p>

<p>　 Ai’s expression visibly softens.</p>

<p>“But still, how did you get out of that pinch? “</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you now. When the guy who confessed to me lost his temper and approached me, Hondō was the one who called out [Wait!] and stopped him.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>“Oh! So this is where the story connects to what you just said before.”</p>

<p>　It seems like an exciting development with foreshadowing, but it’s just a simple back-and-forth chronological explanation.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Hondō intervened between me and the guy who had lost his temper and casually started to introduce himself.”</p>
<p>“Wait, at that moment? Daiki-kun, is he a bit airheaded? “</p>
<p>“He’s quite laid-back, I guess. Then, after he finished introducing himself, the guy who confessed his feelings for me made a puzzled expression and asked me what kind of relationship I had with him.”</p>
<p>“Not even acquaintances, but it was your first meeting.”</p>

<p>　I’ve never seen Hondō look so troubled before or since.</p>

<p>“When I told him that I met Hondō for the first time today, he got angry again, asking why he had interfered with his confession.”</p>
<p>“The guy might have had a point if he hadn’t lost his temper with Kei.”</p>
<p>“Hondō then apologized with a wry smile. But then he suddenly turned serious and said to the guy that he would have left if the confession had gone smoothly without any issues, but he saw that he was about to touch me, that’s why he intervened and confronted him.”</p>
<p>“I guess Daiki-kun is a guy who can firmly say what’s on his mind.”</p>

<p>　I was also surprised at that time. I had thought that he was the type of person who couldn’t express his opinions to others because he always had a carefree expression on his face.</p>

<p>“Hondō is surprisingly that kind of person. Anyway, the guy told Hondo that the way I refused him was bad, but then he was at a loss for words when Hondō admonished him that it was wrong to lay a hand on me.”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm. Okay then? “</p>
<p>“In the end, the guy seemed to calm down a bit after talking with Hondō, and he came to apologize to me.”</p>
<p>“So the boy was able to reflect on the situation. What did Kei do about it? “</p>
<p>“I apologized, thinking I also might have been a little out of line.”</p>
<p>“From what you said, I think the boy was at fault. But it’s great that you can still say you’re sorry. I’ll give you a pat! “</p>
<p>“Stop it! Don’t even think about patting me!”</p>

<p>　 I dodge Ai’s hand. Ai still treats me like a child even though I am in high school…</p>
<p>　When will I be treated as an adult by Ai?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Oh, I haven’t even stroked you yet! Well, forget it for now. Is that the end of the story? “</p>
<p>“Almost. Then he watched us go back to the school building and then he left.”</p>
<p>“I see. Did you meet Daiki-kun after that in junior high school? “</p>
<p>“I saw him occasionally in the hallway, but we only spoke once.”</p>
<p>“I see. What did you talk about? “</p>
<p>“That it wasn’t a coincidence that he was there that day.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>　It seems that what Hondō and I had talked about was not what Ai had expected because Ai has a surprised expression.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Please explain.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that confession was planned or anything. Also, if we went to the back of the school building together, knowing that we both attended the same school, it’s not a place to be for no reason.”</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, it does make sense. It would be a good place to confess because not many people go there.”</p>

<p>　I also didn’t notice that sense of incongruity when I first met Hondō. It was only after recalling that incident a few times that I finally wondered about it.</p>

<p>“So I asked Hondō about it afterward. And he had a troubled face, like a child who got caught playing a prank.”</p>
<p>“And then?”</p>
<p>“Hondō said that at first, he was inside the school building and saw me and that guy walking to the back of the building through the window. He said that guy is known for being a bit snappy (short-tempered), so he was worried about me being with him and followed us to the back of the school building.”</p>
<p>“Daiki-kun is such a worrier.”</p>

<p>　 I think Ai’s attitude toward me was just as overprotective as Hondō’s at that time.</p>

<p>“I thought the same thing. So, I told Hondō, [ Even though we’re not friends or even acquaintances, why did you go to such lengths for me?].”</p>
<p>“What did Daiki-kun say?”</p>
<p>“He said he didn’t want to regret it. And he said he only acted like that because he would hate himself if he ignored it and I got hurt or something happened to me.”</p>

<p>　Hondō seemed a little lonely at that time.</p>

<p>“I see, it was all for his own sake. And how did Kei respond? “</p>
<p>“I said…you do this all the time? If you’re not careful, you’ll be in danger too…. “</p>
<p>“Kei? Isn’t that the part where you say [T-thank you for saving me.] and blush? “</p>
<p>“Who’s going to blush?! I did think I should properly thank him, but the words just wouldn’t come out…”</p>

<p>　I hate myself. Why couldn’t I say a single word of thanks to him back then?</p>

<p>“Kei is a bit clumsy. But that’s also what makes you so charming. So, I guess that’s the end of the junior high school story, right? “</p>
<p>“Yeah, I didn’t talk to him for the rest of junior high.”</p>
<p>“I see. Well, I get the gist of it. A boy shows up at a critical moment, then Kei falls in love after being saved. How nice, I think you have a good love life!”</p>
<p>“Noisy. And I’m not in love with him at that moment.”</p>
<p>“Ah, really? “</p>
<p>“Yeah, I just thought he was a strange kind-hearted person.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then when did Kei have a crush on Daiki? “</p>

<p>　 Ai’s eyes are sparkling, a complete change from this morning. I guess she is very curious about her sister’s love life.</p>

<p>“We’ve already talked enough, so let’s call it a day.”</p>
<p>“That’s not fair! We were just getting into the good part, you can’t do that!”</p>

<p>　 Ai grabs me by both shoulders and shakes me back and forth. A little annoyed, I brushed her hands away.</p>

<p>“It’s annoying. I’ve already paid the Bentō back with what we talked about earlier.”</p>
<p>“Well, that may be true, but… right! If you tell me why you fell in love, I’ll support Kei’s love life behind your back!”</p>
<p>“I don’t want it.”</p>
<p>“It’s an immediate answer!? “</p>
<p>“I can’t trust someone who can’t even handle her own love life.”</p>
<p>“Gah!”</p>

<p>　 Ai and her crush, Yosuke, like each other, but they’re not officially a couple. It’s simply because neither of them has confessed their feelings. Yosuke shies away from confessing to Ai because Ai has turned down all the other guys’ confessions, and Ai wants Yosuke to confess his feelings to her. As a result, Ai and Yosuke continue their relationship as more than childhood friends but less than lovers.</p>

<p>“Haa, haaah, Kei, you’re actually pretty good at this.”</p>

<p>　 Ai seems to have recovered from the psychological damage.</p>

<p>“I’m just stating the facts.”</p>
<p>“That’s a nice jab, my imōto. Well, hold on. Giving advice about love might be a bit difficult, but there are still things I can do.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>　 I reluctantly listen, knowing it probably won’t be a sensible suggestion.</p>

<p>“I’ll use my position as the vice president of the student council to call Daiki-kun and ask him what he thinks about Kei!”</p>
<p>“I’ll knock you out.”</p>

<p>　 Now is definitely not the right time to take advantage of her position as the vice president of the student council.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on. I thought it was a perfect answer.”</p>
<p>“What part of it was perfect? It’s an abuse of power, plain and simple. And what if he doesn’t think well of me for doing that?”</p>
<p>“I think you’re worrying a little too much. Kei is a super-pretty girl. I’m sure Daiki-kun will say something nice about you.”</p>
<p>“Who’s Super Pretty Girl?! Anyway, I reject that idea. Rejected!”</p>
<p>“You’re harsh~. Well, even if half of what I said before was only a joke, I think having someone in the same school who supports Kei’s love is pretty encouraging.”</p>

<p>　It is true that so far, the only person who knows about my feelings for Hondō is Ai. I feel there is a big difference between having someone to rely on or not. Ai’s suggestion might not be a bad idea for me.</p>

<p>“…fine. But please don’t get in my way.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Now that I’m on board, you’re going to tell me about the times your heart flutter for Daiki-kun, right?”</p>
<p>“I never feel my heart flutter…”</p>
<p>“Imōto, you’re not very honest. Well, then, how about telling me what made you interested in Daiki-kun?”</p>
<p>“Well, if it’s only that, I can tell you. It was during our first year of high school…”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>　One day after school, during my first year of high school, I went back to the classroom to retrieve something I had forgotten.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span>
<p>　I thought there would be hardly anyone left in the classroom by the time I arrived, considering some time had passed since I left the school.</p>

<p>“By the way, Toshiya, are you free today? “</p>

<p>　I stopped opening the door and instinctively bent down as I heard a familiar voice.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’m off from club activities today, so it’s no problem.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to hear that.”</p>

<p>（Why are those two left of all people? Now, it’s hard for me to enter the classroom.)</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>　From the voices coming from inside, it seems that Hondō and Matsuoka are the only two who are still in the classroom. They did not seem to notice me outside the classroom.</p>
<p>　When I entered high school, I was placed in the same class as Hondō, and since I had not had a chance to talk with Hondō since junior high school, I only found out for the first time during the entrance ceremony that we had entered the same high school.</p>

<p>　At first, we were seated far apart and did not interact with each other, but after a few seat changes, I coincidentally ended up sitting next to Hondo. What I realized through our conversations was that Hondo thought he was meeting me for the first time in high school.</p>
<p>　It’s either he had forgotten the incident in junior high school, or he thought I was a different person now that I had dyed my hair. Somewhat frustrated, I did not tell him that we had met in junior high school.</p>
<p>　But Hondō talked to me every day, even though my classmates were afraid of me and kept their distance. I always wondered what Hondō thought of me.</p>

<p>“I’ve been wondering, Daiki, aren’t you afraid of Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“Afraid of Shimizu-san? Why is that?”</p>
<p>“Because she dyed her hair gold even though school rules forbid it, and she stares at me when we make eye contact, it’s scary. Besides, I’ve heard many rumors that she’s doing something bad.”</p>

<p>(Matsuoka, you have the audacity to say whatever you want to Hondō just because I’m not around…)</p>

<p>　Though the first two statements are true, so I can’t argue with that.</p>
<p>　I was fine with Matsuoka saying whatever he wanted, but I didn’t want to hear the same kind of comments from Hondō, so I turned my back to the classroom door to leave.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>

<p>“I don’t think Shimizu-san is scary.”</p>

<p>　 Hondō’s words stopped me in my tracks.</p>

<p>“Why do you think so? “</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san is a bit difficult to understand, but I think she’s a kind person.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? “</p>

<p>　 Matsuoka seems to be genuinely doubtful from the bottom of his heart.</p>

<p>“Yeah. Whenever I talk to Shimizu-san, she always responds properly to me. Despite her appearance being a bit flashy, she’s a good person once you get to know her.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s just because Daiki thinks everyone is a good person?”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>　 Hondō’s comment didn’t seem to alleviate Matsuoka’s wariness toward me.</p>

<p>“It’s not like that. Toshiya doesn’t know this, but Shimizu-san always helps me when I’m cleaning in class. I think Shimizu-san cares about others.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I see.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a bad rumor that’s spreading on its own, but if you talk to Shimizu-san, she’s much kinder and funnier than people think.”:</p>

<p>　 I had no idea that Hondō felt that way about me. I had thought that he would smile and talk to me on the outside, but behind my back, he would be afraid of me like the rest of our classmates.</p>
<p>　But I was wrong. Hondō did not judge me only by my appearance or my atmosphere, but he tried to look at me from the inside.</p>

<p>“If Daiki says so, it might be true. Still, I don’t agree with you she’s that interesting.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“Toshiya should talk to Shimizu-san and you will understand. Besides, Shimizu-san is―”</p>

<p>　――My face suddenly grew warm.</p>
<p>　――I could feel my heartbeat quickening.</p>

<p>　I felt like I shouldn’t stay here any longer… Forgetting why I came back here, I dashed into the hallway.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>






<p>* * * *</p>

<p>“…And that is why I became interested in Hondō.”</p>

<p>　Ai, who had been listening silently, suddenly started clapping her hands. It’s eerie, like a doll had suddenly come to life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>

<p>“Bravo! I’m glad, it was really wonderful! He doesn’t judge you only by your looks but by what’s inside of you. True Love! This made all of America shed tears.”</p>
<p>(TN: The phrase “これは全米が涙しましたわ” is a Japanese expression often used humorously to exaggerate the emotional impact of a situation. It translates to “This made all of America shed tears.” It’s not meant to be taken literally but rather as a playful and exaggerated statement.)</p>
<p>“Don’t talk nonsense.”</p>
<p>“Sorry-sorry. But I really thought Daiki-kun was a good boy. To be honest, the blonde Kei-chan before was indeed a bit hard for other people to approach. As a big sister, I’m quite happy to know that there was someone who looked at Kei seriously.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be so serious all of a sudden.”</p>
<p>“You’re being unreasonable! “</p>

<p>　I thought the same, but whenever my usually carefree sister said something sensible, it threw me off.</p>

<p>“Anyway, we talked a lot about Hondō, so you must be satisfied.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>“Yes. Kei’s youthful, naked love talk rejuvenated my heart.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear. Now go back.”</p>
<p>“What?! Why are you suddenly being cold? It’s so cold I think I’m going to catch a cold. Achoo――”</p>
<p>“Shut up. You’ve already accomplished your purpose.”</p>

<p>　In the first place, Ai came to my room to ask about Hondō. Now that she has achieved her goal, she no longer needs to be here. The clock had already struck eleven, and it was about time to sleep.</p>

<p>“I want to hear more sweet stories, like if Daiki-kun surprised you recently or if you felt uneasy when you saw Daiki-kun talking to another girl. I want to talk more about love with Kei.”</p>
<p>“Don’t arbitrarily assume I’ll be easily surprised or feel uneasy. Leave.”</p>
<p>“No-no. I don’t want to go back to my room. I want to hear more about Kei. Maybe something like the memories you have with Daiki-kun. I still want to talk about love with Kei!”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>　At the age of seventeen, Ai still seems to be going through her rebellious phase. I can’t help it. It seems like the time to unleash the secret weapon has come .</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>“Love talk isn’t something that only one person does, right? I want to hear how far you and Yosuke have progressed, what you like about him, when you became aware of him as a member of the opposite sex, and so on. You’ll tell me, too, right? “</p>

<p>　 Ai’s gaze wanders around.</p>

<p>“Oops, I forgot that I have an assignment to finish by tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow is Saturday.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>
<p>” …Oops, this is no good. I’m getting sleepy all of a sudden. It’s a real shame, but let’s save the love talk for another time.”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to escape?”</p>
<p>“Escape sounds bad; let’s call this a strategic retreat. I’ve done what I set out to do. Well then, Adieu.”</p>
<p>　With that, Ai returned to her own room.</p>

<p>“You always come and go like a storm.”</p>

<p>　In the quiet room, I muttered to myself.</p>
