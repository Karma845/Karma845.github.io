<h2>Chapter 6: Shopping with the Shimizu Sisters</h2>


<p>“Well then, now that we’re full, shall we head to our destination?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span>
<p>“By the way, I didn’t ask before, but what is the purpose of Ai-san and Shimizu-san today?”</p>

<p>Although I agreed to go along, I hadn’t confirmed where we were going yet.</p>

<p>“Oh, did I not mention it? We came to buy clothes for Kei and me.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>I wonder if it’s okay for me to accompany them…</p>

<p>“If we’re buying clothes, it’s better to have the opinion of the opposite sex, right? Normally, I bring my childhood friend with me, but he couldn’t come this time because he had something else to do. I was wondering what to do, and fortunately, Daiki-kun happened to be here.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. But honestly, I don’t really know much about good or bad clothes, so I don’t know if I can help you. “</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>That’s my honest opinion. Honestly, on my days off, I usually just wear hoodies like I am now, so I have no idea what kind of clothes would be good.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about it. My childhood friend always says something like whatever I wear is just fine… “</p>
<p>“Haha… “</p>

<p>I can’t help but let out a dry laugh. I wonder why Ai-san’s smile feels a bit dark. For a moment, it felt like the light had vanished from Ai-san’s eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s why you don’t have to worry about your fashion sense or anything like that. Besides, Kei also wants Daiki-kun to look at her clothes, right? “</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>Ai-san looks towards Shimizu-san, seeking her agreement.</p>

<p>“…I’m fine with either option.”</p>
<p>“――But I’d be happier if Daiki-kun took a look at my clothes.”</p>
<p>“Don’t add lines on your own.”</p>
<p>“I thought I perfectly understood Kei’s feelings.”</p>
<p>“Not even close.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san glares at Ai-san with cold eyes, but Ai-san doesn’t seem to mind.</p>

<p>“I thought I read it well enough to get a passing grade, but whatever. If Kei is okay with either way, then it means it’s okay to have Daiki-kun accompanying us, right? Well, now that we all agreed, let’s go right away.”</p>
<p>“By [let’s go.] didn’t you mean we would go to each person’s regular place?”</p>
<p>“Is that so? “</p>

<p>That’s news to me. I thought from the beginning that the two of them were planning to shop together at the same store.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>

<p>“That was my original plan, but after hearing Daiki-kun’s story, I changed my mind. Let’s all go to the store I often go to.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because the clothes at Kei’s favorite stores are mainly boyish and cool rather than neat and clean. The store we’re going to now has a variety of cute to neat clothes, so it’s better for Kei, right? “</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>

<p>For some reason, Ai-san took a glance at me. Shimizu-san also gave me a quick glance, just kidding, she glares at me.</p>

<p>“Alright! Since you two don’t seem to have any objection, let’s go right away!”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>

<p>With Ai-san’s words as a trigger, we started to move.</p>
<p>The Shimizu sisters and I moved to an area of the shopping mall that mainly dealt with clothing. There are a fair number of couples of one man and one woman here, but it is rare to see a trio of two women with one man.</p>
<p>It’s not that I’m overly concerned about the gazes from the surroundings.</p>
<p>Ai-san seemed to have said it half-jokingly earlier, but objectively speaking, both Shimizu sisters are beautiful. It’s natural for people to be curious when a man is walking with these two attractive women.</p>

<p>“Err, Ai-san, it’s a little difficult for me to stay like this… “</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>I whisper a small protest to Ai-san, who is walking next to Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Difficult to stay? “</p>

<p>Ai-san looked around.</p>

<p>“I see. Don’t worry about it. Other people are just a little distracted seeing a lucky boy walking around with two cute girls.”</p>
<p>“Don’t call yourself cute.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san, standing right next to me, immediately interjected.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>“Just saying it doesn’t cost anything, so it’s fine. Anyway, let’s go inside quickly since we’ve arrived at the store.”</p>

<p>With that, before Shimizu-san and I could say anything, Ai-san entered the store alone. Left behind, I turned my gaze toward Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Give up. There will be fewer gazes inside the store. Let’s quickly go inside too.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san said and started to walk to the store.</p>

<p>“Wait, Shimizu-san!”</p>

<p>I hurriedly followed Shimizu-san.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>“Hey, Kei and Daiki-kun! Come to the fitting room. The first round of trying on clothes has been decided.”</p>

<p>As I entered the store, I could clearly hear Ai-san’s voice from the back of the store. It seemed that she had already decided which clothes to try on first.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, do you know where the fitting room is? “</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve been here a few times with Ai, so follow me.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san led me to the fitting room.</p>

<p>“Hey, Ai, we’re here.”</p>

<p>We walked up to the fitting room and Shimizu-san and I found a fitting room with the curtains closed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>“How did you find this place easily? I’m glad you found it.”</p>
<p>“Now that I found it, can I leave now?”</p>
<p>“Can you wait a bit? The ultra-beautiful Onē-chan changed her clothes and is now I am an Ultimate Beauty. Wanna take a look? Huh?” (Urutora byūtī, arutimetto byūtī)</p>
<p>“Stop saying Beauty-Beauty. Just open the curtains if you want me to see.”</p>
<p>“Geez, my troublesome little sister is always being cold. All right, Curtain, open! “</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Geez, my troublesome little sister is always being cold. All right, Curtain, open! “</p>

<p>As that voice rang out, the curtain of the fitting room opened vigorously.</p>

<p>“What do you think? “</p>

<p>There, Ai-san stood, wearing a slightly oversized yellow cardigan over a shirt. She was wearing a white mini-skirt underneath, which seemed to show off her beautiful legs.</p>

<p>“I tried combining a yellow cardigan with a white mini-skirt!”</p>
<p>“That’s kind of deliberate. Minus 500 million points. “</p>
<p>“That judgment is too sloppy and unreasonable! Kei, you’re so harsh, I want to cry.”</p>
<p>“You never cry if you can say something like that.”</p>
<p>“My heart is crying… What do you think, Daiki-kun?”</p>

<p>That’s right, I need to offer an opinion that can be helpful.</p>
<p>What should I say? If I straightforwardly compliment her legs, saying they look beautiful, she might be put off.</p>
<p>But since I’ve never given my opinion on a woman’s attire other than my sister, I don’t know what aspects to focus on and how to praise her.</p>
<p>I wonder how men in the world give their opinions on women’s clothes.</p>

<p>” Hey, Daiki-kun, are you listening? “</p>
<p>“Yes. Please wait a moment.”</p>

<p>There’s no time left. I decided to convey my impressions as best I could from my meager vocabulary.</p>

<p>“I think the light-colored cardigan suits you well, Ai-san. It gives off a cute vibe this time, whereas I usually have the impression of elegance when I see you.”</p>

<p>The atmosphere in the store becomes silent. I wonder what Ai-san thinks of my opinion.</p>

<p>“Hey Kei, did you hear? He said the cardigan suits me and this time I look cute! I got a very nice compliment! “</p>

<p>That’s good. Ai-san seems excited. Unless she’s good at acting, she’s probably satisfied with my opinion. I’m relieved for now.</p>

<p>“Hondō, didn’t you stare at Ai’s legs? “</p>

<p>Just when I thought I was safe, I received an accusation from an unexpected source. I intentionally didn’t mention the mini-skirt to avoid being perceived as staring at her legs, but it seems Shimizu-san caught me.</p>

<p>“Daiki-kun, is it true? “</p>

<p>Ai-san looked straight at me.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>There’s no way to escape from this. And I don’t really have any intention to deny it.</p>

<p>“Yes, Shimizu-san’s is correct.”</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0020_s18.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/s18.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>It was unintentional for me to glance at her legs, but I feel there’s no room for defense now. Ai-san momentarily had a serious expression, but she quickly returned to her usual smile.</p>

<p>“Well, okay. Of course you couldn’t resist my cute and mature charm.”</p>

<p>I feel relieved. I guess I managed to get away with it.</p>

<p>“…This guy also stared at my legs while I was talking to him before.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san…”</p>

<p>Indeed, there was a moment during the previous art class when I looked at Shimizu-san’s legs. But I thought she had already forgotten about it.</p>

<p>“Daiki-kun, is what Kei just said true? “</p>
<p>” …it’s not wrong.”</p>

<p>Ai-san seems to be looking at me with colder eyes than before. After a brief moment of gazing at me with those eyes, she smiles again.</p>

<p>“I’ll forgive you. Kei’s legs are firm and have a different beauty from mine. It’s understandable that even Daiki-kun would be captivated.”</p>

<p>It seems I’ve been completely remembered by the Shimizu sisters as a leg fetishist.</p>

<p>“Is that really okay?”</p>
<p>“My heart is as vast as the ocean. I don’t care if it’s only Daiki-kun or Kei, okay? Besides, the important thing is I’ve already won.”</p>
<p>“What kind of competition did you win?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san questioned her. I honestly don’t know either.</p>

<p>“It was a competition to see who could choose Daiki-kun’s preferred outfit.”</p>
<p>“Just do it by yourself.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san dismissively pushes Ai-san away with her words.</p>

<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>“W-what now?”</p>

<p>Ai-san is suddenly wearing an unexpectedly wicked smile.</p>

<p>“You lack confidence, Kei? Even if we’re called the Ultra Beauty Sisters, there’s a world of difference between me and the imōto. It’s only natural for Kei to feel like running away before the competition even starts.”</p>

<p>She’s trying to stir things up. It is an obvious provocation. Well, there is no way Shimizu-san would fall for such a cheap provocation…..</p>

<p>“…Fine.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Fine! I’ll accept that challenge!”</p>

<p>(Shimizu-san fell for the provocation!)</p>

<p>Shimizu-san had a much lower tolerance for provocations than I had imagined. I didn’t know because there was no one in my class who provoked Shimizu-san. It’s a new discovery.</p>

<p>“Hmmm, I knew Kei would get on board. The rules for the showdown are simple: we’ll see who can choose Daiki’s preferred clothes. We’ll try them on, and the winner will be the one Daiki-kun says looks better. You can only try on the clothes twice. So I have one more time to try again. Now, let’s take our positions and get started!”</p>

<p>With that, Shimizu-san disappeared from my sight.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Ai-san, why did you say such provoking things to Shimizu-san?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span>

<p>I questioned Ai-san, who was still in the fitting room with a comfortable look on his face. Ai-san must have known that Shimizu-san would take the challenge if she said something like that.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I want Kei to buy clothes with a different atmosphere than usual.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Kei usually only wears boyish clothes. It’s true that they look good in cool-looking clothes, but Kei is also beautiful and cute, so I wanted her to wear something that would highlight that side of her, you know? That’s why I challenged her to this competition. I invited Kei to this store because this store has a lot of cute and beautiful clothes, so I thought it would be perfect for her.”</p>
<p>“I see. So that was your intention.”</p>

<p>It seems that Ai-san had her own thoughts.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>“Well, there is also the fact that I simply want to see Kei in different clothes. Anyway, I’m going to change my clothes and look for a second one now.”</p>

<p>After saying just that, Ai-san closed the fitting room curtain. That’s when a question arose inside of me.</p>

<p>(Hey, what am I supposed to do while they are picking out their clothes?)</p>

<p>The question remained unresolved, and I ended up spending a lot of empty time in the store until they decided which clothes to try on.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>“Okay, I see that Kei has picked out some clothes as well.”</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s too late to quit now.”</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>A little while later, the three of us had changed place to a place in the store where two fitting rooms were adjacent to each other. Fortunately, there were few other customers, so it seemed like there won’t be a problem even if they took some time to try on clothes.</p>

<p>“I’ve already shown my first outfit, so it’s Kei’s turn now.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll change, so I’ll close the curtain for a moment.”</p>

<p>The curtain in the dressing room with Shimizu-san is closed.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it make you excited to think that Kei is changing clothes in there?”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>Ai-san, who seemed bored, spoke to me from the fitting room.</p>

<p>“I can hear you. And Hondō, I won’t forgive you if you imagine anything strange. “</p>

<p>Before I could even think about anything, she nailed me. It is true that it wouldn’t be pleasant to have someone of the opposite sex imagining what you look like without clothes.</p>

<p>“Don’t take away our freedom to imagine!”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>I don’t know whose opinion she is speaking for, but Ai-san started to protest.</p>

<p>“That’s more like a delusion than imagination. Anyway, I’m already dressed. “</p>
<p>“Aren’t you too quick? Are you a master of quick change?”</p>
<p>“Why do you sound a little disappointed? Okay, I’m going to open the curtains.”</p>

<p>As the curtains opened, there stood Shimizu-san wearing a green blouse. She was wearing a beige flared skirt underneath, so her legs were not as emphasized as those of Ai-san. The gap between the stylish outfit she wore right now and the casual clothes I usually see her made me a little surprised.</p>

<p>“…Hey, say something.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>“Kei, did you succumb to embarrassment?”</p>

<p>While I was thinking of a comment, Ai-san casually spoke like that to Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Huh? What’s with you all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“Well, the combination of the green blouse and beige flare skirt suits you. But you know, Kei-san, I saw it. You put a mini-skirt in the shopping basket. The only reason you wouldn’t wear it is if you were embarrassed to wear a mini-skirt.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s reaction seems to indicate that she hit the mark.</p>

<p>“You’re a really cute imōto-chan. But I win.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>

<p>Ai-san raised her right hand triumphantly, wearing a victorious expression.</p>

<p>“W-well, you still don’t know the result.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s true. Daiki-kun, why don’t you give your opinion?”</p>

<p>For some reason, I ended up becoming something like Ai-san’s subordinate or lackey.</p>

<p>“Yes, well… I thought the combination of the blouse and skirt that Shimizu-san is wearing right now gives off a calm and mature womanly vibe, and I think it looks nice.”</p>
<p>” …O-okay.”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>Shimizu-san responded weakly. Uh, I don’t know how to respond to such a reaction.</p>

<p>“But it can’t compare to my bare legs.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. I mean, if that’s the case, the winner isn’t the clothes you chose but your legs, right?”</p>
<p>“You’re barking like a loser.”</p>

<p>When it comes to provoking Shimizu-san, Ai-san has no rivals on this planet.</p>

<p>“Who’s a loser? I’ll bite you.”</p>
<p>“I’d be happy if Kei bites me. Anyway, Daiki-kun, which outfit do you prefer? “</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>I wonder how I can prevent Ai-san’s killer pass.</p>
<p>(TN: キラーパス (kirāpasu), I think it’s something like casually dismissing Kei and talking to him.)</p>

<p>“I think both have their own charm, so I can’t decide…”</p>
<p>“Daiki-kun, sometimes kindness hurts people more than anything else. Come on, speak your mind!”</p>
<p>“Ignore Ai’s statement, though it’s true that this is a competition, so choose one side.”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><span style="clear:both; display:block" id="ez-clearholder-leader-4"></span>
<p>Although I genuinely think both are good, it seems I have to make a decision here.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Can I see both of your outfits again before deciding?”</p>

<p>I decided to postpone the choice. In the end, I think my choice would be the same, but I wanted to make sure just one more time if possible.</p>

<p>“That’s right. That was the plan from the beginning. Let’s try them on again and then decide.”</p>
<p>“If you say so, I don’t mind.”</p>

<p>And so, the showdown moved on to the next round.</p>

<p>“I went first last time, so Kei will go first this time.”</p>
<p>“Got it. This time, I’ll go first.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san closed the curtains again and started changing.</p>

<p>“Well, my victory is almost certain. What about you, Kei? Are you going to wear a mini-skirt? Even so, I think the impact will be somewhat lacking compared to the first mini-skirt he received from me.”</p>
<p>“Ai-san, when you say it like that, isn’t that a flag? “</p>

<p>If you confidently claim to win against your opponent like that, in the world of manga, it’s a straight path to defeat.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, when it comes to someone like me, I take care of everything from manufacturing to breaking all flags of destruction.”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to break it, don’t create it in the first place.”</p>

<p>“Kei, have you finished getting dressed yet?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing that, Shimizu-san opened the curtains slightly and peeked out with only her head visible.</p>

<p>“Why are you embarrassed? Oh, could it be that you’re wearing an outfit even more revealing than mine?”</p>
<p>“There’s no way that’s true. It’s just that I’m not used to wearing clothes like this.”</p>
<p>“You’re already wearing it. That’s fine. Come on, strike a pose!”</p>
<p>“H-hey!”</p>

<p>Ai-san snatched the curtains from Shimizu-san’s grasp and opened them.</p>
<p>Standing there was Shimizu-san in a pure white one-piece dress.</p>

<p>“What the…?”</p>

<p>Ai-san collapsed to her knees upon seeing Shimizu-san’s appearance.</p>

<p>“It’s a white one-piece dress with a simple design that doesn’t even expose the shoulders. But…That’s why it precisely highlights Kei’s good qualities so well. I must say, even though you’re my imōto, it’s quite commendable.”</p>
<p>“Why are you looking down on me? And… what do you think, Hondō… Hondō?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m sorry.”</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0021_s19.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/s19.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>I was taken aback. I was so captivated by Shimizu-san in her dress that I didn’t think about anything else.</p>

<p>“No need to apologize. So, what do you think?”</p>

<p>I quickly turned my mind into overdrive. However, no matter how much I thought, I couldn’t find the right words for Shimizu-san’s current state.</p>

<p>“I guess it doesn’t suit me… “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s expression carried a hint of sadness that she usually didn’t show.</p>
<p>Unable to bear seeing her like that, I instinctively spoke up.</p>

<p>“It suits you.”</p>
<p>“Hondō?”</p>
<p>“That dress suits you very well. Shimizu-san, you look beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, what are you saying… “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s expression changed. I could understand from that expression that she was no longer sad.</p>

<p>“That’s good, Kei. He says you’re beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Don’t repeat that.”</p>

<p>When I looked at Shimizu-san’s face again, I felt that it was slightly redder than usual.</p>
<p>I wondered if it took a lot of courage for Shimizu-san to show this outfit to others.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, your face is red, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Whose fault do you think it is…”</p>
<p>“Kei is fine. She can’t show it in words, so her skin has become more honest.”</p>

<p>Ai-san answered Shimizu-san’s comment. I didn’t quite understand the latter part, but if Ai-san said she was okay, then it must be fine.</p>

<p>“Why are you talking nonsense? I’m going to change now.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Shimizu-san closed the curtain again.</p>

<p>“Oh, is it over already? I haven’t even taken a picture of Kei in the dress with my smartphone!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san didn’t reply. After a while, the curtains opened again. There was Shimizu-san, who had returned to the boyish clothes she was wearing before she changed.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s really back to normal. Even though it’s a rare opportunity to see Kei in a dress…”</p>

<p>Ai-san said as she wiped away her nonexistent tears.</p>

<p>“It’s your turn, Ai. Get dressed now.”</p>
<p>“I’ve had enough of this.”</p>

<p>Ai-san casually said that.</p>

<p>“Huh? “</p>
<p>“I surrender because I don’t feel like I can win against Kei’s overpowering dress. I give up!”</p>
<p>“Is that really okay with you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I’m completely satisfied just by seeing Kei in that dress, so I have no regrets!”</p>

<p>Indeed, Ai-san’s expression shows not a trace of regret.</p>

<p>“…I don’t feel like I’ve won.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san said that while holding the dress and walked towards the cash register. After quickly finishing the payment, she returned to the fitting room where Ai-san and I were.</p>

<p>“Hey, Kei, did you buy that dress? “</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“What? You should have told me earlier then. I cried for nothing earlier. Now I can see Kei wearing that dress anytime, anywhere!”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. Besides, you weren’t crying in the first place. And I won’t be wearing this dress that frequently.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san seemed genuinely taken aback. As I was thinking about that, our eyes briefly met.</p>

<p>“Do you have something to say to me too?”</p>
<p>“That dress looked very good on you, so I’m glad Shimizu-san liked it too.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, you always say things like that so naturally… Also, I didn’t buy it just because you said it suited me! Well, it doesn’t matter. I’ve already bought mine, so now I just have to wait for Ai to choose her clothes.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already decided too.”</p>
<p>“What? “</p>
<p>“I’m going to buy this! “</p>

<p>When I looked closely at Ai-san, she was hugging the cardigan she tried on earlier.</p>

<p>“Is that mini-skirt okay? “</p>
<p>“I discovered that wearing that would dangerously captivate all the men around, so I decided to pass on it this time.”</p>

<p>Ai-san looked at me and winked. At about the same time, Shimizu-san glared at me.</p>

<p>“Ahaha… “</p>

<p>Caught between the stares of the Shimizu sisters, all I could do was force a laugh.</p>

<p>“…If Ai is fine with it, then I’m fine too. Now that we’re done shopping, let’s leave.”</p>

<p>With these words from Shimizu-san, we left the store.</p>
<p>――Somehow, the image of Shimizu-san in the white dress remained vivid in my mind.</p>
