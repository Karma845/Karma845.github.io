<h2>Chapter 9: Lunch Break without Shimizu-san</h2>


<p>“Oraa, here comes Onē-chan! Everyone, make a way!”</p>

<p>On the night I met Hondō at the shopping mall, I was reading a comic book in my room when Ai, in her pajamas, barged in.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I always tell you to knock and say something before entering someone’s room?”</p>
<p>“Forget about that for now! Tell me about your way back home!”</p>

<p>Ai points her index finger straight at me. When will she ever knock before entering a room?</p>

<p>“Why are you acting so high and mighty?”</p>
<p>“Because I’m actually are. Don’t you dare underestimate the Vice President of the Student Council!”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to assert your authority over your own sister at home.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be careful next time. Anyway, what happened with Daiki-kun after that?”</p>

<p>Ai, whose talent for derailing conversation is second to none, seems to have not forgotten her purpose.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? We just went home normally.”</p>
<p>“Hmm-mmh.”</p>

<p>Ai looks at me suspiciously. </p>

<p>“W-what is it?”</p>
<p>“Kei-san, I know who you are, okay?”</p>
<p>“Know what?”</p>
<p>“It was raining when you both left. And Kei-san, you didn’t have an umbrella, right? How did you manage to come back home without getting wet?”</p>
<p>“Guu…”</p>

<p>Why is it that Ai’s memory is so sharp only at times like this? I wish she could put that memory to good use in her studies.</p>

<p>“I think you came back home before Mom and Dad arrived, so it must have been raining while you were on your way. Your clothes and bags didn’t get wet either. In that case, I have a hypothesis…”</p>

<p>” …stop beating around the bush and just say what you want to say.”</p>

<p>“Fine. I’ll be direct. You’re using Daiki-kun’s umbrella, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Why is it that only at times like this Ai’s reasoning is so brilliant?</p>

<p>“What do you think, Kei? Is there any mistake in my hypothesis?”</p>
<p>“…No “</p>

<p>Even if I were to say that her hypothesis was wrong, the truth would eventually come out after some flaws were exposed. </p>
<p>It would be less tiring to admit it from the beginning. </p>

<p>“Oh, the truth revealed! Kei, you’re doing the “sharing an umbrella” thing, huh?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that big of a deal.”</p>
<p>“It is a big deal! Who initiated it?”</p>
<p>“…I did.”</p>

<p>Although it was Hondō who first proposed lending the umbrella, it was my remark that led to us sharing the umbrella.</p>

<p>“Kei, you… the passive Kei?”</p>
<p>“I can’t help it! I didn’t want to get wet!”</p>

<p>Nothing special, it’s just that. And yet, Ai smiles mischievously.</p>

<p>“I see. Because your precious dress and the stuffed toy you won are both very important, you didn’t want them to get wet, huh?”</p>
<p>“I never said anything like that!”</p>
<p>“But that’s how it is, right?”</p>
<p>“…I didn’t say you’re wrong.”</p>

<p>Ai keeps grinning and looking at me warmly. </p>

<p>” Yay, I received Kei’s rare dere moment!”</p>
<p>“You’re so noisy. Just go back already.”</p>

<p>I point at the door, but Ai looks at me with a somewhat exasperated expression.</p>

<p>“The night has only just begun, you know? Besides, I haven’t heard all the details about sharing the umbrella.”</p>
<p>“There’s not much to say. There are no more details beyond the fact that I walked home with Hondō.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. What did you talk about on the way back? Tell Onē-chan.”</p>

<p>I recall the conversation on the way home today. I don’t want to talk about Hondō’s past, so I’ll tell you what else we talked about…</p>

<p>“He said things like ‘It’s fun being with you,’ ‘I’m happy to see a different side of you,’ and ‘I get nervous when we share an umbrella.'”</p>
<p>“Daiki-kun, he’s more aggressive than I expected! Does that mean there’s something between you two?”</p>

<p>Ai can’t hide her excitement. I don’t know if it’s possible for people to get so excited about other people’s love stories, though I don’t have any examples other than Ai. </p>

<p>“He didn’t mean it that way.”</p>

<p>Although he may not be lying, I have serious doubts about whether Hondō sees me as a love interest.</p>

<p>“I doubt it. I don’t think he would tell a girl he is not interested in that she is beautiful, give her a stuffed animal as a gift, or tell her he is nervous when they share the umbrella together. </p>
<p>“He does! He also called you cute when choosing clothes, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>I can’t help but feel a bit uneasy imagining him saying that to other girls.</p>

<p>“Based on what I saw today, I don’t think Daiki-kun is that kind of person. Hmm, I should have asked if he’s conscious of Kei as a girl.”</p>
<p>“What scary thing are you trying to do?”</p>

<p>It gives me chills just thinking about it.</p>

<p>“I’m just kidding. Anyway, did Daiki-kun take Kei home in the end? ” </p>
<p>“…no.”</p>
<p>“No? But I didn’t see any umbrella that wasn’t yours, so you must have arrived at Daiki-kun’s house first and borrowed an umbrella to come back, right?”</p>

<p>Why is it that her observations are so perceptive only at times like this? </p>

<p>“The rain stopped halfway.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“The rain stopped while we were walking home together, so I ran home alone.”</p>
<p>“Why? Why would you do that, Pretty Girl? “</p>
<p>“I can’t help it. I’ve been through a lot today and I’m at my limits! ” </p>

<p>Today with Hondō that started with an unexpected encounter was too intense for me.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“You pure-pure maiden! What are you doing, missing out on such an opportunity?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span>
<p>“Who’s the ‘pure-pure maiden (pyuapyua otome)’?”</p>

<p>But it’s true that I feel like I couldn’t make the most of the unexpected chance I got.</p>
<p>Feeling a bit down, Ai, perhaps sensing this, put her hand on my shoulder. </p>

<p>“Well, I said some harsh things, but asking for opinions on clothes, getting closer during the photo shoot, suggesting sharing an umbrella. Kei, you did well compared to your usual attitude.”</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly saying that?”</p>
<p>“I’m the type who encourages others with praise, you know.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard that before.”</p>

<p>I haven’t had many opportunities to be taught by Ai, so I didn’t know.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Well, just like before, Kei, do your best at your own pace.”</p>
<p>“Ai…”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>“Now, let’s hear more about sharing the umbrella! “</p>
<p>“What is it? “</p>

<p>Love’s eyes were sparkling with curiosity.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>“Yawn…”</p>

<p>On Monday, I arrived at school at the same time as usual and let out a small yawn. </p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>After that, I explained in detail to Ai the series of events of walking home with Hondō and sharing an umbrella.</p>
<p>By the time the explanation was over, the clock had already struck twelve. That’s why I was slightly sleep-deprived compared to usual.</p>

<p>I fought against drowsiness as I opened my shoe locker.</p>

<p>“Geez…. “</p>

<p>I unintentionally let out a voice. There was something other than my shoes inside.</p>

<p>    * * *</p>

<p>“Hey, Daiki. Are you awake?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Yeah, I’m fine.”</p>

<p>During the lunch break, while I was lost in thought, Toshiya approached me with a Bentō. </p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>

<p>“What are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>“I was just thinking about the last holiday.”</p>
<p>“Did something happen on the holiday?”</p>

<p>Saying this, Toshiya sat down in an empty seat next to me.</p>

<p>“When I went to the shopping mall, I happened to meet Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san? “</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“Yeah, her older sister was also there.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san’s sister, you mean Shimizu Ai-san? “</p>
<p>“Toshiya, do you know Ai-san? “</p>
<p>“Of course, I know at least the vice president of our student council. Besides, Ai-san is quite famous for being Shimizu-san’s sister and being cute, you know?”</p>

<p>So that’s how it was. It seemed like I was the only one who didn’t know about Ai-san.</p>

<p>“So what happened when you met them?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>“Ai-san invited me to go shopping with Shimizu-san and her.”</p>
<p>“That’s an interesting turn of events. Did Daiki already know Ai-san?”</p>
<p>“No, I met her for the first time then. Ai-san knew me, though.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Shimizu-san told her about me beforehand.  </p>

<p>“I see. Still, it’s surprising that Ai-san would invite someone she just met to go shopping.”</p>
<p>“I was surprised too.”</p>

<p>I was indeed surprised at how quickly Ai-san was able to shorten the distance between us. </p>

<p>“So what did you go shopping for?”</p>
<p>“They were shopping for clothes.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>“And did Daiki help them pick out clothes?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t help much, to be honest. I just gave my opinions while they tried on clothes.”</p>

<p>They asked for my opinion, but I don’t remember giving any useful ones.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that what helping people choose clothes is all about? “</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say for sure since I haven’t had much experience helping girls choose clothes. What happened after that?”</p>
<p>“We played at the game center. After that, Ai-san had some business to attend to, so we split up. Shimizu-san and I walked together to the station.”</p>

<p>To put it simply, that’s what happened.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>

<p>“Oh, I see. Then what did Daiki think about that holiday? “</p>
<p>“At that time, I was bothered by the words Ai-san said to me…”</p>

<p>[Why are you on Kei’s side?]</p>

<p>For some reason, that question still hadn’t left my mind.</p>
<p>While thinking about that, the back door of the classroom swung open forcefully.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>“Kei! “</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>
<p>Startled, I looked in the direction of the voice coming from the back of the classroom, and there stood Ai-san with an anxious expression.</p>

<p>“Toshiya, I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? Uh, be careful.”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>
<p>Feeling that something was off, I hurried over to Ai-san. </p>

<p>“What’s wrong, Ai-san?”</p>
<p>“Daiki-kun! I’m glad you’re here. Straight to the point, is Kei not here?”</p>
<p>“No, she’s not. Shimizu-san went somewhere right at the beginning of lunch break…”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>“I knew it… “</p>

<p>Ai-san had a look of frustration on her face.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>
<p>“What happened to Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“I told you before at the family restaurant that some people were interested in Kei. That girl hadn’t been around since lunchtime, and according to her friend, she said she had something to do. That’s why I had a bad feeling and came to check, and as expected, Kei wasn’t here. I guess I was a step too late…”</p>
<p>“Does that mean Shimizu-san was summoned by someone?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. If she’s not here, I can’t stay here either. I have to find Kei.”</p>

<p> Ai-san has that serious look on her face I’ve seen before. </p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>“Wait a moment. I’ll look for her too.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t want to trouble you, Daiki-kun.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I’m also worried about Shimizu-san. Please let me help.”</p>

<p>I stare at Ai-san seriously. After a few seconds of eye contact, Ai-san seems to give in and sighs, which is unusual.</p>

<p>“Daiki-kun is more stubborn than I thought. Fine. But don’t push yourself too hard.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>“Oh, by the way. If you find her, let me know so I can get in touch with her. There’s another childhood friend of mine who’s also looking for him, so let’s create a group and communicate there if anything happens.”</p>

<p>Ai-san and I exchanged contact information and started running in different directions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Hey, is anyone here?”</p>

<p>During the lunch break, I had come to the back of the gym, known for being a place where not many people come.</p>

<p>“You came as promised.”</p>

<p>I look in the direction of the voice and see a tall guy standing there. His appearance seems to be somewhat appealing to girls. </p>
<p>I looked at his face, but I did not recognize him at all. </p>
<p>From his demeanor, he was probably in my grade or an upperclassman. For some reason, the man smiles confidently. </p>

<p>“What promise? You put this in there.”</p>

<p>I showed him the note paper I brought. It was the one I found in my shoe locker this morning.  </p>
<p>The note roughly stated that I should come to the back of the gym during lunch break today. </p>
<p>Finding it put me in a terrible mood since morning.</p>

<p>“You brought it all the way here. If you read it, you should understand my purpose, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Then, will you go out with me?”</p>

<p>Just as I expected. I let out a sigh in my mind. I was supposed to have changed since becoming a high school student to avoid situations like this.</p>

<p>“I have something I want to ask.”</p>
<p>“What is it? “</p>
<p>“Why did you confess to me? “</p>
<p>“Because I wanted to be in a relationship with you.”</p>

<p>The guy answers with an expression, ‘Why are you asking such an obvious question?’.</p>

<p>“So, why did you want to be in a relationship with me?”</p>
<p>“Well… I thought you looked good with black hair.”</p>

<p>Another one likes this. It seems that even in high school, guys who approach me are only interested in my appearance.</p>

<p>“So what’s your answer?”</p>
<p>“I refuse.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>

<p>The man looks as if he can’t believe it. The faint smile he had on his face disappeared.</p>

<p>“I won’t accept a confession from someone I don’t even know. If you fall in love based solely on appearance, find someone who looks like me.”</p>

<p>In my heart, I add, [Except for my sister Ai.] </p>

<p>“You don’t have to be so angry. Let’s calm down.”</p>
<p>“I may not be in a good mood, but I am calm. I told you I refused.”</p>
<p>“If you’re calm, then listen. It’s true that we don’t know much about each other yet, but it’s never too late to get to know each other even after we start dating, right?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s normal to get to know each other, gradually develop feelings, confess, and then start dating. The order before dating is reversed.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>

<p>The guy snorts. Unlike the way he laughed before, this time it looks like he’s mocking me. </p>

<p>“What’s so funny?”</p>
<p>“No, you’re more innocent than I thought.”</p>
<p>“Whatever.”</p>
<p>“I know you don’t like me right now, but you might like me later, right? Date me. I won’t make you feel bad.” </p>

<p>He’s quite persistent. And it feels like he’s used to saying things like this. He might have approached other girls in the same way as this time. I feel like I’ve caught the attention of a troublesome guy.</p>

<p>“My feelings won’t change. Even if we date, I could never like you, and I definitely won’t date you in the first place.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I’m at a loss. Then how about starting as friends? “</p>
<p>“Forget it. I refuse to be friends with someone who has such obvious ulterior motives. If that’s the end of it, I’m going back.” </p>

<p>The man trembles and shivers. The confidence he had earlier has completely disappeared from his face.</p>

<p>“That’s how you want to play, huh?”</p>

<p>The man is getting furious, and it seems to be getting really dangerous. </p>
<p>First of all, this gymnasium is rarely visited by people. I haven’t told anyone that I’ll be here, so no one knows I’m here. </p>
<p>That means no one can help me no matter what happens here.</p>

<p>“So that’s it is. Your mask has come off.”</p>

<p>I’m acting composed, but I can’t think of any plans to overcome the situation. </p>
<p>I might be able to resist a little because I exercise on a regular basis, but even so, the difference in physique between men and women will not be reversed. </p>
<p>The man is slowly closing the distance to me. I closed my eyes as I got lost in my thoughts, thinking that it was over.</p>

<p>“Wait! “</p>

<p>When the man and I turn our heads toward the voice, Hondō, who shouldn’t be here, is standing there.</p>

<p>“…You’re saving me again?”</p>

<p>I speak softly, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>“Hey, who are you?”</p>
<p>” …haa….haaah…Excuse me, can you wait a moment?”</p>

<p>Where was his bravado earlier? For some reason, Hondō was already out of breath.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“…Just for a little while.”</p>

<p>I managed to get permission. I’m really grateful because I’ve been running at full speed until just now. </p>
<p>As I catch my breath, Shimizu-san suddenly comes up next to me.</p>

<p>“Hey, why are you here? </p>

<p>Shimizu-san whispered to me.  </p>

<p>“Well, there are various reasons.”</p>

<p>I actually wanted to explain in more detail, but there doesn’t seem to be enough time. I wanted to report it to Ai-san as well.</p>

<p>“It’s time to talk. Who are you anyway?”</p>

<p>Tired of waiting, the man who was talking to Shimizu-san earlier called out to me.</p>

<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting. I’m Daiki Hondō, a second-year.”</p>
<p>“Well, thank you for being polite, kohai-kun. Now Hondō, what are you doing here?”</p>

<p>Suddenly, the senior changed his tone, which was quite eerie. </p>
<p>Although I want to believe that he won’t act rough since the numbers favor me being here…</p>

<p>“I’m here looking for Shimizu-san.”</p>

<p>I state my purpose concisely. The smiling Senpai nods, but his eyes are not smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, it seems like you’ve accomplished your goal. And since she’s in the middle of talking with me, it’s time for you to say goodbye.”</p>
<p>“I’m done with you. I’m going back to the classroom.” </p>
<p>“How cold. If we talk a bit more, your feelings might change.”</p>

<p>The Senpai already has no interest in me and is only looking at Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“No way they’ll change. I dislike someone like you who only judges people based on appearances.”</p>

<p>Although her tone is a bit harsh, considering the story I heard about Shimizu-san from middle school, I can understand why she would say that. </p>
<p>As I thought that, I heard him gritting his teeth.  </p>

<p>“I thought your personality had rounded out, so I went out of my way to say I wanted to go out with you, but what’s with that attitude? “</p>

<p>When he suddenly raises his voice, I shift my gaze toward the agitated Senpai, and all I can read from his expression is anger.</p>

<p>“Senpai, please calm down.”</p>
<p>“Outsiders should stay back! You’ve got nothing to offer me except your face, so don’t talk so highly of yourself! Don’t get carried away! “</p>

<p>The Senpai continues to say whatever he wants without trying to control his emotions. </p>
<p>Feeling curious, I glance at Shimizu-san. </p>
<p>She has a sad expression I’ve never seen before, then something inside me snaps.</p>

<p>“…Please correct yourself.”</p>

<p>My voice’s tone comes out unexpectedly low.</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I said, correct yourself.”</p>
<p>“Correct what? “</p>

<p>The Senpai glares at me intensely, but I’m not scared.</p>

<p>“You told Shimizu-san that she has no good qualities except her face.”</p>
<p>“That’s a fact, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“No, there are many good things about Shimizu-san that you don’t know.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san willingly helped me when we were short on staff during cooking practice, and she even shared her homemade bentō with me when I couldn’t afford lunch.”</p>
<p>” Hondō… “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san seemed to want to say something, but I still had a lot to say. </p>

<p>“Besides, she’s a good listener, and talking to her always puts me in a good mood. And even when we have nothing to talk about, just by being together——”</p>
<p>“H-hey, enough, I get it.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san interrupts me, cutting off my words. </p>
<p>Her expression seems different from before; she appears to be flustered. </p>
<p>I feel relieved that she no longer looks sad. But I can’t stop now.</p>

<p>“It’s not enough. I still haven’t conveyed all of Shimizu-san’s good qualities. It’s true that Shimizu-san is outstanding in terms of appearance, just as the Senpai says, but that’s only a small part of her charm——”</p>
<p>“I said that’s enough! “</p>
<p>“Mfffw——”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san physically covers my mouth with her hand from the front. </p>
<p>Her grip is stronger than I expected, and I can’t easily remove her hand. </p>
<p>When she finally released me after a desperate struggle, both Shimizu-san and I were out of breath.</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0029_s27.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/s27.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>“Haa… Haah… What are you doing all of a sudden, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“…Haaa… t-hat’s because you keep saying embarrassing things! ” </p>
<p>“It’s not embarrassing since everything I said is true!”</p>
<p>“It’s embarrassing for me! Put yourself in the listener’s shoes!”</p>

<p>“What are you guys doing fighting with each other?”</p>

<p>When I turned toward the voice, I saw that my Senpai had a look of dismay on his face. </p>
<p>Fortunately, there was no more anger on his face. </p>

<p>“Ah, I’m sorry. I’ll continue then.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to. I’ve heard enough. Can I ask you something?”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been curious since you came here, but what kind of relationship do you two have?”</p>
<p>“For me, Shimizu-san is someone I can’t leave alone.”</p>
<p>“Someone you can’t leave alone?”</p>

<p>Senpai seems to not understand. I wonder if I said it too vaguely for him to understand. </p>

<p>“Yeah, she’s kind yet clumsy, and that makes her an irresistible presence to me. I think as long as we’re together, I’ll always find myself looking at Shimizu-san without even realizing it.”</p>
<p>“Hondō, you, what are you… “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san appeared to be strangely flustered, even though I didn’t say anything particularly special.</p>

<p>“…I see how it is. Sigh… “</p>

<p>Senpai let out a sigh and turned his back on me and Shimizu-san. </p>

<p>“Senpai? “</p>
<p>“Done, I’m leaving. I didn’t come all this way just to listen to you two flirting.”</p>
<p>“Flirting? “</p>

<p>What is he talking about? Maybe what I said didn’t come across correctly.</p>

<p>“Hey, wait a moment. Don’t leave us alone in this situation!”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san? “</p>

<p>When I arrived, she seemed to want to stay away from the Senpai, but I wondered what her change of mind was. </p>

<p>“I don’t want to. Since you rejected me, I hope you suffer from the awkwardness of being alone with that guy. And that…maybe I was out of line earlier. Sorry about that.”</p>

<p>After saying just that, Senpai starts walking towards the school building by himself.</p>

<p>“Don’t just say what you want to say and leave! “</p>

<p>Fortunately, Shimizu-san’s shout did not reach anyone except the three of us here.</p>
