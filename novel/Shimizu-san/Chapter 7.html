<h2>Chapter 7: The Shimizu Sisters and the Game Center</h2>


<p>“We’re done with today’s objective. What do we do now?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span>
<p>“Huh? Why do you think I hurried to choose those clothes?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san responded. I also want to know the reason.</p>

<p>“It’s obvious so that the three of us can have a lot of fun together!”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>“Ha?”</p>

<p>It seems that my shopping mall adventure with the Shimizu sisters is far from over.</p>

<p>“We’ve arrived at the game center. This place is calling me!”</p>
<p>“No one is calling you.”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>After finishing shopping for the Shimizu sisters’ clothes, the three of us arrived at the game center inside the shopping mall.</p>
<p>There were many people here, probably because it was a holiday.</p>

<p>“Now, where should we start? Do you two have any games you want to play?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have anything in particular.”</p>
<p>“Me neither.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then, let’s start with a game that we can all play together, the one I always play!”</p>

<p>Ai-san’s eyes are sparkling. She seems really looking forward to playing that game.</p>

<p>“Is it a game that can be played with three people?”</p>
<p>“Of course! Well, think of it as getting on a big ship and just follow me!”</p>
<p>“That boat, I hope it’s not a mud boat…”</p>
<p>(TN: Refers to a fragile boat made of mud that appears in the old Japanese folktale [Kachi-kachi Yama.] Additionally, it is used as a metaphor for something that is likely to fail or fall apart quickly.)</p>

<p>Shimizu-san and I follow Ai-san, half skeptical.</p>

<p>“The first game we’re going to play is… this one!”</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s this?”</p>
<p>“You can tell by looking at it. It’s air hockey.”</p>

<p>As Ai-san said, there was an air hockey game in front of us.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>As I recall, this game is played by hitting a plastic disk called a puck with a device called a mallet and putting it into the opponent’s goal.</p>

<p>“That’s not what I’m asking. Why start with air hockey, a game that two or four people usually play? Not three!”</p>
<p>“If two or four can play it, why not three?”</p>
<p>“Then the side with two people is definitely stronger. Or do we have to take turns? “</p>

<p>As Shimizu-san suggested, taking turns while playing could balance the difference in strength.</p>

<p>“But then the one person who’s not playing will be bored, right? Let’s play one against two.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“Who’s going to play alone?”</p>
<p>“Of course, as the older one, I will fight alone. Bring it on, you chicks (youngsters/rookies)!”</p>
<p>“Ai-san, are you okay with that? I don’t mind being on the one-person playing.”</p>

<p>If we have to divide into teams like this, as a guy, I think it would be better for me to be on the one-person side in terms of balancing the strength.</p>

<p>“Hehe, even though I don’t look it, I love air hockey and always play it with my friends when we come to the game center. So don’t worry about me, Daiki-kun.”</p>

<p>It seems that Ai-san is quite confident in her air hockey skills.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, maybe we can split up the teams like Ai-san said.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>

<p>“Alright, Shimizu-san, is it okay for you to be on the same team as me?”</p>
<p>“If you guys are okay with that, then I’m okay with it too.”</p>
<p>“Then the teams are decided. Then let’s start playing air field hockey! “</p>

<p>Thus began the air hockey matchup between Shimizu-san and me Versus Ai-san.</p>

<p>“I’ll start since the puck came out from here.”</p>
<p>“Alright, go ahead.”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>The puck seemed to be ejected in Ai-san’s direction.</p>
<p>Ai-san sets the puck down.</p>

<p>“Here I go! Take this!”</p>

<p>Ai-san hits the puck toward our goal. Just as the puck approaches Shimizu-san, it disappears with a sound.</p>

<p>“What? “</p>

<p>Suddenly, the score on our side shows a number 1.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>Shimizu-san’s returned puck had somehow made it into the goal.</p>

<p>“I’m not satisfied with the previous match at the store. So, I’ll win here and feel refreshed.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s face displays a predator’s smile.</p>

<p>“This is not good, Daiki-kun. It seems like Kei’s switch has been flipped!”</p>
<p>“Should I change team now?”</p>

<p>I think this game will be one-sided, dominated by Shimizu-san, and even if I switch with Ai-san, it might still end up one-sided.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry! I have a secret plan!”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>Ai-san holds the puck and points to the back of Shimizu-san.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>“…wait, what’s that? What’s happening behind you?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san and I turn around, but there isn’t anything unusual.</p>

<p>“An opening! Take this deadly attack! Shōri Victory Smash! “</p>
<p>(TN: 勝利, Shōri, also means ‘victory’, she said Shōri bikutorī sumasshu.)</p>

<p>I hear the sound of the puck being hit. In an instant, Ai-san unexpectedly shoots the puck toward our goal.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>
<p>It’s a surprise attack. Just as I think the puck has entered our goal, there’s a [thud] sound, and our team’s score shows the number 2.</p>

<p>“What the… “</p>

<p>Ai-san couldn’t hide her shock.</p>

<p>“What are you doing? … You’ve been using the same move since long ago, so it’s not going to work anymore. And the name of your special move, ‘Shōri’, has the same meaning as ‘Victory.’ “</p>
<p>“Oh my god… To think that our beautiful sisterly memories have turned into a joke… “</p>
<p>“Please play fair when you are playing with your sisters.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>

<p>Ai-san’s secret plan has failed. I wonder what she’s going to do next.</p>

<p>“Kuhh, I didn’t want to use this dirty trick because it’s not fair, but I had no choice.”</p>

<p>I don’t think we need to worry about that anymore, since the previous strategy was cowardly enough.</p>

<p>“Just go ahead and try.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san is still full of determination. I don’t think Ai-san can take the goal from Shimizu-san, though.</p>

<p>“Let’s go! Operation name: [The distance between him and me is closer than I thought, and my heart is pounding… What is this feeling…?] Strategy! Take this!”</p>

<p>As Ai-san announces her strategy, she hit the puck toward our goal.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Let’s go! Operation name: [The distance between him and me is closer than I thought, and my heart is pounding… What is this feeling…?] Strategy! Take this!”</p>

<p>As Ai-san announces her strategy, she hit the puck toward our goal.</p>

<p>“It’s too long! “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san responds with a retort and hits the puck back.</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>However, this time the puck’s speed seems slower, and Ai-san hits it back again.</p>
<p>The puck was on a trajectory that was about halfway between me and Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>Just as I thought that Shimizu-san would start to move to intercept the shot, she suddenly slowed down and stopped, looking at me.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san!”</p>

<p>Although I managed to hit it back somehow, I couldn’t hit the puck cleanly, and it slowly headed toward Ai-san.</p>

<p>“Chance! Oriya!”</p>

<p>Ai-san’s puck was not hit back and went into our goal.</p>

<p>“Why did you stop in the middle, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“B-Because…you were closer than I thought… “</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Why couldn’t Shimizu-san hit the puck if I was close to her?</p>

<p>“Fu-fu-fu. It seems like my plan worked.”</p>

<p>Ai-san crosses her arms and wears a proud expression.</p>

<p>“By ‘plan,’ do you mean that long and incomprehensible thing? “</p>
<p>“I feel like crying a little due to the harsh criticism, but that’s exactly right!”</p>

<p>Ai-san pointed at Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Kei-san, you have a weakness, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“What’s this all of a sudden?”</p>

<p>Weaknesses? I can’t think of any weaknesses that would put Shimizu-san at a disadvantage in this situation.</p>

<p>“If Daiku-kun is next to you, you find it diffic——”</p>

<p>As Ai-san begins to speak, Shimizu-san quickly moves towards Ai-san and physically blocks her mouth with her hands.</p>

<p>“What are you trying to say all of a sudden?! “</p>
<p>“Mmmffw.——”</p>

<p>Ai-san taps Shimizu-san’s hand a few times and declares surrender.</p>
<p>Shimizu-san sees this and releases Ai-san.</p>

<p>“That was dangerous… I almost departed to Heaven…”</p>
<p>“That’s because you were casually trying to say something outrageous.”</p>

<p>What was Ai-san trying to say? And what would happen to Shimizu-san when I’m next to her?</p>

<p>“But I haven’t said anything yet. Well, anyway, the innocent and naive Kei-san can’t show her true abilities when she’s so close to Daiki-kun. If I can exploit that, I can easily defeat you!”</p>
<p>“You… Are you happy to win with that?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter! As long as I win, I can do whatever it takes!”</p>
<p>“Don’t suddenly become obsessed with winning. Usually, you prioritize having fun and don’t care about winning or losing.”</p>

<p>Indeed, Ai-san doesn’t seem to be the kind of person who is obsessed with winning.</p>

<p>“Since you say things like that, this is what you get! You better get back next to Daiki-kun now! I’ll give you a good beating!”</p>

<p>Ai-san strikes a fighting pose and throws a punch into the air. Shimizu-san still seemed to have something to say, but Ai-san shooed her away and came back to me.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“She’s not going to listen to anyone anymore.</p>
<p>“It seemed that way to me too… Anyway, Shimizu-san, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“What are you apologizing for?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san has a puzzled look on her face as if she can’t think of anything that would require an apology.</p>

<p>“I don’t really understand, but it’s because of me that Shimizu-san wasn’t in top form earlier, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah… that, how should I put it, it’s because of you, but at the same time, it’s not entirely because of you…” (あれはなんというか、お前が原因だけどお前のせいじゃないというか)</p>
<p>“Err…uh?”</p>

<p>Am I at fault or not? Which one is it?</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t have to worry about it.”</p>
<p>“Got it. But what if we both end up in a position where we can take the puck like earlier?”</p>
<p>“We’ll split up by location. I’ll take care of this half, so if it comes to your side, you take the shot.”</p>

<p>That way, we won’t have to worry about a situation like before arises.</p>

<p>“Roger that. In that case, can I ask Shimizu-san to take the first shot?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Are both of you ready for my strategy? Then come on!”</p>
<p>“It won’t go as smoothly as before, you know.”</p>

<p>The second part of the Shimizu sisters’ air field hockey duel has begun.</p>

<p>“Here I go!”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san, go for it!”</p>
<p>“I know! Ora!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san quickly moves and returns the puck. Ai-san, unable to react in time, lets the puck go into the goal. It seems like we’ve scored this time.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>“Haah… haaa… Kei, that’s pretty good. It seems like you’re gradually syncing well with Daiki-kun. Onē-chan is starting to feel a little jealous… “</p>
<p>“You’re better than I thought you’d be, Ai.”</p>

<p>With less than a minute remaining, the score is currently tied at five to five. Our team has been scoring points with Shimizu-san’s powerful strikes using her athletic abilities, and Ai-san has been scoring precise goals by accurately hitting the puck even after we divided our location.</p>

<p>“We don’t have much time left.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the next one to score wins.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. And the winner gets to give orders to the loser.”</p>
<p>“What? What are you talking about all of a sudden? “</p>

<p>Thinking that she has an advantage with the puck on her side, Ai-san starts adding a new rule.</p>

<p>“It’s only natural that the winner has the right to give orders to the loser, right? Huh, don’t tell me Kei, are you not confident? “</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san, that’s just Ai-san’s provocation. Don’t fall for it.”</p>
<p>“I know. Who would fall for such an obvious provocation…”</p>
<p>“Ahh I see〜. Kei-san is playing with two people and has an advantage, but she’s scared to death. Wow~. “</p>
<p>“…fine. I’ll take you up on your offer.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san? “</p>

<p>It seems that Shimizu-san is more susceptible to provocation than I thought. I’m starting to worry about her a little.</p>

<p>“Well then, it’s decided. There’s not much time left, so let’s go for the finishing move! Never-Ending Attack! (Nebāendingu atakku)”</p>

<p>Ai-san is now hitting the puck into a good trajectory again.</p>

<p>“I’ll hit it!”</p>
<p>“Understood!”</p>

<p>Even though I was closer to the puck, I decided to trust Shimizu-san and leave it to her.</p>
<p>“Ora! “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san hits the puck back, heading straight for Ai-san’s goal.</p>
<p>Just when we were confident that it would be a goal, the puck disappeared with a [thud] sound.</p>

<p>“Huh? “</p>
<p>The next thing I knew, the score had been updated and the number on Ai-san’s side had changed to 6.</p>
<p>At the same time, the game-ending buzzer sounds. The intense game ends with Ai-san winning by six to five.</p>

<p>“You let your guard down. If I know who’s going to hit and where they’re going to hit, I can deal with a fast shot. Based on our previous fight, I had a pretty good idea which way Kei would hit and the trajectory she was going to take, so I could counter it.”</p>
<p>“Grrr… “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san can’t hide her frustration.</p>
<p>From her explanation, it seems that Ai-san’s last score wasn’t just a coincidence.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Since I won, both of you will obey my orders as promised.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Kei, you won’t break a promise, right?”</p>

<p>Ai-san has a wicked smile on her face. It seems that being able to give orders to Shimizu-san brings her great joy.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it. Because I’m the one who said I’d listen to your orders if we lose, I’ll take orders for both of us. I mean, don’t give Hondō any unreasonable orders.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san, you can’t do that.”</p>

<p>Indeed, Shimizu-san was the one who made the promise to obey orders. However, I don’t think it’s fair to burden her with all the responsibility.</p>

<p>“It’s fine. In the first place, it was my fault for falling for Ai’s provocation. So I’ll take care of it.”</p>
<p>“Kei, is that okay with you?”</p>

<p>Ai-san looks straight at Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>” …Okay. Then let’s get Kei to listen to some special command! “</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Daiki-kun. It’s not a hard command. Well then, let’s move to the next destination!”</p>

<p>Ai-san grabbed Shimizu-san’s arm and started to lead us along. I followed behind them as we headed to our next destination.</p>

<p>“We’ve arrived at our destination!”</p>
<p>“Is this the place?”</p>

<p>Looking around, I see an area with several print sticker machines, commonly known as Purikura machines.</p>

<p>“Do we have to do this?”</p>
<p>“Good answer. Very perceptive, Kei.”</p>
<p>“Well, there are only Purikura machines around here, so it’s hard not to know. Besides, aren’t Purikura usually taken with friends?”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>Ai-san seems to have a face as if she wants to ask if there’s a problem.</p>

<p>“If that’s the case, then why did you suddenly take Purikura with Hondō, whom Ai met for the first time today?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, my memories with Daiki-kun are only available today, but we had meals together, looked at clothes, and played at the game center today. Isn’t that already a good friend?”</p>
<p>“It’s too early to become friends.”</p>

<p>It seems that Ai-san’s judgment on whether or not we are friends is a bit lenient.</p>

<p>“Besides, even without a command, I would have taken Purikura for you.”</p>
<p>“Fu-fu-fu-“</p>
<p>“What’s with that sudden laughter?”</p>

<p>Ai-san looks like she’s up to something.</p>

<p>“Are you saying that I’m using my precious command rights on Kei just to take ordinary Purikura? You’re naive, Kei. Sweeter than a cookie with too much sugar.”</p>
<p>“That’s the cookies you usually make, Ai.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. I have a sweet tooth, so I tend to put in too much sugar… No, that’s not it! Oh well, for now, it’s time to relax!”</p>

<p>Ai-san points sharply at Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“What are you planning?”</p>
<p>“You’ll find out in a little while. Well then, Daiki-kun, Kei, we’ll prepare a bit and come back. Can you wait around here for a while?”</p>
<p>“Okay, but I don’t have to go? “</p>
<p>“It’s a promise with Kei that I won’t give you any big commands, so just wait here and be excited.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>

<p>I wonder what Ai-san is planning to do with Shimizu-san. I can’t help but feel anxious.</p>

<p>“Okay! Then let’s go! Kei, follow me!”</p>
<p>“I have a bad feeling about this.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san is pulled away by Ai-san, and they disappear from my sight.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Ten minutes had passed since Ai-san had taken Shimizu-san away.</p>
<p>There is no sign of the Shimizu sisters coming back. As I ponder what to do with nothing to do, I hear a familiar voice from behind.</p>

<p>“Hey, Daiki-kun, are you waiting for long?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m fine… Ai-san, what kind of outfit is that?”</p>

<p>I turned my head in the direction where the voice came from.</p>
<p>There, the Shimizu sisters, dressed as maids, are standing.</p>

<p>“Surprised, aren’t you? You can borrow costumes for taking pictures at the Purikura machines here.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. I didn’t know.”</p>
<p>“I’ve always wanted to cosplay and take Purikura with Kei.”</p>

<p>Ai-san’s excitement is evident in her expression.</p>

<p>“It’s a maid outfit! Isn’t it lovely! “</p>

<p>Ai-san leaned her arm on her hip and proudly showed me the costume. She unconsciously poses to emphasize her ample bosom, making it a little difficult for me to look at her.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it looks good.”</p>

<p>The maid’s uniform is based on black, with a white apron worn over it.</p>
<p>She also wears a headband with frills, and the skirt is long, resembling the design of a maid working in a mansion.</p>

<p>“There was also a cute maid uniform with a mini skirt that you would see at a maid cafe, but Kei said she didn’t like mini skirts, so I reluctantly compromised and chose this one. Although I couldn’t capture Kei in the white dress before, this maid uniform in the same elegant style works just as well.”</p>

<p>Ai-san lightly bowed while holding the skirt. It seemed like a gesture she often performed, and I couldn’t help but be impressed.</p>

<p>“I actually wanted to make Daiki-kun a maid too. But I promised Kei not to give big orders to Daiki-kun, and there are no costumes here for boys.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>I felt like she said something terribly scary with a smiling face.</p>

<p>“Daiki-kun has a somewhat neutral and cute face, and your body is slender, so I think you would also look good in cross-dressing.”</p>
<p>“Uh, thank you?”</p>

<p>Regarding my face, I actually want to look a bit more masculine, so being called cute honestly gives me mixed feelings.</p>

<p>“Hey, if you don’t honestly say you don’t want to, Ai might make you dress up as a woman.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san, who was watching beside her, gave me a very important warning.</p>
<p>“Well, Ai-san, I’m not interested in that kind of thing…”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s a shame. Daiki-kun, you’re like an unpolished diamond that would shine if you were polished…”</p>

<p>Ai-san seemed genuinely disappointed. I’d rather keep that diamond unpolished for the rest of my life, though.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Well, I can’t help it. I’ll wait for Daiki-kun’s feelings to change slowly. That aside, how about Kei in a maid outfit, Daiki-kun?”</p>

<p>I shifted my gaze to Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>Perhaps because the image of Shimizu-san from the time when we were first-year students, with blonde hair and a disheveled uniform, still remained in me.</p>
<p>I felt a significant gap in seeing the current Shimizu-san, who had long black hair and an elegant maid-like aura.</p>

<p>“W-What is it? Don’t look at me so seriously…”</p>

<p>Although Shimizu-san glared at me, there was less intimidation since she was dressed as a maid. Even though she asked me not to look, Ai-san asked for my opinion, so I stared intently at her figure.</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0024_s21.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/s21.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>“Ai-san gives off a lively maid vibe, while Shimizu-san gives off a calm, cool, beautiful maid vibe. I think both of you look good.”</p>
<p>“Ugh… “</p>
<p>“Incredible, Daiki-kun, praising both girls at the same time! I wish my childhood friend could learn from you. By the way, you’re a calm, cool and beautiful maid Kei! I’m happy for you.</p>
<p>“S-shut up!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san turns away from me and I can’t see her expression.</p>

<p>“She’s not very honest, is she? Well, now that we have Daiki-kun’s feedback, let’s go take some purikura right away!”</p>
<p>“…Do we really have to take them in this outfit?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s words sounded weak, I guess she really doesn’t like it.</p>

<p>“Even if you show me your cute side and try to shake my heart, it won’t work! I’m willing to become a demon if it’s for taking pictures with Kei!”</p>

<p>Saying that, the lively maid firmly grabbed Shimizu-san and me with her hands and headed towards the photo booth.</p>

<p>“It’s a dream come true to cosplay as sisters and in maid outfits! I’m so incredibly happy. Maybe I’m going to die today? “</p>
<p>“I want to disappear… “</p>

<p>After taking the photo and changing back into our original clothes, the Shimizu sisters had completely opposite levels of excitement.</p>

<p>“Why do you look like you’re about to do a Kyomizu dive? We had so much fun.</p>
<p>“You’re the only one who had fun! You made us do such embarrassing poses!”</p>
<p>“Is that so…Daiki-kun, did you have fun?”</p>
<p>“Ahaha… “</p>
<p>(TN: “Kiyomizu” refers to Kiyomizu Falls, a sacred waterfall associated with a nearby temple of the Tendai sect of Buddhism called Kiyomizuzan Kenryuji Hochiin.)</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but let out a dry laugh.</p>
<p>This time, I could understand Shimizu-san’s feelings to some extent. Even I felt a little embarrassed doing a pose where I winked with one eye and made a heart shape with both hands.</p>

<p>“Daiki-kun too… it can’t be helped. Well then, let’s have another go at it! “</p>
<p>“Are we… going to take another photo?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san asked Ai-san hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Of course! But this time, we won’t cosplay. Our only purpose is to take a purikura photo.”</p>
<p>” …Well, that’s fine then.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san seemed worn out mentally as if now anything would do as long as it didn’t involve cosplay.</p>
<p>“Is Daiki-kun okay with that too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m fine with that.”</p>

<p>Since we had come this far, I decided to go along until the end. Halfway forgetting the purpose of my visit to the mall, I walk over to the photo booth.</p>

<p>“Okay, let’s take a picture!”</p>

<p>As soon as Ai-san entered the booth, she quickly inserted the money and started setting up the photo booth.</p>

<p>“Um, Ai-san, I’ve got my own money… “</p>
<p>“It’s fine. This time, it’s my treat. Instead of that, what kind of pose should we do?”</p>
<p>“Anything is fine.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san didn’t seem as enthusiastic as Ai-san. Or rather, one could say that Ai-san was overly enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“No, that won’t do! We have to commemorate this special day. Don’t you want to do an interesting pose?”</p>
<p>“If it’s too strange, I won’t do it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, trust Onē-chan.”</p>
<p>“I can’t trust you, that’s why I’m pointing it out.”</p>

<p>While the sisters were arguing, a mechanical voice suddenly came from the screen in front of us.</p>

<p>[The camera will begin. Counting down to the first shot…]</p>
<p>“Oh, we’re about to take the first shot! Let’s line up, everyone!”</p>

<p>Saying that, Ai-san pulled me and Shimizu-san, who was behind her, a little forward while she moved further to the front and crouched down.</p>

<p>“Why are Hondō and I next to each other this time?”</p>
<p>“Earlier, Kei and I were wearing matching outfits, so I wanted to be next to Kei. But now I’m a little shorter than both of you, so this arrangement feels better.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>I didn’t know that was the intention behind this arrangement.</p>
<p>On the screen in front, the three of us were captured.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, it seemed that the distance between Shimizu-san and I was a little far from each other.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, can we get a little closer?”</p>
<p>“Why all of a sudden…”</p>
<p>“Because Shimizu-san and I are a bit far apart. Is it not okay?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not like it’s a problem…”</p>
<p>“We don’t have much time! Let’s start with a classic peace sign! Countdown, three, two…”</p>

<p>I made a peace sign with one hand and took a step closer to Shimizu-san. Just after that, there was a sound of a shutter and a flash went off.</p>

<p>“Let’s see… Oh! It came out pretty good, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>The image on the screen showed the three of them posing for a picture. Looking closely, I felt that Shimizu-san in the image was about half a step closer to me than she was now.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Now, how should we take the next one?”</p>
<p>“Can we just do whatever pose we like?”</p>
<p>“Geez, Kei is so indifferent. Onē-chan is so sad. Daiki-kun, do you have any pose you want to do?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have any particular pose either.”</p>

<p>I don’t have many opportunities to take pictures, so I can’t think of any poses.</p>

<p>“Hmm, young people these days, aren’t they a little cold towards me? Well, never mind. Next, let’s go freestyle. Leave it to each person’s senses! I’m looking forward to what kind of funny picture it will be!”</p>
<p>“Don’t raise the bar unnecessarily.”</p>
<p>[The camera will begin. Counting down to the second shot…]</p>

<p>Once again, a mechanical voice began to announce the countdown.</p>

<p>“Come on, it’s about to start. Have you both decided on your poses?”</p>

<p>Not at all. After much deliberation, I decided to strike a fighting pose, at least not the same one as before. The flash went off again.</p>
<p>“How about this time… Kei, at least strike some pose!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san in the image was just standing without posing, as Ai-san had said. But upon closer inspection, it seemed like Shimizu-san had moved half a step closer to me compared to when we took the previous picture.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t think of a pose.”</p>
<p>“If you had said so earlier, I would have taught you my super funny pose.”</p>
<p>“I would rather not pose than do that.”</p>

<p>Ai-san’s pose in the second picture was unique and hard to describe. I can understand why Shimizu-san refused.</p>

<p>“Well, there is one more time, so it’s fine. What pose should we do for the last one…”</p>

<p>Suddenly, a ringing sound was heard. It wasn’t my ringtone, so it must be from either Shimizu’s sister’s phone. Ai-san hurriedly took out her phone from her bag.</p>

<p>“Hello, it’s me… Yeah, can you wait a moment?”</p>

<p>Ai-san turns to us.</p>

<p>“Sorry. I have to take this call, but I’ll be right back. I don’t think I’ll make it in time for the last picture, so you two should take it together.”</p>

<p>With that said, Ai-san went outside the photo booth.</p>

<p>“What should we do?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? We just need to take the picture.”</p>
<p>“Is Shimizu-san okay with that? “</p>
<p>Unlike Ai-san, Shimizu-san wasn’t that enthusiastic about taking pictures.</p>

<p>“If you told me we have to take several more, I would refuse, but one picture is fine. Besides…”</p>
<p>“Besides?”</p>
<p>“…It’s nothing. Let’s just take it. I don’t want to bother with posing.”</p>
<p>[The camera will begin. Counting down to the third shot…]</p>

<p>The final countdown begins.</p>
<p>It seems strange for me to be the only one posing, so I decide to be natural for the last shot.</p>
<p>As the countdown reached single digits and I looked toward the camera, I felt something touch my shoulder.</p>
<p>Before I could react to the sensation, the flash went off.</p>

<p>“Suddenly leaving like that, sorry about that. Did the last shot turn out well?”</p>

<p>Ai-san walked into the photo booth with an apologetic look on her face.</p>

<p>“Well maybe… “</p>
<p>“I wonder how the last photo turned out… Oh?”</p>

<p>I also leaned in from behind Ai-san to check the image. There, it captured Shimizu-san and me leaning our shoulders against each other.</p>

<p>“Oh my, Kei, you’ve become bold.”</p>
<p>“No! That is… my legs just got tangled up a bit! “</p>

<p>Since I didn’t see it directly, I didn’t realize that Shimizu-san’s leg was tangled. I’m glad she didn’t fall.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s just leave it at that.”</p>
<p>“It’s not about leaving it at that. That’s how it is. Are you going to edit the photo?”</p>
<p>“Don’t say ‘edit.’ Enhance! Do you both want enhancements?”</p>

<p>The meaning doesn’t seem to differ much, but Ai-san seems to be very particular about it.</p>

<p>“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“I’ll pass too.”</p>
<p>“Huh? It’s so much fun to enhance it together! Well, forcing someone is not good, I guess. Then, I’ll enhance the photo to the fullest, you two can keep each other entertained nearby.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Sure, but don’t take too long.”</p>

<p>While Ai-san enhanced the photo, Shimizu-san and I had to find a way to pass the time together.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, do you usually come to the game center?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not really interested, so it’s rare for me to go here. How about you?”</p>
<p>“Teruno likes to play games, so I sometimes accompany her.”</p>

<p>After leaving the photo booth for a few minutes, we wandered around the game center without any specific destination.</p>

<p>“What do you do when you come with your sister?”</p>
<p>“I usually play versus games with her. I’m not very good at games, so Teruno always tells me to get better.”</p>
<p>“I guess it’s not easy being an older brother (Aniki).”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m having fun too, so it’s okay.”</p>

<p>As we walked and talked, Shimizu-san suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, Shimizu-san?”</p>

<p>When I followed Shimizu-san’s gaze, there was a crane game machine.</p>
<p>Inside, there were several teddy bear plushies.</p>
<p>Looking closely at the teddy bears, they had droopy eyes and gave an impression of looking sleepy.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, do you want that? “</p>
<p>“N-no, of course not.”</p>
<p>“But Shimizu-san, didn’t you just stare at that plushie?”</p>
<p>“It just happened to catch my eye, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san emphasized that it was a coincidence. Perhaps it was just my imagination that she seemed concerned about it.</p>

<p>“Well, since we have time, why don’t we give it a try?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s expression briefly brightened, then she shook her head and returned to her original expression. It was as if something was fighting inside Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“I guess I can’t help it. I’m not interested, but I’m free, so I can give it a try once.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. Then, let’s give it a try.”</p>

<p>Great, it seems like she is willing to give it a try. And so, the teddy bear capture operation between Shimizu-san and me began.</p>
<p>The claw catches the stuffed bear and pulls it into the air. However, the claw was not strong enough and the plushie fell back to its original position.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Oh no, why? Let’s try again!”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san, are you still going to continue?”</p>

<p>A few minutes after the start of the operation, Shimizu-san continued to challenge the claw machine alone.</p>
<p>Initially, Shimizu-san and I were supposed to take turns with one attempt each, but Shimizu-san kept saying [one more time] and I completely lost the timing to switch.</p>

<p>“That was close, wasn’t it? I’ll get it next time.”</p>

<p>Is that so? No matter how many times she tries, the plushie quickly falls and the position doesn’t seem to change much.</p>

<p>“Okay, here I go!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san puts a 100 yen coin into the arm again.</p>
<p>This time, just like before, the teddy bear plushie moved up and fell down again and didn’t change its position significantly.</p>

<p>“Where did I go wrong?”</p>

<p>Honestly, it’s a bit cruel to say this, but it seems that Shimizu-san has absolutely no aptitude for crane games.</p>

<p>“Let’s wrap it up soon, Shimizu-san. Ai-san must be waiting for us, right?”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san looked genuinely disappointed. It seems like she really wanted that plushie.</p>

<p>“Alright, if that’s the case, can you let me try once? Let’s each try one more time, and if it doesn’t work, let’s go back to Ai-san.”</p>

<p>I don’t have much experience with crane games either, but it’s probably more likely for me to succeed than Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“…Ah, okay.”</p>

<p>Great, it seems like Shimizu-san is willing to accept my suggestion.</p>

<p>“Well then, I’ll try.”</p>

<p>The final teddy bear capture operation by Shimizu-san and me commenced.</p>
<p>I put in a 100 yen coin and took hold of the controller. It is difficult to count on Shimizu-san’s disastrous improvement in skill, the only way to win the plushie is for me to capture it in one go.</p>
<p>I exhaled slowly and focused my gaze. Carefully manipulating the controller, I slowly moved the claw closer to the plushie from above. Just as the claw reached directly above the plushie, I pressed the button to make it descend.</p>

<p>(Now!).</p>

<p>The claw swiftly descended and grabbed the plushie. Without falling, it was lifted up all the way. I glanced to the side and saw Shimizu-san staring at the plushie as if praying.</p>
<p>Whether the prayer worked or not, the plushie remained stable until the end and eventually fell from the claw into the retrieval chute.</p>

<p>“I got it, Shimizu-san!”</p>

<p>I took the stuffed bear out of the slot and showed it to Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Ah…well, good for you.”</p>

<p>For a moment, Shimizu-san’s eyes sparkled like a child, but she quickly regained composure.</p>
<p>However, there still seemed to be a lingering excitement in her eyes when looking at the plushie.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, can I ask you for a favor?”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Could you take this plushie?</p>
<p>“Huh? Why me? …why don’t you give it to your sister?</p>
<p>“Teruno tends to handle things a bit roughly. I’d feel sorry for this plushie.”</p>

<p>This is not a lie; Teruno’s room is always a mess no matter when I visit it.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if I give her this teddy bear plushie, I have a feeling that in a few days, it will end up being used as a replacement for a beanbag chair.</p>

<p>“So, Shimizu-san, would you take care of this teddy bear instead?”</p>

<p>I handed the teddy bear to Shimizu-san. She reaches out her hand, then retracts it midway, and after a moment of hesitation, she reaches out her hand again and accepts the teddy bear from me.</p>

<p>“…then I’ll take it. I won’t return it later, though.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san, hugging the teddy bear, seems happier than before.</p>

<p>“Fufu.”</p>
<p>“W-why? Why are you suddenly laughing?”</p>
<p>“I mean, Shimizu-san, I didn’t expect you to like teddy bears.”</p>
<p>“That’s because… This bear is… “</p>

<p>Maybe because Shimizu-san brought the teddy bear close to her mouth, her voice became quieter, overshadowed by the surrounding sounds, and I couldn’t hear it well.</p>
<p>Maybe I should explain why I said it was surprising, just in case.</p>

<p>“When I said it was unexpected, I didn’t mean it in a bad way. I just thought it was cute, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Ughh… “</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“D-don’t call me cute all of a sudden! …anyway, let’s go. Ai is waiting for us.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Then let’s go to Ai-san.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>The teddy bear capture operation ended successfully, and Shimizu-san and I began walking toward the area where Ai-san was waiting with the Purikura machine.</p>

<p>“Kei and Daiki-kun, I’ve been waiting. What were you doing… Oh, that teddy bear is adorable! How did you get that?”</p>

<p>When we returned, Ai-san had already finished and was waiting for us in front of the Purikura machine.</p>

<p>“Got it from the crane game.”</p>
<p>“Huh, I thought Kei was terrible at crane games?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say it was me!”</p>

<p>She certainly didn’t say it, but it felt like she implied it was her.</p>

<p>“Kei didn’t win it, but Kei has it… Hmm-mmh, I see.”</p>

<p>Ai-san closed her mouth with her hand and seemed to be signaling that she was hiding a smile behind her hand.</p>

<p>“W-what?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m just glad you got an unexpected present.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>“And here’s a present from me to you two.”</p>

<p>Ai-san said and handed us something like a thick piece of paper.</p>

<p>“It’s a picture we took just now. I enhanced it with special effects, so please take good care of it.”</p>
<p>“Hey, the second picture, my face is too dark!”</p>

<p>I looked at the second picture we took, and sure enough, there was a brown-skinned Shimizu-san and me in it.</p>

<p>“Well, when I was thinking about how I could make myself look whiter, and I thought, [Why don’t I make the people around me darker?] “</p>

<p>Her way of thinking was devilish. As I looked at the received Purikura, I noticed that the last one, featuring only Shimizu-san and me, hadn’t been edited at all.</p>

<p>“Ah, Ai-san.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you add effects to the last Purikura of Shimizu-san and me?”</p>
<p>“Oh, well.”</p>

<p>When I asked, Ai-san chuckled happily.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s because I didn’t want to get kicked by a horse.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to understand that right now. Well, just make sure you don’t lose that Purikura.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>When will I understand the meaning behind that?</p>
<p>Right now, I have no idea.</p>
