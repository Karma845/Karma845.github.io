<h2>Chapter 3: Shimizu-san’s Bentō</h2>

<p>“It wasn’t supposed to be like this… “</p>

<p>　I say this unintentionally, without trying to tell anyone as I lie down on the pillows in my room. Then I sat on my bed and thought about today’s cooking class.</p>
<p>　The purpose of going to today’s cooking class was to cook with that man… Daiki Hondō. Since we were in the same group, the opportunity to cook together was easier than I thought. My original plan was to show that I am a good cook in the process of working together. What I did not calculate was that Hondō was more experienced in cooking than I had expected, and my cooking skills were quite terrible.</p>

<p>(I had no idea there was that much of a gap between us…)</p>

<p>　It is true that I usually did not cook at home and had skipped the previous cooking classes, so I was called in later to cook together with the home economics teacher.</p>
<p>　But before I started cooking with him, I thought that cutting with a knife would be a piece of cake. As a result, Hondō was teaching me the whole time, and I could not show him that I could cook. However, even though it was very different from my initial assumption, what happened last time is still a very good thing for me…</p>

<p>(His hands were rougher than I thought they would be.)</p>

<p>　Remembering last time, I shake my head from side to side.</p>
<p>　 Was it because Hondō’s hands were rugged and more masculine than I had expected? The only other experience I have of being touched by the opposite sex is the memory of being touched by my father when I was a child, but that doesn’t really count.</p>

<p>(He said he was happy to cook with me…)</p>

<p>　Groaning, I roll around on the bed again.</p>
<p>　Hondō must have said that he was happy to cook with anyone. What got me so excited to hear just one comment from Hondō?</p>
<p>　I slap my cheeks with my hands.</p>

<p>　What’s done is done. The important thing is how to get back on track. Somehow, I must show him that I am not a bad cook.</p>
<p>　The question is how. Since there will be no more cooking classes for a while, I need to make some other opportunity. As I was thinking about how to do that and looking at the notes I had written down on my phone, I remembered the love talk that Hondō and Matsuoka had before.</p>

<p>[Then, Daiki probably would be interested in a bentō made by the girl you like, wouldn’t you? ]</p>
<p>[That may be true…]</p>

<p>　 When Matsuoka asked Hondō if he was interested in a homemade bentō, he answered yes.</p>
<p>　If so, I could kill two birds with one stone by making a bentō and giving it to Hondō, which would make him happy and also show off my cooking skills. I thought I had come up with a good idea, but at the same time, a certain problem arose.</p>

<p>(Wouldn’t it seem strange if I suddenly gave him a homemade bentō?)</p>

<p>　I have seen a scene in the manga where a girl gives her favorite boy a homemade bentō, but I wonder if it is actually happening in real life, at least, I don’t remember seeing it. Maybe it is happening in real life, but I just don’t know it.</p>
<p>　I thought it was difficult to make a judgment by myself, so I decided to ask someone else opinion.</p>

<p>“Hey, Ai, are you there?”</p>

<p>　I leave my room and come to the next room, knocking on the door and talking to the room owner. Then I heard footsteps from inside, and the door slowly opened.</p>

<p>“Huh, Kei, what’s wrong? “</p>

<p>　My sister, Ai, the owner of this room, looked at me curiously through the door.</p>

<p>“I wanted to ask you a few questions… “</p>
<p>“What? It’s so rare that Kei has a question for me!!! Maybe something will fall from the sky tomorrow?! For now, let’s go inside my room, I have snacks. Come on, come in, come in.”</p>
<p>“Too noisy! Get your hands off me! “</p>

<p>　I shake off Ai’s hand as she tries to drag me into the room. Ai’s machine-gun talk is still so annoying to me. I’m already beginning to regret coming to my sister for help.</p>

<p>“I told you it was just a few questions. It’s fine to talk right here.”</p>
<p>“You sure? Mom and Dad might hear us in the hallway. Is it okay for them to hear? “</p>
<p>“Ughh.”</p>

<p>　I’m not saying it’s wrong for them to hear this, but the fewer people who know about this story, the better.</p>

<p>“…I’ll leave as soon as we’re done talking.”</p>
<p>“Of course-of course! Let me show Kei to my room.”</p>

<p>　 Ai happily grabbed my arm and pulled me inside the room.</p>

<p>“Then, what do you want to ask this good-looking, academically talented student council vice president? “</p>
<p>“Don’t call yourself good-looking. Also, you’re not that good academically…”</p>

<p>　Now, Ai and I were sitting across from each other at the mini-table. I had hardly been to Ai’s room since I became a high school student, it did not seem to have changed that much since then. The room was filled with comics, games, and stuffed animals.</p>

<p>“As I said before, I want to ask you something.</p>
<p>“What is it? The secret to being as bright, dainty, and beautiful as me? “</p>
<p>“…I’ll leave.”</p>
<p>“I’m kidding! It was a simple joke! I would love to hear your story Kei!”</p>
<p>“…the next time you make fun of me, I’ll leave for real.”</p>
<p>“Roger! I understand! “</p>

<p>　 Ai pauses to salute. I wonder if I will be able to hear the answer to my question before I return to the room.</p>

<p>“You know… What would Ai think if someone suddenly handed you a bentō? “</p>
<p>“Does that mean Kei gave it to someone? “</p>
<p>“No, I mean, I got a bentō from a guy I usually talk to.”</p>
<p>“Huh, but why all of a sudden?”</p>

<p>　Is it strange to suddenly give a homemade bentō to someone of the opposite sex? I may have to rethink my strategy from the very beginning.</p>

<p>“…I got it. It was helpful. I’ll return. “</p>

<p>　As I get up to leave, Ai grabs me firmly by the arm.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. I don’t understand the whole story, and at this rate, I can’t sleep if I don’t. Why don’t you tell me more about it? Don’t worry, I won’t let you down! “</p>

<p>　I don’t know what she’s trying to understand from the previous question, and I don’t know if I can tell her everything. To be honest, I feel uneasy, but it’s also true that I’m stuck on my own.</p>

<p>“I won’t tell you everything.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’m an ultra-hyper beautiful girl who knows a thousand things when she hears one thing! “</p>
<p>“Then you should know everything from the question I asked earlier…”</p>

<p>　I sighed in my mind and started to explain to Ai.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>　I sighed in my mind and started to explain to Ai.</p>

<p>“Well, you mean Kei wants to show off her cooking skills to the boy who took care of her? And for that purpose, she wants to make a bentō and give it to him.”</p>
<p>“That’s about it in a nutshell.”</p>

<p>　After a few minutes of explanation, I succeeded in conveying my purpose while hiding Hondō’s name and some of the past events.</p>

<p>“That’s okay, isn’t it? Why don’t you give it a try? “</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say [why all of a sudden?] earlier?”</p>
<p>“You said it was because you suddenly got a bentō from a boy, right? It would have a very different meaning if Kei had told me something like this earlier.”</p>
<p>“What’s the difference?”</p>
<p>“A handmade bentō from a girl is a boy’s dream! It’s the kind of thing they want to get at any cost! “</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>　 I think Matsuoka said something like that, but I can’t quite figure it out why.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right. And it would be a waste if Kei wanted to do it, but she doesn’t try! Let’s run through our once-in-a-lifetime youth event at full speed! “</p>
<p>“Err, yes…”</p>

<p>　 I can’t hide my bewilderment at Ai’s vigor. I don’t know why Ai is more motivated than I am, but I am glad to hear her positive attitude. However, I still have some concerns.</p>

<p>“Even if I make it, won’t it be hard to give it to him without a reason? “</p>
<p>“You could say it’s a thank you for helping you in the previous cooking class.”</p>

<p>　I see. That’s an idea I hadn’t thought of.</p>

<p>“So, do you already know what you want to cook?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t decided yet.”</p>

<p>　 I would like to include ginger pork, which Hondō said he would be happy to see in the bentō, but the other dish are still undecided.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to start from there. I’m starting to look forward to it.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Eh? Of course I’m going to help Kei make her bentō.”</p>

<p>　Ai looked at me as if to express it’s obvious.</p>

<p>“I can make the bentō by myself.”</p>
<p>“Hey-hey, have you forgotten the story of how you had to depend on that guy during the cooking class? “</p>
<p>“Ughh…”</p>

<p>　It brings back memories of Hondō teaching me how to use a knife many times during cooking class.</p>

<p>“I’m the only one who can help you in the mornings because Mom is probably busy. My support isn’t free of charge, but this time, onē-chan is offering a special service! “</p>
<p>“Don’t talk like a mail-order salesman.”</p>
<p>“My bad, I just couldn’t resist. Anyway, I think your success rate will be totally different with or without my support, don’t you think, Kei? I make sweets in my spare time, I’m sure I can be of some help. “</p>

<p>　Ai may be joking around, but she has much more experience in cooking than I do. If I want to give Hondō a high-quality bentō, I think I have no choice but to rely on her.</p>

<p>“….can you get up early in the morning? “</p>
<p>“That’s no big deal for a sister like this Ai. If Kei says [Please, sis. (Onegai onē-chan)], I’ll help you for days.”</p>
<p>“Who would say such a thing?!”</p>

<p>　I don’t remember ever saying something like that in my life.</p>

<p>“Ehh～. One word, just one word! Please!”</p>

<p>　 Ai rubs her hands together. Maybe she won’t stop until I say it.</p>

<p>“…please, sis… There you go.”</p>
<p>“So cute~! All right, this Onē-chan will go all out for you!”</p>

<p>　I want to disappear. I want to leave here as soon as possible…</p>
<p>　Then even though my motivation has been severely sapped from the get-go, I start preparing to make a bentō with Ai.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>“Hey, isn’t Shimizu-san in an even worse mood today? “</p>
<p>“You think so too? I heard a rumor that she got into a fight with someone from another school and hurt her hand.”</p>
<p>“Ah, maybe you’re right. Shimizu-san dyed her hair black and never skipped class, so I thought she had become more serious, but she was still the same as before.”</p>

<p>　My classmates are whispering about me, but I don’t have the energy to look at them. It’s all because of my homemade bentō.</p>

<p>(This is the worst.)</p>

<p>　The bentō is ready. Ai, who helped me, lost her trademark smile, but it was complete. The problem was the quality.</p>
<p>　The egg omelet turned out to be a mysterious blackened entity, which anyone could not tell whether it was the soy sauce or the burn, and Hondō’s favorite ginger pork turned out to be a blackened entity as well.</p>

<p>　This time, despite Ai’s support, I cut my fingers several times with a knife, and although the wounds were shallow, I made Ai worry about me a lot.</p>
<p>　The finished bentō was not something that I could give to others.</p>
<p>　At first, I wanted to eat the homemade bentō by myself, but Ai, feeling responsible for me, suggested that we split it in half. Thanks to her suggestion, I was able to finish the bentō, but my stomach got a bit queasy.</p>

<p>[To tell the truth, Kei’s cooking skills were more than I had expected.]</p>

<p>　Ai said to me afterward with dead eyes.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Morning.”</p>

<p>　As I recalled today’s morning incident, Hondō sat next to me before I knew it.</p>
<p>　 I know that Hondō is innocent, but I feel my brow subconsciously wrinkled because of my bentō failure this morning.</p>

<p>“Um, Shimizu-san. Did I do something wrong? “</p>

<p>　Perhaps seeing my face, Hondō made a troubled smile at me.</p>

<p>“You didn’t do anything wrong.”</p>

<p>　In fact, Hondō did not do anything to make me angry. I’m angry because of my own problem.</p>

<p>“If that’s the case, did you have any trouble? If you don’t mind, I’ll listen to you?”</p>
<p>” …there’s no problem.”</p>

<p>　Of course I can’t tell him I’m depressed because I made a homemade bentō for him and it didn’t work out.</p>

<p>“Well, okay… Hm? Shimizu-san, you hurt your hand, are you okay? “</p>

<p>　I quickly hid my hand, but it was too late. I was completely careless. I’ll have to think of an excuse…</p>

<p>“…I’ve been going through some stuff. It’s not a deep cut, so don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>“I see. But please take care of yourself.”</p>

<p>　It was a poor excuse, but Hondō seemed to accept it. I felt relieved, but then, I began to feel sleepy perhaps as a reaction to having woken up earlier than usual.</p>

<p>“I’m going to sleep now, so don’t wake me up.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll only wake you up when Sensei almost comes.”</p>
<p>“I told you, you don’t have to wake me up… “</p>

<p>　Usually, we would argue about whether or not to wake me up, but I guess I was mentally exhausted after making bentō from early in the morning, and I let go of my consciousness early today.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>　During the lunch break, I finished my lunch early and had nothing particular to do, so I lay down on my desk.</p>
<p>　I could hear Hondō and Matsuoka talking to each other from the seat next to me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I really wanted to eat Seto-san’s homemade cooking——”</p>
<p>“Toshiya, are you still hung up on what happened during the cooking class?”</p>
<p>“At that time, I thought I had come to terms with it, but wouldn’t every guy want to eat the homemade cooking of a girl he likes?”</p>
<p>“I think the subject is a bit too big, but you’re probably right. It’s rare to have the chance to eat the food made by a girl you like, and I think it will make anyone happy.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　It seems that Hondō is also interested in home-cooked food from the opposite sex. Good, it means I’m making the right effort in the right direction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Right?! I wonder if Seto-san will make homemade Bentō and give it to me… “</p>
<p>“At this point, it’s more of a fantasy rather than an imagination…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 Perhaps because they are close friends, Hondō can sometimes be blunt with Matsuoka.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t care if it’s fantasy or imagination, I’ll definitely make it a reality later!”</p>
<p>“Good luck with that.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I mean, even if it’s not the home-cooked food of someone you like, there’s something nice about someone else’s homemade food.”</p>
<p>“Agreed. It’s good to cook by yourself, but there’s something special about having someone else cook for me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　This is good information. It means they would feel happy to have someone else cook for them, even if it is not from the person they like.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Speaking of which, I was just wondering, when we were talking about love before, did Daiki ever think of making your own Bentō?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 Matsuoka suddenly questioned Hondō.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I thought about it, but in the end, I gave up because I couldn’t get up early in the morning.”</p>
<p>“I see. So you’ll have to rely on the school store for the time being.”</p>
<p>“I guess so. But when we talked about Bentō before, I got a little curious and wanted to try making one if I wake up early next time.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　I was just casually listening to him, and now I’m in big trouble. There is a world of difference in cooking skills between Hondō and me. If Hondō made his own bentō, it would be somewhat difficult for me to give it to him later.</p>
<p>　I had thought that I could give him the Bentō later when I was satisfied with it after some practice, but now I realized that I needed to hurry up and finish the Bentō.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey, Shimizu-san has been in a bad mood for the past week or so, do you know why? “</p>
<p>“I’ve heard a rumor that the scar on her hand is increasing day by day cause she has been fighting with students from other schools every day, there is a theory is that someone has made Shimizu-san upset and some other theories. But I don’t know which one is correct. The only thing I know is that we should never get involved with Shimizu-san in that state.”</p>
<p>“I agree. I’ll be careful too.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　I can feel my classmates gossiping about me in the corner of the classroom, but I don’t have the energy to respond.</p>
<p>　 It’s been a week since I started making Bentō, and to tell the truth, I’m still not satisfied with my Bentō.</p>
<p>　No matter how carefully Ai taught me every morning, my cooking skills did not improve, and even though my mother began to teach me a few days ago, the result remained the same. As I continued to eat the Bentō’s failed dishes day after day, both Ai and I gradually lost heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(I had no idea my cooking skills were this bad…)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　No one had the energy to eat the failed dishes this morning, so I packed them in a Bentō box and brought them for today’s lunch.</p>
<p>　It would be difficult for me and bad for Ai to continue making Bentō any longer. I decided to stop making bentō from today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　At lunchtime, I take out from my bag the Bentō that my mother made and the Bentō that I made myself. I have to eat both of them during my lunch break. I feel like sighing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“…sigh.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　The voice wasn’t mine. I turned toward the voice, and I saw Hondō resting his chin on his hand, looking absent-minded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’s wrong? You got such a gloomy look on your face.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 I was curious and couldn’t help but ask since Hondō rarely sighed like that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ah, sorry, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“No need to be sorry, but what’s going on? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　Since I took the initiative to talk to him, I wanted to at least know the reason for his sigh.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>　Since I took the initiative to talk to him, I wanted to at least know the reason for his sigh.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, I forgot something today.”</p>
<p>“What did you forget? “</p>
<p>“My wallet. Thanks to that, I couldn’t buy lunch. I was wondering what I should do.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　Indeed, looking at Hondō’s desk, there is no bread, which he usually eats during lunch break. But if that’s the only problem, the solution is simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If it’s just a matter of money, why don’t you borrow some from Matsuoka? He can at least lend you some money for lunch.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　Matsuoka should be the first person Hondō would turn to in this situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s true. Toshiya would have lent me the money if he was around, but he’s away during the lunch break because there is a soccer club meeting today. I wish I could have realized that I had forgotten my wallet before Toshiya left.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　I looked around the classroom, and Matsuoka was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, there’s nothing I can do about it, I guess I won’t have lunch today. I’m sorry for worrying you, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“I’m not worried about you.”</p>
<p>“That’s good then.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　The conversation was interrupted. As a high school boy, Hondō probably had a big appetite, and it must be tough for him to skip lunch. I thought about it while looking at my own desk, and there were two bento boxes there. Yes, that’s right, I have two Bentō today. This is an unexpected opportunity for me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey, Hondō.”</p>
<p>What’s wrong? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 Hondō turned his gaze again towards me. Without making eye contact, I placed a Bentō on Hondō’s desk.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><img src="../Images/0012_s9-1.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/s9-1.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p>“Shimizu-san, what is this bento for?”</p>
<p>“…take it.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I mean, I’m giving you this Bentō.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 Hondō seemed to want to ask why.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I appreciate it, but then you won’t have a Bentō.”</p>
<p>“I have another one for me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　I pointed at the other Bentō on my desk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ah, that’s true. Then, whose Bentō is this?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter whose it is… Look, I’m only giving you this because I want to repay you for taking care of me during cooking class. Besides, I can’t finish two bentos by myself, so you don’t have to worry about it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 A question mark floats over Hondō’s head. I guess he doesn’t understand why I have two Bentō. I can’t tell him that I brought a failed handmade Bentō that I wanted to give you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If there is one for Shimizu-san, then okay. Thank you very much, I’ll gladly accept it.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　Hondō did not seem completely convinced, but when he saw that I had another one, he decided to take the Bentō.</p>
<p>　Then I realized. Who made the Bentō that I gave Hondō?</p>
<p>　Both the Bentō I made and the Bentō my mother made for me were the same shape and color, and without looking inside, I could not tell which Bentō it was. Therefore, I couldn’t determine which bento I gave to Hondō.</p>
<p>　While I was panicking, I saw Hondō was about to open the Bentō.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t see other people’s Bentō very often, so this is exciting.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　He casually checks the contents of the Bentō from the side. The Bentō I gave Hondō was definitely the one I had made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(…it’s all over now.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　I thought I heard my heart snap. My blackened mass dishes were now perfectly in Hondō’s sight.</p>
<p>　I was tempted to take the Bentō away from Hondō immediately, but my remaining speck of rationality held me back. It wouldn’t be appropriate to give it to him and then immediately take it back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can I try it immediately, Shimizu-san? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　Hondō called out to me, unaware of my internal struggle. Even now, I want to ask him to swap Bentō, but at the same time, I also want him to eat my cooking. Two factions are fighting in my brain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>” …yes. “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　In the end, I decided to let him eat the Bentō I made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you. Then, Itadakimasu.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 Hondō picked up his chopsticks, undaunted by the disastrous black color of the dishes. After a few moments of deliberation, he reached for the black tamagoyaki that I had been making every day for the past week and brought it into his mouth.</p>
<p>　 I looked at Hondō’s face but I did not see any significant change. That’s strange, because this is one of the most dreadful dishes that could steal my family member’s smile.</p>
<p>　As I was staring at him, Hondō turned his head toward me, perhaps sensing my gaze.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Did you want to try this Bentō too? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　I wondered if Hondō thought I was a person who liked to eat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, I was just wondering what dish you would start with.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, people said that how someone starts eating their bentō can show their personality. I kind of started with the tamagoyaki first.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　To my astonishment, Hondō seemed to recognize the blackened mass as a tamagoyaki before eating it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ve never had tamagoyaki made by someone other than my family, but this tamagoyaki has an interesting flavor.”</p>
<p>“You say it’s interesting, is that what you think of that food? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　Well, I guess it’s better than being told it’s bad, or he forced himself to tell me it’s good.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sorry, maybe I shouldn’t have? It was a tamagoyaki with a taste I’d never had before, so I didn’t know how to describe it.</p>
<p>” …it’s fine.”</p>
<p>“I’ll let you know if I can think of another way to describe it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　With that, Hondō resumed eating. As I ate the bentō my mother had prepared for me, I glanced sideways to check on Hondō.</p>
<p>　 The next dish Hondō chose was ginger pork, another dish I have been trying every morning for the past week. Although there are other dishes in his bentō that I feel turned out better, why did he prioritize eating the ones that I thought I didn’t do particularly well?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(At least eat the other dishes until I’m mentally prepared…)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Err, Shimizu-san? It’s hard for me to eat with you staring at me like that.</p>
<p>“Hondō, are you okay? Are you forcing yourself to eat that? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　I just said what I was thinking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m a little scared of that question. Does this ginger pork have any seasonings that you normally don’t put in? “</p>
<p>“I didn’t put anything like that but… I mean, Hondō, did you really feel nothing after eating that ginger pork? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　When Ai tasted it for the first time, she told me that ginger pork could express despair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t know. I like ginger pork, so I ate it with anticipation… “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　As I have heard before, Hondō seems to have been a ginger pork lover. But that’s not the answer I want to hear now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you don’t like it, you can say it tastes bad.”</p>
<p>“Why? I wouldn’t say that. Especially after you gave me the bentō you made, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“You, why did you think I made it…? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　Since I did not say that I made the Bentō before, anyone would think that my parents made it. I wonder where Hondō got the idea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Because Shimizu-san, when I asked you if there was anything in the ginger pork, you assured me there was not, right? I thought this was something Shimizu-san wouldn’t have said if she wasn’t making this ginger pork.”</p>
<p>“But that’s not enough evidence, is it?”</p>
<p>“Also, you said earlier that it’s okay to say it’s bad if I think it’s bad. I don’t think Shimizu-san would have said that if she didn’t make it herself.”</p>
<p>“Ughh… “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　I want to make excuses, but I have a feeling that a bad lie will be exposed immediately.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I guess I’m right. Anyway, a Bentō that you worked so hard to make, are you sure you’re okay with me eating it, Shimizu-san? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　What should I do? Should I just tell him the truth? I made that Bentō because I wanted Hondō to eat it, and I’m glad you ate it… No. Just the thought of saying it makes me want to disappear in embarrassment. Silence fell between Hondō and me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Shimizu-san? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　Hondō breaks the silence, perhaps feeling puzzled about my lack of response.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“…worry.”</p>
<p>“What? “</p>
<p>“I said don’t worry about it. That Bentō was just something I wanted to make on a whim. And I gave it to you because I didn’t think I could eat it all by myself today. “</p>
<p>“Is it a whim to keep cooking for a week? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 Hondō hits a sore spot. I think he was just expressing his doubts, but it made me wonder if I unintentionally said something important.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How did you know I’ve been making Bentō for a week…? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　I hurriedly tried to cut my words off mid-sentence. But Hondō seemed to already know the answer. Hondō points to my hand covered in band-aids.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You put that band-aid on your hand because you injured your finger when you cooked, right? At first, I didn’t understand why you were injured, but after seeing today’s Bentō, I finally understood.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 Hondō, unlike the rest of my classmates, did not think I had been injured in the fight.</p>
<p>　——An indescribable, itchy feeling growing inside of me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Shimizu-san? Hey? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　I was so shaken by Hondō’s words I had abandoned the thought of explaining the reason why I’d been making bentos for a week. I hurriedly tried to think, but nothing came to mind immediately. I decided to push my way through with momentum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“…it doesn’t matter when I started making Bentō. A-anyway, there’s no specific reason why I gave you that Bentō! Got it?! “</p>
<p>“Um, okay. Well then, it’s fine if Shimizu-san says so.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 Hondō seems to have decided not to pursue the matter any further.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you understand, then eat it quickly.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Thank you very much.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　After that, Hondō continued to eat the bentō silently and eventually finished it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you very much for the food.”</p>
<p>” …Give me the Bentō box when you’re done.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 I reached toward Hondō and urged him to hand over the Bentō box.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’d like to wash it and return it later. “</p>
<p>“I told you it’s because I can’t eat two Bentō all by myself, and this Bentō was a thank you for the cooking class. Of course I’ll be doing you a favor to the end.”</p>
<p>“…Okay. Shimizu-san, thank you again for the food.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　With that, Hondō handed me the package containing the Bentō box.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>” …yes. “</p>
<p>“And—Can I say one more thing? “</p>
<p>“W-what is it?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　I slightly tensed up when he asked me something like this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m really grateful for the bentō today. I forgot my wallet and was in real trouble, so it was a big help for me. I was happy to have the bentō that Shimizu-san made. Next time, I’ll do something for you as thanks.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　——I was happy… I was happy… I was happy…</p>
<p>　The words play over and over in my head. I felt that Hondō had affirmed that the hard, grueling, and hellish week up to today had not been in vain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you okay, Shimizu-san? “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 Hondō’s words brought me to my senses. It seemed that I had been so moved that my consciousness had wandered far away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No need to thank me… just… “</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“If I ever make Bentō again on a whim, eat it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　 Hondō looked surprised for a moment, then quickly returned to smiling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes. Then, I’ll be looking forward to it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>　Inside my heart, I did a fist pump (Victory gesture).</p>
