<h2>Chapter 8: Shimizu-san and the Shared Umbrella</h2>


<p>“Something came up? “</p>
<p>“Yeah, I made plans to hang out with my friend after the phone call earlier.”</p>

<p>After leaving the game center, the three of us took a break at the food court inside the shopping mall.</p>
<p>The three of us had a drink that we had just bought in front of us.</p>

<p>“If that’s the case, is it okay for you to linger around?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. According to our conversation, we’ll meet up here in a little while.”</p>
<p>“Alright, does that mean we’ll part ways here today?”</p>

<p>That’s the way it should be. I’m worried that Teruno might get tired of waiting since I ended up staying here longer than planned due to meeting the Shimizu sisters, but I’m sure she’ll understand if I explain it to her.</p>

<p>“I might be, but you guys are different.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Yes? “</p>
<p>“Since we had fun hanging out together, just go home together!”</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>“You didn’t have to go home with me.”</p>
<p>“Well, I was planning to head back as soon as my business was done.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san and I were on the train after talking at the food court for a while.</p>
<p>In the end, Ai-san went to hang out with her friend while Shimizu-san and I headed home.</p>
<p>Ai-san told me the general location of Shimizu-san’s house, and it turns out that my house and Shimizu-san’s house are relatively close.</p>

<p>“Did Shimizu-san not have anything else to do?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t. I don’t like crowded places to begin with. “</p>
<p>“Then, did you only come to the mall because Ai-san invited you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, when she asked if I had any plans, I said no, and then she said, ‘Let’s go buy clothes together,’ so I got dragged along.”</p>
<p>“I see, so that’s what happened.”</p>

<p>Ai-san certainly gives the impression of someone lively enough to do something like that.</p>

<p>“She’s always so pushy.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san sighed. It is rare to see Shimizu-san being pushed around by someone.</p>

<p>“You two seem very close.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san had a look of discontent.</p>

<p>“Well, since you’re always together, I guess most people would assume that. Isn’t that a sign of you two being close?”</p>
<p>“She comes to my room without my permission though.”</p>
<p>“It means Ai-san really likes you, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Say whatever you want.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san turned away. It seems she’s given up trying to argue with me.</p>

<p>“By the way, didn’t you have a younger sister?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I do.”</p>
<p>“How is it between you and your sister?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know much about other siblings, so I can’t say for sure, but I think we’re pretty close. We play games and watch anime together.”</p>
<p>“You have no complaints? “</p>

<p>Complaints about Teruno?</p>
<p>There are some minor things, like her dislike for vegetables and being lazy, but overall…</p>

<p>“I guess she can be a bit selfish at times, and that’s my only worry.”</p>
<p>“So even you have things you worry about with your family.”</p>
<p>“I’m not that unhappy about it, but there’s a possibility that Teruno herself might face difficulties in the future.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“If she relies too much on me, she might have a hard time when I’m not around anymore due to going to college or finding a job.”</p>

<p>For now, I’m taking care of cooking and other household chores until our parents come back, so it’s fine. But I can’t imagine Teruno doing the housework if I’m no longer here.</p>

<p>“In the end, it’s about worrying for your sister. Are you a bit of a siscon?”</p>
<p>“Well…everyone who has a sister worries about her more or less, probably?”</p>

<p>I feel like I’m making a bad excuse by exaggerating the subject, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with what I said.</p>

<p>“That’s an exaggeration. At least Ai is never worried about me.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true. Ai-san must be worried sometimes about Shimizu-san too.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>I can’t say it’s because I talked about it with Ai-san at a family restaurant when Shimizu-san wasn’t there…</p>
<p>Besides, Ai-san seemed to want to keep that conversation a secret.</p>

<p>“I guess I have a hunch because we are the same, having a younger sister.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san looks at me with a bewildered expression.</p>
<p>I think it’s natural because it was a reason that even I didn’t fully understand.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I think Ai-san is always thinking about Shimizu-san, too. “</p>
<p>” …well, if you insist so much, let’s leave it at that.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san doesn’t seem convinced, but it seems like she understands what I’m saying.</p>

<p>“By the way, I met Ai-san for the first time today, but she’s a very kind onē-san, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Is it? She’s just doing what she wants to do.”</p>

<p>Maybe because she’s her family, Shimizu-san seems to have a strict evaluation of Ai-san.</p>

<p>“I do feel that she is faithful to her own desires, but I think she also pays attention to those around her. She was very easy to talk to even though I had never met her before, and the conversation was interesting and enjoyable.”</p>
<p>“…Muu.”</p>

<p>Huh, why does Shimizu-san seem slightly dissatisfied?</p>

<p>“Ai is much more inappropriate at home, you know.”</p>
<p>“Maybe she doesn’t have to worry about anything at home.”</p>
<p>“…She’s always fussing about how she doesn’t understand something before exams.”</p>
<p>“I see, she’s studying hard before the exams.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, Shimizu-san starts exposing things about Ai-san.</p>
<p>Is this payback for Ai-san exposing old memories at the family restaurant?</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, why are you telling me about Ai-san’s shortcomings?”</p>
<p>“Because… you keep praising Ai… “</p>

<p>I don’t know why, but it seems that Shimizu-san doesn’t like it when only Ai-san is praised. In that case, I’ve decided what to do.</p>

<p>“If that’s the case, what would you like to be praised for, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What is this all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san doesn’t like it when only Ai-san gets praised, right? If that’s the case, I thought it would be better to praise Shimizu-san too.”</p>

<p>I think it’s a good idea. It feels good to compliment someone and the person being praised would feel better too.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about? I don’t want it. Besides, there’s nothing to praise me for.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s self-evaluation seems lower than I thought. It seems like I need to tell Shimizu-san about her good points.</p>

<p>“That’s not true. I will tell you what I think is good about Shimizu-san. First of all, you’re kind. Shimizu-san took the initiative to help me when I was the only one in charge of cutting the ingredients in the last cooking class. I think I told you that at that time, but it made me happy. Second, you’re hardworking. When you gave me bentō before, you were practicing cooking so hard that you had to wrap your fingers in band-aids. I admire that kind of effort. Third——”</p>
<p>“Stop.”</p>
<p>“Err, why? I’m just getting started. “</p>
<p>“Too much, I’ve heard enough.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san hides her mouth with a teddy bear plush, making it impossible for me to read her expression.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to be reserved because there’s still plenty of things I want to say.”</p>
<p>“I’m not being reserved. Just be quiet until we get to the station.”</p>

<p>When I looked closer at Shimizu-san, I noticed that her ears seemed to have turned slightly red.</p>
<p>She seemed to be embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Well, okay.”</p>

<p>From then on, Shimizu-san and I sat silently in our seats without speaking until we reached the nearest station.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“It’s raining, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>Just as we were about to leave the station, the rain began to fall.</p>
<p>The rain, which started out as a light drizzle, gradually increased in intensity and soon turned into a downpour.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, do you have an umbrella? “</p>
<p>“I didn’t bring one. Did you?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I brought a folding umbrella.”</p>

<p>I took out the folding umbrella from my shoulder bag and showed it to Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“If you have one, that’s good. I guess we’ll part ways here today.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine with that, but what about you, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“I’ll call my parents.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Shimizu-san took out her smartphone from her bag and showed it to me.</p>

<p>“In that case, I guess you’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, so hurry up and go.”</p>
<p>“Got it. See you at school then.”</p>
<p>“See you.”</p>

<p>I turned my back to Shimizu-san and left the station.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>(…What should I do?)</p>

<p>After some time had passed since Hondō left, I stayed in the station and gazed at the rainy sky.</p>
<p>I told Hondō I would call my parents, but they had gone out today and would not return until tonight.</p>
<p>I don’t know if Ai has an umbrella, and I didn’t want to interfere with her time with her friends in the first place.</p>
<p>The only thing I could do was to go home by myself, but the rain only intensified and showed no signs of stopping.</p>

<p>I’m at a complete loss.</p>
<p>I would be likely to catch a cold if I were to run home in this rain without an umbrella, and more importantly, my dress and the plush would get wet.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, I realized that I prioritized the condition of my dress and the plush over my own well-being and was taken aback.</p>

<p>(What am I thinking…)</p>

<p>Just because I was praised for my clothes once by him.</p>
<p>He had praised Ai, and he had also complimented the other clothes I wore.</p>
<p>But there was something different about his face when he praised this dress, somehow… he seemed to be captivated by it.</p>

<p>I shook my head from side to side. There was no way that person would react like that.</p>
<p>That dense guy would never notice my feelings, no matter how much I tried to appeal to him.</p>

<p>However, it doesn’t mean that he was completely unresponsive, he did notice a few things…</p>
<p>I shook my head from side to side once again. I didn’t care about that person’s reaction.</p>
<p>Besides, what about this plush? It was just an ordinary teddy bear plush that you could find anywhere. But this one feels special, as it was something that he had chosen for me…</p>

<p>“…Shimizu-san “</p>

<p>I must have been thinking about him too much that I even heard an auditory hallucination. Was I really this weak?</p>
<p>Since becoming a high school student, I have tried to keep people away and not show my weaknesses. And yet, that person was by my side, slowly making me more vulnerable little by little.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san ? “</p>

<p>A face appeared in front of me.</p>

<p>“Ah?!”</p>

<p>Caught off guard by the suddenness of it, I let out a not-so-pretty sound and jumped back.</p>
<p>Hondō stood holding an umbrella in front of me as if it were natural.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>“Hondō, why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Why? Because I turned back on my way back home. “</p>
<p>“I’m asking why you came back.”</p>
<p>“No particular reason, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san looked at me as if she couldn’t understand me.</p>
<p>Well, I think that reaction is understandable.</p>

<p>“I had a feeling that Shimizu-san was still here. I thought so when I was on my way home. Shimizu-san is so nice to me, maybe Shimizu-san lied to make it easier for me to go back home.”</p>
<p>“What were you planning to do if I had just gone back normally?”</p>
<p>“Then I would have thought I was overthinking and gone back again.”</p>
<p>“You…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s face seemed exasperated, and she appeared to be pondering about something.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a good thing Shimizu-san was here. If you’re here means you have no way to get home, right? “</p>
<p>“…yes. Do you have a solution for that? “</p>
<p>“Well… about that.”</p>
<p>“Why do you suddenly sound hesitant?”</p>
<p>“You can use my umbrella.”</p>
<p>“Huh? “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s reaction was not much different from what I had expected.</p>

<p>“I looked at the nearby convenience store, but they were sold out of vinyl umbrellas. So I only have one umbrella for you.”</p>
<p>“Then what about you? How are you going to get back?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, maybe I’ll ask Teruno to pick me up.”</p>

<p>Even though Teruno is not fond of going out, I’m sure she would come to help me if I’m in trouble.</p>

<p>“…Half.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Can you lend me half of it?”</p>
<p>“You mean sharing the umbrella?”</p>
<p>“Don’t bother rephrasing it! So, what do you say?”</p>
<p>“Is Shimizu-san okay with that?”</p>
<p>“It’s strange for you to have an umbrella and not use it. But I don’t want to get my dress or plush toys wet in the rain. So… please let me put them in your umbrella.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san told me in a strained voice.</p>

<p>“Alright, in that case, can you get under the umbrella?”</p>
<p>“O-Okay.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san hesitantly entered under my umbrella. Thus, Shimizu-san and I started moving toward our home from the station.</p>

<p>“The rain won’t stop, huh?”</p>
<p>” …I guess so.”</p>

<p>A few minutes after leaving the station, we walked quietly under the rainy sky.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, am I walking too fast? “</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“That’s good then.”</p>

<p>The conversation stopped. I wonder how we were able to talk normally before.</p>
<p>It’s not a common experience for me, so I don’t know what to do either.</p>

<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“What is it, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“Come closer to me.”</p>
<p>“What’s going on all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“Your shoulder is wet. You’ll catch a cold.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san seems concerned about the side opposite to the one holding the umbrella.</p>

<p>“Just a little wet, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to catch a cold while you’re lending me an umbrella. Come closer.”</p>
<p>“Is it okay if it’s a little cramped? “</p>

<p>This umbrella is not that big since it is a folding umbrella.</p>
<p>To avoid getting wet, maybe we need to get close enough that our shoulders would touch.</p>

<p>” …it’s fine. So come over here.”</p>

<p>If Shimizu-san says so, there’s no reason to refuse.</p>
<p>I moved closer to Shimizu-san until our shoulders were almost touching.</p>

<p>“T-that’s good enough.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“It’s your umbrella, so there’s no need to thank me.”</p>
<p>“Fufu.”</p>
<p>“What are you laughing?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san glared at me. Oops, I accidentally laughed.</p>

<p>“I just thought that Shimizu-san was really nice.”</p>
<p>“What? What’s this all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. Just something I thought.”</p>
<p>“If you say it like that, you’re so much better than me because you came back to the station for me even though you’re not even sure I’m there.”</p>
<p>“Somehow… I’m just doing it to make sure I don’t regret anything.”</p>
<p>“You’ve said that before, but what does it mean? Is there a reason for that?”</p>

<p>Hmm, have I said that to Shimizu-san before? I don’t remember.</p>

<p>“It’s not a big reason, but I had a small regret in the past, I just don’t want to feel that anymore.”</p>
<p>“…What happened?”</p>

<p>I didn’t expect Shimizu-san to be interested. I hesitate to speak, but I guess it’s not something to hide.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“It’s a story from when I was little. I had a friend named Yu-kun. I didn’t know where he was from, but he was always at the park. We played together, and before I knew it, Yu-kun and I became close friends.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san quietly listens to my story.</p>

<p>“We played at the nearby park every day, but after about a year, older kids started coming to the park…”</p>
<p>“And then?”</p>
<p>“They started teasing me and Yu-kun. I ignored them, and Yu-kun didn’t react to them, so I thought Yu-kun didn’t mind either. But I was wrong. After an incident, Yu-kun suddenly stopped coming to the park.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san didn’t say anything. She seems to be waiting for me to tell her the rest of the story.</p>

<p>“After that, no matter how many times I went to the park, Yu-kun wasn’t there. I regretted it so much at the time. I thought if I had told them to stop teasing us, maybe Yu-kun wouldn’t have disappeared. Since then, I’ve been trying not to have any regrets.”</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem like a big story when I finish telling it.</p>
<p>It’s not an exciting or amusing story either.</p>
<p>Neither Shimizu-san nor I say anything more, and only the sound of rain can be heard.</p>

<p>“…sorry.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san was the first to open her mouth.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect to be apologized to, so I couldn’t come up with a proper response.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s something you don’t want to remember.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san seems to be concerned about reminding me of a bitter memory.</p>

<p>“True, it was sad that we couldn’t meet anymore, but there were many happy memories with Yu-kun. I don’t dislike remembering them that much.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you forcing yourself?”</p>
<p>“I’m really fine. Besides, I was happy.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean happy?”</p>
<p>“I’m happy that Shimizu-san showed interest in me.”</p>
<p>“Ughh…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san tries to keep a distance from me, so I hurriedly move to avoid her getting wet.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, don’t suddenly move like that.”</p>
<p>“T-that’s because you suddenly said something weird like that!”</p>

<p>I didn’t mean to say anything weird. Maybe I didn’t use the right words.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s just that I often talk to Shimizu-san, but it’s not often that Shimizu-san asks me questions. So when you ask me about myself like now, it makes me happy because it feels like we’re getting a little closer, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“…Are you really happy about getting closer to someone like me?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san muttered quietly.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m happy.”</p>
<p>“Ha? But why?”</p>
<p>“Well, because it’s fun being with Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Fun being with me…”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Shimizu-san is always fun to talk to. “</p>
<p>“…You’re a strange person.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san lowered her face, and I couldn’t see her expression.</p>

<p>“Is that so? Shimizu-san is a good listener and interesting to talk to, so I feel like other people would also enjoy talking to you.”</p>
<p>“You’re the only one who thinks like that.”</p>
<p>“Is it? By the way, Shimizu-san, your ears have been a little red since earlier. Are you okay? Is it because of the cold?”</p>
<p>“What? It’s not red at all.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san reflexively turns toward me.</p>

<p>“Ah, your face is also a little red. Are you sure it’s not because you’re cold?”</p>
<p>“It’s not. It’s your misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, then it’s fine.”</p>

<p>I was worried it might be cold symptoms.</p>

<p>“Then Shimizu-san, are you feeling nervous about something?”</p>
<p>“Why should I be nervous?”</p>
<p>“I mean, there are people whose face turns red when they get nervous, so I wondered if Shimizu-san might be like that too.”</p>
<p>“I-I’m not!”</p>

<p>It seems it’s not because of nervousness either.</p>
<p>If so, was it just my misunderstanding that her face looked redder than usual?</p>

<p>“Aren’t you the one who seems nervous?”</p>

<p>I guess it’s my turn to be suspected. I try to think if I’m feeling nervous.</p>

<p>“…Maybe.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘maybe’? What are you nervous about?”</p>
<p>“Uh? I’m nervous about sharing an umbrella together?”</p>
<p>“Ha? …Haa???”</p>

<p>In the gap between [Ha?] and [Haa?], Shimizu-san’s expression changed drastically</p>
<p>It changed from an expression that seemed to say, [What are you talking about?] to an expression that seemed to say, [So you were thinking something like that!?].</p>

<p>“I don’t think I said anything weird.”</p>
<p>“Just a moment ago, you were completely calm.”</p>
<p>“Is it? Maybe I’m the type whose thoughts don’t show on my face.”</p>
<p>“But still…”</p>

<p>I didn’t realize it myself, but maybe I have a poker face.</p>

<p>“It’s true that I was nervous.”</p>
<p>“R-really? What were you thinking right now?”</p>
<p>“Are you going to be repulsed if I tell you?”</p>
<p>“Depends on what you’re talking about.”</p>

<p>That may be true, but I don’t want to say it and have her be repulsed.</p>
<p>As I think something like that, Shimizu-san lets out a small sigh.</p>

<p>“…okay. I’ll make an effort not to. So, what were you thinking?”</p>
<p>“Normally, I wouldn’t get this close to Shimizu-san, so I feel a little excited.”</p>
<p>“Y-you…!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san quickly tries to distance herself again from me, and I quickly move while still holding the umbrella.</p>

<p>“I already told you not to move suddenly Shimizu-san! And you said you wouldn’t be repulsed!”</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0027_s25.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/s25.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>“I just said I would make an effort! Also… if you said something like that…”</p>

<p>She said the latter part in a somewhat muffled voice, and it was a little difficult to hear.</p>

<p>“How about you, Shimizu-san? Have you ever shared an umbrella with someone before?”</p>
<p>“For me, it’s either getting wet together or lending an extra umbrella if someone has one.”</p>
<p>“Ai-san doesn’t seem to have an umbrella.”</p>
<p>“Even when it’s raining, that person probably doesn’t carry an umbrella.”</p>
<p>“Ahaha.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>It’s easy to imagine Ai-san dashing through the rain without an umbrella.</p>

<p>“In that case, Ai-san won’t be able to go home while it’s raining.”</p>
<p>“Well, hopefully the rain will stop before Ai returns.”</p>
<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p>The conversation falls silent again.</p>
<p>The sound of rain I hear seems slightly weaker than before.</p>

<p>“But it was unfortunate, by the way. If it weren’t for Ai, we could have gotten home before the rain started.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? I’m glad I could meet Shimizu-san and her today, though.”</p>
<p>“Why? “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san seems to not understand the reason.</p>
<p>It’s not that hard to figure out.</p>

<p>“It’s because I got to meet Shimizu-san’s sides that I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>“A Shimizu-san who gets along with Ai-san, a Shimizu-san who is engrossed in games, it’s Shimizu-san’s sides that I never see in school. I’m happy to see a different side of you.”</p>
<p>“S-stop!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s face became even redder than before. She seemed to realize it and turned her face away from me.</p>

<p>“…it’s fine now. “</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san? “</p>
<p>“I don’t need the umbrella anymore.”</p>
<p>“But it’s still raining…”</p>

<p>As I was about to say that, I noticed that the sound of rain had stopped.</p>
<p>When I looked up, the sunlight was peering through the gaps in the clouds.</p>

<p>“The rain has stopped, so we don’t need the umbrella anymore.”</p>
<p>“But it might start raining again… Ah, Shimizu-san?”</p>

<p>When I looked to the side, Shimizu-san wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Looking around, I saw Shimizu-san a few meters away, and her figure was gradually getting smaller.</p>
<p>It seems she decided to run back before the rain started again.</p>

<p>“See you later at school, Shimizu-san!”</p>

<p>I shouted to Shimizu-san, who was now too far away to hear me.</p>
