<h2>Chapter 5: Encounter with the Shimizu Sisters</h2>


<p>“I have a mission for Onī-chan today.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span>
<p>“What’s wrong, Teruno?”</p>

<p>On holiday, as I was returning to my room after breakfast, I found my sister Teruno standing in front of my room with her arms crossed.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear what I said? I have a mission for you.”</p>
<p>“You mean you want me to do something for you? “</p>
<p>“You’re very perceptive. That’s right.”</p>

<p>Teruno nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>“So what do you want me to do? “</p>
<p>“Thank you for asking. I want Onī-chan to go to the shopping mall.”</p>
<p>“The shopping mall?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I want you to go there and pick up the game I had reserved.”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>When I asked what she wanted me to do, it wasn’t a particularly difficult request. The only question I had was.</p>

<p>“That’s fine, but aren’t you coming with me, Teruno? “</p>
<p>“Well… um, I have exams to study for…”</p>

<p>Teruno’s eyes wander around. Perhaps studying for exams was just an excuse, and she actually didn’t want to go to a crowded place during the holiday. I know that Teruno has such a tendency to be unsociable.</p>
<p>When I look at Teruno again, I see that she has an anxious look on her face. It seems that she knows that her true feelings have been exposed to me. Now, what should I do?</p>

<p>“Okay. I’ll go. Can you tell me the information I need to pick up the game?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Thank you, Onī-chan!”</p>

<p>Teruno nodded happily. Maybe I’m indulging Teruno a little too much, but I just couldn’t refuse my sister’s selfish request.</p>
<p>After getting detailed information from Teruno, I prepared myself and left the house.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>“I’m glad I was able to safely buy it.”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>About an hour after I left home, I successfully completed the given mitzvah.</p>
<p>There were no major problems, and I was able to smoothly pick up the game Teruno had reserved at the electronics store. The game came with a limited edition bonus, and it seemed like Teruno had reserved it because she wanted that bonus.</p>
<p>Since I didn’t particularly want anything today, I was thinking of just heading back home. However, I unexpectedly spotted someone.</p>

<p>“Oh, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“…Hondō? What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>When I called out, the person was indeed Shimizu-san.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>Shimizu-san was wearing a navy jacket over a white shirt and jeans. I had never met Shimizu-san outside the school before, so it was refreshing to see her in her casual clothes.</p>

<p>“I knew it, it was Shimizu-san. Is Shimizu-san shopping, too? “</p>
<p>“Yeah, what about you――”</p>
<p>“Hondō? Are you that Daiki Hondō? Wait, really? Is it the real one?”</p>

<p>When I asked a question, a person I was not aware of called me by name. I turned my eyes in the direction of the voice and saw a woman a little shorter than Shimizu-san standing there. She had slightly brownish shoulder-length hair, a light blue V-neck knit top, and a long white skirt. From her appearance, she appeared to be the same age as me or slightly older.</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0016_s15.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/s15.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Not an image from the chapter)</p>

<p>“I am indeed Daiki Hondō, but I am sorry, who are you?”</p>
<p>“What? Don’t you know me? “</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… I don’t know you at all.”</p>

<p>“From her reaction, I guess she is the same age or older than me, but I have no idea who she is.</p>

<p>“Ai, aren’t you a bit overshadowed? (not well-known) “</p>
<p>“Well, maybe. Anyway, let’s go somewhere brighter.”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to make your shadow physically darker.”</p>

<p>From Shimizu-san’s light-hearted banter, it seemed that the woman called Ai had a close relationship with Shimizu-san. I replay the past conversations with Shimizu-san in my brain. Then I remembered something.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>

<p>“Could you be Shimizu-san’s older sister?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you actually knew about me. Yes, I am. I am Shimizu Kei’s sister, Shimizu Ai. Please feel free to call me Ai.”</p>
<p>“Okay, nice to meet you. Ai-san. “</p>

<p>I had heard from Shimizu-san before that she had an older sister, but I didn’t recognize her because the atmosphere was so different from her.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>“By the way, Ai is the vice president of the student council of our high school.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really?”</p>

<p>I look at Ai-san. Ai-san noticed my gaze and winked at me for some reason.</p>

<p>“Yes, not only am I Kei’s older sister, but also the vice president of the Hyper Ultra Student Council of your high school.” (haipāur utora, hyper ultra)</p>
<p>“Don’t unnecessarily use foreign words.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san quipped with a look of exasperation on her face.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>“Well, isn’t it catchy? Anyway, forget about that. So, what are you doing here, Daiki-kun? “</p>
<p>“My sister asked me to do some shopping for her.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so you have a sister. Are you going to do the shopping now?”</p>
<p>“No, I’ve already finished shopping.”</p>

<p>I showed Ai-san the bag of games I was carrying.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>“I see. Daiki-kun, do you have any plans for the rest of the day?”</p>
<p>“I was going to leave now that I’ve finished my business.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>“In that case, why don’t you come with us?”</p>
<p>“Yes? “</p>

<p>The invitation is so sudden, and my mind can’t keep up with her.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>
<p>“Hey, what are you saying on your own, Ai?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san joined the conversation after hearing Ai’s sudden invitation.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>“Because I want to talk with Daiki-kun. It seems Daiki-kun has some time, so it’s fine, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s bothersome for Hondō if you suddenly invited him like that.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san meets my gaze. I feel like she’s subtly telling me to decline.</p>

<p>“It’s not a problem, right, Daiki-kun?”</p>

<p>Ai-san also looked at me. I feel like she’s subtly telling me to accept.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>

<p>“Well, um…”</p>

<p>I thought I was someone who didn’t hesitate much when making choices, but this dilemma is extremely difficult. Whichever option I choose, I have a feeling that the other one will say something to me later.</p>

<p>“Hondō”</p>
<p>“Daiki-kun”</p>

<p>Time seems to be running out. Then I made up my mind.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>“I’m glad it wasn’t too crowded.”</p>

<p>The Shimizu sisters and I were at a family restaurant in a shopping mall. Perhaps because there was still some time before lunch, we were able to sit down without waiting in line.</p>
<p>Shimizu-san and Ai-san were sitting next to each other, and Shimizu-san and I were facing each other.</p>
<p>In the end, I decided to accompany the Shimizu sisters for shopping. Partly because Ai-san is older than me and partly because I thought that Shimizu-san would forgive me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Since we are here, let’s have lunch a little early. I’ll have a cheese hamburger steak.”</p>
<p>“I’ll have mentaiko pasta (cod roe).”</p>
<p>“What? Kei, why don’t you order your usual pancakes?”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san always orders pancakes at a family restaurant? I’m slightly surprised by that, and as I’m thinking this, our eyes meet.</p>
<p>She glares at me――</p>

<p>“Is there something you want to say to me?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t. Pancakes are delicious, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“Yes-yes, pancakes are good. Kei, are you sure you want mentaiko pasta?”</p>
<p>” …I’ll have Pancakes.”</p>
<p>“Okay, pancakes it is. What do you want, Daiki-kun? “</p>

<p>Oh, right. I completely forgot to order mine. I hurry to look at the menu.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have carbonara, then.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Got it.”</p>

<p>Ai-san called the waiter and placed the order for the three of us. While we were waiting for our food to arrive, Ai-san started asking me questions.</p>

<p>“How many siblings does Daiki-kun have?”</p>
<p>“It’s just me and my younger sister.”</p>
<p>“You mentioned your sister earlier. What’s her name?”</p>
<p>“Her name is Teruno, spelled with the character for ‘no(乃)’ from Nogizaka(乃木坂).”</p>
<p>“That’s a nice name. Teruno, is she cute? “</p>
<p>“She’s my family, so I may be biased, but I think she’s cute.”</p>
<p>“I see. Compared to Kei, who do you think is cuter?”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san interjected reflexively. Ai-san might enjoy teasing people. Hmm, how should I answer her?</p>

<p>“Well, in my opinion, Shimizu-san gives more of a beautiful image rather than cute.”</p>

<p>This is not exactly an answer to the question, but it is the only way to answer it in a way that is not a lie.</p>
<p>I casually looked at Shimizu-san, but she turned away from me, and I could not read her expression.</p>

<p>“Kei! Daiki-kun thinks you’re beautiful. That’s great!”</p>

<p>Ai ruffled Shimizu-san’s hair as she sat next to her.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch my hair. It’ll get messed up! And he only said that because he was troubled.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san forcefully pushes Ai-san’s hand away.</p>

<p>“That’s not true, right, Daiki-kun? You’re such a shy girl.”</p>
<p>“Ahaha…”</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s move on to the next question. What do you do on your day off? “</p>
<p>“Most of the time, I stay at home. I read manga, play with my sister, and sometimes play online games with friends if we have the time.”</p>
<p>“So you are an indoor person.”</p>
<p>“I’m not really physically active.”</p>
<p>“I see. It’s also fun to be active, so you should try it sometimes. Next, do you have a wide taste tolerance? “</p>
<p>“Taste tolerance? “</p>

<p>I’ve never heard that expression before. I guess it means whether or not there is any food you don’t like.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if my understanding is correct, but I am often told by my family and friends that I should eat food regardless of whether I like it or not.”</p>
<p>“So that’s why you could eat dark matter.”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>“What is dark matter? “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san interrupted again. What are they referring to as dark matter?</p>

<p>“Nothing, let’s change the topic. Next… It seems like I’m asking too many questions, do you have anything you want to ask, Daiki-kun?”</p>
<p>“Questions? “</p>

<p>I can’t come up with a question if you ask me suddenly.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to worry so much. Even if it’s about our favorite food or our favorite subject, it’s totally fine. Or rather, it doesn’t have to be a question, you can just say whatever you want.”</p>

<p>I may have been thinking too hard. I decided to say what I was thinking.</p>

<p>“It’s not a question, but I was thinking that you two sisters must be very close to each other to come shopping together.</p>

<p>When I said that, Ai-san’s expression softened a bit.</p>

<p>“I guess Daiki-kun sees it that way too. It’s because we are the best, lovey-dovey sisters! “</p>

<p>Ai-san enthusiastically clings to Shimizu-san, who tries to remove her, looking annoyed.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by the best, lovey-dovey sisters? Get away already. It’s suffocating!”</p>
<p>“Kei’s a naughty girl〜. It would be nice if you could be a little more honest with me too.”</p>
<p>“I’m being honest enough. Get away quickly, what kind of hug is this strong?”</p>

<p>It took Shimizu-san a few moments to bring Ai-san back to her original position.</p>

<p>“Geez, Kei is so cold.”</p>
<p>“Noisy. Don’t cling to me in front of other people.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying you want to cuddle in a private space? Geez Kei, you’re a spoiled child no matter how old you are.”</p>
<p>“Oh my god, you always have a retort for everything.”</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0017_s16.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/s16.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>“Ahaha”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but laugh at the well-coordinated banter between the Shimizu sisters.</p>

<p>“What are you laughing at?”</p>
<p>“Daiki-kun couldn’t help but smile when he saw the adorable relationship between us beautiful sisters.”</p>
<p>“Don’t casually call yourself beautiful.”</p>
<p>“If we are not beautiful, then who is?! Daiki-kun, you think so too, don’t you? “</p>
<p>“Uh, yes.”</p>

<p>I reflexively nodded, unable to resist the pressure. It’s true that both of them are beautiful.</p>

<p>“You’re forcing him to say that.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that. It’s the truth. Oops, we got off track. Daiki-kun, do you have any other questions for us?”</p>

<p>Right, I forgot about it while listening to the sisters’ comedy banter.</p>

<p>“Hmm. Things that I want to ask… “</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not easy to come up with something on the spot. Then, I’ll ask you something again. Hmm, what should I ask next?”</p>

<p>Ai-san puts her index finger on her forehead, striking a pose while thinking.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea! But this might be a bit too bold…”</p>
<p>“If it’s not too much, I’ll answer anything.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then I’ll ask. I’ll start with a jab. What type of girl is your preference, Daiki-kun? “</p>
<p>“Type of girl…?”</p>

<p>For a brief moment, Toshiya’s face flashed through my mind. I wonder if high school students are creatures that are more interested in love stories than I thought.</p>

<p>“Yes! Daiki-kun is a boy of our age, and I was wondering if he likes this or that about girls.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“How about that? If you can’t come up with anything, should I give you some time to think?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. I had a similar conversation with a friend a while ago.</p>
<p>“Is that so? So I’ll ask you again, what kind of girl do you like, Daiki-kun? “</p>
<p>“I like neat girls.”</p>

<p>Ai-san looked at Shimizu-san for a moment, then quickly returned her gaze to me with a grin.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. So Daiki-kun likes neat girls… I see-I see.”</p>

<p>Ai-san looked at Shimizu-san again meaningfully.</p>

<p>“W-what is it? If you have something to say, just say it.”</p>
<p>“No, nothing? I just thought of you as a devoted younger sister, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“I’ll remember this later.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san clenches her fist.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Okay-okay. Moving on to the next question. Just so you know, if you find the next question difficult to answer, you don’t have to.”</p>
<p>“I-I understand.”</p>

<p>I wondered what kind of question Ai-san would ask me if she emphasized it so much.</p>

<p>“Alright, First of all… Have you ever had a girlfriend before?”</p>

<p>This was a question I had not expected at all. Indeed, as Ai-san said before, this is a very direct question. It may be difficult for some people to answer. While I was thinking about how I should answer the question, I suddenly make eye contact with Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Shimizu-san gives me a sharp glare.</p>

<p>“No, I just thought that Shimizu-san might be a little bored with this conversation, that’s all.”</p>

<p>I’ve been answering Ai-san’s questions the whole time. Ai-san seems to be interested in me for some reason, but Shimizu-san might just be bored and not interested in this conversation.</p>

<p>“Eh〜. That’s not true, right Kei〜? You are trying to play it cool, but inside, your heart is pounding so hard it feels like it is going to burst open when you hear something you didn’t know about Daiki-kun, right?”</p>
<p>“Don’t speak on behalf of others.”</p>
<p>“Then what’s the truth? “</p>
<p>“Ugh… I’m not that bored…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san doesn’t meet my gaze, but she doesn’t seem to be lying.</p>

<p>“Look, she says she’s interested in what Daiki-kun has to say.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that!”</p>
<p>“That’s how it looked to this Ai-Onēchan.”</p>
<p>“You have some serious vision problems. Anyway, Hondō, what’s the answer to the previous question?</p>
<p>“Question?”</p>
<p>“Did you forget already? It was about whether you’ve had a girlfriend before.”</p>

<p>I do remember having that conversation. I don’t know why, but the topic keeps getting sidetracked today. I have to answer before I forget again.</p>

<p>“I’ve never been in a relationship with anyone.”</p>
<p>“I, I see…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san covered her mouth with her hand, and I couldn’t read her expression, but her voice sounded relieved.</p>

<p>“Then, Kei has never been in a relationship either, so you two are the same.”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t tell him something like that without my permission!</p>

<p>Shimizu-san glared at Ai-san. I’m honestly surprised that Shimizu-san has never been in a relationship before, considering how beautiful and fun she is.</p>

<p>“If you’re going to spread someone’s secret, you might as well tell him yours.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t do that, did I?”</p>

<p>As we’re having this conversation, the dishes we ordered are being served one by one.</p>

<p>“Oh, this cheese hamburger is the best, as expected.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say the tonkotsu ramen here was the best last time?”</p>
<p>“You can have multiple ‘best’ things.”</p>
<p>” …Oh, really?”</p>

<p>After finishing our food, we ordered additional drinks and were still inside the family restaurant.</p>
<p>It was a little early for lunch, so the restaurant was still empty.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way. Since I finished my question earlier, can I ask you another question, Daiki-kun?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s fine.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to answer any questions you don’t want to answer.”</p>
<p>“Mouu, Kei, I won’t ask him such difficult questions anymore.”</p>

<p>Even the previous question about whether Teruno or Shimizu-san is cuter was a little difficult to answer, but Ai-san seemed to think it wasn’t.</p>

<p>“Now, for the question…”</p>
<p>“I’m going to get a drink.”</p>

<p>As Shimizu-san was about to get up from her seat, Ai-san grabbed her arm.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter? Keep asking your question.”</p>

<p>Ai-san stared at Shimizu-san for a moment, then used the hand opposite to the one holding Shimizu-san’s arm to pick up a cup.</p>

<p>“Please get one for me, too.”</p>
<p>“Go get it yourself.”</p>
<p>“Aww〜, please listen to your onē-chan request.”</p>

<p>Ai-san pouted in dissatisfaction and shook Shimizu-san’s arm.</p>

<p>“Why do I have to listen to your request?”</p>
<p>“Heeh, really? Kei, you’re not supposed to say things like that. Ah, I feel like I’m about to reveal something. Obe, obe, what ‘obe ‘ was it? Before I go too far…”</p>

<p>Ai-san let go of Shimizu-san’s grip and pointed her index finger at her head temple instead.</p>

<p>“Obe? “</p>

<p>The only word I can think of that starts with [obe] is [o-bentō (lunchbox)’], but I wonder if there’s something related to lunchboxes.</p>

<p>“Hey, be quiet for a moment. Got it? I’ll go get your drink.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, then I’ll have ginger ale.”</p>
<p>” …Ai, I’ll remember this when we get home.”</p>
<p>“My beloved sister, you’re so sweet it brings tears to my eyes. “</p>
<p>“I’ll never forgive you.”</p>

<p>With those words, Shimizu-san took two cups and walked toward the drink bar.</p>

<p>“Is it okay? “</p>
<p>“It’s fine-it’s fine, Kei is very kind and she will forgive me. “</p>

<p>Is that so? The last expression Shimizu-san showed me didn’t look like someone who would give warmth to others, though.</p>

<p>“Can I continue with my question? “</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“What do you think of Kei? “</p>

<p>Ai-san had a serious expression on her face, something she had never shown since we first met.</p>

<p>“What do I think about Shimizu-san…?”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Even if it’s short, I want you to answer without lying or avoiding the question.”</p>

<p>I have no idea what the right answer is, but one thing I know is that I shouldn’t make superficial remarks here. If Ai-san is asking seriously, then I need to answer seriously too.</p>

<p>“I think Shimizu-san is a kind person.”</p>

<p>I look at Ai-san. I could not guess what Ai-san was thinking from her expression.</p>

<p>“I see. Why do you think so? “</p>
<p>“As you may have heard, Shimizu-san and I have been in the same class since the first grade. We started to talk with each other after we switched seats, and Shimizu-san is a very good listener. She never interrupts the conversation when we are talking, and when she finishes listening to me, she always replies to my questions properly.”</p>
<p>“Nn, nn.”</p>

<p>Ai-san’s face looks happy as she repeatedly nods her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you can do that unless you are willing to listen to what others have to say. I think Shimizu-san’s kindness and seriousness are evident in those moments.”</p>
<p>“I understand kindness, but what do you mean seriousness? I mean, she was ignoring the school rules and dyed her hair blonde until a while ago, you know? “</p>
<p>“Given her personality, I believe that Shimizu-san has her own reasons for doing so. Having that kind of firm character is also one of Shimizu-san’s strong points, I guess?”</p>
<p>“I see. I got it. Can I ask one more thing?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>I wonder what she’s going to ask me next. I involuntarily hold my breath.</p>

<p>“Why are you on Kei’s side?”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Why are you on Kei’s side?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span>
<p>“That’s… What do you mean? “</p>

<p>I thought it might be a warning to stay away from Shimizu-san, but it doesn’t seem to be the case judging from Ai-san’s expression.</p>

<p>“I might have asked in a slightly prickly way. I know that Kei has been kind of isolated in the class since the first year. So I was wondering why Daiki-kun is by Kei’s side.”</p>

<p>I see. If that’s the case, then my answer should be simple.</p>

<p>“Because I can’t leave her alone.”</p>
<p>“Is that sympathy? “</p>

<p>Ai-san looks at me with a slightly anxious expression. It seems like my words were vague.</p>

<p>“No, it’s different. Like I said before, I really enjoy talking to Shimizu-san. So when I say I can’t leave Shimizu-san alone, it’s because Shimizu-san is interesting. Isn’t it natural to want to be with someone who makes you feel happy when you spend time together?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>

<p>Ai-san widens her eyes. The conversation pauses, and the voices of people around us become distinct. Then Ai-san breaks the silence.</p>

<p>“Thank you for answering seriously. So that’s your answer for now.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>When Ai-san hears my reply, she breaks into a satisfied smile.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>“Ah, being serious is tiring. I guess it’s not my style to act like a serious onē-san, huh?”</p>
<p>“Um… What do you trying to find out with your previous question? “</p>

<p>In a more comfortable atmosphere, I decided to ask about the intention behind the previous question.</p>

<p>“Ah, yeah, f course you would be curious about that. Kei was quite popular in middle school. Many people approached Kei, but none of them really tried to see Kei’s inside.”</p>

<p>I was a little surprised to hear that Shimizu-san was popular in middle school, but thinking about it again, Shimizu-san is kind, interesting, and also beautiful, so it’s not surprising.</p>
<p>Ai-san continues.</p>

<p>“After hearing about Daiki-kun from Kei, I wondered if you were really paying attention to Kei. That’s why I asked you that question. I’m sorry if I’m being mean to you.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay.”</p>

<p>In other words, the previous question was meant to express concern for Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Thank you. But I have one last favor to ask you.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>

<p>Ai-san’s face became serious again.</p>

<p>“What is it? “</p>
<p>“It’s about Kei. I’ve been hearing rumors about people who are interested in her since she changed her hair back to black. When Kei was in junior high school, I used to keep those people in check until I graduated, but now I’m too busy with the student council. There are even people I don’t hear good things about among those interested in Kei, and it worries me.”</p>

<p>I see what you mean. I guess Ai-san does not want Shimizu-san to be in danger.</p>

<p>“So, should I act as Shimizu-san’s bodyguard?”</p>
<p>“No, Daiki-kun might get hurt if you do that. Neither Kei nor I want that. So, Daiki-kun doesn’t have to do anything risky. Not all the time, but I want you to be by Kei’s side.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“Just being nearby is enough?”</p>

<p>Certainly, suppose it were to escalate into a fight or something. In that case, it’s doubtful that I, who don’t usually engage in much physical activity as a member of the non-athletic club, could protect Shimizu-san.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>

<p>“I think just having someone of the same gender near someone they’re interested in can be quite a deterrent.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>I don’t know, I don’t have any experience, but I wonder if that’s how it works.</p>

<p>“Will you accept my request? “</p>
<p>“About that, can I decline? “</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Ai-san looks genuinely surprised. Maybe I didn’t use the right words.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>“No, it’s not what you thought. I actually enjoy talking with Shimizu-san. So, if I’m asked to be near her, it’s kind of… unpleasant somehow. So, why don’t we pretend that Ai-san didn’t ask me for a favor? Even without a favor, I’m sure I’ll be around her as long as Shimizu-san doesn’t say no.”</p>

<p>Ai-san listens to my words, and her expression relaxes.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. That’s good. I got worried thinking I made you dislike Kei because I was being mean to you.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I made you worry. So, can we just pretend there was no favor?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. That’s totally fine.”</p>

<p>“What’s okay?”</p>

<p>When I turned to the voice I heard, I saw Shimizu-san standing there holding two cups.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>

<p>“Well… it’s a secret between me and Daiki-kun.”</p>

<p>Ai-san winks at Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>Shimizu-san frowned and sat down, placing the cups in front of herself and Ai-san.</p>

<p>” …Well, fine, it was ginger ale, right? “</p>
<p>“Yeah, thanks. But it was a little late, huh?”</p>
<p>“There were more people at the drink bar than I expected, so I had to wait in line.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. Must have been tough.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>
<p>“Well, if you feel that way, next time, you’re on your own. Anyway, what were you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Oh, we were just talking about how cute Kei is, of course.”</p>

<p>Ai-san lied brazenly. It seems she intends to keep the conversation between the two of us a secret from Shimizu-san.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>“…ugh.”</p>
<p>“When we were little, you always begged mom for your favorite sweet, or when you were in elementary school, you got scared when you saw a horror movie and came to my room, also… “</p>
<p>“That’s enough, don’t say anything anymore.”</p>
<p>“It’s useless to stop me now. Daiki-kun already knows every little detail of Kei’s cute past.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Hondō, forget everything you heard earlier. Right now.”</p>
<p>“I-I’ll try my best… “</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>In the first place, since it’s Ai-san’s lie, I haven’t heard much about Shimizu-san’s cute past.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>“You should definitely forget about it. Besides, I don’t mind watching horror movies now.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san leans closer across the table and makes a mysterious expression.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, your face is a little too close… “</p>

<p>Noticing this, Shimizu-san quickly moves away from me.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>
<p>“Oh! You’re making an aggressive, Kei.”</p>

<p>Ai-san looks at Shimizu-san with a mischievous grin.</p>

<p>“Don’t say it like I did it on purpose.”</p>
<p>“Now-now, Kei-san, I understand.”</p>

<p>Ai-san pats Shimizu-san’s shoulder lightly.</p>

<p>“Why are you making that face as if you’ve figured something out?!”</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>
<p>Shimizu-san’s shout echoes through the family restaurant.</p>
