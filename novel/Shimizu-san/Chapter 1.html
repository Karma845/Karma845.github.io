<h2>Chapter 1: Art Class with Shimizu-san</h2>

<p>“Okay, let’s talk about love again today.”</p>

<p>　As I was trying to leave the classroom for the next art class in the art room, Toshiya stopped me. Unlike me, Toshiya has chosen music as his art subject, so I wondered why Toshiya had stopped me, but then he made the same request just like before.</p>

<p>“What’s so good about it? There is an art class right now, so we have to move quickly.”</p>

<p>　The rest of our classmates had already started to get ready to move, and the only ones who didn’t seem to be moving were me, Toshiya, and Shimizu-san, who was sleeping in the seat next to me.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. We finished class earlier than usual, so there’s still some time to spare. Besides, at worst, we can make it if we run.”</p>

<p>　If the time is so tight that we have to run, I think Toshiya, who is quick on his feet, is the only one who can make it, and I’m not sure if I can make it in time.</p>
<p>　Anyway, it would be quicker to have a conversation about love that Toshiya would be satisfied with rather than arguing with him.</p>

<p>“All right. So what do you want to talk about today? “</p>
<p>“I wonder. What should be the topic of today’s love talk…?”</p>

<p>　You stopped me with no preparation. Well, that’s just how Toshiya is.</p>

<p>“The art room’s a little far, so if there is nothing to talk about, I’m going to go now.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. I’m in the mood for a little love talk. I’ll think of a topic soon, so please don’t leave your seat.”</p>

<p>　I look at the clock on the classroom wall. As Toshiya said, there is still some time before the class starts, including the time it takes to get there.</p>

<p>“…but if you don’t think of something soon, I’ll leave.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, my friend! “</p>
<p>“Well, let’s just start with a normal chat and then move on to love talk.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good. Then I’ve always wanted to ask why you chose painting as your art subject. “</p>
<p>“Simply because I like painting the most out of the three art subjects of painting, music, and calligraphy. Why did you choose music, Toshiya? Did you like music that much? “</p>

<p>　We have been talking during breaks for about a year, but I don’t remember hearing Toshiya talk about anything related to music.</p>

<p>“The reason I chose music is simple. It’s because Seto-san chose music.”</p>

<p>　For some reason, Toshiya’s face looked very proud when he said that.</p>

<p>“Really, that’s the only reason?”</p>
<p>“Wanting to be with the girl you like as much as possible is natural, you know? Even being on the library committee, since Seto-san said she’d do it again this year, I decided to do it too.”</p>
<p>“So you’ve been in love with Seto since last April? Maybe it was love at first sight? “</p>

<p>　Toshiya was also a member of the library committee with Seto-san last year. If what he said earlier is true, I wonder if Toshiya joined the library committee in order to have more contact with Seto-san. And when I said, ‘Maybe it was love at first sight,’ I felt Shimizu-san who was supposed to be sleeping, move her head slightly.</p>

<p>“That’s not true. At least last April, Seto-san was just a classmate to me. I became a library committee member because I didn’t want to join other more troublesome committees.”</p>
<p>“I see. I thought you joined the same committee because you fell in love with her.”</p>
<p>“I’m not that simple. I sometimes think she’s cute on the outside, but that’s not enough to make me want to go out with her.”</p>

<p>　It seems that Toshiya is more hard-headed than I thought. I looked at Shimizu-san and saw no movement. It may have been my imagination that she seemed to moved slightly earlier. Either way, I should wake her up when we leave later, because we need to move out of the classroom for the next class.</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Toshiya? “</p>

<p>　While I was thinking about how to wake up Shimizu-san, Toshiya seemed to come up with something.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea, a topic of love conversation. Let’s make today’s theme a class time with the girl you like.”</p>
<p>“Class time with the girl you like? “</p>
<p>“That’s right. Even the most boring class time is a hundred times more fun with the girl you like, right? Today, let’s think about the situations in which you can have fun in class time with the girl you like! “</p>
<p>“Before thinking about having fun, you should take the class a little more seriously…”</p>

<p>　I can’t help but think he always seems unmotivated about the class, but when it comes to the exam, he not only gets a better score than me but he also ranks quite high.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Daiki. You have to enjoy everything in life, you know? Uh, about the situation, can you come up with something?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I don’t know. I mean, there’s no opportunity to talk during class, so what’s the point of doing anything?”</p>
<p>“That’s true, but I wonder if there’s anything else.”</p>
<p>“Toshiya, is there anything you would like to do in class time with Seto-san? “</p>
<p>“About that, uhh… “</p>

<p>　Toshiya crosses his arms and groans. I feel like he could accomplish great things if he could use his motivation to think hard like this for something else. Toshiya’s personality makes this impossible, though.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a great situation! Listen to me, Daiki.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Tell me.”</p>
<p>“In class, I get bored and took a glance at Seto-san. At the same time, Seto-san glanced at me too, then our eyes met. We both get nervous and quickly look away from each other, then both of us started to think about each other! Don’t you think that’s a nice situation? “</p>
<p>“That’s pretty good for an impromptu idea.”</p>

<p>　It’s the kind of situation you’d expect to see in a romance manga, it makes me wonder if he thinks about something like this all the time in his spare time.</p>

<p>“Right? What do you think, Daiki? Do you yearn for that?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s nice. It makes me excited to know that she cares about me.”</p>
<p>“You understand me? That kind of situation is really nice! “</p>

<p>　The disadvantage is that it would not work if the other person did not care about you, but it could be an interesting way to get nervous and excited during class time.</p>

<p>“Okay, once we come up with the first one, the rest will just keep coming.”</p>
<p>“Are we still going to continue? “</p>

<p>　I was already impressed that he could come up with one situation where the students were restricted to their actions during class time.</p>

<p>“Of course. We still have some time left, so let’s do that. I want to hear Daiki’s idea about exciting situation this time!”</p>
<p>“I can’t come up with something like that.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Daiki can do it. You’re a guy who can do anything, after all. I can vouch for that!”</p>

<p>　If possible, I would have liked to hear those reassuring words in a different situation. Unlike Toshiya, who has a vivid imagination, I have a hard time coming up with ideas. I wonder if this is the difference between those who are in love and those who are not. I thought about it again and came up with an idea that was not very clear but seemed to fit the situation.</p>

<p>“Is it okay if it’s a little rough? “</p>
<p>“Of course it’s okay. So what’s the situation? “</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you could call it a situation. But in some classes, you have to cooperate with your classmates. I was thinking that it would be nice if I could do that with the girl I like. “</p>

<p>　I think it’s a bit vague, but I couldn’t think of anything else, so it can’t be helped. Toshiya listened to me for a moment and made a gesture of thinking before opening his mouth.</p>

<p>“So, if I were to apply this to myself, I would ask Seto to teach me how to play the recorder when I practice it in music class. That’s great! I want Seto to teach me how to play the recorder! “</p>

<p>　It was an ambiguous idea, but he seemed to understand it somehow. I was slightly surprised at how he could quickly apply it to himself, though.</p>

<p>“When I heard that, I became really motivated for my next music class! I can’t stand it, I will go see her right now. Wait for me, Seto-san!”</p>
<p>“Wait! It’s not always possible to actually have Seto teach you in class… “</p>

<p>　Toshiya stormed out of the classroom, and my voice did not reach him.</p>

<p>“When he is absorbed in something, he never listens to what people say…”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“When he is absorbed in something, he never listens to what people say…”</p>

<p>　As I was thinking of heading to the art room after Toshiya was gone, I remembered something I had to do before that.</p>

<p>(Right. I have to wake up Shimizu-san.)</p>

<p>　I looked at the seat next to me. But Shimizu-san, who was supposed to be there a moment ago, was already gone, and I was the only student left in the classroom. When did Shimizu-san leave the classroom? I looked at the clock to see that the class time was approaching, and hurriedly left the classroom.</p>

<p>　When I arrived at the art room, there was only about a minute left before the class started. Toshiya, though it’s not intentional, seemed to end our love talk just in time. When I took my seat, the students were still buzzing, and even though I didn’t intend to listen to them, I could hear people talking around me.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san really dyed her hair black.”</p>
<p>“Do you know why she dyed it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I asked my friends and they all said they didn’t know either.”</p>

<p>　It seems that Shimizu-san is the main topic of conversation. Students from other classes also take the class together because the art class is held jointly with two other classes. The news of Shimizu-san’s makeover, which has calmed down after a few days in our class, seems to be fresh news to the students in the other class.</p>

<p>（I wonder if Shimizu-san is okay?)</p>

<p>　I sneak a look at Shimizu-san. According to the seating order in the art class, Shimizu-san’s seat is diagonally behind mine. Shimizu-san seems to know that people are talking about her, and she does not seem to be in a good mood. But I can’t ask her about it now because our seats are a little far from each other. While I was wondering what to do, the door opened and the art teacher came in.</p>

<p>“You guys seem to be more lively than usual today. I will start the class, so please be a little quiet from now on.”</p>

<p>　Sensei didn’t seem to understand why the students were making so much noise. He started the class without caring about it.</p>

<p>“Today, we are going to read the textbook first, and then you will draw a painting. I’ll tell you what we’re going to draw later. For now, open your textbook to page 23.”</p>

<p>　Sensei then began to explain some of the paintings in the book. In this art class, students are rarely assigned to read the textbook, and we just listen to Sensei. As I was losing my concentration on the Sensei’s explanation, I felt a presence and something like a piercing gaze behind me. I turned around slowly so as not to be noticed by Sensei and found the source of the presence. It was Shimizu-san, who was staring straight at me while other students were looking at their textbooks.</p>
<p>　I turn my head back to look at my textbook in a hurry. It seems that the presence I had felt from a while ago was from Shimizu-san. But why am I being stared by Shimizu-san?</p>

<p>(I thought she was staring at me, but maybe Shimizu-san just happened to be looking in my direction?)</p>

<p>　I was also a little bored during this time listening to Sensei, and I could understand why she took her eyes off the textbook. I might coincidentally have turned my head while she was looking around.</p>
<p>　I looked behind again to confirm the truth. Shimizu-san was still staring at me with her sharp eyes. My eyes met Shimizu-san’s, then Shimizu-san’s eyes widened and she immediately looked away.</p>

<p>(I was not mistaken, but why was Shimizu-san staring at me?)</p>

<p>　I tried to think of any possible reason. The only conversation I had with Shimizu-san were only about everyday life, and Shimizu-san did not seem to have changed at all when we were talking this morning. The only thing that came to my mind after that was the love talk we just had…</p>
<p>　Maybe Shimizu-san woke up because of the loud conversation that Toshiya and I were having, and she was getting irritated at me. That would explain why she was staring at me from a while ago.</p>

<p>（I wonder if Shimizu-san was really mad at me.)</p>

<p>　I looked behind again and saw that she had her hands on her cheeks for some reason. Her eyes are looking down, and her face seems to be redder than before. I was puzzled about what had happened to Shimizu-san between the time our eyes met and now. As I wondered about this, I felt a light tap on my head. I turned my head and saw Sensei standing in front of me.</p>

<p>“Hey Hondō. You’ve been looking behind too many times. It might not be on the exam, but you should at least pretend to listen to what Sensei has to explain.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>　The art room erupts in laughter. It seems that the tap I felt earlier was caused by Sensei putting the textbook on my head. Fortunately, I don’t think he’s really mad at me because he’s smiling too.</p>

<p>“It’s fine if you understand it, but be careful next time. Now that we’ve finished reading today’s textbook, let’s talk about the models we will draw today, which we discussed at the beginning of the class.”</p>

<p>　While I was paying attention to Shimizu-san, the explanation of the paintings was over before I knew it. Sensei returned to the front of the classroom and began to explain.</p>

<p>“Today, you will work in pairs and spend the rest of the class drawing each other.”</p>

<p>　As Sensei said this, a student from another class raised his hand.</p>

<p>“Sensei, can I ask you a question? “</p>
<p>“Yes? What is it? Tell me.”</p>
<p>“You said we’re going to draw in pairs. Will we be paired with the person sitting next to us?”</p>

<p>　That’s right. Sensei didn’t explain that part yet. Pairing up with the person sitting next to you is indeed the easiest way to make a pair. Sensei is scratching his head, and he seems to be thinking about it.</p>

<p>“Sensei? “</p>

<p>　The student who asked the question, perhaps waiting for Sensei, asked again.</p>

<p>“Okay, I’ve decided. You can pair up freely today. It can be a friend or someone from another class. Once you’ve been paired, please take your seats so that you’re next to each other. Everyone can stand up. “</p>

<p>　As soon as Sensei finishes, all the students in the art room stand up.</p>

<p>“You have five minutes. Please make a pair during that time. Those who haven’t form a pair will be forced to make their pairs after five minutes. So grab your stuff and start pairing up with each other. “</p>

<p>　With those words, the students begin to move in unison. Some of them have friends in this class and are paired up right away, and some don’t know anyone and are just looking around. I was the latter and was in trouble because I did not know anyone who would pair with me.</p>

<p>( At this rate, I would be paired with someone I didn’t know well. )</p>

<p>　Just when I was beginning to think that it was fine, I heard footsteps behind me. I turned around and saw Shimizu-san standing in front of me.</p>

<p>“Hey, Shimizu-san has been staring at Hondō for a while now. What is she going to do to him? “</p>
<p>“How could I know anything about Shimizu-san? I’m in a different class from her. Let’s get away from them so we don’t get involved.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. Hondō, my sympathies.”</p>

<p>　The other students around us started to blatantly distance themselves from Shimizu-san and me, whispering something. Shimizu-san did not seem to open her mouth. I decided to ask her myself.</p>

<p>“Are you still angry with me, Shimizu-san? “</p>
<p>“Angry? What do you mean? “</p>

<p>　It seems that the reason she was staring at me earlier was not because she was annoyed that I woke her up when she was sleeping. Then why was I being stared at? Well, it’s fine if she isn’t angry.</p>

<p>“I guess I was wrong. So what’s up, Shimizu-san? “</p>
<p>“…Hondō, have you decided on a pair?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t decided yet. How about you, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“No, not yet.”</p>

<p>　The conversation stops. I wonder what Shimizu-san wants to tell me. I look at Shimizu-san. She was looking at me just a moment ago, but now she is looking at a completely different direction, and our eyes don’t meet.</p>

<p>“There are less than two minutes left. Those of you who haven’t paired up yet, hurry up.”</p>

<p>　Sensei calls out to us. It seems I have less time than I thought. As I was wondering what to do, I saw Shimizu-san and a thought came to my mind.</p>

<p>“If you don’t have a pair yet, why don’t you pair up with me? “</p>

<p>　I thought it was fine even if I was paired with anyone, but I was glad to be paired with Shimizu-san, whom I knew.</p>

<p>“Why should I be paired with you..?”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to? “</p>

<p>　Well, then, I guess I have no choice. I don’t have much time, but I’ll just have to try to find another classmate.</p>

<p>“Wait. I didn’t say no. I just needed to prepare myself a little bit ….anyway, I’d rather draw with someone I know than to be paired with someone I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“So you’ll pair up with me then? “</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, if you insist that much.”</p>

<p>　It would be great if she agreed, but I don’t remember desperately asking her to pair up with me.</p>

<p>“Thank you. Best regard, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>　I sit down next to Shimizu-san. Between us, it’s the same position as in the classroom, so it’s somewhat comfortable.</p>

<p>“Time’s over.”</p>

<p>　Sensei looks around the art room. I look around too, but I can’t see anyone without a pair.</p>

<p>“It looks like everyone has paired up. Let’s get started. You can decide which one of you is going to draw first. Don’t take too long, just do it quickly. You have 30 seconds. “</p>

<p>　Sensei clapped his hands and started looking at his watch again.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Shimizu-san, do you want to draw first? Or do you want to do it later?”</p>
<p>“Either way is fine. You choose what you want.”</p>

<p>　To be honest, I don’t mind the order either. But if Shimizu-san says so, I’ll decide.</p>

<p>“In that case, may I draw first?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>　Sensei takes his eyes off the watch. It looks like 30 seconds have passed.</p>

<p>“Have you decided? Then the first one to draw gets their sketchbook ready. Whoever draws later moves their chair away from the desk a bit so that they face the first person to draw. You have ten minutes to draw. The person to be drawn should be in a comfortable position because you have to stand still for ten minutes. When you are ready, we will begin.”</p>

<p>　As soon as Sensei finished talking, half of the students pulled out their sketchbooks and got their pencils ready, while the other half moved their chairs toward their pairs and struck a pose.</p>
<p>　I opened a blank page in my sketchbook and took out my art pencil from my pencil box. I looked at Shimizu-san, who was already sitting facing me. While all the other students to be drawn had their hands on their knees, Shimizu-san crossed her arms. In addition, her legs were also crossed.</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0004_s2.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/s2.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Not an image from the chapter.)</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, are your hands okay in that position? “</p>
<p>“It’s easier this way… should I put my hands on my knees? “</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san whispered a little anxiously in a voice that only I could hear.</p>

<p>“If it’s easier for you, I think that’s okay.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then it’s fine.”</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san looked relieved, though it didn’t show in her voice.</p>

<p>“Looks like everyone is ready. Let’s get started. “</p>

<p>　With a call from Sensei, the students who were to draw first, including me, started to move their hands at once.</p>
<p>　I decided to draw a rough outline first. I stare at Shimizu-san. She has long, shiny, beautiful black hair, slender arms and legs, and is taller than other girls. Her legs are crossed, which naturally draws my attention to her long legs.</p>

<p>“Hey, Hondō, your hand stopped.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>　I was surprised to hear her voice. I had been so absorbed in staring at Shimizu-san that I had not moved my hand. I felt another piercing gaze. Maybe she noticed that I was staring at her legs.</p>
<p>　I hurriedly proceeded to draw the sketch. I was able to complete a rough sketch of her in less than half of the time limit. However, I omitted some details in favor of speed. In order to draw one of the omitted parts, the face, I moved my eyes to Shimizu-san’s face.</p>

<p>(Shimizu-san is a very beautiful girl…)</p>

<p>　Her eyes are slanted and her eyelashes are long. Her nose, lips, and other facial parts are all well-defined, and I think everyone who sees her face would find her beautiful. In fact, according to Toshiya, there are a surprisingly large number of boys who would be interested in dating her if she didn’t have such a personality.</p>
<p>　While I was staring at Shimizu-san’s face to draw a detailed sketch, Shimizu-san suddenly turned her face to the side.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san? I’m drawing your face right now, so please don’t move.”</p>
<p>“Because… you were… “</p>

<p>　I could tell from the movement of her lips that Shimizu-san was saying something, but her voice was so low that I couldn’t completely understand what she was trying to say.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Shimizu-san. Can you say that again? “</p>
<p>“Muu.”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san turns her face toward me and protests with her eyes. I thought it would be a good time to draw her now that she was looking at me, but I had a feeling that Shimizu-san would get angry at me later if I drew her grumpy face.</p>

<p>“Anyway, my face should be drawn last. You have a lot of other parts to draw too.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll draw the other part first.”</p>

<p>　I don’t really understand what’s going on, but Shimizu-san seems to have her own reasons. I have no choice but to draw from the neck down first. I turn my eyes down a little. A little lower than the head is her neck, and a little lower is her chest. My gaze naturally moves to Shimizu-san’s chest. Shimizu-san’s arms are currently folded, and her chest, which has a strong presence, is even more prominent in that position.</p>

<p>“H-hey Hondō. Where are you looking with such serious eyes!”</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san noticed what I was looking at and shouted.</p>

<p>“Where…? A little below your neck.”</p>

<p>　I didn’t have the guts to tell her directly that I was looking at her chest. Then Shimizu-san moves her arms to cover her chest.</p>

<p>“Why are you looking at me like that? “</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san asked me to draw something other than the face first, so I thought I’d draw a little bit below the face. I didn’t mean anything by that! I’m so sorry! “</p>

<p>　I feel like apologizing would be admitting my fault, but I can’t think of any other way to handle this situation other than by apologizing. I apologized as sincerely as I could.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you didn’t mean anything by that?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Can you say there is not even 1 millimeter of feeling at all?”</p>
<p>“Yes…there is none.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>　 Why does Shimizu-san look so disappointed? Don’t you feel uncomfortable with the evil glances from the opposite sex? Think again. Did I really feel nothing when I looked at Shimizu-san’s chest? I mean, to be honest, I think I felt a little nervous, partly because it was unexpected.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Shimizu-san. I lied.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I said I didn’t mean anything, but I actually had one millimeter of feeling… or maybe two. Sorry.”</p>

<p>　 I bow my head to Shimizu-san. I didn’t want to regret this, so I wanted to apologize to Shimizu-san now, even if she got angry with me. I slowly lifted my head and saw that Shimizu-san was looking at me.</p>

<p>“You saw my… and thought about it a little bit.”</p>
<p>“Uh, yes.”</p>
<p>“W-well, I’ll forgive you this time. I was a little nervous too… If you don’t stare at me with ‘that’ kind of eye, you can look at it when you draw it. But there’s a condition.”</p>
<p>“What is it? “</p>
<p>“I’ll try not to move, so draw me properly…”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san said to me in a slightly quieter voice.</p>

<p>“Okay. Leave it to me.”</p>

<p>　I decided to draw Shimizu-san even more seriously in the remaining time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Three minutes left. There’s still time left, but anyone who thinks he’s late should hurry up a little.”</p>

<p>　Sensei told me how much time I had left. After that conversation, I was making good progress with my sketches because Shimizu-san stayed put as she had declared. Finally, the only part I had not yet drawn was her face.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, can I look at your face now? “</p>

<p>　I asked her just to be sure. I had already drawn a rough sketch of her face, so even if I don’t see her face directly, the quality will be good enough if I use the remaining time to draw her detailed face.</p>

<p>“O-okay, come on!”</p>

<p>　It seems that Shimizu-san has made up her mind. Though I still don’t know why she needs to be so determined.</p>

<p>“I’ll start drawing then.”</p>

<p>　 I looked at Shimizu-san’s face. Her face is tense and her eyes are sharp enough to kill anyone who looks at her.</p>

<p>“Please relax a little more, Shimizu-san.”</p>

<p>　If I don’t do this, I’ll end up drawing Shimizu-san who stares at me with a terrible fierceness.</p>

<p>“What’s that! Are you saying I’m nervous? “</p>
<p>“I think so…”</p>

<p>　I don’t know why your expression is so tense if you’re not nervous.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san slowly closed her eyes for a few seconds, then her eyes widened.</p>

<p>“How’s that? “</p>
<p>“Not much has changed…”</p>
<p>“…are you serious? “</p>
<p>“I’m not going to lie here.”</p>
<p>“Grrr…”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san has a frustrated look on her face.</p>

<p>“Fufu.”</p>
<p>“What’s so funny? I’m trying to be serious right now.”</p>

<p>　I couldn’t help but laugh, but Shimizu-san seemed to have interpreted her seriousness as being laughed at. I should clear up the misunderstanding quickly.</p>

<p>“I mean, when I first met you, I didn’t expect Shimizu-san to have so many different facial expressions. I’m glad I started talking to Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, you.”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san’s face turned reddish. I actually didn’t mean to say such an embarrassing thing.</p>

<p>“…do you always talk like this to everyone? “</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san stares at me. I wonder what kind of person does she think I am?</p>

<p>“For me to say that, I think Shimizu-san is the first person.”</p>
<p>“…then it’s fine. Come on. There’s not much time left, so draw me quickly.”</p>

<p>　The tension in Shimizu-san’s face was gone. I hurried to move my pencil before her expression changed.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>“It’s been ten minutes. Who wants more time? “</p>

<p>　I look around the art room, but I don’t see anyone raising their hands.</p>

<p>“Well, it looks like everyone got it done in time. Then we’ll take a short break. You can take a break until I say to start again.”</p>

<p>　With that voice, the art room becomes noisy. Perhaps because many of the students are paired up with other students they know, they start talking with people near them more than usual.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, good work.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for modeling for me.”</p>

<p>　There were a few incidents during the session, but thanks to Shimizu-san’s cooperation, in the end, I was able to complete the sketch without any problems.</p>

<p>“…uhh”</p>
<p>“Are you okay? “</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san looks a little tired. It seems that acting as a model for sketching is harder than I thought it would be.</p>

<p>“This is nothing. Show me your drawing.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Here you go.”</p>

<p>　I handed my sketchbook to Shimizu-san. Shimizu-san took the sketchbook and looked at the page I had just drawn.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(Not an image from the chapter.)</p>

<p>“What do you think? “</p>

<p>　I like to draw, though not as much as the art club members, and I drew as much as I could in ten minutes, but I wondered what Shimizu-san thought of my work.</p>
<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>“….I think it’s okay. Even from my point of view, it’s easy to recognize this was me.”</p>

<p>　I am relieved to hear her words. I would have had to apologize to Shimizu-san for her hard work if she had said that it did not look like her.</p>

<p>“Thank god. I’m glad you said that.”</p>
<p>“But can I ask you one question? “</p>
<p>“Is there anything bothering you?”</p>
<p>“Why do you shade my cheeks? “</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>　I was afraid of what she might ask, but I could answer that.</p>

<p>“When I was drawing Shimizu-san’s face, it was red all the time, so I just lightly shaded it.”</p>
<p>“Ah?!”</p>

<p>　 Shimizu-san touched her cheeks with both hands. Apparently, she didn’t realize it herself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>

<p>“…Hondō, don’t tell anyone about this.”</p>
<p>“Yes? Well, okay.”</p>

<p>　 It seems that Shimizu-san did not want anyone to know. I’ll only keep this in my memory. Although I wasn’t planning to tell anyone in the first place.</p>

<p>“Break is over. Next, you’re going to reverse the model and the guy who’s drawing, and you’re going to do another ten-minute drawing. Get ready.”</p>

<p>　Hearing Sensei’s voice, the students in the art room begin to get ready.</p>

<p>“It’s my turn to be the model. Do you have any poses you want me to do?”</p>
<p>“Any position is fine.”</p>

<p>　Since there were no specific instructions, I sat facing Shimizu-san with my hands on my knees.</p>

<p>“Are you ready? Let’s start. “</p>

<p>　I looked straight into Shimizu-san’s eyes as Sensei announced the start of the session. Shimizu-san noticed my gaze and hid her face with her sketchbook.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san? “</p>
<p>“Don’t stare at me with such serious eyes…”</p>
<p>“You’re still not used to my gaze? “</p>

<p>　In the end, Shimizu-san started sketching my face only after less than half of the time remained.</p>
