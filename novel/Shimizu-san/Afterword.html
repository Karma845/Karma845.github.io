<h2>Afterword</h2>


<p>Thank you for reading this book. I’m the author, Soko Hana (底花).</p>
<p>Now, how should I start writing? I’m already struggling in the second line of the afterword. Maybe I’m nervous.</p>

<p>First, let me start with a brief self-introduction. I’m called Soko Hana, which means [Flowers blooming in the depths of the earth.] My favorite animal is an owl.</p>
<p>As for who I am, I am a member of a novel submission site. I occasionally write short romantic comedies on the novel submission site called [Let’s become a novelist, 小説家になろう, (Syosetu).]</p>

<p>Why did I start writing and posting short romantic comedies? I don’t remember it well now.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>However, I do remember how happy I felt receiving feedback from readers and how it inspired me to keep writing.</p>
<p>So, I continued writing short romantic comedies on a whim or sometimes not at all.</p>
<p>But one day, a turning point came. I received an email. The gist of the email was, [Your work is great! Can you share a bit of the story?]</p>

<p>That work became the basis for this book, the short romantic comedy titled</p>
<p>[The day after I told my friend that I prefer a neat girl, the Delinquent Shimizu-san on the Seat Next to Me Dyed Her Hair Black.]</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>I feel like my nervousness has eased a bit.</p>
<p>Anyway, I had a conversation with the person who sent me that email.</p>
<p>The conversation was about turning the short story I wrote into a book.</p>

<p>Turning it into a book… turning it into a book… turning it into a book!</p>
<p>It was an incredible shock when I actually heard those words.</p>
<p>In fact, one of my biggest ambitions while I’m alive is to publish a book, even just one.</p>
<p>This proposal was an exceptional opportunity that could fulfill that ambition. I decided to accept the proposal.</p>

<p>After that, the days flew by, and before I knew it, I had finished writing the main story and now I’m writing this afterword.</p>
<p>Having written this much, my nervousness has finally subsided.</p>
<p>This book holds a special place in my heart as it is the first book I’ve ever written.</p>
<p>I’m genuinely happy that readers like you have picked up and read this book.</p>

<p>Lastly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my dedicated editor who has supported me from the beginning, to Shimizu-san and Daiki, to Hamu-san (ハム) for creating lovely illustrations, to Yasuno Toshinori-san for drawing an amazing introduction manga, and to all the readers who have read this far.</p>
<p>Thank you very much. I hope to see you again somewhere in the future, if we have the chance.</p>
