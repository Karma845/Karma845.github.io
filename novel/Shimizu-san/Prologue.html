<h2>Prologue: Shimizu-san Dyed Her Hair Black</h2>

<p>“Daiki, let’s talk about love.”</p>
<p>“All of a sudden? “</p>

<p>　After school, when I was about to go home, my friend Toshiya Matsuoka approached me.</p>

<p>“You know, we’ve been friends since the first grade of high school, but we haven’t talked much about love, have we?”</p>

<p>　It is true that Toshiya and I started talking to each other at the beginning of our first year in high school because our seats were close to each other, and we gradually became close friends. Even now in our second year of high school, our relationship hasn’t changed. It is also true that we have never talked about love. But I’m a bit confused about the sudden love talk.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s true that we haven’t. But I mean, isn’t it something you only talk about secretly with a few guys on a school trip night or something? And Toshiya, didn’t you have club activities right now?”</p>

<p>　Unlike me, Toshiya is a member of the soccer club. So I don’t think he has time to talk with me after class.</p>

<p>“I have a little time to spare today before the club activities start, so it’ll be fine. Anyway, I’d like to start a conversation about love between Daiki Hondō and me now! “</p>

<p>　Hearing Toshiya’s declaration, which I did not know to whom he was addressing, I gave up on giving my opinion. In my experience, no one can stop Toshiya if he’s acting like this.</p>
<p>　I look around quickly, but few people are left in the classroom after school, and no one seems interested in what we have to say.</p>
<p>　The only concern I have is that Shimizu-san is still sitting next to me.</p>
<p>　Kei Shimizu, a famous delinquent (Yankee) in our high school. Shimizu-san’s beautiful hair, which reaches down to her waist, is completely golden even though the school rules prohibit hair dyeing. She wore her school uniform full of accessories, such as necklaces and earrings.</p>
<p>　There are many stories of Shimizu-san’s saga, such as when the teacher warned her about her flashy hair color, but when she stared at the teacher, the teacher almost cried. Perhaps because of this, Shimizu-san is widely feared not only by our classmates but also by the juniors and seniors.</p>
<p>　For some reason, Shimizu-san and I have been in the same class since we started high school. Though Shimizu-san usually goes home right after class, so it is rare to see her still in the classroom. I guess she must be sleeping because she was lying on the desk and did not move. If she is sleeping, I guess it’s okay to talk with Toshiya next to her.</p>

<p>“First question. Daiki, is there any girl you like? “</p>

<p>　As my attention turned to Shimizu-san next to me, Toshiya suddenly asked me a question that got to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t that be the last question you should ask in a love talk? “</p>
<p>“I have a habit of eating the strawberries in a shortcake first. So, what is the answer? “</p>

<p>　I feel like the analogy is a bit off, but I’ll answer anyway.</p>

<p>“No, there is none.”</p>
<p>“What a boring guy.”</p>

<p>　Toshiya’s face was somewhat dissatisfied, even though I answered seriously. I guess he expected me to say that I was interested in someone.</p>

<p>“How about you, Toshiya?”</p>

<p>　I didn’t mean to retaliate, but I decided to ask Toshiya the same question. Well, even if he had someone he liked, I don’t think he would answer this question…</p>

<p>“I like Seto-san.”</p>

<p>　It was an immediate answer. He did not seem to be bothered at all. I had no idea that this was how I would find out who Toshiya’s crush was.</p>
<p>　I checked my surrounding again. Fortunately, I seemed to be the only one who had heard Toshiya’s declaration.</p>
<p>　Seto-san is a girl who has been in our class since our first year. However, she is not a very conspicuous type in the class, and I don’t know her very well.</p>

<p>“Is it okay to say such an important thing here? “</p>
<p>“It’s nothing to hide. Besides, it doesn’t bother me even if she knows.”</p>

<p>　I think it would be big news if it was known that Toshiya, a sophomore that was popular among girls and the ace of the soccer team, had a crush on someone.</p>

<p>“By the way, if Daiki doesn’t have anyone he’s interested in, what type of girl do you like? “</p>

<p>　Despite my concern, Toshiya seems to be still planning to continue this love talk. Since Toshiya answered my question earlier, I have to answer his question this time. However, I can’t immediately think of what I like about the opposite sex.</p>

<p>“Hmmm…”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to think so hard. I think it’s okay to casually say that you like someone who is cute or pretty, something like that.”</p>

<p>　I see, I’ve been thinking only about the inside, but the outside is also a condition to falling in love. I thought about it again, and one thing came to my mind.</p>

<p>“Then, I think I prefer a neat girl.”</p>
<p>“I see. Daiki likes neat girls. Specifically, what exactly do you like about them?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘specifically’? “</p>
<p>“I think the image of neatness differs from person to person. So, I want to know what kind of image you have of a neat girl.”</p>

<p>　The word [neat] may indeed be a bit abstract.</p>

<p>“My idea of a neat girl is, for example, one who wears her school uniform properly… “</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm. What else? “</p>
<p>“She should have dark hair, if possible…”</p>
<p>“Fumu-fumu. This is a little off-topic, but what is your favorite hair length, short or long?”</p>
<p>“I guess I prefer a long hair girl.”</p>
<p>“Okay-okay. By the way, I’m a guy who prefers a short-haired girl because Seto-san’s hair is short.”</p>

<p>　I didn’t ask you that. Or rather, Toshiya is likely to switch to long hair if Seto-san grows her hair long by some chance.</p>

<p>“Back to the topic, how about accessories? In my case, if it’s not too flashy, I can tolerate it.”</p>
<p>“I also think it’s okay as long as it’s not too flashy.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I get it. Daiki likes a neat girl with long black hair, doesn’t wear her uniform sloppily, and only uses simple decorations.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>　I didn’t have that specific type of girl in my mind, but I think he’s right.</p>

<p>“Okay, this is getting interesting. What should I ask next…? “</p>
<p>“Toshiya, speaking of which, are you still have the time? “</p>
<p>“I told you I have a little time to spare today… uh, it’s this late already?! “</p>

<p>　Toshiya rushes to get up from his seat and grab his bag.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, I have to go to my club activities. Let’s continue our love talk again later, Daiki! “</p>

<p>　Is Toshiya going to have another love talk with me later? I’m satisfied now that I know who Toshiya likes. Before I can say so, Toshiya quickly leaves the classroom.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>　The next day, when I arrived at the classroom, I found someone lying down on Shimizu-san’s seat.</p>
<p>　I say [Someone] because that person had beautiful black hair that extended below her waist. I wonder if there was anyone in our class with such long hair except for Shimizu-san. Maybe a girl in another class inadvertently chose the wrong classroom.</p>
<p>　If this is the case, there is a possibility that this girl and Shimizu-san, who will come later, will be in trouble with each other. I decided to wake up the girl who was occupying Shimizu-san’s seat.</p>

<p>“Hello.”</p>

<p>　I patted her shoulder, who seemed to be sleeping.</p>

<p>“Hmm?”</p>

<p>　It was Shimizu-san…</p>
<p>　To be more precise, it was Shimizu-san with black hair.</p>

<p>　There are endless questions about why she had dyed her hair black, why she wore her uniform without much of a mess today, why she didn’t wear the necklace she always wears, and why she changed her earrings to a simple design. But now I have to think about why I woke her up by tapping her on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Err, good morning.”</p>

<p>　I know it’s bad to wake her up and say good morning as if nothing happened, but I’d like to think that tapping her on the shoulder to say hello is not that unnatural. Besides, I usually greet Shimizu-san, so it should not be that strange.</p>

<p>“Morning… “</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san greeted me back. Fortunately, it looks like it worked out somehow.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, you dyed your hair black.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.”</p>
<p>“Why did you dye it all of a sudden? “</p>
<p>“Because…yesterday…”</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san’s voice volume suddenly dropped and I couldn’t hear her. What happened to Shimizu-san yesterday?</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><div><img src="../Images/0002_s.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/s.png  --></div></div>

<p>“Well, it’s nothing, I’m going to sleep again, so don’t wake me up this time.”</p>
<p>“I understand. I won’t wake you up until Sensei comes.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to wake me up.”</p>

<p>　After saying this to me, Shimizu-san lay down on the desk again.</p>

<p>“Good night, Shimizu-san.”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>　Today was a turbulent day. The homeroom teacher, Yuasa-sensei, who came to the morning homeroom, was surprised to see Shimizu-san with black hair and started to cry, and other classmates, though they did not tell her directly, spent the whole day discussing the reason why Shimizu-san had dyed her hair black.</p>
<p>　Shimizu-san, who was in the spotlight today, seemed to be in a bad mood all the time because of the attention from everyone in the class.</p>

<p>“…such a big fuss.”</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san grumbled to no one in particular after school.</p>

<p>“It’s not like anyone in the class is saying something bad about Shimizu-san, so I don’t think you need to worry about it.”</p>
<p>“W-were you listening to me?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I heard you because we’re sitting so close.”</p>
<p>“…it’s fine. But you can’t be sure if they’re not saying bad things about me in class.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. But I think Shimizu-san’s black hair and the way you’re wearing your school uniform today are really nice, so I don’t think there’s anyone who would say anything bad about you.”</p>
<p>“…Ughh.”</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san’s movement stops suddenly. Did I say something strange? Shimizu-san was stiff for a while, but then, she suddenly stood up with her bag in her hand.</p>

<p>“I’m going home.”</p>
<p>“Uh? Then, see you tomorrow, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>　Shimizu-san said and left the classroom with a swift movement.</p>

<p>“I think I should go home too.”</p>

<p>　Toshiya has club activities today, so we’re not going to talk about love. I put on my backpack and left the classroom as if I was following Shimizu-san.</p>
