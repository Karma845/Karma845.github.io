<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Continued: Let’s Learn about Magic!</h3>

<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“I have nothing to teach you.”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-20" class="calibre6"></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">That was first thing the teacher, Giuseppe, said after entering the class meant for teaching exorcism.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">And the only person in the room was Tatsumi. It was a luxury in it’s own way, having a man to man lesson on exorcism with the Supreme pontiff Giuseppe himself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Well, they weren’t actually having the lesson yet, but were about to. Because the class was about to start from now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Despite that,</span><span id="calibre_link-21"></span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">The thing Giuseppe said at the very start was “I have nothing to teach you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">And Tatsumi, who had been preparing himself mentally with this and that, totally went blank. Well, anyone would have shown the same reaction.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Rather, it’s better to say ‘There is nothing I can teach you concerning magic.’ To tell you the truth, your magic is a bit out of the normal.”</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">As the second person in history to be able to use the &lt;Sky&gt; system magic, he could even use the mana present in the atmosphere- the outer origin mana, rather than the mana within himself, the inner origin. This alone made it something out of the ordinary.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Hmm, now that I think about it, rather than calling you a [Magician], you should be called a [Mana User].”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-22" class="calibre6"></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“M-Mana User……?”</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Correct. From what I have heard from Calsey, what you’d used was not magic, but a phenomenon similar to it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Tatsumi completely didn’t understand the difference between a magician and a mana-user. But since Giuseppe said something was different, then there must be something different.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“I have already explained this before. That magic could only be invoked by combining a spell and an aria, these two things. Do you remember?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Right. When I first came here I think… that’s when you and Chiiko explained it all to me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">There’s no way he could forget. The first day he was summoned over to this world he heard a bit about magic from Giuseppe and Calcedonia. And after he heard that his body had no mana at all he was feeling really down.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“But….From what I’ve heard from Calsey you didn’t use a spell or aria at all….or rather, you don’t even know them right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Now that you mention it….”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Tatsumi didn’t use the all important Spells when he was using magic. Rather, even in the books in this world he hasn’t even seen a spell. It’s been just a while since he started to study the language of this world, and the alphabets so even if he did see one there is no way he would remember it.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">So even if Tatsumi wanted to chant a spell, he didn’t even know what it was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“But in the end you could still use magic. No, you directly used mana to call upon a phenomenon which was similar to magic. So for you who can use Mana directly, I think it’s better to call you a [Mana user] rather than a [Magician].”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Suppose, the mana was the fuel and the spell was the engine. In order to start a car you first have to use fuel with the engine to start a spark which will make a car run. Similarly, by using mana with the spell, the car called [Magic] would be invoked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">In other words, what Tatsumi did was similar to running a car which doesn’t have an engine with fuel alone. Normally, the car should not be able to start.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">But in the end he drove the car splendidly. He should understand that this by itself was an abnormality.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“In the past there were quite a few Mana users like you. Hmm, well even now, though very few, some do exist. But, well, certainly they are rare, but that only for humans like me and demi humans. Other than that, there are a surprisingly high number of them in other species.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Giuseppe said while smiling.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Early morning, after seeing Tatsumi off who was going to the temple for lessons, she started to tidy up their new house.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">She herself didn’t have any duties at the temple today, so she decided to take the day to clean up everything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">They moved in to their new home yesterday. After the moving was completed, together with their close friends like Verse and Bogart, they had a modest home made dinner by Calcedonia to celebrate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">After the celebration Bogart and Verse both went back home or to their lodging at the temple. Well, before Verse went back he gave Tatsumi a thumbs up, smiling with a deep meaning. But surprisingly, because of the fatigue from the moving and the wine from the celebration, Tatsumi fell asleep fast.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Seems like Tatsumi wasn’t used to drinking. And on top of that he just recovered from injury too.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-23" class="calibre6"></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Because he fell asleep faster th</span><span class="calibre5">an expected, Calcedonia was feeling a little lonely, but she didn’t forcefully wake up Tatsumi who was tired.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">She was grinning while staring at his sleeping face for a while, but than she too fell asleep.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">The next morning, Calcedonia was completely fired up! Actually, ever since she started dreaming she had one big ambition!</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Yesterday master fell asleep rather quickly…But today…Today’s the day I will finally, with master…..!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Calcedonia’s cheeks blushed red as she continued to think about her long cherished dream.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">While happily humming, Calcedonia left the house to clean up the courtyard after she was done tidying up the inside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Oh my…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">What she saw beyond the gate was a few women, presumably the housewives around this neighborhood, glancing at their home and whispering to each other.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Probably, after they heard the rumored &lt;&lt;Holy Maiden&gt;&gt; had moved in here, they gathered together and were getting lively gossiping about what could be happening.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Among them, one housewife noticed Calcedonia and exclaimed out loudly, and with that the other housewives also noticed her presence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">&mdash;Come to think of it, I still haven’t greeted the neighbors yet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">While thinking that, Calcedonia smiled and walked towards them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Good morning everyone. I have moved into this house recently. My name is Calcedonia Chrys…. No, Calcedonia Yamagata. From this occasion, please do take care me and my husband.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">And she bowed lightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Just then, a tremendously huge information just got published….but probably none of them even noticed.</span></p>
<span></span><span id="calibre_link-24" class="calibre6"></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“For example, Demonic beasts. Among them, there are a lot who can unleash phenomena similar to magic. Some can breath fire, and some can cause snow storms and the likes. But of course, they can’t recite the chants. So how exactly do they use magic? Or rather, the phenomenon similar to magic? Son-in-laws powers should be similar to that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">&mdash;I see.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Tatsumi nodded.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Tatsumi has yet to see a demonic beast. But he didn’t believe that they could speak human languages. Even if, by chance, some could speak, they had to be some unique existences of sort.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“So, what I have to do now is to learn the spells properly right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">First, he had to learn the alphabet, and then remember the spells. But how much he could accomplish wasn’t certain at all, so he was feeling a bit uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">But, he has to do it. Because he decided it. He would become stronger to protect his family, no matter how much effort it takes.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Tatsumi was resolving himself once again, but after hearing Giuseppe’s next sentence his newly found resolve vanished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“No…well, that…you have the &lt;Sky&gt; system but… in the past there was one who could use that magic, you heard about that right? But that was in the times of antiquity. It has been passed down that the &lt;Sky&gt; system magic itself exists but well, the very essential spells themselves haven’t been passed down.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">If they searched the old scriptures and texts in bulk then they just might find some, but it would take a huge amount of time and effort for it. Even when Calcedonia found the summoning ritual, it took a tremendous amount of time.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Eh…? W-Wait, then you mean….”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Yes. I guess there’s no other way than to find a method yourself. I said it before right? [I have nothing to teach you].”</span></p>

<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“But, for Her holiness herself to move here, it really is very much reassuring.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“I agree. Please do take care of us in case of sudden accidents.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Of course, I’ll help as much as I can. But if I do as I please too much then the temples’ earnings would go down… So do put request there sometimes too, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Calcedonia happily spoke to them with a smile, and the housewives also laughed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Still, when I first heard of her holiness, the &lt;&lt;Holy Maiden&gt;&gt;, I totally assumed you were a stiff person hard to talk with….but now that we’re chatting, you are just like a normal maiden.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Umm…I’ve always been living in the temple so this is my first time speaking with neighbours like this. Truth is, I’m a bit surprised too. But I myself want to get along with everyone also, if I don’t I’ll probably make my husband feel awkward.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">While saying that, Calcedonia put her cheeks on her hand, and smiled somewhat happily.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Actually, Calcedonia had poor social skills..</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Ever since she was in her home town, she was looked down upon with cold eyes by the villagers and her family. Even after coming to the temple, other than Giuseppe who had adopted her as his daughter, the number of people she could talk with in a friendly manner was very small.</span></p>
<span></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">But, now that she would be living here, she had to skillfully get along with her neighbours. Even if, for some reason she isolated herself from the other housewives, Tatsumi might start to feel awkward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Because Tatsumi promised to work hard for her sake, she also resolved to try harder for his sake.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Hmm. Well, it’s not like I wouldn’t be able to help you at all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">After seeing Tatsumi becoming visibly more depressed, Giuseppe smiled like a kid whose prank was a success.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-25" class="calibre6"></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“First practice so that you can skillfully manipulate the outer origin mana. Right now, you cannot even gather outer origin mana consciously can you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Right…it’s as you say.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Till now, Tatsumi used &lt;Sky&gt; magic only once. And even then he was mostly unconscious. He did use mana a few times, but there weren’t any occasions he could operate it by his own will.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">To be able to consciously operate mana, that was Tatsumi’s first and foremost goal.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-26" class="calibre6"></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Though Son-in-law is different than us, I think we could still be of reference to you. First I’ll explain the ins and outs of when we use magic. First&ndash;”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">There is no reason to rush. It’s alright if he could properly grasp the things he needed first, firmly.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-27" class="calibre6"></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">After telling himself that, Tatsumi concentrated on Giuseppe’s lecture.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“I’m home&mdash;”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">At the seventh bell &mdash; long passed 6PM &mdash; when the surrounding were completely dark, Tatsumi finally returned home.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Welcome back, master!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">After opening the door with a key &mdash; Magic key, made by Calcedonia which only opened after using the correct pass-phrase &mdash; Tatsumi tiredly entered, after which he greeted Calcedonia who greeted him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Good work. So how was it? Today’s lessons.”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-28" class="calibre6"></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Well…how do I say it…. I don’t think I should look forward to it too much…ahahaha”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Even if he was suddenly told to feel the mana which was around him, since he has never felt it before since the moment he was born, it was easier said than done. He spent today all day trying to do that under Giuseppe’s leadership.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">But in the end he couldn’t feel anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Nobody can suddenly feel magic you know? Even I had to work hard for a while till I was able to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Is that so…yeah. There’s no way it would go smooth so suddenly.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Before, Giuseppe said Calcedonia was a genius. But even she had to work hard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">And he might not even have talent for it. While he was feeling down, Calcedonia comforted him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">And as the legend said, when someone was comforted by a beautiful woman he would instantly feel better.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“I already prepared dinner. Master, please go ahead and take a bath, the water is ready.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Whether it was preparing the hot water for the bath or other things, Calcedonia could easily do them with her magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“Thanks. I’m really lucky that I have Chiiko.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“N-No..I’m happy…just being of use to you…..”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“But I can’t let Chiiko handle everything at home. I can help out too. Like wood-chopping and stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Tatsumi said while showing off his biceps, but then Calcedonia started to fidget while her cheeks turned red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“T-Then Master…I have a r-request but…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“A request? Well as long as I can do it.”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-29" class="calibre6"></span>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">“T-Then…….C-Can I sleep with you tonight?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">……Click!</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Tatsumi’s body froze with a sound.</span></p></div>
