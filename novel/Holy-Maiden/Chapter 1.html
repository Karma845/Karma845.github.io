<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Dream</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, it’s that dream again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He, Yamagata Tatsumi, was clearly aware that he was within a dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Were the dreams where you could clearly tell that “this is a dream” called lucid dreams? While thinking so, Tatsumi always saw this reoccurring dream as if it was unrelated to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dream was set in a basement somewhere. It wasn’t very large; it was about the size of a school classroom. And, in the dark room, a single woman was on her knees, wholeheartedly offering her prayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surroundings, from the walls, to the floor, and to the ceiling, were made entirely out of stone. That appearance was what lead Tatsumi to guess that the place was a basement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only sources of light were some lit candles, whose flame gently swayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman’s age seemed to be just under twenty. To Tatsumi, a tenth grader, she appeared to be either of the same age as or a little older than him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her long, straight hair went past her waist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hair reflected the red light of the candles, sparkling in vermilion gold, but its actual color was probably blonde. Or rather, it could be a more whitish color, making her the so-called platinum-blonde.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The color of her pupils was unknown; her eyes were closed, for she was deep in her prayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her race seemed to be from the West. However, it felt slightly different from the normal white person. Well, Tatsumi wasn’t that knowledgeable about white people, being Japanese, but there was no doubt that she was exceedingly beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sharp nose line and chin. Each part of her body was also very exquisite and developed. It was a pity that her eyes were closed due to her prayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking closely, her lovely petal-like lips were faintly but constantly moving. She seemed to be reciting some sort of incantation or ritual prayer in a language unknown to Tatsumi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holy maiden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Tatsumi thought of that phrase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why he thought of a “holy maiden” might have been because the girl praying in his dream then resembled a priestess rather than a witch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holy maiden was praying eagerly, seemingly without end, in the dreams that Tatsumi saw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He awoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi thought, with a dim mind, as he stared at the familiar ceiling, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When did it start? When did I begin to have that dream?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi thought for a while, remembering the holy maiden seen in his dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has it already been a year since he began having this dream? In the beginning, it was about once in a month. Tatsumi knew the abnormality of having the same dream, over and over again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the intervals between each dream gradually shortened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a month became twice a month and then it became the thrice a month, then before long it was once a week, followed by once in three days. And now he had the dream of that holy maiden almost every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had it been about ten days since the time when he saw her in his dreams every day?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten days ago. That date made him realize something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“… Ten days ago? That’s…the day I…lost Chiiko…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chiiko was the name of his last and dearest family member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had been about a year and a half since Tatsumi lost his parents and younger sister in a traffic accident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was when they all went to a hot spring region to celebrate him passing the exam to go to the high school he wanted. Their car, being driven by his dad, was hit by a truck. The truck driver had been dozing off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Tatsumi was in the car too. But, although he miraculously escaped from death, the rest of his family died almost instantly.</span></p>
<p>Tatsumi remembered seeing the front of the truck through the windshield, and that was it. He was unconscious for a few days after.</p>
<p>Even after regaining consciousness, he had severe bone fractures and had to stay hospitalized for another two months.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in those two months, his life had completely changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi had lost his parents and younger sister in an accident all at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi heard that his neighbors took care of the funeral after being discharged from the hospital. Apparently, the expenses of the funeral would later be paid from the insurance money of his family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, the remaining insurance was enough for him to survive until he became an adult. A lawyer in charge had explained the details, but because of the situation, he didn’t remember much of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Tatsumi, who had just entered high school and was a minor, could not possibly manage the remaining insurance finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The management of the insurance ended up being left to his aunt from his father’s side, who was his only remaining relative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His aunt was in her mid-thirties and unmarried if he remembered correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because she lived pretty far away from where Tatsumi and his family lived, she could at most be called an acquaintance. What’s more, even during his family’s funeral, she hadn’t shown up due to being busy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, she clearly refused to take in and look after Tatsumi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can take guardianship of you, but everything else will be noninterference with each other, alright? Or do you want to go to some facility or something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi could only agree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His aunt became his guardian only on paper, and Tatsumi’s life living alone began.</span></p>
<p>Necessary funds for living and school was transferred to Tatsumi’s account every month. This was the only thing that Tatsumi’s aunt did well, but that might just be part of some contract.</p>
<p>It was possible that his aunt took part of Tatsumi’s money into her own pocket.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi had thought about it, but he didn’t plan on looking at the records, nor was he interested in the money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could very well accuse his aunt of neglecting her duties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then his aunt would become disqualified as his guardian, and he would have to be taken into a foster family or orphanage. If he had to choose, living alone like he was would be the better option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi sold the house where he lived with his family and moved to an apartment close to his school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The house where he lived before was too spacious for Tatsumi to live alone in, and the maintenance costs would be too great. And above all, living alone in a house filled with memories of his late family was too painful for Tatsumi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi had managed to pass the exam for his school of choice, but it was hard to say that his new life went well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi had spent the first few months of school on a hospital bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after being discharged, painful rehabilitation was waiting afterward. By the time he left the hospital after finishing all of the rehabilitation and returned to everyday life, the first semester was already over and the school had already entered summer vacation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi was absent from the first semester of the tenth grade entirely. As a matter of course, from the second semester onward, he was an estranged existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi turned up at school suddenly in the second semester. His classmates seemed to have been informed of his misfortune beforehand and every single one of them interacted with him as if he was a tumor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no bullying or malicious intent, but it was somehow uncomfortable for them to deal with a victim of such unfortunate circumstances, so Tatsumi was often left alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His grades could not keep up with his classmates because he lost an entire semester of learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His grades steadily dropped, and he quickly became a bottom-ranker who couldn’t keep up in school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the reason why Tatsumi had continued to go to high school was that his late family was very happy when he passed the entrance exam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi continued going to high school in order to meet the expectations of his family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But his grades weren’t doing well, there was no club he was devoted to, and he had nobody he could call a close friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before long, he simply continued going to school out of habit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with the life he had, he was able to look forward to the future. That was because he had Chiiko, his one last family member with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chiiko did not participate in the family vacation and stayed at home. And so, she didn’t die like the rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chiiko was always there waiting for him when he returned to his apartment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi spent his days with only that thought keeping him going.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with his dearest Chiiko, the day of parting came.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had been more than a decade since the day Tatsumi met Chiiko. As a birthday present for the very young Tatsumi, his parents introduced Tatsumi and Chiiko to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, they were almost inseparable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Chiiko couldn’t eat by herself, he took care of her meals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After she had grown bigger, they ate ice cream together during summer. When it was winter, they cuddled up in the kotatsu</span><a id="n1" href="#tln1"><sup>[1]</sup></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it was spring, they went out for walks together, and when it was autumn, they enjoyed various seasonal harvests together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Chiiko got sick, Tatsumi held her and rushed into the hospital, and when Tatsumi caught a cold, Chiiko would always stare at him with worried eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chiiko was his dearest, but a parting approached by way of lifespan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is about just ten days ago that Chiiko had finished her natural lifespan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chiiko had taken her last breath in Tatsumi’s arms as if she was sleeping. Tatsumi could still vividly recall the sensation of that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dreadfulness as the warm and fluffy sensation of Chiiko’s body as it gradually grew colder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi silently cried throughout the night in his apartment void of anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He cried and cried, and continued crying. At daybreak, Tatsumi took Chiiko’s body that had gone completely cold to the neighboring riverbank and buried her corpse there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He made a small grave and, although they were wildflowers, placed some flowers in front of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting his hands together before the grave, he prayed for her happiness in the next world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi prayed and kept praying for her, for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wanted to keep praying forever, but he couldn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High school life greeted its second spring. No, it was the first spring for Tatsumi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With his poor grades and having missed the entire first semester, it was decided early last year that Tatsumi would have to repeat the school year. So when the new school year began, he never showed went to school even once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While part of the reason was because he had to repeat the year, he wanted to be with Chiiko who had begun weakening from old age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without going to school and rarely even leaving his room, Tatsumi looked after Chiiko.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that she had lived up her natural lifespan, he made up his mind. He decided to drop out of school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without any close friends, and having now lost Chiiko, he had absolutely no attachment to high school life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning to his apartment, he changed into his long neglected uniform and headed to school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went to the staff room directly, not even going to the classroom, and silently handed over the dropping-out notification to his homeroom teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeroom teacher seemed to have expected it, and although they said the usual things to stop people from dropping out, there was no enthusiasm behind them. Thus the curtains closed on Tatsumi’s high school life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was after that, did he start to have dreams of the holy maiden every night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dragging on the sorrow of having lost Chiiko, Tatsumi shut himself in his apartment room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the day, he would do nothing but motionlessly stare at Chiiko’s birdcage. Then at night, he would crawl into bed and have the same dream of the holy maiden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He repeated this lifestyle for ten days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What he completely lacked now was any hope and will to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi raised his body from the bed and grabbed his cellphone, opening up pictures of Chiiko.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chiiko…I… What should I do…? Alone…without you, I…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a question he thought about many times throughout the last ten days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatsumi stared at Chiiko’s innocent face on the screen of his phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Round eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soft body which was wrapped in silvery gray feathers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her head a wonderful snow white.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A white-faced cockatiel. </span><a id="n2" href="#tln2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His beloved, last family member who stayed with him ever since he was a child.</span></p>
