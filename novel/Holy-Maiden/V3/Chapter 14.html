<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; Miloulle's Magic</h3>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“We’re changing plans.”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-118" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The &lt;devil&gt; that possessed the giant snow lizard was obviously toying with Tatsumi and the others.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The first plan was a failure, progressing to a situation that required a different strategy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Master…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia had a worried expression flash over her face for an instant, but it was immediately was replaced with a face full of determination. Her voice called out to Tatsumi that was standing before her,</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“The only one that would be able to deal with the giant snow lizard’s speed, in this bad footing, is a &lt;Sky&gt; mana user. But, this is a huge burden on Master…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Understood. Only I can do it, so I have to try.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“While Master is directly confronting the giant snow lizard, we’ll fight against the other snow lizards, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In response to Calcedonia’s words, the others simultaneously nodded in consent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“After defeating the other snow lizards, </span><span class="calibre8">Jadokh and Miloulle, provide assistance to Master as much as possible. While the demon’s movements have been slowed, landlady and I will finish them off with our strongest fire magic&mdash;”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-119" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“No, that’s no good.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While Calcedonia was in the middle of giving out instructions, Tastumi interrupted her,</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-120" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“The person who will deal the last blow is… Miloulle. Leave it to her.”</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“M-Me…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The surprised Miloulle pointed at herself, and Tatsumi smiled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Yes. Get revenge for your old friends by killing it with your own hands. I’ll create that chance.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“U-Understood.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“When you see that chance, at that time, use all your power on one attack and beat him up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi’s line of sight captured the giant snow lizard. At the moment, the giant snow lizard and its subordinates, who were slightly separated from Tatsumi’s party, were steadily watching them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Those eyes that are sparkling in a red color, it’s as if they’re looking down on us, waiting for us to enter their trap, Tatsumi thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Once more, the giant snow lizard let out a roar.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">At the same time, the giant snow lizard and several of the snow lizards charged at Tatsumi’s party.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“You guys can take down the small fries!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Without even checking if his comrades had nodded, or rather, convinced that they would, Tatsumi disappeared from where he was.</span></p>

<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi abruptly disappeared, and in the next instant, he appeared directly in front of the giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru and Miloulle were shocked at the sight of that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“T-Tatsumi disappeared…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“N-No way… H-He was really a &lt;Sky&gt;… user?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh, who was battle ready with a weapon in hand, ran past the two girls who were unintentionally left absentminded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Stop it, both of you. Is this the time to be spacing out? Look, our guests are coming.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh’s tone was light, but his gaze was piercing. Before that piercing gaze, there were several snow lizards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">As if they were gliding on the snow, the magic beasts bared their fangs and came running while clanging their claws together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Seriously… this snow is really hard to stand on, and it’s even more impossible to fight in, yet our opponents can move on it like it’s flat ground… Unfair!”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-121" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh gave a smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, it wasn’t his normal bright smile; it was a ferocious smile that would come from a wild beast staring at its prey.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The snow lizards’ leader opened its mouth wide and started attacking Jadokh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Fufun. Doing such a thing like running towards here, this is a great help!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Though Jadokh’s mobility was limited by the snow, it would be a different story if they came to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With his battle staff, Jadokh lunged into the widely-opened mouth of the snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Having the battle staff thrust into its mouth as a counter to its attack, the snow lizard was lifted into the air. With the battle staff using the head as a fulcrum, the lower body swung towards Jadokh like a pendulum.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With another of his long battle staves, Jadokh swung horizontally, smashing both of the snow lizard’s legs. Then, in that situation, he used his battle-axe to swing downwards from the sky, splitting the snow lizard’s head into two.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Ufu. Our goal today isn’t their materials so we can fight freely this time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Shifting his gaze from the dead snow lizard, Jadokh looked for his next prey.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…You’re quite enthusiastic, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miloulle, who was standing next to Jadokh, asked that while keeping her spear at the ready.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Of course? Tatsumi had confidence in us; he entrusted us with the task of killing the small fries. Because of his confidence, we have to live up to it, don’t we? A favor begets a favor. A grudge begets a grudge. And, confidence should be returned with confidence. That’s what our creed is. Besides…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh took a fleeting sideways glance behind him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“It looks like I’m not the only enthusiastic one.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">From behind, they could hear a sonorous spell’s aria. Of course, that aria was from Calcedonia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Passing by Jadokh, the snow lizard leaped towards the Calcedonia who was chanting the spell.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-122" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">If it was a normal magician, it’d be fatal if the enemy attacked in the middle of the aria. But, without stopping the aria of her spell, Calcedonia countered the snow lizard’s attack.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Spinning the staff around in her hand, she firmly hit the body of the snow lizard using the staff filled with the power of centrifugal force.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">A dry snapping sound echoed, and the snow lizard collapsed onto the snow. Faster than the collapsed snow lizard could rise, Calcedonia completed her aria.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-123" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With the end of the staff, she thrusted at the snow lizard, and a flamethrower-like blaze blew out at the snow lizard, scorching it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Normally, in a forest like this, the〈Fire〉system’s magic wouldn’t be used. Flames burn the forest’s trees and undergrowth, and it could spread uncontrollably.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, right now, the surroundings were full of snow. In this season, the〈Fire〉system’s magic could be used since the probability of the fire spreading is low.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The flames trapped the snow lizards, and their death throes only became louder.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-124" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In order to finish off those snow lizards, stalagmites rushed out of the ground, and, like spears, they stabbed through the bodies of the snow lizards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you very much, landlady.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“No, I think you did more.”</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Setting down the staff, Calcedonia and Eru, who commanded the mole-like earth spirit, smiled at each other.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…I also have to do my best”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Seeing those two going back and forth, Miloulle used the spear in her hands a few times, showing her own power.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“……A-Amazing…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Right before Miloulle’s eyes, a high speed battle developed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miloulle that had completely defeated the small fry snow lizards was wondering how Tatsumi’s battle with the giant snow lizard progressed, and scanned the surroundings with her eyes. Looking at the scene of it, she unintentionally murmured that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The giant snow lizard was moving at high speeds on top of the snow, and Tatsumi was using all of the trees in the surroundings as footholds for three-dimensional movement. In this snow, a human chasing the giant snow lizard like that was basically impossible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">But.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">But, a human was doing that right here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The giant snow lizard leaped around at high speed, kicking off the snow and trees. However, Tatsumi chased after even faster.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">No, he wasn’t faster. He was leaping over space itself, going to where the giant snow lizard was heading to ahead of time and inflicted wounds on it with the sword in his hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Small wounds littered the lizard’s entire body. While the giant snow lizard released a roar full of rage and irritation, it brandished a claw overhead.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-125" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, at the next instant, the human figure that was its enemy disappeared, and appeared at its rear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With a silent exhale, Tatsumi swung his sword. The sword blade was glowing with a golden mana, and, as it came into contact with the giant snow lizard’s body, a violent explosion occurred. </span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi could use several types of magic. &lt;Instant Transition&gt;, &lt;Acceleration&gt;, &lt;Self-Recovery&gt;, and &lt;Mana Strike&gt;.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">&lt;Mana Strike&gt;, a magic that could be said to be more like a sword technique, imbued mana in a sword, and, when it hit the enemy, the mana would explode outwards. It’s not a technique that attacks with mana from afar.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, Tatsumi could use &lt;Instant Transition&gt; and &lt;Acceleration&gt;, so the distance to the enemy didn’t matter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Again, the sword’s dwelling mana exploded out in streaks of gold, and the giant snow lizard’s huge build faltered and swayed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">But, the giant snow lizard’s entire body was covered in tough scales; its vitality was inhuman.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi’s sword slash could only inflict a scratch, and the mana explosion from &lt;Mana Strike&gt; couldn’t inflict a severe injury either.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-127" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Since it was &lt;Mana Strike&gt;, if Tatsumi poured mana into the sword constantly, then it would be possible to break through the giant snow lizard’s tenacious scales. However, without using &lt;Instant Transition&gt;, it would be more than impossible to catch up to the giant snow lizard. He had no choice other than to use a half-charged &lt;Mana Strike&gt;. </span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After making the giant snow lizard eat another &lt;Mana Strike&gt; to the back, Tatsumi used &lt;Instant Transition&gt; to move next to Calcedonia.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…C-Calsey, please…!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi was breathing heavily. His shoulders were heaving intensely, but despite being in the snow, his entire body was sweating.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi had an inexhaustible supply of mana, but not stamina.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Repeatedly using magic and performing those intense maneuvers in the battle naturally made him exhausted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While breathing heavily, with Tatsumi’s shoulders going up and down, Calcedonia touched his shoulder and used her &lt;Stamina Restoration&gt; magic to temporarily restore his stamina.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Yeah, I’m fine. With this, I can still go for a while.”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-128" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With a deep breath, Tatsumi disappeared. And, when he appeared from the rear of the giant snow lizard, he swung his mana-clad sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, Calcedonia understood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Her magic was said to be stamina restoration, but it had limits. As it was, Tatsumi’s stamina would slowly whittle away until it completely ran out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Something had to be done. Calcedonia took her eyes off of Tatsumi and frantically thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In short, it would be best if this entire area had less snow. However, even a child would understand the difficulty of achieving that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">It would be impossible for her &lt;Blaze&gt; magic to melt the entire surrounding area’s snow, and, even Tatsumi using &lt;Instant Transition&gt; to remove this vast range of snow, would be difficult.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi’s movement skill can only move things that he clearly recognises. Because of that, things like “this whole area of snow” is too unclear and can’t be transported.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…At least, if only there were some kind of landmark…”</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The previous time, when Tatsumi went to gather medicinal plants, he drew a circle on top of the snow that could be said to be a landmark. It would be great if she could do the same thing, but the snow was hard to stand on and drawing a circle around the whole area would take too much time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…Something… A magic that would be good, something that could draw a mark on top of the snow… M-Magic…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">At that time, Calcedonia had a light bulb flash in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“L-Landlady!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia turned her head to look at Eru, who was beside her. And then, she talked about what she just thought of with her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">His sword arm was heavy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Nevertheless, he mustered strength with pure willpower and continued swing his sword.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-129" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, his sword attacks were only being repelled by the giant lizard’s tenacious scales.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Constantly breathing heavily, Tatsumi used &lt;Instant Transition&gt; to distance himself from the giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Master!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The voice of the girl he loved reached the ear of Tatsumi, who was constantly breathing roughly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When Tatsumi took a sideways glance, while being careful about the giant snow lizard, he could see that Calcedonia was frantically pointing to something.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">&mdash;What…? What’s Calsey pointing to…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi, still clueless, saw a red glitter in the corner of his eye.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">&mdash;Red…light…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Unintentionally, Tatsumi followed the red light with his eyes. That gave birth to a huge opportunity as it seemed that the snow lizard was confused about the red light, for the beast was often looking around its surroundings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The shine of the red light that Tatsumi saw was almost encompassing the entire area. Almost as if red paint was drawn on top of the snow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Master!! Landlady has drawn the landmark! The snow… Please transfer the snow at once!!”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-130" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">For a second time, he could hear Calcedonia’s voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Because of that, Tatsumi completely understood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">&mdash;That’s right! The light was Eru’s illusion magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When he looked at Eru, her eyes were closed in worry and anxiety. Probably, to maintain the red light on this scale, she needed to concentrate her mind completely.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After tossing aside his sword, Tatsumi slammed his palms on the piled up snow at his feet. </span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Oooooooooooooohhhhhhh!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">From Tatsumi’s mouth, came a glass-shattering scream of fighting spirit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The final remnants of his physical strength was used, and the snow within the drawn “landmark” was transferred in almost an instant.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">A little ways off from Tatsumi’s party, a large amount of snow fell, and a number of trees were knocked down.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-131" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And the snow from the area that Tatsumi, his party, and the giant snow lizard have been around up until now, mostly disappeared. &nbsp;In some parts of the ground, a blackened earth was exposed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With no snow on the ground, the surface became muddy, nevertheless, compared to the time when it was accumulated with snow, movement became much less restricted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“……Miloulle!! I’ll entrust… the rest… to you…!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi collapsed onto the muddy ground. And, as it was, he lied face-up, and, right after, he appeared to breathe heavily in pain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In haste, Calcedonia rushed towards Tatsumi. Jadokh too; he ran with Calcedonia to Tatsumi.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The Eru who used a wide-range illusion magic leaned her shoulder against a nearby tree. Next to her, a small figure was touching her cheek in worry.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-132" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…Humph, jeez!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While looking at her comrades, Miloulle, who was entrusted with the back by Tatsumi, cast aside the spear in her hand and slowly approached the giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…If it’s like this, it’s not just Jadokh that wants to live up to his confidence!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Her eyes gleamed with determination and conviction, and she shouted,</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“I’ll do it! I’ll get revenge for my comrades!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">From Miloulle’s body, a blue light of magic poured out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The light of magic surrounded Miloulle’s body, and the radiance continued to grow.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-133" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The blue light conspicuously shined, and it wasn’t Miloulle’s figure, it was instead an unusual-looking shadow</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">She had a body type on the short and stout side with a large head, and she was covered in slippery scales.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Long and narrow limbs stretched out from that plump body, and there was webbing in between her fingers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Large, prominent eyes. Mouth and gills that flap open and shut. A giant fin that adorned the back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">From her wrists to her elbows, there were two other huge fins, whose pointed ends were as sharp as a blade and shined dangerously.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“……Uh, umm… Ha-Half-fishwoman (<sup class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-6" href="#calibre_link-5" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 pcalibre3 pcalibre2">1</a></sup>) …?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia was helping Tatsumi when she saw that figure and such a fact was revealed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">&lt;Fishwoman Transformation&gt;</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Like that, it was Miloulle’s magic that only she could use.</span></p>
