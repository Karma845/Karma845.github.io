<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Those Who Started to Make a Move</h3>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Thump. Bam.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-78" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That sound originated from her right.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Whilst still dumbfounded, </span><span class="calibre8">Miluoelle</span><span class="calibre8"> moved her sight to that place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">There was Tadd, with blank look in his face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">He was pushed down by Giant Lizard’s hind leg, while its sharp claw pierced his chest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Hagh…Gah…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">From Tadd’s mouth, breath and red liquid leaked out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With its well developed hind legs, the giant snow lizard had leaped toward </span><span class="calibre8">Miluoelle and the rest from its original position, which should have been quite far apart, and with the momentum of its rush it planted its hind legs’ nail in Tadd’s chest, piercing his heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The giant snow lizard moved slightly above Tadd. And the result was the nail gouged even deeper toward Tadd’s chest, scattering something red toward the snow in their surroundings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Right after the grating sound reached Miluoelle’s ear, a sound of wind blowing, and then something snapping followed after.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-79" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While stepping on Tadd’s body without care, it swung its elastic and long tail toward Kuoron who was next to Tadd.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Kuoron who hit by its tail can’t even make a sound as he was blown away and crashed back first to a tree nearby. And he crumpled on the trees’ roots just like that.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Only at that time did </span><span class="calibre8">Miluoelle</span><span class="calibre8"> finally come to her senses.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Ru-run!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">She shouted at Ganz who still alive.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tadd’s signs of life were already starting to fade. There is no human would stay alive after their heart was pierced, especially by those sharp claws.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That can also be said about Kuoron. Kuoron, who was crumbled at the tree’s roots, had his neck twisted in an impossible direction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">This might sound cruel, but Miluoelle chose to prioritize her and Ganz’s life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The giant snow lizard in front of them is not an enemy they can defeat with their combined power. That’s why their only option is escape.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While gritting her back teeth, knowing they are unable to recover her comrades’ corpses, Miluoelle ordered Ganz to escape. While she herself, using her trump card, magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The duration of her magic is extremely short. However during that time, her physical ability, attack power, and defensive power will rise dramatically.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Using all those reinforcement, she will make herself a bait and let Ganz escape. And then when she discovered an opportunity, she will also run away.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That’s the plan Miluoelle thought in a short amount of time. However that plan quickly went awry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Ganz didn’t follow Miluoelle’s direction, instead he rushed toward their fallen comrades.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“O-Oi Kuoron!! Tadd!! Are you fine!?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">&ndash;Don’t go over there Ganz!! Run!!</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miluoellle tried to shout, but no voice come out, and it won’t reached him either.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Ganz who ran hastily towarda their comrades, never reached their side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">A shadow fell towards the running Ganz.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When he noticed and looked up, the sole of foot of the giant snow lizard already right in front his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…Eh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Ganz let out an idiotic voice. At the same time, his head was kicked by the hind leg of giant snow lizard, and then crushed like a ripe fruit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">&mdash;ah…..ah…..</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miluoelle can only looks at that scene in a daze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And while the giant snow lizard looked at her with its crimson eyes, something inside her breaking apart.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-81" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">&ndash;…AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA…….!!!!</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Shouting a strange voice in her heart, the frenzied Miluoelle rushed toward the giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Her speed after being reinforced by magic is equal with the giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In an instant she covered the distance between them and then used both of her hands to punch at it with all her might.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Normally, there is no way she would be able to pierce through the scales of the giant snow lizard. However, with her attack power which had been reinforced with magic, in addition to her frenzied state, she successfully pierced through giant snow lizard’s scales.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">A red line ran straight at giant snow lizard’s white body, and from there, black blood spurted out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">At that time, the giant snow lizard let out a pained roar.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Succumbing to anger, Milouelle continued to mindlessly swing her arms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And when her anger subsided, the figure of giant snow lizard no longer there. Did it feel wary of her after she was reinforced with magic and injured it, and decided to run away? Or perhaps Miluoelle herself unconsciously ran away from it while in her frenzied state?</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While she noticed she already walked trudgingly, naked, in the middle of snow piled forest. And it seems her mana already used up at some point of time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Losing both her comrades and &nbsp;all of her equipment, Milouelle walked naked in the middle of snow without destination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When she hugged herself because she couldn’t stand the cold, she heard a beast roar from somewhere.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Is it the roar of the wounded and angry giant snow lizard, or is it from different beast?</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">She couldn’t determine which, but when she heard that roar, panic run through her body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With no equipment, no mana, and no comrades, she currently has no means to defend herself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Driven by her fear of being attacked by beast, without even confirming her direction, she broke into run.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Naked, in the middle of the snow piled forest.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-82" class="calibre3"></span>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Please…take me together with you…revenge for my comrades…no, I don’t think I will be able to defeat it alone…But at least, let me stand to watch the defeat of that giant snow lizard…please…I beg you.”</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miluoelle bowed her head as she pleaded. However she also quickly raised it again and gaze toward Tatsumi and co.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-83" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miluoelle’s eyes were wet with tears. However there was also conviction in them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia and Jadokh who noticed it turned toward Tatsumi.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…What should we do, master?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…What should we do, Tatsumi-chan?”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-84" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Asked with same question by both of them, Tatsumi racked his brain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Bringing her back with them certainly has some merit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However brief, she has experienced trading blows with the giant snow lizard which had become a demon. Moreover, she even wounded it.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That experience might become valuable asset, and it doesn’t seem she will drag them down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And even if they refuse to let her join, she will, undoubtedly, move alone to challenge the giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In that case putting her under our command is better. That was Tatsumi’s judgement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Alright. Milluoelle-san, let’s go together. However you must follow our orders. Never ever try to take individual action. That’s the condition.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Alright…ah…I understand. Errm…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“My name Tatsumi…Tatsumi Yamagata. And they are&mdash;“</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“&mdash;I am Calcedonia Yamagata. Pleased to meet you, Milluoele-san.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia cut in the middle of Tatsumi’s introduction, and introduced herself while smiling sweetly. Moreover, she shrewdly added ‘Yamagata’ in her name to keep Milluoelle in check.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While stifling her laughter, Jadokh introduced herself following her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…I am Jadokh. As you can see I am a shade. Pleased to meet you, Milluoelle-chan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh winked, looking at Milluoelle, who couldn’t help becoming flustered.</span></p>
<span></span><span id="calibre_link-85" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Alright, we are going to prepare, during that time please rest a bit more, Milluoelle-san.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“You can call me Milluoel. Since it seems we are close in term of age.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“I see, then please call me Tatsumi.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Please call me Calce.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Of course, you can also call me Jadokh.”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-86" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After changing their way of addressing each other, they started to move toward their own goal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru who watch over them from slight distance away, smiling happily despite feeling a bit out of place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“They might become a decent team. I’m looking forward to it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Losing her comrades is certainly a tragedy for Milluoelle.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-87" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, although this might sound cold, anyone who worked in the monster hunting business should have this level of determination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru hoped Milluoele would be able to overcome this tragedy and grow up as monster hunter.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And then her existence would also stimulate novice hunters like Tatsumi and Jadokh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Even while looking forward toward their exploits thereafter, Eru too started her own preparations.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Since a demon appeared near the royal capital, she would also give her assistance in defeating it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When she headed toward her room to prepare.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly a question crossed her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“………Come to think of it, what system is Milluoelle’s magic from? And what kind of magic is it?”</span></p>
<span></span><span id="calibre_link-89" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Giuseppe, who received information about the demon’s existence from Tatsumi, gave a formal order to Tatsumi and Calcedonia for them to subjugate it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Of course, there are some in the upper echelon of the temple who raised objections from the fact that Calcedonia who has high ability in devil exorcism and also has a lot of achievements teamed up with nameless monster hunters.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, after knowing Tatsumi is among them, of course the sound of objections died down in its own.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The second &lt;sky&gt; magician, and also Calcedonia’s fiancé. Additionally, he received direct instruction from Giuseppe, and Tatsumi, who lately aspired to become supreme priest, is already famous not only among Savaiv temple, but among the other temples, and even a part of Largofiely Kingdom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi who able to use &lt;sky&gt; magic, which is the most effective against &lt;evil&gt;, and Calcedonia the famous &lt;&lt;Holy Maiden&gt;&gt;. If the two of them teamed up, there would be no one who would object.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After all, the demon subjugation this time is a direct order from the supreme priest. Even the kingdom wouldn’t be able to object.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In due form, Tatsumi and Calcedonia accepted the order from supreme priest, while Jadokh and Milluoele will be employed under them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However there’s no way they would belittle Jadokh and Milluoelle. Because both of them will fight shoulder-to-shoulder against the giant snow lizard together with Tatsumi and Calcedonia.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Additionally, Eru will also be added in their line up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Though, rather than as fighting power against giant snow lizard, Eru’s main role is searching the enemy. </span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Currently the demon in question is lurking inside the forest near the royal capital. However the definite hiding location is unknown. If they tried to find it with sending many people, the monster which was possessed by &lt;devil&gt; will quickly leave the royal capital because of its intellect.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The reason Giuseppe only ordered Tatsumi and Calcedonia is because of this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In the time they could ask for cooperation from the other devil exorcist from Savaiv, or from the other temples to hunt it, the demon would have already left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That’s why, in demon subjugation using a small number of people is the most effective, that’s what experience taught them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">According Eru’s proposal, they will rely on spirit to find the demon. </span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Spirit user able to communicated with spirits. She planned to ask forest trees’ spirits and snow spirits about the whereabouts of the giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Spirit exists everywhere. If you want to know something you just need to ask them&mdash;is what usually people think, but the reality is not like that.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-90" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Why you ask? That’s because Spirits and humans&mdash;demi-humans as well&mdash;have great differences in mentality.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Especially for spirits, they lack the concept of time. They can only differentiate between ‘now’ and ‘past’, and they also don’t have any concept about ‘future’.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">For example, if you ask them ‘Is there snow lizard inside the forest?’ they will only answer ‘I saw it before’.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Moreover the spirits also can’t differentiate between giant snow lizard and normal snow lizard. They only recognize a snow lizard as a ‘big white lizard’ with how big being quite ambiguous compared with human standards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That’s why when asking spirit you need to be meticulous.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Choose words that the spirits can understand, and you must analyze the spirit’s words properly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, for Eru who is the founder of spirit magic, that problem undoubtedly will be easily solved and she can obtain beneficial information.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And so, the plan to subjugate demon with Tatsumi, Calcedonia, Eru, Jadokh, and Milluoele has begun.</span></p></div>
