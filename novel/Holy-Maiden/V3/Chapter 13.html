<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; Another Mana User</h3>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Eh…!? Miloulle is also a mana user…?”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi asked in shock. Calcedonia nodded towards Tatsumi’s words in silence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Right after Eru asked the spirits about the whereabouts of the demon beast, the party headed there with Miloulle walking beside Jadokh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And with a slight distance between them, Tatsumi and Calcedonia guarded the rear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Yes. Before, she said her magic was self-taught. However, all magic incantations are already completed, in other words, there is no such thing as self-taught magic incantations.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“That means, self-taught here means no incantation…and so the same mana user like me. But, is there no possibility her magic is a spirit magic like Eru’s?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“There is no way the landlady wouldn’t notice it if her magic is spirit magic.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru is the founder of spirit magic. Just like Calcedonia said, there was no way she didn’t notice if Miloulle’s magic was spirit magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Additionally, Miloulle said the duration of her magic is short. I think it is another proof that she is a mana user.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“I see. After all mana user constantly emits mana normally.”</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Hearing Calcedonia’s explanation, Tatsumi was also convinced that her conjecture was correct.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Controlling mana without incantations, in other words, an ancient form of magic. To keep the magic active, the users need to continuously expend mana. And thus their mana will be depleted in an instant. Tatsumi is an exception because he can control mana from an external source, but it seemed Miloulle is normal.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-106" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Then…the reason Miloulle didn’t say anything about her magic is because…she is a mana user?”</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t understand that much…and also…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia tilted her head. And as usual her ahoge swayed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Concentrating her consciousness towards her eyes, she saw the mana’s light from Miloulle’s body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…Her mana’s light colour is blue, I thought her magic is a derivation from the &lt;water&gt; magic system, however…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Perhaps Miloulle’s mana comes from extremely rare mana system, thought Tatsumi.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">A rare mana system meant that, just like Tatsumi’s &lt;Sky&gt;, there was no one who researched the spells. That’s why magicians who have rare mana system usually are mana user.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…Well, though we don’t know the specific magic Miloulle has, the plan doesn’t change.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Coinciding with Tatsumi’s answer, Calcedonia smiled.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">No matter what kind of formidable enemy awaited them, as long Tatsumi…the natural enemy of &lt;devil&gt; was there, there’s no way they will lose. At that time, Calcedonia was confident in it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">&ndash;That’s right.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">At that time, they haven’t&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">GAAAAAAAAANNNNNNN. A thunderous roar resounded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">At the same time, light gushed out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That roaring sound and light’s true form was Calcedonia’s magic &lt;&lt;Thunder Storm&gt;&gt;. Thunder rained upon the designated area.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And when the thunderous roars and light stopped, next blew violent tempest of ice and snow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The one who created the ice and snow tempest was Eru, who used the power of the contracted ice spirit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, Calcedonia’s and Eru’s magic was unable to seize the target.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Their target&mdash;the giant snow lizard possessed by &lt;devil&gt;&mdash;freely moved on top of the snow and easily evaded the magic’s aim.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Damn, it’s too nimble!!”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-107" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru cursed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">No matter how many times Eru and Calcedonia casted their magic, the giant snow lizard kept evading them all. Their plan was to weaken it with Eru and Calcedonia’s combination, as they were both excellent magicians, and then for Jadokh and Miloulle to finish it off. And lastly, Tatsumi will terminate the &lt;devil&gt; that separated from the giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, their plan was destroyed in the first phase.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The target giant snow lizard was more agile than Calcedonia and Eru predicted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia and Eru have experienced facing against giant snow lizards many times.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Using that experience as the base and added the variable of &lt;devil&gt;’s strengthening, they predicted the strength of the giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, when they met it for real, the ability of the target giant snow lizard was far stronger from their prediction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And because of that, they were unable to seize the target from distance, alas only exhausted their own mana instead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">On the other hand, Jadokh and Miloulle who were tasked with close combat were unbale to get close because of the giant snow lizard’s bizarre speed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Even now, whenever Jadokh rushed ahead and swung his two-handed battle axe or brandished his battle mallet, the giant snow lizard will casually hop out of his range as if ridiculing him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And for Miloulle, since they unable to seize it the first time, she lost the timing to use her magic.</span></p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Let’s turn back the time a bit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru led the vanguard of Tatsumi’s party. And suddenly, she stopped and looked around with a sharp gaze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…Something is here…! Please be careful…!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">There’s no need to ask ‘what is it?’. Tatsumi, Calcedonia, Jadokh, and also Eru, directed their gaze to the surrounding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Among them, Miloulle put down the knapsack on her back and threw it to the snow.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-108" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“O, oi, Miloulle…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While still probing the surrounding, Tatsumi asked.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Don’t mind me. If I don’t do that…it’s because when I activate my magic everything I wear will break…to not let it be lost in the snow I use the knapsack as a landmark.”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-109" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miloulle said it with a red face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Now that she said it, there was a red cloth wrapped in the knapsack she’d thrown. That’s the landmark she talked about.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Currently, she only wore clothes and defensive cloak, but no armour. If what she said is true&mdash;well, there’s no need to doubt her though&mdash;she didn’t wear armour because she was convinced she needed to use her magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In her hand was a spear longer than her height. It seemed her main weapon is a spear.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-110" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">By the way, because Miloulle lost all her belongings when she met with the giant snow lizard, for this mission, she borrowed money from Calcedonia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi and Jadokh wore the usual hardened leather armour and their usual weapons, while Eru wore a white-soft looking leather armour and a cloak over it. She also has a short sword on her waist, but that’s nothing more than for self-protection.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">As for Calcedonia, she didn’t wear anything like armour. However, underneath her cloak, although it looked like any common grey robe without any ornaments, it actually was a magic-sealed armament that boasted higher defensive capabilities than a common metal armour.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In her hand, she has a single crooked, old-looking staff. However, that old-looking staff was also another magic sealed armament that was capable of heightening Calcedonia’s mana.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Tatsumi-san, Miloulle-san, please stop your discussion&mdash;”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While Eru rebuked them like that, suddenly her words were cut in the middle and she looked up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">From above the trees around them, a number of snow lizards fell down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“They are not the giant snow lizard….but normal snow lizards!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Did it gather the survivors from the herd…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With weapon in hand, Jadokh and Miloulle quickly intercepted the falling snow lizards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Although the aforementioned giant snow lizard only saw the herd as another food source, it seemed that because the wound in its hand inflicted by Miloulle, it used them as bodyguards to protect itself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miloulle’s long spear successfully pierced the snow lizard’s throat, while Jadokh battle axe pulverized one of the snow lizard’s head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, of course, they unable to intercept all of them, some which safely landed in the snow, looking around and setting their targets to Calcedonia and Eru.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">To protect the two of them who were not suited for close combat, Tatsumi stood between the snow lizards and them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, when he drew his sword and almost rushed towards the snow lizards, from his right and left, lightning and ice arrows flew and ended the snow lizards with one strike.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi blanked, and when he looked behind, the two magicians showed him a sweet smile.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-111" class="calibre3"></span>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Normal snow lizards were not a problem for Tatsumi and co.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">A little while after the start of their battle against the snow lizards, suddenly a roar of a beast resounded. It was a roar they had heard before&mdash;the roar of giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Hearing that roar, the snow lizards stopped fighting and started to run.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…Did the giant snow lizard just ordered its underlings to retreat…?”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-112" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh stopped swinging his battle axe and then rested it on his shoulder as he followed the snow lizards with his gaze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“What should we do, Calce? Let them go? Or pursue?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Let’s not chase them too far. However, from that roar, I can grasp the general direction of the giant snow lizard. Let’s head there while keeping vigilant.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Hearing Calcedonia’s decision, the others nodded.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-113" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And then after rearranging their formation, their party started to move again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">This time Jadokh and Miloulle walked in the front as the vanguard. Right behind them were Calcedonia and Eru as rear guard and Tatsumi in the last line.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-114" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Using the direction from the roar and the footsteps of the snow lizard, they advanced in the snow-piled forest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And then ten minutes later, something happened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly from the snow, the giant snow lizard appeared and attacked them. It seemed the giant snow lizard hid in the snow, waiting for them to arrive there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The one the demon targeted was Miloulle. Perhaps it remembered the fact that Miloulle injured it. Or perhaps it judged that Miloulle was the easiest target.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Because it was too sudden, Miloulle was unable to react in time against the attacking giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With drool smeared sharp fang, it attacked Miloulle. The fang dug into her body and scarlet blood splattered around&mdash;was what the giant snow lizard expected, however, in reality, it closed its mouth without being able to bite onto anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When Calcedonia looked toward the giant snow lizard’s back, she can see Tatsumi, who successfully brought Miloulle away from harm’s way.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-115" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In the split second Tatsumi noticed the giant snow lizard attack, he quickly teleported to Miloulle’s side and then teleported again toward the giant snow lizard’s back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Master! Miloulle-san!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“We are fine! Just do it as planned!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After Tatsumi answered Calcedonia’s worried voice, they started as they planned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia started to chant a spell, while Eru called her contracted spirits.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">As for Jadokh and Miloulle, they quickly guarded the defenseless magicians.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The first one to attack was Eru with her spirit magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Rurra-kun!! Please!”</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In front of Eru’s fingertip, a ball of light with the size of small child’s head appeared. This was Eru’s contracted light spirit, Rurra-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Rurra-kun shook its body and then from its surrounding smaller balls of light appeared. And then after shaking once more, the balls of light rushed towards the giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The small balls of light&mdash;the light bullets rushed toward the giant snow lizard following their respective arcs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When they thought the light bullets would land on the giant snow lizard’s body, suddenly the giant snow lizard performed an overhead jump and barely evaded the rain of light.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The light bullets which lost its target collided with each other and then disappeared just like that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The giant snow lizard soared in the air. However, it won’t be able to move in the air. Aiming for that, purple lightning was released from Calcedonia’s palm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The purple lightning tore through the air and attacked the giant snow lizard which currently was still in the air. However, the giant snow lizard used its long tail to change its posture in the air, and then kicked the tree nearby and avoided the purple lightning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“No-no way&mdash;!“</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“In the air…it can move like that in the air&ndash;!”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-116" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The two magicians became dumbfounded. Because the magic they believed would hit was evaded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Normal snow lizards, no, even the usual giant snow lizards won’t be able to evade their magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">To think the giant snow lizard in front of them could evade it easily made Calcedonia and Eru freeze on the spot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The sly demon didn’t miss it and once again kicked a tree and attacked the two of them from above.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The claws of its hind legs glittered. If this goes on Calcedonia and Eru will be shredded by the sharp claws.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, right before the giant snow lizard’s claw reached them, the two of them disappeared. Of course, it was Tatsumi who brought them away through teleportation, again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Taking some distance from the giant snow lizard, Tatsumi carried Calcedonia and Eru with both hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…Calce, it seems we are the one trapped by the giant snow lizard…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi said it without letting the giant snow lizard out of his sight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And then when Calcedonia’s legs returned to the snow, she understood what Tatsumi trying to say.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“……The snow here…it is softer than the other places…”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-117" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">It seemed this place was where the snow blew and accumulated, and thus the snow still retained its soft property. Additionally, the snow was pretty new and has yet to congeal, in other words: powder snow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The snow easily caught Tatsumi’s party’s legs and thus restricted their movement. Especially for close combat specialists like Jadokh and Miloulle, their mobility was shaved by a great amount.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">On the other hand, for the giant snow lizard which adapted in a snowy region, its leg won’t be caught by the soft snow and was able to move freely. And more than that, just like what it displayed before, this giant snow lizard was evidently nimbler than common giant snow lizard, and thus their difference in movement speed will become even more pronounced.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Anticipating Tatsumi’s party, the giant snow lizard hid and waited in this place while using the other snow lizards to lure them here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When they noticed, the other snow lizards standing beside the giant snow lizard and bare their fangs, intimidating Tatsumi’s party.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia and Eru, magicians who excelled in magic, Jadokh and Miloulle, warriors who excel in close combat. And then Tatsumi, the &lt;Sky&gt; magic user the natural enemy of &lt;devil&gt;.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Despite they felt it would become an easy fight earlier, they were forced to understand that currently, they were falling into an unforeseen predicament.</span></p></div>
