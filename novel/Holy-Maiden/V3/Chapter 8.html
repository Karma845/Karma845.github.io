<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Hunt</h3>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Although getting a foothold on top of the snow was exceedingly difficult, its nimble body was not restricted by it.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-54" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">As if it was running on an open plain without snow, it used its legs to kick away at the snow as it chased after its prey.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The Snow Lizard &ndash; a 1.3 meter tall monster that could stand up on its two hind legs. If you measured from the tip of its tail to the head it was a 2 meter long being.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With its evolved hind legs, it had great jumping power. It was a comparatively small, but carnivorous, monster which lived in small packs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Originally, lizard type monsters were poikilotherms (ED: In layman’s terms, a cold blooded animal). If the temperature went down, they would go into hibernation, ceasing all movements. But, maybe common sense like that did not apply to the creatures of this world, or maybe there was some other reason.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">With its whole body covered in white scales, this lizard could adapt perfectly in this cold environment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Even now, one of the snow lizards jumped up into the air, and used its sharp claws on the legs to tear apart its prey. This attack coupled with the falling velocity of the jump could even bring down a tree with a single kick.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">But.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Humph, too slow~”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">It was the creature judged as a prey by the snow lizards. It let out a fearless grin. It raised two of its four arms that each held a battle staff above its head, and easily blocked the attack of the snow lizard.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-55" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And then, it released the power in its body at once. The snow lizard once again jumped above its head. No! It was thrown above head with great strength, as the prey used its remaining two hands, which held a giant war-ax, to violently mow down the snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">A low sound rang out across the snow covered grove. And then, the white snow above the ground was covered in darkish, red coloured blood. </span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-56" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The snow lizard’s body was severed in two as it fell to the snowy ground, spilling blood, flesh and entrails on it.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The supposed ‘prey’ of the snow lizard &mdash; Jadokh the Shade, moved back a little in order to avoid the blood and entrails that was falling from the sky.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“My, I’m completely dirty.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Though he was speaking lightly, his eyes were already filled with a sharp glint, searching for the next ‘prey’.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Deciding the nearest snow lizard to be the next target, he moved unimaginably nimbly on top of the snow towards the poor ‘prey’.</span></p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The snow lizards, which have adapted themselves in a snow covered environment, could obviously move fast in it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Repeating their small mincing jumps again and again, they drive their prey, which can’t move in the snow as it pleases, into a dead end, and then go for the kill. This was their hunting method.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">But the prey this time could move on top of the snow at an equal speed to, or maybe even faster than, the snow lizards in this environment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">One of the snow lizards chased after the prey while baring its white fangs.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">But the prey&mdash; Tatsumi, warded off the fang with his buckler and in the next moment he vanished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In a blink of an eye he appeared in the snow lizards’ blind spot, and attacked its scale-covered hide with his sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Blood gushed out from the newly opened wound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">But the blood did not touch Tatsumi, as the next moment he once again vanished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After that, he appeared and disappeared time and time again, draining away the snow lizards’ stamina.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Before long, the snow lizards movement became visibly sluggish, as Tatsumi delivered the final blow.</span></p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi and Jadokh. The hunt of these two novice monster hunters was being watched quietly by Calcedonia from a distance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">There was no worry in her ruby red eyes. If it’s Tatsumi and Jadokh, they shouldn’t lose to the likes of snow lizards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Even if they got wounded, as long as it wasn’t a large or fatal injury, she could use her healing magic. The two, having that in their mind, could hunt with relief.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Before long, the last snow lizard of the group was defeated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The noisy sounds all stopped, as the surrounding fell into silence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The only sounds left were the gentle swaying of the leaves in the breeze and the loud breaths of Tatsumi and Jadokh who were exhausted from the long battle.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-57" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Confirming that there were no more monsters left in the surrounding, they sheathed their weapons and headed towards Calcedonia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Good work, you two. It was a really good battle.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Humph, thank you Calsey, dear.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“How about you Calsey?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“I’m fine, dear. No snow lizards came this way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Leave it to us. It’s the job of a monster hunter to protect his employee too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The employee that Jadokh mentioned were labourers, who would carry the spoils of battle, and do other odd jobs for the monster hunter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">An employee doesn’t have any rights over the spoils as he didn’t directly participate in the battle. So other than the money paid by a monster hunter as remuneration, the spoils won’t go to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In most cases, people with similar battle strength form hunting teams. That’s why, novice monster hunters often join an advance monster hunter team as an employee to gain experience and learn how to fight better.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Compared to Tatsumi and Jadokh who were novices, Calcedonia was much more experienced as a Monster hunter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Normally, Tatsumi and Jadokh were ‘below her status’. So there was no reason for her to become their employee. But for some reason she became the employee of the team and accompanied then in the hunt. As for what the reason was, is there really a need to explain it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And Calcedonia, who was a veteran Monster hunter, was currently reviewing their battle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Certainly, as a [Fighters] you two fight wonderfully. But as a [Monster Hunter], it was most certainly a failure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">At the harsh criticism, Tatsumi and Jadokh stiffened. But neither of them voiced out in rejection and continued to listen to what she had to say.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Monster hunters bring back the hide, fur, fangs, claws, bones and sometimes even the internal organs of their prey as materials. They then sell them to earn a living. That’s why, they try their hardest to not damage any parts of the monster that might become sellable. Certainly, if it was a large sized monster, then it would be okay to attack over and over again to shave away at its life. But for small monsters such as snow lizards, the preferred way is to hit their vital point and end the battle in an instant.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia’s gaze then moved behind them, where the corpses of the monsters Jadokh and Tatsumi killed laid.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Some of them had been cleaved in two by Jadokh’s superhuman power, and some of them had innumerable small cuts all over their body. At a single glance you could see that the [Commodity Value] they had was close to zero.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“If this was a subjugation mission to get rid of a beast that had been laying waste to fields then it would have been fine. But dear, your mission this time was to [Hunt]. And not to [Hunt] for food but [Hunt] for materials. If you see it from that viewpoint, then the [Hunt] this time is obviously a failure.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Being so severely judged by Calcedonia, Tatsumi powerlessly dropped his shoulders. And Jadokh, he too loosely hung his for arms down, as he gazed at the sky.</span></p><span></span>
<span></span><span id="calibre_link-58" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The reason why Tatsumi and Jadokh went out to hunt snow lizards this time was because they were a newly formed team; they wanted to confirm each other’s strengths.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Of course, selling the monster spoils they got from the hunt was also an objective.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The hide of the snow lizards are good for cold protection, and they are visually beautiful too. So in the winter they can be sold for making overcoats, and even defensive gear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Also, its meat was filled with nutrients. In this winter where small animals were scarce, they were a good source of food.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-59" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">But as Calcedonia said right then, the hide of the snow lizards they hunted before were filled with cuts. That would definitely strike hard against the price so they had to be prepared mentally. Fortunately the meat was still good so it should sell for a good price.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After taking in the last bit of criticism Calcedonia had to offer, they quickly went on the dismantle the corpses with her help.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“……. Both of you look really used to this….”</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Seeing the two dismantling with such efficiency made Tatsumi mutter that in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Certainly Tatsumi had trained his body after coming to this world. &nbsp;But simply being strong and being able to live in the wild were two different things.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">No matter how strong one was, or how strong the monster he could defeat was, that alone could not guarantee that a person can live out in the wild.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Because battle techniques, and techniques to securely obtain food from the nature, were two different techniques.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi had yet to study techniques such as efficiently dismantling prey, or obtaining food and materials without harming their value.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“It’s alright. If it’s you, then I am sure you can learn them in no time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, I’ll properly remember how Calsey does it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Okay. Then, first about how to skin this part. You have to keep this area in check while&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">For Tatsumi who grew up in modern day Japan, the scenery of a beast being taken apart really wasn’t one he was eager to see. But for him who decided to live in this world, who is aiming to become an exorcist after becoming a brilliant monster hunter, this was a path he could not avoid.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While forcibly pushing the bad feeling down his throat, he kept looking at Calcedonia’s hands as she explained the ins and outs of the job.</span></p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi and Calcedonia were getting along perfectly while dismantling the monsters.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh, who was watching them from a bit further away, had a pleasant smile on his face.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-60" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“……Really, Tatsumi boy is full of surprises.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh muttered quietly, as to not let them hear him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When Tatsumi and Jadokh wanted to find a suitable target to test each other’s skills, news of a group of small snow lizards appearing in the suburbs of the capital reached Jadokh’s ears.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">No matter how much the snow lizards adapted in the cold, the amount of animals that can be their food in this season decreases harshly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That’s why they appear near human habitats like this from time to time.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-61" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Snow lizards didn’t pose much of a threat. As long as it wasn’t too huge of a group, then he and Tatsumi should be able to deal with them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">So after consulting the two of them, they decided to hunt the snow lizards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">For other novices like them, snow lizards were moderately hard preys. And besides, they weren’t the only ones who were going after the group of monsters.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">So before the others get to them first, they decided to finish the hunt. The next day, they decided to start preparing for the hunt.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-62" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">On the appointed day of their departure, Tatsumi brought along Calcedonia to meet up with Jadokh, who was waiting in front of the [Elven Resthouse].</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Seeing Tatsumi bring along a lady, Jadokh’s eyes opened wide in shock. And after learning that the lady was the fabled &lt;&lt;Holy Maiden&gt;&gt; of the Temple of Savaiv, his eyes opened even wider.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-63" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Moreover, he then learnt that the &lt;&lt;Holy Maiden&gt;&gt; was his fiancée. She was going to accompany them as an employee.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">At this point, Jadokh’s mouth was gaping wide open, and his mental state was in a mess.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">But Jadokh’s time to be shocked didn’t just end there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">He soon realized an even more shocking fact.</span></p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After searching for the rumoured group of snow lizards in the said forest, they fortunately bumped into the group quickly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi and Jadokh took position for battle quickly, and Calcedonia who was the employee took shelter in a safe zone.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-64" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That’s how the start of the battle played out. But, as soon as it did, Jadokh was hit with the greatest impact he felt all day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi, who was right beside him, suddenly disappeared, and in the next moment, he appeared behind the snow lizard group.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…………what?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Even though it was in the middle of a battle, Jadokh just stood there staring at Tatsumi.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Mister Jadokh!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia’s sharp voice woke him up from his trance, and he noticed one of the snow lizards was coming straight at him with its fangs brandished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">He immediately thrust the war-axe into the snow lizards open mouth. The pitiful snow lizard was blasted away with a mouth full of smashed fangs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“My, how careless of me… But… still….”</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Though he was still conscious of the battlefield, he kept looking at Tatsumi’s figure with his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi repeatedly appeared and disappeared. He always positioned himself in the snow lizard’s blind spot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“That… is that maybe… the &lt;&lt;Instant Transition&gt;&gt; magic, of the legendary &lt;Sky&gt; magic system?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In the past there was only a single person who managed to use &lt;Sky&gt; magic, and &lt;&lt;Instant Transition&gt;&gt; was something almost synonymous with &lt;Sky&gt; magic. So of course, Jadokh had heard of it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Certainly Tatsumi mentioned that he was a mage. But for him to be a legendary &lt;Sky&gt; system mage,</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…..Really, just who is he… that boy..”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">He swung his weapon, and killed the snow lizards in the surrounding. But his eyes still chased after Tatsumi’s back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Engaged to the &lt;&lt;Holy Maiden&gt;&gt; of the Temple of Savaiv, and a user of the legendary &lt;Sky&gt; system.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">From what he could see, Tatsumi and the &lt;&lt;Holy Maiden&gt;&gt; weren’t in a predetermined engagement by their parents, but they were actually truly in love with each other. No, rather, the &lt;&lt;Holy Maiden&gt;&gt; was the one who was completely head over heels for Tatsumi.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-65" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre4"><span class="calibre8">Maybe, did I just form a team with someone who might become a big-shot in the future?</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That thought flashed through his mind, as he grinned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">His curiosity towards Tatsumi grew even larger, as in his mind he decided to work together with Tatsumi from now on, no matter what happens. He then turned his attention towards the snow lizard in front of him.</span></p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi, who was covered in fat and blood, somehow managed to finish the dismantling work.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After equally distributing the gathered meat, hide, fangs, claws and bones, they decided to return back to the capital for now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">It was then.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh’s ears which boasted high sensitivity picked up a faint sound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Be careful, you two. There is something nearby.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Warning Tatsumi and Calcedonia in a low voice, he carefully scanned the surroundings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">As the three held their breaths like that, finally, something white came out from a nearby thicket with a rustling sound.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…………Huh!?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Oh my?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Eh…….?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">They all opened their eyes wide in disbelief at what appeared.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Because,</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">what staggered out of the thicket and appeared before the three was a completely naked human lady.</span></p></div>
