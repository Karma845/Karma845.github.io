<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Right Before the Decisive Battle</h3>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In front of their eyes was the trace of the tragedy.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-91" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The place Tatsumi and co. stood was where Miloulle and her comrades encountered the &lt;devil&gt; possessed giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Blood splattered in the white snow. The partly eaten snow lizards’ corpses scattered here and there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And among those partly eaten snow lizards’ corpses, something that were certainly not snow lizards were mixed in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…Kuoron…Tadd…Ganz…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Their corpses were so damaged that they didn’t want to continue looking at it. Perhaps because their corpses were left in the snow, the decaying didn’t progress much. Looking at their partly eaten corpses, Tatsumi desperately held down the nausea attacking him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…The snow lizard pack we subjugated…perhaps they ran away from the boss which was possessed by &lt;devil&gt;. I’m sure of it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, I think so too. Near the royal capital, there were many sighting of small scale snow lizard packs. Perhaps in the beginning the pack was pretty big, however after their boss was possessed by &lt;devil&gt; and become demon, they were scattered.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru supplemented Jadokh’s conjecture.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After they had re-examined the rumour of snow lizard packs sightings near the royal capital, they found out that the rumour could be heard everywhere.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-92" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru who managed inn-cum-bar knew very well about those rumours. That’s why her conjecture couldn’t be wrong.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While listening to their conversations, Tatsumi glanced toward Miloulle.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-93" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Right now, she was kneeling at the snow, and she didn’t even hide her flowing tears.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi could sympathize with her feelings, because he too had experienced losing his family members all at once.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When he was about to be seized by the sadness of losing his family, Calcedonia snuggled up to Tatsumi’s side and gently gripped his hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi looked at Calcedonia, and Calcedonia also looked back at him. And then she smiled softly as if comforting Tatsumi. It seemed Calcedonia could grasp Tatsumi’s mental state.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Master, let’s pray for those who fell in this place.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Ahh…That’s right.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">As a priest, Tatsumi also learnt various types of prayers. Tatsumi stood beside Calcedonia, and they started to speak words of prayers together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Among their voices, sometimes Miloulle’s soft sobbing voices were mixed in.</span></p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi and co. started to act after Miloulle calmed down.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">First, they buried Miloulle’s comrades; they couldn’t bear to let their corpses to be weather beaten.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Before they buried the corpses, Miloulle took anything that could serve as a memento from their bodies.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Tadon-kun, please.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After Eru said it while touching her earring, a mole-like animal appeared near her legs from inside the snow. </span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Eru-san. What is that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“This child is my contracted earth spirit, Tadon-kun. When I was in Japan, I only had two contracted spirits, Picho-kun and Twirl-kun, but after coming here I contracted more spirits. Right now I have five contracted spirits.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru said it proudly. According what Eru said, the five spirits she contracted were water, illusion, earth, ice, and light spirit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Hearing Eru’s wish and using her mana as compensation, the earth spirit created a hole to bury the remains.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">And then with Tatsumi and Jadokh’s cooperation, the remains of Miloulle’s comrades which had been wrapped by a spare coat were buried.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Although moving the remains into the hole with teleportation crossed Tatsumi’s mind, since he felt it was impolite to the dead, he decided to return them to the earth with his own hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">On top of the piled earth of burial, Calcedonia muttered words of prayers while sprinkling alcohol. It had two meaning&mdash;as offering to God and to purify them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Different from Japan, in this place they don’t usually offer flowers to the deceased, but generally they offer alcohol or food to God.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">At the end, they once again prayed for the happiness of the deceased in the next world. After everything was finished, Miloulle faced Tatsumi and co. and deeply bowed her head.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-94" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Tatsumi, Jadokh, Calce-san, Eru-san…Thank you very much, everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Ara, we only did what’s natural. More than that, are you fine, Miloulle-chan?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Umm…Actually I don’t think I can get over it immediately, however, if I continue to hesitate, I don’t think I can face my comrades ever again. Additionally, the most pressing matter right now is…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Yes. To find the demon…the giant snow lizard, and defeat it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Hearing Tatsumi’s words, Miloulle nodded strongly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru focused all her senses and attentively listened to the spirits voices.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The ability to listen the spirit’s voice was the most basic ability to become spirit magician, that is to heighten their hearing sense until they could hear voices that usually couldn’t be heard&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The spirit’s voices.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Using the words spirits use&mdash;the spirit language&mdash;Eru gathered the information about their target, the giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">To be blunt, the spirits’ words were incoherent. Many of the ice, wind, and tree spirits talked to Eru as they pleased.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">They even told things unrelated to what Eru asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru patiently listen to all of them and filtered the necessary information.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">After finishing communicating with the spirits, Eru turned towards Tatsumi and co.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“The spirits said in the northwest direction there is a big white lizard. I don’t have any proof that it is the one we looking for, but I feel it is worth a try.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Hmm, spirit magic is handy. Ne ne, landlady. Do you think I can learn spirit magic too?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh asked Eru with eyes glittering with curiosity. However Eru showed a difficult expression.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Spirit magic is different from aria magic. In aria magic, you can cast magic as long you have mana, however for spirit magic if you can’t communicate with spirits, you won’t be able to use it. Communicating with spirits is mainly about feeling, so it is quite hard to explain with words.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Demi-humans who received influence of spirit’s power would have higher aptitudes in spirit magic than humans. &nbsp;However for people who couldn’t sense the spirits, no matter how much hard work they put on it, they still won’t be able to sense them.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Additionally, Jadokh has low mana reserve, considering that too, I think you should give up on magic….”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Hearing Calcedonia added that with difficult expression, Jadokh dropped his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Do you really want to use spirit magic?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“It doesn’t have to be spirit magic, I just want to use magic. After all, among us I am the only one who can’t use magic. That’s a bit vexing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh said it while writhing in agony. It only dawned upon Tatsumi after he said it.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">He and Calcedonia can use magic. Actually it was a bit different for Tatsumi but from the perspective’s of others, there was no difference since he did use magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru used magic in front them just now and according to Miloulle’s story, she also use magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Indeed among the members right now only Jadokh can’t use magic.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">By the way, from the public perspective, to have magicians gathered in one team like this was actually quite strange.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Eh? Tatsumi is a magician?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Well… from what Giuseppe said I am not a magician, but mana user.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Giuseppe? Who is that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Ah, Giuseppe is Savaiv religious organization supreme priest, Giuseppe Chrisphraez. Miloulle at least know that name right?”</span><span class="calibre8"><br class="calibre5" />
</span><span class="calibre8">“………..Eh?”</span><span class="calibre8"><br class="calibre5" />
</span><span class="calibre8">Miloulle was dumbfounded. Of course she had heard the name of Savaiv religious organization supreme priest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However since the name of an unexpected big wig flowed smoothly from Tatsumi’s mouth, her thoughts were unable to catch up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Why-why the name of such important person come out here…? Eh? Eh? Per-perhaps Tatsumi is a son of noble?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Now that she remembered it again, when they introduced themselves Tatsumi also said his family name.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Well, no, I am not a noble. However Giuseppe is my teacher. And he is also Calce’s grandfather.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Still with a dumbfounded expression on her face, now she turned towards Calcedonia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“….Calce….Calcedoni…a…? Perhaps Calce-san is…”Saiav temple’s &lt;&lt;Holy Maiden&gt;&gt;?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">It was common knowledge that ‘Savaiv temple’s &lt;&lt;Holy Maiden&gt;&gt;’ was the granddaughter of Savaiv religious organization’s supreme priest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However when Calcedonia introduced herself, she didn’t introduce herself as ‘Chirsphaes’ but ‘Yamagata’. Miloulle also didn’t expect such a famous person would appear in front of her, thus she didn’t connect Calcedonia with the &lt;&lt;Holy Maiden&gt;&gt;.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Received such a surprising truth which swooped her like a wave, she became disordered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“By the way, you said you can use magic, right, Miloulle? What kind magic is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Hearing Tatsumi’s question, Miloulle who was still in a confused state suddenly turned frozen solid.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“…Mu-must I say it…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miloulle let out a forced laugh. Tatsumi and Calcedonia reflexively looked at each other.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Miloulle-san, we are going to fight the demon together here on. Isn’t it common sense to know each other’s powers first?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“We-well, I understand where you are coming from, but…err…by the way what kind magic Tatsumi use? From what system?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That was a blatant way to change the subject. However before Tatsumi able to say anything, Calcedonia cut in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Master magic system is &lt;Sky&gt;! The second person who can use &lt;Sky&gt; magic ever is none other than my master!!”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia said it with pride. And she calmly emphasised ‘my master’ part in her speech.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Eh…? No, no way? I heard &lt;Sky&gt; magicians only appear in fairy tales?”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-101" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">While slightly blushing Calcedonia looked up toward Tatsumi who was beside her and affirmed it. It was clear for the three of them that the gaze she used toward him was filled with immense trust and confidence, also many things more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“That’s not a lie. I saw it with my own two eyes after all. I saw Tatsumi-chan use &lt;Sky&gt; magic…&lt;&lt;Teleportation&gt;&gt;.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“&lt;&lt;Teleportation&gt;&gt;…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru showed a surprised look. It seemed she realized the reason Tatsumi able to collect herbs in short amount of time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“So, what kind of magic Miloulle use? Can you please tell me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When Jadokh asked her, her eyes swam.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“It-it seems my-my magic is…from failure system, tha-that’s why I am ashamed to say it…My-my magic is self taught, from strengthening system. My fighting style is to strengthen my physical ability and defensive power and then fight in close combat. However, the activation time is very short, so I can only use it in short decisive battles… That’s enough right?”</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-102" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miloulle said it somewhat desperately to Calcedonia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That’s because she was the team leader for this operation. She was a devil exorcist who had purified many &lt;devil&gt;. Tatsumi and Eru also agreed immediately when she Calcedonia nominated herself to take command of the team.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Since Tatsumi and Eru agreed to it, Jadokh and Miloulle also didn’t raise any objection.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“I know this is sound selfish…but when the time comes I will certainly use it. I promise…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miloulle walked toward Calcedonia and held out something. It was the articles left by her comrades such as hair and favourite short sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“When I use my magic these things might be lost…so, can you please hold on this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Eh…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Although Calcedonia didn’t understand what she meant, she still nodded at held into those articles.</span></p><span></span>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Alright, let me explain again our strategy.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Before they moved again, they reviewed the plan to deal with the demonified giant snow lizard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“When fight against demons, we must never deal the final blow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Tatsumi and co. nodded silently as they heard Calcedonia’s instructions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">&lt;Devil&gt; was a spirit life-form with no physical body. </span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">That’s why even if they killed the demon, it didn’t mean they defeated the &lt;devil&gt;. Even if they defeated the host, the &lt;devil&gt; will only move towards another living creature.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">In this world, there were weapons which could deal damage to the host and the possessing &lt;devil&gt; such as holy sword and holy spear, or in other words, &lt;magic weapons&gt;. However the number was extremely limited.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Weaken the demon, make its movement dull, and then use &lt;Light&gt; or &lt;Holy&gt; type magic, &lt;devil exorcist&gt;, to destroy it. That’s the ironclad rule of demon subjugation.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“However this time you can defeat the demon. Use all your power to defeat the giant snow lizard.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However this time was a bit different. That’s because Tatsumi who was the natural enemy of &lt;devil&gt; was here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">When they defeated the giant snow lizard, of course the &lt;devil&gt; possessing it would leave. Normally there was no way to see the &lt;devil&gt; which has left its host.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">However, Tatsumi could sense it; he could recognize the &lt;devil&gt; which has left its host.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">&lt;Devil&gt; which lost its host won’t be a threat, and with Tatsumi’s &lt;Sky&gt; magic, he could destroy it with ease.</span></p><span></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“The fact that we can fight without holding back is reassuring.”</span><span class="calibre8"><br class="calibre5" />
</span><span class="calibre8">“That’s right. I will go all out from the beginning.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh and Miloulle brimmed with fighting spirit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“I will support from the rear but I will also work hard!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru who was the founder of spirit magic would certainly be helpful for Tatsumi and co.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">“Alright, let’s go!”</span><span class="calibre8"><br class="calibre5" />
</span><span class="calibre8">Calcedonia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Eru.</span></p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-104" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Jadokh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Miloulle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">All of them nodded at Tatsumi’s words, and started to walk towards the location of the giant snow lizard.</span></p></div>
