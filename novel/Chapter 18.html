<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; Getting Stronger quickly in the Labyrinth’s Underground! ⑧ </h3>

<p>「So, let’s go back up?」</p>

</div>
<p>「……Up? Why so?」</p>

<p><em>Yes</em>, I nodded my head in confirmation.</p>

<p>「The road onwards is to the floor below this one, to the deepest part of this dungeon– the guardian」</p>

<p>「………… So then…… what about it?」</p>

<p>「What do you think is the guardian?」</p>

<p>「……A Dragon Zombie. A dead dragon…… is slaughtered and sent towards the 黄泉の世界 by a young dragon. To pass the baton to the next generation…… this is that kind of sacred ritual」</p>
<p>(EN: 黄泉の世界 literally translates to hell, but I think calling it afterworld or heaven sounds a bit better)</p>

<p>「Yes, it is just what you have said. Then…… the weapon that I only have is this knife. Even though it is already dead…… do you think I can hunt the dragon? The preserved state that it is in is almost as good as that of when it was alive right?」</p>

<p>Lilith shook her head in denial (EN: It seems like she’s saying that he’s wrong, but I’m pretty sure she shaking her head saying that puny knife isn’t going to do anything)</p>

<p>「…… I do think that Lute has become stronger, even so, it is not possible for you to penetrate through its scales」</p>

<p>「That’s why, we will first return back. Just like the giant catfish and the armed golem…… there’s still a few left」</p>

<p>「…… Sometimes you want to go up, while sometimes you want to go down…… really, so busy?」(EN: Rewrote this to be a bit more comprehensive)</p>
<p>Lilith looked at above her and said, appalled.</p>

<p>I replied to her question with a nod.</p>

<p>「The foundation of this dungeon is mostly made out of orichalcum. So…… The orichalcum stairs and pathways are the places where the foundations and core parts are linked together. It is made like that in the first place.」</p>

<p>「…… Orichalcum. I understand the general idea. It is a strong metal」</p>

<p>「The existence of the dwarves’ minions, homunculi plays an important role to build impossible buildings…… like this dungeon」</p>

<p>「…… Well, even though,  the construction of this facility should not have taken more than 100 years. Thanks to someone who recklessly burn this place down……」</p>

<p>Ignoring Lilith’s piercing gaze, I pointed my finger upwards.</p>

<p>「So then, let’s head upwards okay? For now, let’s reach the first floor」</p>

<p>And so, I reached the room with the defeated minotaur.</p>
<p>I took the gigantic axe beside the unconscious minotaur.</p>

<p>A 2-metre strong ax made of a special type of metal.</p>


<p>The weight is about 100 or 200 kilograms……</p>
<p>I could lift it at Level 1 but, the strength to swing with this ax in a real fight is impossible.</p>

<p>But, I’m now Level 99.</p>
<div id="novel_honbun" class="novel_view">
<p>Moreover, though my occupation is a villager, thanks to the Protection of the Dragon King, the growth rate is corrected to that of the level of a sage, at least high ranked occupations cannot look down upon me.</p>

</div>
<div id="novel_honbun" class="novel_view">
<p>I used my strength.</p>
<p>As I swing the axe, there’s a fine cutting sfx (ヒュッ).</p>

</div>
<div id="novel_honbun" class="novel_view">
<p>— Yes, it’s no different from swinging a stick.</p>

<p>I activate the skills Sword Technique and Taijutsu.</p>
<p>With various experiences, I handle the axe skilfully.</p>
<p>(EN: Sword skill for an axe… I think he just broke so many rpg rules there)</p>

<p>Of course, there should be a skill like battle axe arts or anything that could bring out the full potential in axes, but just to tackle this emergency…… well, this is passible.</p>

<p>I swing the axe like a whirlwind with one hand.</p>
</div>
<div id="novel_honbun" class="novel_view">

<p>With this…… isn’t it possible to do <em>that</em>?</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, it was only that day I luckily came out of the room with the minotaur.</p>
</div>
<div id="novel_honbun" class="novel_view">


<p>–The 15 year old Cordelia cut a big rock like butter with a sword in the past.</p>

<p>And, I walked towards the big rocks around the cave.</p>

<p>A big rock with a diameter of about 5 metres</p>
<p>I swing with tremendous speed at the uneven surface of the rock</p>

<p>This is amazing…… more than cutting butter with a butter knife…… less resistance</p>

</div>
<p>And, in just a few minutes, a 3 metres diameter stone-made sphere is presented in front of me.</p>

<p>The surroundings are filled with stone pieces.</p>
<p>Rather than being hit furiously, it looks like it had been shaved.</p>

<p>I said to Lilith while she was still in shock.</p>

<p>「…… At first, when I held the axe…… I had used some body strengthening skills but, it was only possible to complete a few swings」</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This will be enough.</p>

<p>「Now, let’s go」</p>

<p>Lilith responded with a question after I’d said that.</p>

<p>「……Where to?」</p>

<p>「Let’s have revenge on the armed golem for now」</p>
