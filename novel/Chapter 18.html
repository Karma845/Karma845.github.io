<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; Retreat and Encounter</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
little while back.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hey,
you guys, are you going to stay here?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio,
the red-haired adventurer, and his friends just finished preparing for another
night of camping on the dungeon first level. A human adventurers party
approached them from a distance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">One
of the adventurers held out his hands as if to say, "We have no intention
of starting a fight," and approached them close enough to be heard.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
and the others are wondering what was going on and feeling anxious.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
adventurer who had approached them speaks in a calm voice, trying not to
provoke them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Sorry.
We have no intention of picking a fight with you or anything like that. Since
you didn't seem to know about it yet, so we thought we should tell you as
fellow adventurers."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">According
to the middle-aged adventurer, many adventurers have been killed in the second
level and beyond.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
not uncommon for adventurers to lose their lives inside dungeons, but the
problem is that they are being killed not by monsters but by the same
adventurers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
party of mixed dwarf and beastmen adventurers, secretly hired by the adventurer
guild, has investigated the crime scene.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
results of the investigation confirmed that there are adventurers who wander around
killing other adventurers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
other words, instead of monsters, some adventurers kill other adventurers
inside the dungeon.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"We
just happened to be in the same area, and soon one of the beastmen will be
running back to the surface to report their findings to the Guild. There's a
bounty on the adventurer killer's head. Sooner or later, the killer will be
caught or killed. But it will take time. We don't want to spend the night in a
dungeon with a psychopath who goes around killing their fellow adventurers. So
we are heading back. No offense, but you guys should probably leave the dungeon
tonight."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Oh,
thank you for telling us."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ah,
that's why a beastman adventurer was sprinting towards the dungeon
entrance."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gimra
recalled a beastman adventurer running like the wind while he was setting up
his camp tent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
beastman took one look at them and then ran off, so they paid no attention to
him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Hearing
this, the middle-aged adventurer grumbles.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Human
discrimination, passing by without giving a warning is ...... asshole. He
should at least have some respect for fellow adventurers. The racism these days
is just too much to bear."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"But
how do they know it was an adventurer who killed it? The killer could have been
a monster, right?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
asked a question to a middle-aged adventurer who was still annoyed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
middle-aged adventurer laughs bitterly and answers him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"That's
a good question."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
simple. I saw the adventurer's body, who was killed, and it was burned and
frozen, and there were signs that multiple attack magic had been used. Do you
think there are any monsters on the second or third level that can use multiple
attack magic?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">And there were no footprints other than
those of the killed adventurer. The party of dwarves and beastmen who investigated
the scene also agreed. A tactical class magician who can use more than one
magic type and can fly was attacking the victims. Now you know why we should
quickly turn back and run away, right?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Oh,
Onii-chan......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
sister Miya, a former student of the magician's school, truly understood how
dangerous the killer is if the conclusion is correct.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
face turned pale.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
what he said was true, there would be at least one first-class magician who can
use magic to fly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
not an easy opponent. Even if they are all working together, they can't win.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
the killer uses attack magic while flying, they would be literally helpless.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
magician lady seems to understand the situation well. I have nothing else to
say. You guys should not camp and quickly leave the dungeon today. On your way
back, if you guys meet adventurer who does not know the circumstances, please
warn them regardless of their race."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I understand!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
middle-age adventurer asked him for a favor, and Erio unconsciously replied.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
middle-aged adventurer gave another manly smile, returned to his friends, and
moved toward the dungeon entrance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
boys see him off and began to discuss the situation.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
So what are you going to do, leader? We've come this far to go down to the
second level this time, but are we going to turn back as the old man
advised?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
time, Erio and his friends avoided fighting as much as possible to go deeper
into the second level. Currently, they are at the end of the first level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
they spent the night and started moving in the morning, they would reach the
second level by noon as planned.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
they return at this point, they will surely be in deficit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
eyes of the party members focused on the leader, Erio.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
As advised, let's go back to the dungeon entrance. The deficit this time may be
painful, but nothing can replace a life."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I agree with you, Onii-chan."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Of
course, I agree with the leader. Wardy also agrees, right?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(Nodding)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Wardy
nodded silently.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Now
everyone agreed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
let out a sigh of relief that no one is against his decision to retreat.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Then
let's get ready to retreat as soon as possible. Gimra and Wardy will dismantle
the tents, and Miya and I will pack up our things. Let's hurry because we don't
have much time before nightfall."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Everyone
responded to Erio's instructions and began to move quickly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
childhood friends who had grown up in the same village, they are in perfect
sync with each other.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
finished cleaning up 1.5 times faster than usual and started walking towards
the dungeon's entrance.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Let's
just stay away from the second level entrance. If the crime is committed on the
second level or lower, the further away from the entrance we are, the less
likely we are to encounter the killer."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Everyone
agreed with Erio's words, and they kept walking towards the dungeon first-level
entrance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Luckily,
they didn't encounter any monsters on their way back. But ...... they are still
exhausted and only walked half as far as they had expected.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
surrounding area is completely dark. If they continued to walk with their
exhausted body, maybe they won't be able to respond quickly enough to a
monster's surprise attack.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What
should we do, leader?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Should
we go back?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Or
we camp here to be safe?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
is silent, as he isn't sure which would be better.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
is not sure which is safer and can't decide.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What
are you guys doing in this place?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Suddenly,
someone called out to them from behind.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal"><span class="calibre13">An adventurer wearing a hood
was standing there and called out to them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though they had been on their guard against the monster attack, but they didn't
notice him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
and the others gasped in surprise at the adventurer who suddenly appeared out
of nowhere.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
adventurer, who sounds like a man, asks them again.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Stopping
in the middle of nowhere, are you in some kind of trouble?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
it's not like that. ...... We just got tired of moving and decided to take a
break."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"O,
Onii-chan. Hey......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"?
Ah."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
his sister poked him in the back, Erio immediately remembered the middle age
adventurer's words.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13"></span>"On your way back, if you guys meet
adventurer who does not know the circumstances, please warn them regardless of
their race."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
immediately tells the adventurer in front of him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Do
you know about ''adventurer killer''?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Adventurer
Killer?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
man in the hood tilted his head.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
Erio and the others realized that he didn't know, they politely informed him of
the circumstances.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
is currently adventurer killer on the second level and lower level targeting
fellow adventurers. There is a possibility that the killer is more than one
person, and their abilities are at the level of tactical class magicians.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
is a bounty on their heads, and it's dangerous to spend the night in the dungeon
until they are subdued.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
other party nodded several times as if he is impressed.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
see, so you are going back because you felt unsafe."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes,
that's right. How about you?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
was looking for my prey when I noticed you guys, and you were acting strangely,
so I called out to you."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
see. I'm sorry to have made you worry."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
and the others lowered their guard, thinking that they are talking to an
ordinary adventurer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
that sense of security is quickly changed by the hooded man's next words.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
didn't expect the Adventurer's Guild to respond so quickly. It seems they're an
organization that takes its operations seriously. I should be a little more
careful about concealment next time."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Eh?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The hooded
man emits an intense killing intent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
slowly pulls out the broad sword on his back and smirks gruesomely.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"In
the meantime, let's crush tonight bugs."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito,
the elf is holding the fantasy class sword "Grandius" with both
hands. He looks very excited.</span></p></div>
