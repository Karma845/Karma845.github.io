<h1> Chapter 1: Shouting stress in the middle of the office</h1>

<p>Sometimes I tend to wonder what it would feel like to leave work at the time my workday is supposed to end. Is there anything more appealing in this life than that? Since my first year joining this company, I don’t remember going home early and saying goodbye to my coworkers. I’m always the one who stays late at the office.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-102 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>It would be more tolerable if I at least had a break on weekends, but I don’t remember ever having such a privilege either. <p>There are few words in this life that make me want to punch someone in the face so hard regardless of the responsibilities they carry, and today my boss said one that wrecked all my plans for tonight. Yes, that’s right, the classic “stay and finish this job by today, I want it done by tomorrow”.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>It was close to 10:00 pm, and I kept blurting out words of longing as I typed relentlessly.<p>—No overtime… Bonuses twice a year… Paid annual leave… Preferential treatment at recreational sites… Work style reform….<p>Nostalgia is the farthest emotion from compression that we have as humans. Therefore, the more I say this out loud, the sadder I get.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Nonsensical lunchtime meetings… Fulfilling overtime even working remotely… Chanting corporate slogans that are repeated every day… And always having signs in front of you reminding you that you are not allowed to have small talk with colleagues or do any work on my own.<p>The more I mumbled my complaints, the more intense the keyboard sounds became, and my pent-up stress overflowed uncontrollably. <p>But I could no longer keep my unhappiness to myself….<p>—I…! I HATE THIS JOOOOOOOOOOOOOB!!!!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>I screamed at the top of my lungs my discontent in the middle of the office.<p>This job has me so frustrated that at times I feel suffocated.<p>—Damn boss…! Giving me more work at the last minute! If he wants to get it done fast, he should have stayed here doing this… To hell with it.<p>Unconsciously, I started typing nonsense on the keyboard and a lot of scribbles appeared on the screen, it was my only way to express my will.  </p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>If anyone else were here with me, they would probably think I had gone crazy. However, no matter how much I yelled or how much I freaked out, I was the only one in this office.<p>—Come on, Senpai, don’t shut up, keep venting~~~~~~<p>—Huh?!<p>Big mistake on my part. I wasn’t completely alone in the office, there was another person besides me. As soon as I turned around, she was standing next to me, a beautiful girl with a carefree smile that as I stared into her big eyes, I was engulfed in her pupils and seeing the dimples forming on her cheeks was a hard blow to my heart. Her name is Inami.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>She is a new employee who had just joined the company this year, and she is a Kouhai who is under my direct supervision.<p>—Your eyes look bad, Senpai, you look like you’re dead. — <em>Inami says while placing her fingers around my eyes.</em><p>—Don’t be silly, I had clear and beautiful eyes before I joined this company.<p>—Huh? Does that mean you think I’m a pretty girl with light and beautiful eyes?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—I never said anything like that… <p>—I’m so glad that Senpai thinks I have beautiful eyes!<p>Is this girl really listening to what I’m saying or is she just ignoring it at her convenience? Anyway, I hope she also realizes my hidden message behind my words, and those are; “In a few years, you too will have eyes like mine”.<p>If I had to describe Inami’s personality, it would be something like a cat full of curiosity. Full of energy, friendly and full of charm.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>On top of that, she has an outstanding appearance and style. That not only makes her stand out within the company, but also among our business partners. It’s a complete waste to have her in a place like this.<p>It’s quite nice to have a girl like her here, it gives a different atmosphere to the company, but…<p>—Come on, Masato-senpai, let’s finish work quickly and go out for a drink!<p>Whenever she gets the chance, she invites me out for a drink. She does this almost every day, as if it’s some kind of strange greeting. It’s pretty amazing to me that she has such a strong fighting spirit and waits for me even in my overtime just to go out for a drink with me.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>Is this girl some kind of alcoholic freak?<p>—Denied.<p>—Why?! What’s wrong with me buying you a drink? Don’t worry, it’s on me.<p>—This has nothing to do with money.<p>—Then why do you refuse? Is it because you won’t let me leave? </p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—It’s because you won’t let me go home until just before the last train, you idiot!<p>When it comes to drinking alcohol, my Kohai is a heavy drinker. She’s a girl who’s always full of energy, but when she’s drunk, she becomes even more so… <p>Despite my refusal at her invitation, she automatically behaved like a spoiled child and clung to my arm. I could feel the soft touch of her breasts on my arm, how good that feels… <p>—Come on, drinking with senpai is always fun!<p>—Don’t push me! Besides, who goes out drinking alcohol on a Monday? You have a serious drinking problem!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—No, no, no! I want to go to the seafood tavern you took me to last time! I want to eat grilled tuna and drink cold sake!<p>—…. How old are you? 50?<p>—Besides, if we don’t make it in time to catch the last train, we can stay in a hotel!<p>—What?!<p>Her comment sent a shiver through my body. A night of drinking and staying overnight in a hotel with my Kouhai… Do you understand how dangerous that can be? Inami Nagisa, I’m amazed at how naturally you get along with the opposite sex by saying such a deadly comment…</p>
