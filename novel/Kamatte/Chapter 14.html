<p>—Masato-senpai! This way, this way.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-102" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title -->



<p>—Yes, I’m coming.</p>



<p>It seems that after that little break Inami had at the office she had enough in her to make her feel 100% upbeat again.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph -->



<p>—I’d love to have even a small part of the energy you have, Inami.</p>



<p>—Would you like a kiss or a hug?</p>



<p>I think that would be an overload for me.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph -->



<p>While we were talking about banal topics, we arrived at a park that was located near the company. It’s quite large, and from our offices we can watch the cherry blossoms bloom.</p>



<p>Although it was a bit hot and humid, the park was deserted at night. Around there were only a few old people walking their dogs and a few couples chatting with each other. So, you could say we had the park to ourselves.</p>



<p>We came to a bench with a table which we secured for a drink.</p>



<p>—This place is perfect, we’re lucky no one is using it. </p><!-- Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content -->



<p>—Well, it’s not very common for people to go out drinking alcohol in a park at night.</p>



<p>—Hehehehe, how perceptive you are, Masato-senpai.</p>



<p>As soon as we got comfortable, Inami hurriedly placed the beer cans on the table, plus some hot snacks and sandwiches that were in the shopping bag. </p>



<p>We bought all these items at a convenience store we found along the way.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content -->



<p>—Don’t you think we bought too much stuff?</p>



<p>—That’s fine. Then we won’t have to worry about the stores closing. Relax and enjoy the moment. </p>



<p>—Will you make me go home until the last train leaves?</p>



<p>—Maybe I won’t let you sleep today?</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content -->



<p>The statements Inami just said…I don’t know if she meant them seriously or jokingly. Be that as it may, it was kind of intimidating. Since I do believe in her ability to force me to stay drinking beer in a park until dawn.</p>



<p>—Which beer would you like to start with, Masato-senpai? — <em>Inami asked as she held up two cans of different flavors.</em></p>



<p>I chose the beer with orange juice while Inami stuck with the lemon. </p>



<p>—Thank you for your hard work today, Masato-senpai.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_longest_content - longest_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_longest_content - longest_content -->



<p>—Congratulations on your first contract. — <em>I replied as we clinked the cans together.</em></p>



<p>—Fueeh~~ The acidity of the lemon is certainly a help to combat tiredness! </p>



<p>Watching Inami drink alcohol was a truly enchanting image. Seriously, how is it possible that such a beautiful girl like her could have such a fascination with alcohol? I keep insisting the idea in my head that if a brewery hired her to be the poster girl of their product, they would be very prosperous.</p>



<p>—Masato-senpai, eat some Yakitori… Or would you rather I give it to you mouth to mouth?</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_5 - incontent_5 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_5 - incontent_5 -->



<p>…Is this girl already drunk?</p>



<p>Drinking a large amount of alcohol often has serious consequences. You might be asking yourself “Like what?” right now. Well, there’s only one, which if you ever cross that line, will only generate a chain of events that only bring a lot of headaches for you.</p>



<p>And that obviously is getting drunk. </p>



<p>In our case we didn’t do anything crazy, just that Inami and I spent a small part of the time playing a card game that Inami invented in the heat of the moment.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_6 - incontent_6 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_6 - incontent_6 -->



<p>We both pulled out our card holders and started tossing our partners’ business cards around like monsters with attack powers. The value of the cards is measured depending on the type of person we meet.</p>



<p>If it is someone with a high status or position within a company, we could say that it is already equivalent to quite a powerful monster.</p>



<p>A pretty absurd game if you think about it, but we’re drunk and bored, so I guess anything that helps us to make the time more enjoyable is welcome.</p>



<p>Not to mention the fact that we ended up with a bunch of business cards on the table. I don’t even know which ones are mine and which ones are Inami’s anymore… </p>



<p>—I’ll go to the bathroom, Senpai, I’ll be right back.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_7 - incontent_7 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_7 - incontent_7 -->



<p>—Okay.</p>



<p>Inami gets up from the bench and goes to one of the public restrooms a few meters away from us. Her appearance was a mess, and the way she walked was funny, as she wobbled everywhere.</p>



<p>I noticed the clock tower that sits in the park, and noticed that it was 1:30 am.</p>



<p>—Well, I guess we can call it a night.</p>



<p>I took one last sip of my beer, and then pulled a few nuts out of the bag to then start chewing them in my mouth. </p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_8 - incontent_8 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_8 - incontent_8 -->



<p>As I carefully wiped my fingers with a disinfectant alcohol wipe. I began to sort my business cards into my card holder. </p>



<p>At the same time, I started arranging Inami’s cards, and to my surprise, she had a lot of them. It seems she has had the opportunity to meet a lot of people along the way. It is very gratifying to see my Kouhai’s efforts in this manner. </p>



<p>Obviously, I don’t plan to tell her this. It would be too embarrassing. But if she keeps going at this current rate, her card holder will be full soon enough. So, I should teach her to put them away properly.</p>



<p>—Ah, this card…</p>



<p>It looks like Inami was carrying a business card of mine. I was a bit surprised, though… I don’t remember ever giving my card to Inami.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_9 - incontent_9 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_9 - incontent_9 -->



<p>—…Hmm? That’s strange. This card… It’s from when I joined the company.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt about it. This card was from when I had my one year anniversary at the advertising company, then the logo was changed and as expected, I renewed my business card. </p>



<p>How did Inami get this card?</p>



<p>I feel a sick feeling in my chest… This is all starting to sound familiar. The look on her face when she said “You promised me” that night comes back to my memory.</p>



<p>—Is it possible that… Inami and I met a long time ago…?</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_10 - incontent_10 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_10 - incontent_10 -->



<p>Slowly an indescribable feeling deep inside me takes shape.</p>



<p>—Kyaaaaaaa!!!</p>



<p>—Hmm?</p>



<p>Inami’s shout brings me out of my thoughts, causing me to head for the public restroom at full speed.</p>



<p>—What’s wrong, Inami, is there a pervert spying on you?!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_11 - incontent_11 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_11 - incontent_11 -->



<p>—No! It’s much worse than that! There’s a centipede in here…!</p>



<p>—…Huh?</p>



<p>—There was a big centipede in the girls’ bathroom. It was circling the wall! It showed up when I was trying to pee!</p>



<p>—It sounds like a tragedy. </p>



<p>Inami, who was afraid, grabs me by the arm.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_12 - incontent_12 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_12 - incontent_12 -->



<p>—I can’t hold on any longer.</p>



<p>—And what can I do?</p>



<p>—Please watch the ladies’ room.</p>



<p>—So, you called me so you can have your Senpai keep an eye on you?</p>



<p>—Uuuh, I’m at my limit!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_13 - incontent_13 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-124" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_13 - incontent_13 -->



<p>—Hey, but how about we go to the restroom that was in the convenience store that—…</p>



<p>—I can’t stand the urge to pee anymore! -I’m going to have a leak if I don’t do it now!</p>



<p>—You look like a 5 year old.</p>



<p>I don’t think Inami is trying to trick me into knowing what my reaction would be like in a situation like this. She seems to be more interested in saving her dignity as a human being than continuing her shame and jeopardizing her pride.</p>



<p>—Let’s go fast~~!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_14 - incontent_14 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-125" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_14 - incontent_14 -->



<p>—Hey, don’t pull my arm!</p>



<p>Inami grabbed my arm and pulled me into the public restroom with her. I couldn’t help but look at her face for a moment and noticed that she was very red. Doubts arose in my head whether she had that color because she was drunk or because she was embarrassed.</p>



<p>I guess it doesn’t matter much now.</p>



<p>—Please keep an eye out for the centipede on the wall, okay? Oh, and cover your ears!</p>



<p>—What a complicated and demanding woman you are… Okay, I’ll keep an eye out and cover my ears.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_15 - incontent_15 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-126" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_15 - incontent_15 -->



<p>—…Are you sure you’re doing it?</p>



<p>—Huh? Did you just say something…? I’m sorry, I can’t hear you!</p>



<p>This is the most annoying Kouhai I’ve ever had. But I guess I have no choice. I covered my ears and stood there watching for 1 or 2 minutes. I think that was enough time for her to relieve herself.</p>



<p>Although I’m afraid to turn around, I’m willing to take the risk and ask her.</p>



<p>—Inami, have you finished?</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_16 - incontent_16 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-127" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_16 - incontent_16 -->



<p>—Yes, but… There’s no toilet paper here…</p>



<p>—Uh-oh…</p>



<p>What kind of situation is this, one crisis goes away but then another one comes along…? </p>



<p>My heart can’t take this much stress and harassment anymore… </p>



<p>I heard a noise in the vicinity, and turned around to check the source of the noise. What I encountered was something quite unusual. </p>



<p>A drunken old man was coming in my direction in the distance.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_17 - incontent_17 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-128" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_17 - incontent_17 -->



<p>—Bad news, Inami… Someone is coming this way…</p>



<p>—Really?! What do we do now, Masato-senpai?! </p>



<p>—Damn it… Wait, I’ll go look for toilet paper in one of the other bathrooms.</p>



<p>I rushed into one of the adjoining bathrooms, and as soon as I got one available, I grabbed it and tried to hand it to Inami.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_18 - incontent_18 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-129" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_18 - incontent_18 -->



<p>—Inami, I found one.</p>



<p>—Well, give it to me here, Senpai.</p>



<p>I saw Inami’s hand peek through the door. But as soon as I tried to give it to her, instead of her taking the paper, she grabbed my hand tightly while pulling me into the bathroom with her.</p>



<p>As soon as I saw her, her face was bright red, while her tight skirt was rolled up above her waist, and her pantyhose was just below her thighs….</p>



<p>Eeh… Wait a minute… Is that… A lace fabric? Oh… It means she’s completely exposed right now….</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_19 - incontent_19 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-130" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_19 - incontent_19 -->



<p>—What did you do Inami? Why did you pull me with you?</p>



<p>—Well~…. It was because Senpai told me to hurry up~~~</p>



<p>—Idiot…! I wasn’t going to let that guy get close to you, you didn’t have to get desperate like that, let alone walk around with your panties down.</p>



<p>I wonder if it’s a bad time to ask Inami if she can lift up her panties and pull down her skirt…</p>
