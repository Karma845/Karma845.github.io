<h1>Chapter 5: Unexpected Changes in the Schedule</h1>

<p>Needless to say, the blacker a company is, the sloppier its corporate structure is. The corporate culture is a mysterious “let’s overcome our staff shortage with energy and overtime” posture. Naturally, there is no such thing as a fierce person who wants to take the initiative to join a black company. If there are, it would only be the most avid mistresses or dominative.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-102 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>So how do senior managers attract the lost lambs? To be more specific, recent graduates. Well… The answer is simple: deception.<p>How do they execute these deceptions? Well, they list the negatives as positives, and the most common one is overtime pay (by the way, you won’t get paid for all the overtime you work). You will have a flexible schedule, or so they would have you believe for the first 3 months until they start giving you more and more jobs. Then you start to realize that it’s only the bosses who have the benefit of being able to leave at the schedule that was stipulated from the beginning.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>And so on and so forth with many deceptions and manipulations that make you stay chained in this abusive employment to the point that they might as well be considered a magician, for all the lies and deceit.<p><em>(Magician, a term used in Japan usually to refer to a man who is over 30 and still alone, have had no sex and no social life).</em><p>When you’re looking for a job, be wary of companies that love to frame the phrase; “a home-like workplace.” They are most likely saying this because they aspire to make your office your new home with no way to leave. I know this firsthand as I have experienced it at times in this company.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>The daily grind is a norm that cannot be changed. You will be exposed to many managers and floor managers who will harass you sexually or with the power they wield to get you to do their jobs. Not to mention that you will also not be paid benefits for the value you can add to the company, but there’s no doubt they’ll make you work even on weekends.<p>Now, with all that I have told you, would you be willing to send a job application to a black company that lists nefarious things as a positive so that you fall for it like a fly on a web?<p>Don’t believe everything those job search websites show you. Pictures of clean, sleek offices with good looking employees in a friendly atmosphere. It’s all lies. The only thing you will find is the harsh reality that here you can breathe desperation… And sometimes nicotine smoke from stress.</p>

<p>Everyone has their own way of working and managing their schedule. There are people here who check their email first thing in the morning, while others do it after they are done with all their work on the workday.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>In my case, I am one of those who likes to do the small jobs first, and then focus all my energy on doing the heavy work at the end. This way, I gradually get more motivated as time goes by to continue working.<p>So, let’s start doing light work super-fast until it’s half-day.<p>—Kazama!<p>As I excitedly turned on my laptop, a certain familiar tone of voice sent my spirits plummeting.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Yes?<p>I turned around, and it was the head of the department.<p>—Today is the deadline for the application form I asked you for last time.<p>—Really?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Yes! So, I want it in my office today, hurry up!<p>—….<p>After saying that, he headed to the smoking room very happily while I was left with a feeling of indifference inside me… The whole agenda I had planned for today just fell apart.<p>—That damn bald guy…</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>I should run right now to the smoking room and slap him in the face with my resignation letter… I could feel the looks on my coworkers’ faces lamenting over the task I had just been required to do.<p>I didn’t know what to do with all the rage that was welling up inside me, or where to direct it. And if that wasn’t enough, someone comes up behind me, and gently strokes my head.<p>—Poor Masato-senpai… You must be feeling very distressed. Be a good boy and let me give you my love.<p>—Inami, I’m in a very bad mood right now. You have two choices, leave now, or stay here or I’ll tear you apart.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Huh?! You… You want to tear me apart? That means what… No… This is not the time to think about such things, Masato-senpai…! Although, I’d be willing to wait for you tonight at a ho—….<p>—If you finish that word, it’ll be the last one you’ll say. Do me a favor and go to a doctor and get your brain checked out, you idiot!<p>This is really worrying me. Could it be that this girl has a screw loose in her head?<p>—Masato-senpai, you’re such a corporate slave, spending so much time on your laptop has made you insensitive to women.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Stop talking nonsense. In which case, it makes no sense for you, a corporate slave, to refer to me as an office automation slave as well. Anyway… If you’re here, it’s for a reason, right? What do you want?<p>—There was something I didn’t understand about how to make a new proposal, so I wanted Masato-senpai to teach me. But it looks like you have a lot of work to do.<p>I see. She approached me because she wanted to ask me a question, and because the department head intervened, she refrained. What a relief… I thought she had come to rub salt in the wound.<p>—So…<p>—What part of the proposal did you have trouble understanding?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Huh?<p>She seemed to find my words unexpected.<p>—Let’s see. It’s the method to simulate remarketing ads….<p>—I see… I certainly haven’t taught you that yet.<p>I looked at the time and it was past 10:00.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—I don’t think I can give you a quick choice now, sorry… How about we do it in the afternoon?<p>—I have time on my side, so it’s fine with me… Uhh, I mean, no no no. I don’t want to be a bother, Masato-senpai. I’m a girl willing to learn on her own, forget my request!<p>—It doesn’t matter if you’re the one who grows up yourself.<p>—But…<p>—Inami.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—?<p>—Who is the person training you?<p>The nervous Inami fixed her gaze on me. And then, as if she had just given up, she pursed her lips and muttered.<p>—You… Masato-senpai.<p>—That’s right. So, you don’t need to worry about such things.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>Inami must probably be feeling guilty since she thinks about me sacrificing my work time to have to help her, when I actually have an invisible schedule reserved exclusively for training her. <p>—But still…<p>—The work the boss asked me to do is really a hassle, but educating you is a long-term investment.<p>I don’t doubt Inami’s intelligence, I know she is able to adapt and learn anything easily. I glanced sideways at her and watched whose big eyes widened and stared at me.<p>—In a few years, you’ll have much heavier jobs than you have now, and thanks to the fact that I’ll be educating you, you’ll have it easier when that time comes. It’s a Win-to-Win.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>Although some young people often seek this type of training at any company in the hope of getting a better job. And to be frank, that’s fine. No matter which path Inami chooses, I will be willing to support her. And it will be even more beneficial for her to get out of this company that consumes the souls of its employees.<p>However, I don’t want to be taken away from the role of educating new employees, and the reason for that is very simple, it’s much easier to be busy educating the new up-and-comers of this company than to be cleaning up the mess of an unproductive boss.<p>I’m even starting to like spending time with Inami and watching her grow in her field. It’s so rewarding that I wouldn’t even mind working overtime for it… Although this is one little secret, I would never tell her even if my life depended on it. <p>—That’s why I want you, Inami, to grow up to be a woman capable of doing anything.<p>—Masato-senpai….</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Hmm?<p>—This is why I love you…<p>—Huuuh?!<p>Inami pounced on me and hugged me very tightly. She was so excited that she didn’t notice that she had her breasts on my face. But I didn’t mind, it’s very pleasant to feel this softness.<p>—I’m definitely going to move up in this job so I can be your boss and use Masato-senpai to my advantage!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-124 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Don’t think of using me as some kind of toy! And don’t ever hug me again so suddenly!<p>—I won’t treat you like a toy! But as my special partner… Or do you think it would be too unprofessional?<p>—Too much!<p>This girl… Instead of avoiding being just like the bosses who harass her and trying to educate those old perverts… She’s trying to do that with me! What’s wrong with her?! <p>—Masato-senpai, Masato-senpai</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-125 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—????<p>Inami with a smile on her face, approaches me and whispers in my ear.<p>—I hope you continue to educate me well.<p>—!!!<p>—Haha, Masato-senpai’s face is red~~~’</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-126 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—You…!<p>Needless to say, Inami’s behavior brought a lot of trouble for me. And if that wasn’t enough, Suzumori-senpai was nagging me about what happened…<p>
