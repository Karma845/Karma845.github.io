<h1>Chapter 13: Travel Reserve Funds are a Headache</h1>		
		
<p>Today was our payday. Which meant attending a morning assembly with our brains still dull and having to listen to our boss talk about nonsense. But we forgave him due to the fact that we would be handed our check upon completion.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-102" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title -->



<p>Early mornings like these aren’t usually something I look forward to, but this is the one time of the month where you see all your efforts rewarded. Isn’t that the reason we work?</p>



<p>—I finally got my paycheck! — <em>Inami expressed with great joy.</em></p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph -->



<p>—It’s the first time I’ve seen you so motivated to get your salary, Inami.</p>



<p>—Yes! Well, the reason is that I’ve been drinking too much lately and I’ve run out of money. This check will finally restore my gas and electricity after spending so many days living in the dark!</p>



<p>Inami should control her expenses more, even so, I admire her willpower to endure so much time without those two indispensable services that are part of our daily life in society.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph -->



<p>But it doesn’t end there, for some other reason, Inami continued to be happier than usual.</p>



<p>—What’s the matter Inami? It seems you’re not just happy about getting to have gas and electricity again? </p>



<p>—That’s right, Senpai, it’s because the trip is coming!</p>



<p>—Huh? You’re going on a trip?</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content -->



<p>I guess it’s a common wish for a girl your age. I’ve noticed that lately young girls have a desire to go to Okinawa or Taiwan for some reason.</p>



<p>—Of course, and I won’t go alone. You’ll go with me too, Masato-senpai!</p>



<p>—…Huh?</p>



<p>—Yes! Look there~, did you get what I’m talking about now?</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content -->



<p>Inami pointed her index finger at a particular spot. I read it and could grasp what she was trying to tell me.</p>



<p>—Ah. You mean the travel reserve fund?</p>



<p>The travel reserve fund is a service provided by the company in which it deducts a fixed amount from your monthly salary for trips organized by the company itself. </p>



<p>Now I began to understand, Inami is looking forward to the trip that the company will organize….</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content -->



<p>—The more money I pay into the reserve, the more I want to go to an even better place.</p>



<p>—Hey, Inami.</p>



<p>—I wonder where we’ll go, will it be to the beaches of Shirahama? Or to the island of Awaji? Ah! Or maybe to a hot spring in Kinosaki at the end of the new year?!</p>



<p>—Inami, actually I…</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_longest_content - longest_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_longest_content - longest_content -->



<p>—Although I don’t mind if we can’t go to the beach and instead visit Disneyland or Huis Ten Bosch~. I’d like to be able to visit a castle or any touristy place.</p>



<p>—Hey, there’s something you should….</p>



<p>—Or maybe we could avoid traveling within Japan and go to Shanghai for—….</p>



<p>—Inami!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_5 - incontent_5 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_5 - incontent_5 -->



<p>As soon as I raised the volume of my voice, I finally managed to stop Inami’s rambling.</p>



<p>—I’m not going on a trip.</p>



<p>—What? Why?</p>



<p>—The truth is, I can’t go.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_6 - incontent_6 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_6 - incontent_6 -->



<p>—Huh?</p>



<p>I don’t want to make my Kouhai feel sad. However, I’m like her guardian, I must always speak the truth to her.</p>



<p>—You’re lying, aren’t you?</p>



<p>—I’m not lying. I allow them to take some of my money for travel funds, but all that money I’ve been accumulating for a whole year will be given back to me in the end if I refuse to go on the trip.</p>



<p>—I see… B-But… This year maybe…!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_7 - incontent_7 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_7 - incontent_7 -->



<p>—No.</p>



<p>—Masato-senpai… You’re playing with me, aren’t you…? Hey, Fukahiro-senpai, he’s lying, right?</p>



<p>Inami turns to Inaba, who’s sitting at the front desk while typing on the keyboard with her voluptuous breasts on the desk.</p>



<p>Their gazes met and Inaba was silent for a while without saying anything.</p>



<p>—…I was also a girl with many illusions and dreams when I was a newcomer like you, Nagisa.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_8 - incontent_8 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_8 - incontent_8 -->



<p>—Dreams and illusions? But…</p>



<p>—Kazama, leave this to me. I don’t want this little Kouhai to be disappointed like we were.</p>



<p>I see, so Inaba will try to talk some sense into Inami, that comf—….. What’s she supposed to be doing?! What a fool I was to believe that you would help me in this again, Inaba. </p>



<p>Instead of trying to explain the situation to Inami, she put her headphones back on and started working as if she didn’t care about anything else… Hey, Inaba, if you want one to believe that no one can hear you, at least have the decency to connect your headphones to your laptop….</p>



<p>I have no choice but to do it myself.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_9 - incontent_9 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_9 - incontent_9 -->



<p>—Inami, I’ll tell you again. I won’t go.</p>



<p>—Why not?</p>



<p>—Because I’ve never been on a company trip since I joined the company.</p>



<p>Inami’s expression becomes dark and depressing, it’s like watching a rose wilt little by little.</p>



<p>—So… I won’t have a fun trip with Masato-senpai…?</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_10 - incontent_10 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_10 - incontent_10 -->



<p>Damn, Inami, you put me between a rock and a hard place when you get like that. I can’t resist seeing you so sad.</p>



<p>—Don’t worry about it, you’ll be able to get all your money back. So, if you want, use it to buy something you want very much.</p>



<p>—No.</p>



<p>—Huh?</p>



<p>—No! I want to travel.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_11 - incontent_11 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_11 - incontent_11 -->



<p>—….</p>



<p>What kind of behavior is this? Are you a grown woman or a spoiled child, Inami? </p>



<p>As I looked at her I could see that she had tears in her eyes and her cheeks were puffy like a squirrel’s.</p>



<p>—I was really looking forward to it! You don’t know how much I imagined drinking delicious local sake while enjoying a delicious dinner with Masato-senpai! I really wanted to drink with you until dawn without worrying about the departure of the last train!</p>



<p>—I see… So, you’ve thought a lot about that trip.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_12 - incontent_12 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_12 - incontent_12 -->



<p>—Masato-senpai, let’s go together.</p>



<p>—What?</p>



<p>—I want to go on a trip with you.</p>



<p>Don’t say it like it’s such a simple thing, you idiot.</p>



<p>—If we don’t go on a trip, then I’ll spend the night at your place.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_13 - incontent_13 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-124" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_13 - incontent_13 -->



<p>—Stay overnight at my house?</p>



<p>—That’s right! It’s a 365-night long-term stay plan!</p>



<p>—Eeeh! What the hell are you talking about, you idiot?!</p>



<p>Is she desperate or is she actually serious? She’s probably both, this woman is the type to do things when she’s determined, so I don’t think she’ll bloviate. </p>



<p>—If we don’t go, I’ll make you miso soup every morning! I’ll also do your laundry and clean for you!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_14 - incontent_14 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-125" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_14 - incontent_14 -->



<p>What’s with this threat that can only benefit me?</p>



<p>—And I’ll also kiss you good morning every morning!</p>



<p>—Ki… Kiss?</p>



<p>—And, of course, a kiss when we leave for work together and another one when we come home!</p>



<p>—Are you an idiot?</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_15 - incontent_15 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-126" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_15 - incontent_15 -->



<p>—I’m serious! I’ll bathe with you, and crawl over you at night when you sleep.</p>



<p>How badly did this girl want that trip…?</p>



<p>However, even though I’m quite frightened by the things Inami just mentioned, it would be hypocritical not to say that I would actually enjoy it very much. </p>



<p>Now that I know how much Inami wants to have that trip with me, I have this debate in my head about whether to accept her proposal… Or let her live with me for a whole year….</p>



<p>—All right… You want to go on a trip that badly? Let’s do it.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_16 - incontent_16 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-127" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_16 - incontent_16 -->



<p>—Really? Are you serious?</p>



<p>—Yes. Let’s both go on a trip.</p>



<p>—Yay~~! I love you, Masato-senpai!</p>



<p>Inami hugs me with all her strength while pressing her breasts on me, which I liked since they are very soft.</p>



<p>I might regret in the future that I didn’t choose the option of having Inami live with me for 1 year, but, taking a trip with your Kouhai is also like a kind of dream for a man of my age.</p>



<p>Although, if she kissed me everyday, bathed everyday with me, and crawled on me at night… My genitals surely wouldn’t have endured it.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_17 - incontent_17 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-128" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_17 - incontent_17 -->



<p>—Hehehehe, I’m glad to have this trip with you.</p>



<p>Just seeing her smile makes me feel happy that I made a promise. I guess it’s something I should reflect on.</p>



<p>—What do you say we go out for a drink now that we have plenty of money?</p>



<p>—I see you continue to have no intention of saving money… But that’s okay, I’ll allow it for today.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_18 - incontent_18 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-129" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_18 - incontent_18 -->



<p>—Yay!</p>



<p>Damn travel booking service… They should do away with it already.</p>



︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>



<p>It was just after 1:00 pm, I had finished my lunch at the office and headed back to Houjo Constructions.</p>



<p>Even though Inami may have been responsible for having made a contract with a company, she was still an inexperienced girl in this matter. Therefore, Suzumori-senpai directly ordered me to take charge of the negotiations and the handling of how relations with our new client will be conducted.</p>



<p>I intend to keep this meeting brief, so I will have time to return to the office early to meet with Inami for an afternoon of drinks.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_19 - incontent_19 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-130" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_19 - incontent_19 -->



<p>As soon as I arrived at the house, Houjo Sakurako greeted me just like the first time we met, and took me inside, again offering energy drinks and immediately starting negotiations.</p>



<p>But after several minutes, she….</p>



<p>—Kazama, I’m tired, let’s play a game.</p>



<p>—Where are the honorifics? Didn’t your grandfather teach them to you?</p>



<p>—I don’t like to follow that kind of social formalities. </p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_20 - incontent_20 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-131" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_20 - incontent_20 -->



<p>—You really have a serious problem with… Huh?! Hey, stop playing games right now!</p>



<p>I tried to take the mouse away from her to stop her from playing, but Houjo clung to my arm with all her might.</p>



<p>How is this girl not embarrassed that my arm is constantly touching her breasts? Or does she just not care because she’s flat?</p>



<p>—Let go…! You’ll bring my rank down because of what you’re doing!</p>



<p>—I don’t care! Play after work! Learn from me!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_21 - incontent_21 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-132" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_21 - incontent_21 -->



<p>—Noo~!</p>



<p>I’m seriously starting to doubt that this girl is 20 years old. Not only does she have zero professional knowledge about the work we’re doing, she also can’t be bothered to use something as basic as honorifics. </p>



<p>I have no choice but to stoop to her level, as I don’t want to be the only person between the two of us trying to be formal.</p>



<p>—Look, if you want to play, let’s first finish this draft to present it to the team that will take care of the publicity, and then I can go.</p>



<p>—Tsk. Very well…</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_22 - incontent_22 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-133" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_22 - incontent_22 -->



<p>Houjo pursed her lips as she sat down on the sofa. The next thing she did was to pick up the pen that was on the table while looking at her sketchbook.</p>



<p>What we are doing right now is laying the groundwork for a website for the advertising we will be working on. It is very essential to have a website so that people have a place to look for information when they click on the ads.</p>



<p>Even though Houjo Construction had a website, it was somewhat… mediocre.</p>



<p>—This is the first time I’ve seen a company use the free version of FC2 in 2022 to create a website.</p>



<p>—Hahaha! I created it during the summer vacations when I had nothing to do.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_23 - incontent_23 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-134" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_23 - incontent_23 -->



<p>The quality was poor, there were only texts and photos arranged all over the place. That’s why I decided to create a new website, but this is a very laborious task and it increases the cost of our service.</p>



<p>Inaba will be in charge of creating the website for this project. And she herself warned me that doing such work from scratch comes at a price that even she would not recommend.</p>



<p>—I know the costs have skyrocketed due to the creation of the new website, but I guess you don’t mind, after all, your grandfather’s company is making a good profit, right?</p>



<p>—….</p>



<p>—Hmm? Houjo?</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_24 - incontent_24 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-135" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_24 - incontent_24 -->



<p>What’s going on? The expression on Houjo’s face, which had been so full of excitement, quickly turns to “nothing.”</p>



<p>—My grandfather got mad at me for the contract I signed without his permission. And as punishment, he said he was going to give the money I had been saving for my future wedding to pay for the advertising service….</p>



<p>—…..</p>



<p>So, something happened after all. I knew this girl was going to get into trouble because of the contract she signed with us lightly. </p>



<p>As soon as Houjo noticed my sympathetic look, she turned her face to show different emotions, she looked like one who had tears in her eyes and pursed lips. </p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_25 - incontent_25 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_25 - incontent_25 -->



<p>—Listen, Kazama! You’re using my wedding money for this, you are absolutely forbidden to fail in that aspect, if the publicity fails then my grandfather’s business doesn’t prosper. Because if you don’t… You’ll have to take responsibility and marry me, okay?!</p>



<p>What kind of terrifying threat is this? And even more so when you’re playing a video game while you say it.</p>



︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>After my meeting with Houjo, I hurried back to the office from the station. I was supposed to be back before sunset, but the meeting took longer than it should have. This was for the obvious reason that Hojo was distracted every so often to want to play one or another video game on her PC.</p>



<p>Inami must be tired of waiting for me. I sent her messages on LINE several times, but for some reason she hasn’t read them. Maybe she got angry and left…? No. That’s not like her.</p>



<p>As soon as I arrived at the office, I found an empty and quiet environment, only a few employees were left performing one or some other tasks. </p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_26 - incontent_26 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_26 - incontent_26 -->



<p>I looked around and tried to locate Inami. After scanning the place briefly, I found her asleep on my desk… Wow, she really wanted to go out with me for a drink.</p>



<p>—Hey, Inami…</p>



<p>—…Hmm… No…</p>



<p>I looked at the screen of her phone that was lighting up, and in the notifications area I could see that there were several unread messages from me.</p>



<p>—Inami, wake up. — <em>I said while shaking her shoulder.</em></p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_27 - incontent_27 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_27 - incontent_27 -->



<p>—Hmmm…? Huh, Masato-senpai?</p>



<p>Inami rubs her sleepy eyes and looked at her watch. Her eyes, which were glazed over, suddenly widened suddenly.</p>



<p>—Huh? It’s already too late! Senpai! You should have woken me up instead of staring at my sleeping face!</p>



<p>—You’re wrong, I’ve just arrived. In fact, I’ve sent you many messages on LINE.</p>



<p>—Ah, seriously….? — <em>Inami replied in a despondent tone.</em> — Too bad, I had really wanted to go out for a drink with you.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_28 - incontent_28 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-139" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_28 - incontent_28 -->



<p>Unfortunately, we’ve probably already missed out on the 200 yen beer offers. Although I didn’t want my Kouhai to feel depressed, it is my duty as her Senpai to always make her feel happy.</p>



<p>—Well, I just had an idea. </p>



<p>—Huh?</p>



<p>Inami tilts her head at my words, and at the same time her right cheek reflected the marks left by her arm from the time she was asleep on it.</p>
