<h1> Chapter 4: I’m Serious, I Don’t Remember</h1>

<p>It doesn’t matter how late you’re drinking in a bar or how hungover you are the next day. You must always come to work as long as the company exists.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-102 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Senpai, I’m sorry for the inconvenience I caused you last night.<p>—….</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>The expression Inami had on her face today was very different from the pale, drunken girl I last saw before she lost consciousness. She’s still the same lively girl who conveys a warmth that reaches out to heal your shattered soul.<p>Without a doubt, she’s the same old Inami Nagisa.<p>—Last night you were about to die, how come you are so cheerful today?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Huh? Senpai, aren’t you one of those who would feel better if you drank a lot of water and slept through the night too?<p>—…<p>Inami’s power of recovery after a night of drinking is really scary… Although, it would be more appropriate to say that she has an out-of-the-ordinary ability to break down alcohol. When I think back to my student days, I used to get a bad hangover after a night of drinking. It would affect me so much that I couldn’t get enough strength to attend classes the next day.<p>Inami, who has an iron liver, would have a better chance of being a successful boxer than being the slave of a company like this.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Hey, Masato-senpai, where are we going drinking today?<p>—Don’t you know what a ‘rest day’ is?<p>—Hmph!<p>Inami pursed her lips. Her expression is terrifyingly cute.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>There’s no point in playing along with an alcoholic monster like herself. For now, I’ll focus on saving my energy so I can work overtime today.<p>—Hey, Inami, now that I remember…<p>—Yes? — <em>she replied as she leaned forward</em><p>—Have I ever made you a ridiculous “promise” in the past…?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>The words Inami said to me last night near the hotel, and the serious expression on her face, replayed vividly in my brain.<p>‘……You promised.’<p>It couldn’t be helped that I didn’t remember about the promise I once made to her. I was so curious to know what kind of a promise it was, that even last night I kept dreaming about it. And when I woke up in the morning, the first thing my eyes saw when I saw the ceiling were those words that appeared floating in the air like an illusion.<p>I guess it’s inevitable to be curious, right? After all, if I made a promise, it’s natural for me to want to know what it was. Could it be that I propositioned her for sex the second to last time I was drunk? Or maybe I accepted her invitation to go to a hotel while she was busy finishing a job that had a short deadline?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>As much as I thought about it, I couldn’t remember. Therefore, I have no choice but to listen to Inami’s version. This is very important to me, this just makes me look like a jerk and irresponsible for forgetting. Above all… I’m abusing poor Inami, who is a victim.<p>—A promise…? Ah~~<p>—What do you mean by “Ah~~”?<p>—Nothing important really, you can forget about it.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Huh?<p>What does Inami mean by that? More importantly, why did her expression change so suddenly? The sweet and kind look she had before I asked her this question changed to a colder and more serious tone.<p>—It’s something silly, never mind – <em>Inami answered with her usual happy expression.</em><p>—…Huh.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Hahahaha, Senpai’s expression is really funny~.<p>—You can’t expect me to just forget it after the way you said it yesterday! And especially with such a shocking request like that!<p>—Hmm… Since you put it like that, I’m also kind of curious, why did I say that yesterday?<p>—I’m the one who wants to know! You can’t leave me in the dark here!<p>—I’m sorry, I drank too much alcohol that I forgot. — <em>Inami replied while sticking out her tongue and placing her fist on her head.</em></p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—That can’t be! You have to remember, Inami!<p>I grabbed Inami by the shoulders and started shaking her… I know this won’t do any good, but at least I hope that her neurons collide with each other and perform some function in her brain. This is outrageous, I feel like one of those old men who sexually harass young girls, does this mean that as soon as I get drunk, I’m usually a sex monster?<p>—Hehehehe, I love it when Masato-senpai touches me!<p>—Don’t get distracted! I want you to remember that promise. And don’t try to hug me in the middle of a fight, you idiot!<p>—No!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>How I wish I could open this girl’s brain and examine what’s in there. Maybe she’s hiding something she doesn’t want to tell me.<p>—As usual, you two get along so well early on.<p>For a moment I thought Inaba was talking to us. But the pinch on my cheek that I later experienced made it clear that it wasn’t her. <p>—Ohh? What rude vocabulary you have, is that how you talk to your Senpai?<p>—I’m… I’m very sorry…</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>When I apologized to the person in front of me, her face changed from an angry expression to a cheerful one as she pressed her fingers to her lips. <p>And as expected, that made me a little nervous, since after all, those same fingers now holding her lips, until a moment ago had touched my cheek for a few seconds.<p>—Good morning, Suzumori-senpai.<p>—Good morning. I don’t think excessive physical contact during work is good.<p>—Yes! You’re right! I’ll just hug Masato-senpai after work!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—I’m going to kill you.<p>Suzumori Kyouka stared at us with a smile on her face. She is two years older than me, and a very trusted leader in the company. <p>Today she looks like she is working inside the office. She is wearing a blouse with a loose silhouette, a tight skirt with a cinched waist, thin bracelet heels adorning her ankles. Her uncut long shiny black hair that she lets fall down her shoulders and back. Simple, but with a great style that draws everyone’s attention to her every detail. Even I, who am not so interested in fashion, think she has a good taste when it comes to dressing. There is no doubt in my mind that she has a high level of fashionista knowledge. She is a very beautiful woman in every way.<p>Even the Starbucks coffee in her hand makes the synonym for professional woman fit her very well.<p>—Oh, Kyouka-senpai drinks coffee from that famous coffee shop… I wonder if I should also start drinking that coffee to look more professional.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Don’t even bother, because you won’t be even if you start from scratch.<p>—Hm, good reasoning, Masato-senpai…. Although I’d like to know the opinion of the woman who has more experience and is a level above you.<p>—Shu… Shut up!<p>—Haha! That’s a good answer, Nagisa-chan.<p>Tch… Damn Suzumori-senpai, don’t encourage her behavior… Then I’ll be the one who has to suffer her annoying taunts…</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>But Inami’s response seemed to please her very much, for after laughing, she opened her purse and handed Inami an object.<p>—Here you go, Nagisa-chan, a gift card so you can go to Starbucks, it’s your reward for giving a good answer.<p>—Wow! Are you sure, Kyouka-senpai?<p>—Yes. Now you can drink delicious coffee tomorrow.<p>—Of course! When I leave home, it’ll be the first place I go!</p>

<p>Inami is now not only one of those who delights not only with sake, but also with a glass of coffee. This girl never ceases to amaze me. And it is precisely that honest joy that makes her popular with men and women of all ages.<p>—Fufu, Masato-senpai, what do you think of this?<p>—Suzumori-senpai. You shouldn’t spoil this girl… She’s starting to scare me.<p>—Huh? But, Kazama-kun, you’re the nicest person to Nagisa-chan in this office.<p>—…..</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-125 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—If Kyouka-senpai says so, it’s because it must be true then.<p>—Inami… Do you want to advance your death date so much?<p>—I’m sorry, I’m sorry. — <em>said Inami as she clasped her hands together in laughter.</em><p>Her power of persuasion is powerless because it’s obvious that she’s not taking it seriously.<p>—Don’t worry, Kazama-kun. The more brazen the Kouhai is, the more charming they are.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-126 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Umm… Really? I have my doubts…<p>—Trust me. The first Kouhai I had was a bit cheeky, but at the same time…<p>—…And that Kouhai was me, right?<p>—Do you still doubt it?<p>So, she wasn’t kidding, I’m the first kouhai and last kouhai that Suzumori-senpai had… Hmm, I think this is starting to go to my head a lot. Not to mention that it makes me feel very special, and makes me have somewhat erotic thoughts at the same time.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-127 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Masato-senpai, I’m so excited to hear you say; “You’re the first Kouhai I ever had!”<p>—Shu… Shut up! You should respect your senpai more!<p>—Kazama-kun, don’t be so hard on your Kouhai. You should show more compassion and tuck her under your arm.<p>It’s very easy to say, but it turns out that my Kouhai is a girl that the more I tuck her in, the more she wants to climb on my shoulders. I need a break…<p>—Masato-senpai, where are you going?<p>—I’m going to get a coffee from the vending machine.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-128 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>This is useless, I can’t find a way to ask Inami to explain to me what happened in the past, and what was the promise I made to her. There is no way I can question her properly.<p>I feel that if I push too hard, I might end up making her cry, or worse, hurt her…<p>
