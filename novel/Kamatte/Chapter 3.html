<h1>Chapter 3: A Forgotten Promise</h1>

<p>Overtime at work is finally over. And as I promised Inami, we both went out to a bar to celebrate for the work she did today.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-102 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Kanpai!<p>—Cheers</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>After clinking my jar with her glass, we proceeded to pour the delicious golden liquid called beer down our throats. And in Inami’s case, sake. This was our reward for the day after working tirelessly.<p>—Buaaaah~~~~ How I love you, beer~~~~<p>Inami seemed to be very satisfied after ingesting the alcoholic beverage she desired so much. One would think that 22 or 23 year old girls would probably prefer to drink wine or something milder and more in keeping with their feminine appearance.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>However, she was a girl quite different from the rest. She is quite happy eating sashimi with cold sake. And you can tell that because of the expression on her face and the way she moves her body.<p>—Aaaah~~~~ I’m glad I was born in Japan~~~~~<p>Seeing her enjoying what she loves the most without worrying about what the people around her say or being on the receiving end of constant compliments is even nicer to watch.<p>However, I’m very tempted to ask her why a girl of her age is content being in a private room of an Izakaya instead of going somewhere… I don’t know, more elegant maybe?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></div><p><em>(TN: An izakaya is a type of informal Japanese bar that serves alcoholic drinks and snacks. Izakaya are casual places for after-work drinking, similar to a British or Irish pub, a Spanish tapas bar, or an American saloon or tavern.)</em><p>I usually see office workers from all over the world uploading pictures to instagram in fancy Italian restaurants or cafes. Instead, the environment where I meet Inami is quite… Very low level, and more so considering the kind of girl she is.<p>For us Salaryman, being in places like that is a dream. Although sometimes we have to make do with what our wallet allows.<p>—Hey, Senpai, what are you looking at? Do you want to try some of my Fukuju Junmai Ginjo?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Not at all, I don’t feel like drinking sake.<p>—Oh, I see, so you want to kiss me?<p>—I’ll tear your lips off if you keep saying such nonsense.<p>—How horrible you are! But I don’t dislike it, I love it when you’re rough, Senpai.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>Inami’s personality makes me a little uneasy, I’m worried that she might end up marrying a man with domestic violence habits.<p>—Come on, drink some, senpai. — <em>she said as she leaned on me holding her glass in her hand.</em> — See your Kohai asking you nicely, or don’t you want to drink with me?<p>—This is the first time a Kohai has ever harassed me.<p>—Hehehehe. And this is my first time dating a Senpai. </p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>If my guard wasn’t so high, those words would have done some serious damage to my brain. But the attacks didn’t end there.<p>—Come on Senpai, drink, drink, I know you’ll like it. — <em>Inami said as she brought her glass even closer to me. </em><p>—Wow. This Sake is very delicious.<p>—Right? It’s very tasty.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>The smile that formed on Inami’s face was very angelic. Surely if they used that face to promote this kind of alcoholic beverage, it would make even the person who doesn’t like this kind of beverage to try it.<p>Although, I really wonder if she is happy to share her drink with me. <p>Right after that, Inami landed on my body, and took the menu in front of me, and opened it while leaning her body, as if giving me a hint to look at it together.<p>—Let’s order this Sake now, Senpai. I love Daikoku Masamune very much.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—You haven’t finished the one you have yet and you’re already thinking about your next drink…? You’re a heavy drinker and…— Hey! My beer!<p>Inami reveals the true alcoholic monster she had hidden inside her. She took my beer and gulped down more than half that was in the jar, and in the blink of an eye, the glass was already completely empty.<p>—Yay! Now Senpai can spend the whole night drinking sake.<p>—….If you get drunk, I’ll go home and leave you here.<p>—No! Don’t leave me! — <em>Inami exclaimed as she clung to me.</em></p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>For a moment I thought she had picked up on my threat and would control herself more from this point on. But just like a child who is unaware of what she is doing, she has crossed the line long ago, and there is no turning back now.<p>—Ah~~~ Alcohol is good~~~ Alcohol is fun~~~<p>Yeah… This is my kohai, a recent college graduate so drunk that she couldn’t even count to 4 without making a mistake. Although… Her appearance was quite provocative.<p>Her pale skin was flushed, her big, bright eyes were sleepy. And her unbuttoned shirt exposed her large cleavage.<p>Inami leaned on me again as if it were second nature, and went into a spoiled girlish state.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Inami, those are my chopsticks.<p>—What are you talking about, Senpai? How can these chopsticks be yours? It’s obviously from the bar.<p>—No… What I mean is—…<p>—Eeeh? What are those socks doing there? Senpai, what’s the meaning of this?! Why are you stripping off and leaving your stuff all over the place?!<p>—It’s not me, you id**t! It’s you who took off your socks and threw them there!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Hahaha! Senpai, you’re so funny~~~~~<p>God, if you’re punishing me for a prank I did in the past, I’ve already learned my lesson… Stop this torture!<p>—I’ll imitate Masato-senpai!<p>—Huh?<p>Inami turned away from me, straightened her posture, and her smile changed to a serious expression… What’s wrong with this girl?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Work hard while you’re young. Those were the golden words you told me when I first came here….<p>—Ugh…<p>—Hahaha! Why are you making such a face, senpai?<p>This little girl… Not even because I saved her neck from having a nasty date with the boss is she unable to show proper gratitude. Don’t forget that you owe me!<p>I have no choice but to show my displeasure, and I pinched her cheeks while she kept saying absurd things. I don’t care if anyone thinks I’m harassing my kohai, I’m willing to fight in court to teach this brat some manners.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>But my punishment turned out to be useless, as she didn’t seem to feel any pain, it seems that people who are under the effect of alcohol are immune to pain, as a smile was still present on her face.<p>—You were pretty cool for standing up to the boss, Senpai.<p>—You think so?<p>—Of course, there’s no one cooler than Masato-senpai~~~!!!!<p>—!!!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>Huh? What’s wrong with her? Why did she lay on my lap so suddenly?<p>—H—Hey! What are you doing! You’re not a cat!<p>—Nyaa~ I’m a friendly cat~~~<p>Well, if you think about it clearly, she really has the attitude of one. Also, her hair is shiny, bountiful breasts, slender waist, slender shoulders and arms, and long legs etc. That make her a very attractive woman. <p>I couldn’t let my guard down one bit, at the slightest carelessness, something could go wrong, as Inami was rubbing her upper body on me leaving no room at all. And if that wasn’t enough… She starts to move her head on my legs. Inami doesn’t know how dangerous this can be for a man like me.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-124 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—You know… If our co-workers saw us right now, we’d be in serious trouble, and you should write a letter of apology.<p>—I don’t care if I have to write 100 letters. Using my Senpai’s legs as a pillow is a price, I’m willing to pay.<p>—You don’t really think about how this makes me feel?<p>—Umm, so… You’d rather be on my lap?<p>—Don’t talk nonsense!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-125 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Hahaha, take it easy, Senpai, I’m just kidding.<p>—Don’t make that kind of joke…<p>This girl will make me go into cardiac arrest someday.<p>—Hey, Senpai.<p>—What’s wrong?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-126 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Today it looks like I went out of my way to be a nuisance, right?<p>—A nuisance? Why did you…<p>For a moment, I didn’t understand what she was saying, but today’s scene in the office replayed in my mind immediately.<p>—Is this the first time you’ve faced a boss?<p>Inami nodded at my question.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-127 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—I see, I thought you didn’t care about what happened today, but it seems you do.<p>—To tell you the truth, I’m worried about it. I’m new to the company, and I objected to my boss, I’m afraid it could have serious consequences.<p>Inami’s concern is natural, she has probably been thinking about it since we left the office, which is why she was desperate to drink too, maybe alcohol can be her escape route.<p>She was silent, and said no more. I could feel her shrinking more and more, perhaps worry came back to invade her consciousness even more strongly. So, I put my hand on her head to try to calm her down.<p>—Sen…pai?<p>—Don’t worry, if the boss does anything to you, I’ll protect you.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-128 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—….<p>Inami’s eyes get even bigger and her cheeks turn red. She’s an id**t and childish, but… There’s no way I would abandon my Kohai, especially in a job as demanding as ours.<p>—I’ll tell you some magic words that can help you at times like these.<p>—Magic words…?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-129 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—If the boss asks you out again, just say….<p>I have no doubt that I’m very drunk myself.</p>

<p>—’I’m sorry, but I’m going out for a drink with my senpai, so I can’t go with you, boss.’<p>Those embarrassing words came out of my mouth very easily. However, due to the feeling of embarrassment, and the overwhelming amount of alcohol invading my senses, I don’t have enough courage to simply watch Inami’s reaction, so…<p>—And if that brings me trouble, I don’t care! I’m already tired of working in that company! And if the boss is going to fire me, let him do it! He’s the one who will suffer for not having me doing his duties anymore!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-130 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>To be honest, I don’t even know what nonsense I’m talking about, but the last thing I want is for Inami to take my other words seriously and just see it as some kind of joke. However, things didn’t turn out as I had planned, because…<p>—Okay, next time the boss asks me out, I’ll tell him I’m going out for drinks with my favorite senpai!<p>Inami replied with a big smile on her face. <p>—Yes… That’s right! Tell him that!<p>Embarrassment takes over me even more at the honesty and innocence of my cute Kohai. So, I quickly took the glass in my hand, and drank the contents in there in one gulp, and used the excuse of having a red face due to the alcohol.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-131 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>On the other hand, Inami continued to have a smile on her face as I watched her from below. This girl is really strong.<p>—Hey, Masato-senpai.<p>—What?<p>—Let me correct you on something.<p>Inami, who was lying on my lap, beckons me to come closer. And as soon as I bring my face close to hers….</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-132 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—The one who will suffer the most if Masato-senpai resigns will be me, not the boss.<p>—!!!!<p>—Hehehehe… So, you know. Getting fired is non-negotiable.<p>This new generation of boys and girls is very scary. They tell you very embarrassing things without a second thought… Inami was no longer in a drunken state, now she was in slayer mode.<p>—Hahaha! Senpai when they’re embarrassed are cute~~~</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-133 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Stop playing with me like that, you id**t!!!!!<p>—Oh come on, don’t be shy~~ I still have many more things to tell you~~.<p>—This girl…

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>If I worked for a white company, I would probably go to more than one bar after my workday. But unfortunately, the black company I’m shackled to only allows me to visit one bar until the last train is about to leave. <p>After paying the bill, I walk down the main street to the station.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-134 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—No ~~! I still want to drink with my senpai! It’s still nighttime.<p>—That’s precisely the reason why we’re already going home, you id**t!<p>As expected, Inami is acting like a little girl. This drunken girl whining is a pretty regular attitude every time we go out for a drink. I think it would be easier to carry her passed out from drinking so much alcohol than to drag her drunkenly to the train. <p>—I’ve told you many times, stop acting like a child when we go home.<p>—I’m not acting like a child. I just want to drink with Masato-senpai.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-135 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—We’ve had enough to drink, and stop using me as an excuse.<p>—No~!<p>How frustrating. Even my niece, who will be three this year, understands better than this woman.<p>—Just look around, already the stores are closing their shutters. It’s no longer possible to continue drinking… Hmm? Hey, are you listening to me? What’s wrong with you?<p>To my surprise, Inami stopped dead in her tracks, as she pressed her lips tightly together and pointed very determinedly in one direction.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—No… You don’t…<p>This can’t be… Inami pointed to a side street that was glowing with many black signs.<p>—Let’s go the world of adults.<p>Exactly… The place Inami refers to is a section of the city where perversion is the first thing you’ll find. Many adult-themed hotels invade that area. And I could see the seriousness with which Inami was speaking by seeing the determination in her eyes.<p>—We can stay in a hotel and continue drinking without worry. Besides, we won’t worry about the last train, since we can sleep there, and it’s close to the office. It’s all advantages! </p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—You’re not being rational.<p>—You can even take a shower. The beds are soft and fluffy. I’m sure you’ll sleep peacefully.<p>Inami… What kind of things are you talking about? It’s supposed to be men who make up all sorts of excuses with the intention of taking a girl to such places.<p>She and I are definitely in opposite positions… Or is it because she’s drunker than usual?<p>—Even, if Senpai wishes, I can use your arm as a pillow!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—Use my arm as a pillow…?<p>Inami’s invitation was too direct, she doesn’t even make an effort to hide her intentions. I was so surprised that even my drunkenness has disappeared.<p>—We can even take a bath together, I’ll wash your back if you want!<p>—But what the hell are you…?<p>—I don’t care what room we’re in! If it’s a rose-colored one, if it’s kinky or abnormal looking!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-139 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—A… Abnormal…?!<p>—I’d even wear a sailor’s uniform, or a nurse’s uniform if that’s what my Senpai wants!<p>—You id**t! Don’t throw bombs like that when you’re drunk!<p>—I can say it when I’m sober too!<p>—That makes it much worse!</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>What the hell is this woman?! She’s acting like the protagonist of an eroge at 120%!<p>—Hotel! Let’s go to the hotel, senpai! — <em>said Inami while pulling my hand.</em><p>All the salaryman passing around us were staring at us.<p>However, I can’t just go to a hotel with Inami. I am her Senpai and she is my Kohai. Nothing more and nothing less. Inami is a very important girl to me, but it is not right to abuse her, she is also my office mate.<p>It would be unacceptable for me to have a one-night stand and then just not have anything serious, that adding that we would have to see each other daily in the office.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>So, the answer is no.<p>—Let’s go. Let’s get out of here.<p>I pull Inami’s arm as she stands still. However, Inami doesn’t make the slightest movement, and just stands still.<p>—…You promised me.<p>—Promise? What are you talking about?</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>What is Inami talking about? What do you mean, I made her a promise? At what point would I ever think of going to a hotel with her?<p>—No, no, no, no. I never made any promise…<p>—Senpai id**t.<p>—Ah?<p>This is bad, my Kohai got mad at me. Usually, I would give her a little smack on the forehead as a custom of an educational orientation. </p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>But because of the expression on her face, it’s obvious that she’s very serious.<p>—Inami…?<p>She was pressing her lips very tightly, and her eyes had a determination as if they were telling me; “Why don’t you remember?”, while she was clenching her fists to denote her anger.<p>Honestly, I don’t remember making a promise to her, but the more I look at her, the more I question if I must have told her in one of my drunken states… I feel very uncomfortable.<p>Besides, I don’t think Inami will allow me to refresh my memory about what happened in the past. She tried to let go of my hand by pulling hard, but I didn’t want to let go, so I made enough force to pull her towards me.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>This caused her to lose her balance and end up leaning on my body.<p>—Masato-senpai…<p>This was a simple act of reflex, because when I realized this, swallowing saliva was inevitable. The fact that we are close to each other raised the attention even more, because at that moment I was no longer seeing my cute and cuddly Kohai… But a lovely woman.<p>As soon as we made eye contact. Inami, whose eyes were full of tears, expels some words that make me put my feet back on the ground again, and at the same time… Feeling weird.<p>—Disgusting.</p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>—…Huh?<p>But beyond my moment of depression, Inami explains the situation better.<p>—I think I drank too much, I feel nauseous… I feel a little sick….<p>Inami… Where did that serious expression on your face that you had a few minutes ago go? Your body, which was red-hot from the alcohol before, is now pale…<p>All the rush of emotions you were experiencing a few minutes ago… It has completely disappeared. There is no longer a cute and tender kouhai, let alone a perverted eroge protagonist… There is only a simple drunk girl left in front of me. </p><div id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></div><p>Inami, who is about to faint, uses her last strength to point towards a building.<p>—Let’s go to the hotel to rest… Yes?<p>—…Okay.<p>No need to say what happened next… But if you’re curious, we rented a room and the first thing I did was to take Inami to the bathroom so she could… Release the evils she had in her stomach. You can also imagine that nothing happened during the whole night. And that I also missed the last train home.<p>
