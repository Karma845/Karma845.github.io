<h1>Chapter 16: Inami Nagisa Wants you to Take Care of her and Love her</h1>		
			
<p>After we had finished all the beer, we only had to go to the train station before the last train left. But…</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-102" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title -->



<p>—Not again… </p>



<p>—Yes! Let’s stay in a hotel!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph -->



<p>—I’ve already told you many times, no!</p>



<p>—Why not? What’s wrong with staying in a hotel and enjoying a drink? And this way you take the responsibility for looking at my underwear! Last time we didn’t do anything, so let’s go today!</p>



<p>Inami is behaving like a spoiled child, I’m starting to doubt whether she’s really a grown woman. I took a deep breath and tried to control my impulses to continue yelling. I’m not going to let myself be manipulated by a drunken child.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph -->



<p>—There’s still time for the last train. I’ll go into that store and buy a coffee. Do you want anything?</p>



<p>—A Strong Lemon Kirin and… Hepalyse.</p>



<p>—Eh~?! You really have no intention of stopping?</p>



<p>I feel like this night is going to take longer than I’d like.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content -->



<p>I proceeded to enter the store while Inami stayed outside. I don’t know about you guys, but I feel a lot of peace and quiet whenever I enter a convenience store. It’s very relaxing for some reason.</p>



<p>I headed to the beverage corner and grabbed a canned coffee that I liked a lot. But… For some reason I stopped moving. Something in my brain was blocking my whole body.</p>



<p>I lifted my face and looked at the reflection of myself in the glass of the refrigerator. I was red due to the embarrassment I felt because of the proposal Inami was asking me. </p>



<p>This was the first time I wanted to lock myself in a freezer next to the stocked ice cream area and never want to escape.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_long_content - long_content -->



<p>I won’t deny that I’m scared, I’m starting to doubt whether it’s a good idea to leave this store and have to face Inami, after all, she won’t settle for a no… </p>



<p>I must keep my mind clear and not have inappropriate thoughts about her. I am her Senpai and she is my Kouhai, nothing more, nothing less.</p>



<p>I unconsciously turned my gaze in the magazine section and saw articles with flashy titles related to couples, women’s breast size, and techniques for sex with your co-workers. None of this generated confidence in me… even the magazines are against me…</p>



<p>After meditating for several minutes, I plucked up my courage, went to the counter and paid for the coffee and then left the convenience store… But a surprise was waiting for me outside.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_longer_content - longer_content -->



<p>I saw Inami surrounded by three men. They were probably college students, since they didn’t seem to be older than her.</p>



<p>—Are you alone, Onee-san? Why don’t you come and have fun with us?</p>



<p>—Yes! Come to karaoke with us.</p>



<p>—We can go to a club or a bar if you don’t feel like going to karaoke.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_longest_content - longest_content --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_longest_content - longest_content -->



<p>It’s disgusting to see how even college students behave like stalkers in front of women. Although I know I should do something, I don’t know if it’s wise to interfere.</p>



<p>After all, they’re not trying to take Inami away by force. Even she doesn’t seem to have any signs of fear or concern. She had a very happy expression on her face when she heard the invitation from the three boys. </p>



<p>Or so I thought for a moment, since what Inami said was…</p>



<p>—Sorry, but I’m going to a hotel with my favorite Senpai, so I don’t plan to go with you guys.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_5 - incontent_5 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_5 - incontent_5 -->



<p>—Huh?</p>



<p>—Eeh….?!</p>



<p>—Eeh….?!</p>



<p>—Eeh….?!!!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_6 - incontent_6 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_6 - incontent_6 -->



<p>The three guys, and me, were shocked at her answer. This brat… Not only did she use the magic words I told her were supposed to be for the boss. but she also modified them just enough to make them more destructive!</p>



<p>—Ah! Masato-senpai, you’re late!</p>



<p>Inami noticed my presence and came running towards me. She even jumped on me with the same momentum as before.</p>



<p>—I—Inami…</p>



<p>—Don’t do that again, since you took so long, I was teased by those guys.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_7 - incontent_7 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_7 - incontent_7 -->



<p>Just as if she was my partner. Inami pressed the softness of her body against mine. The rubbing and touching of our bodies started to take center stage, and as expected, it made me unable to think clearly.</p>



<p>Once the three boys witnessed the exciting lovemaking between us. They had no choice but to accept reality and leave. </p>



<p>For a moment I thought everything was settled… But I was wrong.</p>



<p>—Okay, let’s go, Masato-senpai.</p>



<p>Inami, who was still clinging to me, tries to walk away from the train station in the direction of the hotel district.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_8 - incontent_8 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_8 - incontent_8 -->



<p>—Hey, Inami… </p>



<p>—What’s wrong?</p>



<p>—….Why are you so eager to go to a hotel with me?</p>



<p>I know I’m pathetic, plus I just asked a really stupid question. But being rational, I can’t be calm without knowing what my Inami’s intentions are.</p>



<p>—Isn’t it obvious? It’s because I like you. — <em>she replied with a serious expression on her face.</em></p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_9 - incontent_9 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_9 - incontent_9 -->



<p>As soon as I heard those words, my heart started pounding. The faint lights of the city at night give the illusion of Inami’s silhouette shining around her.</p>



<p>I’m not sure if Inami was saying that because she’s drunk, or as a joke. I was still confused, but even then, I wanted to be sure about it. So Inami went on to explain.</p>



<p>—These three months of training might have flown by for you. But for me, every day I spent with you was precious.</p>



<p>Once Inami’s passion is ignited, it cannot be extinguished again. And as she spoke, she further shortened the distance between us, thus, she took the opportunity to unleash her deep feelings and emotions on me.</p>



<p>—You may laugh at me for being too naive. But the truth is, I have fallen in love with you, and I cannot ignore these feelings.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_10 - incontent_10 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_10 - incontent_10 -->



<p>—Hey, Inami, calm down a little.</p>



<p>I’m still not sure if Inami’s face is red because of the alcohol, or because she’s embarrassed by her confession… Although I’m starting to lean more towards the second option.</p>



<p>—Since I met you, I haven’t had a single day when I wasn’t calm! Every single thing you teach me, every time you protect me from the bosses and strangers on the street, even when you listen to my nonsense when we have a drink… I’m always nervous when I’m with you, Senpai! </p>



<p>—That’s not what I meant… You’re drunk, Inami!</p>



<p>—I’m not drunk, Senpai! I’m just asking you to go to the hotel! I don’t want to have sex with anyone but you! I want to have sex with Masato-senpai! I’ve always wanted you!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_11 - incontent_11 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_11 - incontent_11 -->



<p>—You’ve always… What?! No! Still, you must—…</p>



<p>I tried to keep Inami’s composure, but my words were suddenly cut off. For Inami pounced on me and pressed her lips against mine. </p>



<p>It all happened so suddenly that it took me several seconds to realize what had happened.</p>



<p>—Huh…!?</p>



<p>—Mmm…</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_12 - incontent_12 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_12 - incontent_12 -->



<p>Inami’s kiss was so intense that even she didn’t bother to breathe, she just moved her lips and the tip of her little tongue in my mouth.</p>



<p>As soon as our lips parted, our breathing became somewhat wild as we stared at each other. This was the greatest proof of affection two people can have.</p>



<p>Her wet eyes staring at me, along with her full lips that were lustrous from our saliva, and the sweat running down her neck… It was all a combination of factors that did nothing but give off a sexy, adult femininity in Inami. </p>



<p>—…Do you understand it yet?</p>



<p>—It was enough just to say it, you idiot….</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_13 - incontent_13 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-124" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_13 - incontent_13 -->



<p>—I have no choice but to take a scathing attitude to make my Senpai understand how I feel about him.</p>



<p>—Ugh…</p>



<p>Her sincerity and her being so straightforward makes me cringe… Has she really been like this all this time? </p>



<p>However, she seems to be aware that she took too aggressive an attitude. So, the ecstatic expression on her face slowly begins to fade.</p>



<p>Which, I don’t mind, as her charming appearance and energetic attitude with which she always interacts with me on a daily basis, is just right for her.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_14 - incontent_14 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-125" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_14 - incontent_14 -->

<p>—I—I’m sorry! It’s all my fault!</p>



<p>—?</p>



<p>—I… I’ve been trying to tell you all this time but I couldn’t!</p>



<p>—Tell me something…?</p>



<p>—That’s right! Inami, you’re my Kouhai and I’m your Senpai! Nothing more and nothing less than that!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_15 - incontent_15 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-126" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_15 - incontent_15 -->



<p>After saying that, Inami’s expression was dumbfounded. She really didn’t expect that response from me.</p>



<p>—I’ve been using you and taking advantage of you all this time! I like it when you hug me because I can feel your breasts, or I accept your invitations to drink alcohol after work because I like spending time drinking, I’ve been trying my best to make everything convenient in my favor!</p>



<p>—But what are you talking about, Senpai? If you did so much to make it convenient, why didn’t you just accept my proposals?</p>



<p>—It’s impossible! I’ve never courted a girl as pretty as you! </p>



<p>—Huh…? Senpai… Do you think I’m pretty?</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_16 - incontent_16 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-127" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_16 - incontent_16 -->



<p>Why is she surprised? She’s probably used to everyone calling her that, even she often makes me say it with her jokes.</p>



<p>The expression on her face now is as if it’s the first time she’s been called that. She looks very embarrassed, but at the same time… She gives off a rather charming air. Although little by little that expression was changing.</p>



<p>—Inami?</p>



<p>—…Fufufu. Senpai’s face turned bright red.</p>



<p>There she is, that cheerful expression I like to see from her so much appeared again. But this is already starting to stress me out, what’s this girl up to?</p>



<p>—And whose fault do you think it is?! Besides, you have the face too—… huh?!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_17 - incontent_17 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-128" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_17 - incontent_17 -->



<p>Before I could finish my sentence, Inami hugged me with all her might so that I wouldn’t talk back to her anymore. Any feelings of anger or stress I was experiencing began to fade away very quickly.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Inami looked happier than usual.</p>



<p>—I feel so happy right now~! </p>



<p>—…Yes, you look just like you do when you drink sake.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_18 - incontent_18 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-129" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_18 - incontent_18 -->



<p>—You’re wrong. Nothing compares to the happiness I feel when I hug you, Masato-senpai! </p>



<p>I guess this would be the perfect time to tell her not to get drunk anymore. </p>



<p>—Just to clarify, I would never go to a hotel just to have a one-night stand.</p>



<p>—Of course. There’s no way to think that Masato-senpai is a cold and emotionless person.</p>



<p>—Well, the fact that you understand is enough for me.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_19 - incontent_19 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-130" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_19 - incontent_19 -->



<p>—Yes… And…</p>



<p>—Hmm? And?</p>



<p>—I’m not the kind of woman who settles for a one-night stand. — <em>said Inami, whispering in my ear.</em></p>



<p>—!!!!!</p>



<p>—Ha ha ha! Senpai, you’re embarrassed again~</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_20 - incontent_20 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-131" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_20 - incontent_20 -->



<p>—It’s because of you~~~~!</p>



<p>Inami’s pranks continue to be dangerous. Although, it’s gratifying to see her laugh out loud. </p>



<p>I still wasn’t used to it, which could be a big problem for me. But to be honest, no man would be strong enough to resist this kind of invitation from a woman like her.</p>



<p>I have my doubts whether I will be able to stand up to Inami… No, she is still my Kouhai. There is no way I can be with such an extraordinary woman like her.</p>



<p>—Masato-senpai. I hope you will continue to guide and encourage me, both in public and in private….</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_21 - incontent_21 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-132" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_21 - incontent_21 -->



<p>—Yeah… Sure…</p>



<p>—Hmm? Why so nervous, Senpai? Maybe you’ve thought of something lewd?</p>



<p>—You… You’re wrong!</p>



<p>—It’s okay, Senpai. For you, I’ll do anything you ask… Even your dirtiest thoughts.</p>



<p>—Ugh~~~~… I’ll give you a big lecture all night long!</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_22 - incontent_22 --><div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-133" data-inserter-version="2"></div><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_22 - incontent_22 -->



<p>From this point on. It’s up to your imagination whether I spent the whole night reprimanding her, or having fun with her.</p>
