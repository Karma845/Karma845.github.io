<p><p>Tycoon’s Research<br><br><br><br>A-rank adventurer Tycoon.<br><br>His ability is [Sage], and he's a full-fledged combat type. However, he excels more in support magic than attack magic, specializing in strengthening his allies from the rear.<br><br>It's not that he can't use attack magic. He just doesn't want to use it much.<br><br>Despite having the rare ability [Sage], which allows him to use all types of magic except healing... he has little interest in using anything other than support magic.<br><br>Such is Tycoon, who was currently in his room at the home of Clan Sacred.<br><br>"...Alright."<br><br>Pushing up his glasses, he gathered a stack of over a hundred parchment sheets and stuffed them into his bag.<br><br>He cast support spells on the bag, adding waterproofing, fireproofing, and hardening spells.<br><br>These were Tycoon's research notes.<br><br>A compilation of his thoughts and analyses on the Forbidden Six Labyrinths.<br><br>Tycoon grabbed his bag and left the room.<br><br>"Tycoon. Are you heading somewhere?"<br><br>"Sasha, huh? Yeah, I'm going to see Master Demiurgos at the royal castle."<br><br>"Demiurgos...? Ah, your master, right?"<br><br>"Indeed. A great historian and scholar. An elf among elves, a High Elf who has lived through the ages. The world's first [Sage] and my benefactor."<br><br>"O-okay, okay. You've got business, huh?"<br><br>Sasha held back the excited Tycoon.<br><br>Tycoon's eyes sparkled like a child's.<br><br>"Exactly!! Look, here's my research on the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. Heheh, I'm going to show it to Master. Ah... I can't wait to see his reaction. Even Master hasn't delved as deeply into the Forbidden Six Labyrinths as I have, having conquered them. Heheh, I can't wait to see his surprised face."<br><br>"R-right."<br><br>Tycoon thrust his research notes in front of Sasha.<br><br>Sasha, while pushing Tycoon's shoulder, said:<br><br>"That passion... it's nostalgic. You were burning with the same fire when we first met."<br><br>"Was I? I don't remember well."<br><br>"Hmph, I remember. You kept getting kicked out of teams or leaving on your own."<br><br>"Ah. Hmph, those were the days when I was surrounded by idiots and couldn't stand it."<br><br>Sasha recalled the time she first met Tycoon...<br><br>"Oops, sorry, but I don't have time for reminiscing. See you later."<br><br>"Ah... yeah."<br><br>The scene Sasha was about to recall vanished in an instant.<br><br>She watched as Tycoon briskly walked away.<br><br>"Good grief. Oh right, I've kept Piasora waiting."<br><br>Sasha hurried off to meet Piasora.<br><br>◇◇◇◇◇<br><br>Thanks to Sasha fulfilling his 'request', Tycoon now had free access to Heiberg Royal Castle.<br><br>He swung open the door to the castle's library with gusto and spotted an old man sitting in a rocking chair by the window. He quickly approached.<br><br>Then, he thrust his research notes at the old man, who had his eyes closed.<br><br>"Master!! I've written a thesis on the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. Read it!!"<br><br>Normally, one should be quiet in the library, but Tycoon ignored that.<br><br>The old man opened one eye and let out a big yawn.<br><br>"You're noisy... really, Tycoon, you should be quiet in the library."<br><br>"Just read it. Master, I think I'll finally get to see your surprised face this time!!"<br><br>"Ah... fine, fine. Really. Hey Tycoon, go make some tea. Make it strong."<br><br>"Ugh... fine."<br><br>Tycoon reluctantly headed to the librarian at the reception desk.<br><br>Watching his retreating figure, the old man, Demiurgos, let out another big yawn.<br><br>"Let's see... I guess I'll read the kid's essay."<br><br>Demiurgos.<br><br>Though an elf, his ears were longer than those of a typical elf, and his emerald-green hair, characteristic of elves, had turned pure white. Deep wrinkles lined his face, and a white beard grew from his chin.<br><br>Demiurgos was no ordinary elf.<br><br>He was a High Elf who had lived for thousands of years. Elves are said to rapidly age once they surpass a thousand years, becoming High Elves.<br><br>Demiurgos, one of the oldest High Elves, was revered as a sacred figure among the elves.<br><br>However, tired of being treated like a god or a fragile relic, he left the elven lands and enjoyed a solitary life in a house near the slums of Heiberg Kingdom. His knowledge was highly valued, and he was now employed as the head librarian of the royal castle.<br><br>It was quite unusual for an outsider to be entrusted with managing the library.<br><br>Demiurgos flipped through Tycoon's thesis.<br><br>"So, Master!!"<br><br>"Quiet. Calm down a bit... really."<br><br>"Hurry, hurry, give me your thoughts!!"<br><br>"Ah~~~... you're such a noisy brat!!"<br><br>"Just read it already!! Come on, come on!!"<br><br>"...There's no point in saying anything to you."<br><br>Demiurgos ignored Tycoon and continued reading.<br><br>Thinking back, his meeting with Tycoon had been quite peculiar.<br><br>Tycoon, born a commoner in Heiberg Kingdom, was a boy who lived next door to Demiurgos. He preferred reading books over playing with friends.<br><br>On a whim, Demiurgos gave him a book.<br><br>The next day, Tycoon came to Demiurgos with the book. Demiurgos, thinking the boy found it boring, took it back with a wry smile, but Tycoon said, "I've already read it."<br><br>Thinking it was a lie, Demiurgos was surprised when Tycoon began reciting the book's contents from memory.<br><br>Amused, Demiurgos started sharing his own books and knowledge with Tycoon.<br><br>This continued for a long time, and Demiurgos became known as [Master]. Then... he was shocked to discover that Tycoon possessed the same [Sage] ability as himself.<br><br>Demiurgos encouraged him to become an adventurer. Around that time, he moved and was scouted to work as the royal castle's librarian, living there and working leisurely.<br><br>One day, he heard that Tycoon's team had been promoted and was delighted.<br><br>Then, as Tycoon steadily rose in rank, they reunited after a long time, and Tycoon's first words were:<br><br>[Master!! Where have you been all this time!? Forget that, I have mountains of papers and research I want you to read!! What? You're working in the royal castle's library? That makes it hard for me to just drop by!!]<br><br>Some time passed after that... Sacred conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths.<br><br>Tycoon gained free access to the library, and his interactions with Demiurgos resumed.<br><br>And now, here they were.<br><br>"............Hoh."<br><br>It was an interesting thesis.<br><br>The Forbidden Six Labyrinths were not of this world's civilization, but rather the crystallization of an ancient civilization's technology.<br><br>Demons. And the Seven Great Calamities... all topics Demiurgos was unfamiliar with.<br><br>It was fascinating, and he couldn't help but smirk.<br><br>Finishing the thesis, he placed it on the table and sipped the strong tea.<br><br>"So, Master?"<br><br>Tycoon looked at Demiurgos with the same carefree smile he had since childhood.<br><br>A smile that truly loved 'researching.' It was the same smile Demiurgos once had.<br><br>"Still lacking."<br><br>That's why... he couldn't be satisfied.<br><br>Tycoon was young. There were still many interesting things to discover.<br><br>Hearing this, Tycoon laughed.<br><br>"Of course. I've only written about one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, so it's natural you're not satisfied. Hmm... how should I write about the Great Labyrinth of Delmadrome that Haise conquered? I'll have to ask Haise. Ugh, I'd rather investigate it myself, but I guess I have no choice. Besides, there are still more Forbidden Six Labyrinths left. Heheheh, I'm getting excited, really excited!! Master, sorry, but I've got work to do. See you!!"<br><br>Tycoon rambled on, then, as if satisfied, left like the wind.<br><br>Demiurgos sank deeper into his rocking chair.<br><br>"Good grief... I guess I'll just relax and wait until that kid comes back. Heheh, it's good to have something to look forward to."<br><br>Muttering this, Demiurgos closed his eyes and began to snore loudly, rocking gently in his chair.</p></p>
