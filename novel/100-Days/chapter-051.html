<p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths - Sasha’s Journey 6<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Two days passed as Sasha and the group rested in the residential area and surveyed the surroundings.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They uncovered several truths.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon gathered everyone in the living room to share his findings.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This is undoubtedly a residential area. It seems that an advanced civilization of ‘Ancient People’ once lived here but went extinct ages ago. Over countless years, this place sank into a salt lake and transformed into a dungeon. It’s now one of the Forbidden Labyrinths, ‘The Great Salt Lake of Diloromans.’”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Adjusting his glasses with a proud look, he continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin raised her hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Okay, I get it, but... is this dungeon really over? No treasure, just a weird town, and we say, ‘We cleared it!’ That’s so boring.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I agree. Shouldn’t there be a dungeon boss if this is a dungeon?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Exactly, that’s the thing.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon pointed sharply with his finger, smirking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold muttered, “You’re in a good mood,” as he sipped his tea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“So there is one, isn’t there? Tycoon.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Indeed. The dungeon boss is here... or rather, on a lower level.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wait! A lower level? Yesterday, we surveyed this entire area—it’s not that big, just full of houses, and the surroundings are just walls of salt!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin groaned in frustration, but Tycoon shook his head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Heh, actually, I found something else... Take a look at this.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon pulled a map from his chest pocket and spread it out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora tilted her head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I can’t read this... but I understand the pictures.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s the language of the Ancient People. While we can’t fully decipher it, I’ve managed to make some sense of it. This combines ‘Eigo’ and ‘Nihongo’ with symbols called ‘Kanji.’ Astonishingly, these Ancient People could fluently read such cryptic writing and understand it effortlessly.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon’s curiosity shone through his smile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Incidentally, his item box was crammed with books he’d collected from the houses.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold examined the map and commented.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This... could it be a map of the area?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes, geographically, it’s accurate. And here’s where we are.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon marked the location with magic on the map.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then he traced his finger across it, stopping at a point.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“And here...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The map showed stairs leading underground.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This is the way to a subterranean space called ‘Chikatetsu.’ The Ancient People constructed complex towns above ground and vast pathways below for transportation. It seems we can proceed further down through this ‘Chikatetsu.’”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wow!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold and Robin clapped, and Sasha nodded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“As expected of you, Tycoon. So we head to this ‘Chikatetsu’, right?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes. However, Chikatetsu is quite intricate. Likely, there will also be many magical beasts. We should be fully prepared.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No problem. We’ve rested and regained our strength over the past two days. Right?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold glanced around, and Sasha, Robin, and Piasora nodded. Piasora turned her head away with a huff.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon also nodded, and Sasha declared.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“We leave tomorrow. Our destination is ‘Chikatetsu,’ and further below. Everyone, the conquest of the Great Salt Lake of Diloromans is within reach!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus, Sasha and her party prepared to venture deeper underground.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Chikatetsu was a narrow, winding path.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora quickly began complaining.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What is this horrible path?! These endless iron bars... so annoying!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This is called ‘Senro’. The Ancient People used a vehicle called ‘Densha’ to travel underground. Hmm... this might have applications above ground too. I’ll take note.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ugh, so annoying!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora snapped in frustration.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold turned to Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I know. Beast scent... This ‘Senro’ seems to be a path for magical beasts.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“They’ve noticed us.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes. I can sense them all around.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha drew her sword.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold wielded only a small shield in his right hand, leaving his great shield aside.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin, Piasora, and Tycoon also readied themselves.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Grrrr...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Out of the darkness ahead came a pitch-black wolf.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As it emerged, Robin fired an arrow without hesitation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crack!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Huh?!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The wolf shot a shockwave from its mouth, shattering the arrow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the same moment, Sasha and Reynold charged forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon began chanting, while Piasora prayed, and Robin nocked another arrow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Gahh!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha, five!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold shouted as Sasha was enveloped in an aura of fighting spirit.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The wolf lunged at her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Dorya!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yelp!?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Reynold intercepted it, slamming the wolf with his round shield.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As the wolf tumbled to the ground, Sasha drove her sword into its head and slashed upward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Golden Sword: [Sky Fang]!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The fighting spirit turned into a blade, silently cutting down three wolves hiding on the ceiling.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the same time, Tycoon’s spell concluded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“[Uruk], [Amad]!’”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hell yeah! Draaah!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thud!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reinforced by Tycoon’s buffs, Reynold unleashed a flurry of punches on an incoming wolf, finishing it with an uppercut that sent it flying. Robin’s arrows pinned it midair.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“[Luck]”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora prayed over Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha faced the wolf leader—a beast three times the size of a normal wolf. Its danger rating was likely beyond SS.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Come on.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Grrrrrr!!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The wolf and Sasha charged at each other. Piasora’s ‘Blessing’ temporarily tripled Sasha’s physical abilities.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The spell, based on luck, activated perfectly this time. Sasha accelerated, slashing the wolf in a single strike.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The wolf split cleanly in two and died instantly. The remaining wolves were also vanquished.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Whew, that was intense.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon adjusted his glasses, inspecting the wolf.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ve never seen this beast in any magical beast compendium. A new species, perhaps... Let’s take one back to the guild. Sasha, collect materials from the large one you defeated. Even the fangs could make excellent weapons.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Got it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They gathered materials and continued along the Senro.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin walked beside Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, Sasha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What is it, Robin?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well... I feel like we’re almost done, right?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Probably.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“When we’re done and back at the guild... can we have a party?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“A party?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. I bet the king will summon you to the castle and shower you with praise. After that, lots of S-rank adventurers and clans will come to meet you. Once all that’s done, let’s have a party. With everyone in the clan.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Heh, sounds good. Let’s do it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora interjected.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m all for it!! But, Sasha, when we’re done here, could you grant me one wish?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“A wish?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sounds fun. Hey, Sasha, can you grant me a wish too?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“R-Reynold?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Whaaaat?! You’ve got some nerve cutting in, idiot!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora growled, glaring daggers at him, but Reynold ignored her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon also chimed in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I have a request as well. Sasha, could you use your S-rank authority to get me access to the royal library?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sure. Reynold, Piasora, what about your requests?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll tell you after we finish. Something to look forward to.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Me too!! Sasha, mine will be serious!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“O-Okay.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha turned to Robin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Robin. Do you have any requests? If it’s within my power, I’ll do it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Just one thing, okay?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sure.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, when we have the party... can I invite Haise?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...Haise?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No way!! That gloomy jerk isn’t—mmph!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Take it easy, Piasora.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Mmpphh!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold silenced Piasora with a headlock.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I know we said a lot before... but I want to be friends with Haise again, like before. Once we clear the Forbidden Labyrinth, I’d like to talk to him.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...Robin.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Tycoon, you feel the same, right? You’d like to talk books with Haise again?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...I won’t deny it. Only Haise can keep up with my knowledge.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“So, is it okay?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...Fine.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Thank you!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin’s earnestness was clear.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She probably admired Haise, not romantically but like an older brother.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To Sasha, Robin seemed utterly endearing.</p>
