<p><p>The Adventurers' Return The Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans, collapsed. The lake disappeared, leaving a massive "hole" for several days... In the frigid country of Frizd, Sasha sat in an inn, reading a newspaper. The headline read: "Adventurer Sasha Conquers One of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths!!" Before the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans collapsed, Sasha's party had been nearby. Entering a tunnel, they felt a sensation of floating and somehow returned to the surface. From there, they headed straight to the Adventurer's Guild to report their feat. The adventurers confirmed the collapse of the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans, and Sasha presented the prismatic gem as proof of conquest, earning recognition. A few days after their conquest, Sasha's party stayed at the inn to recover. Though they were there to rest, countless nobles and adventurers came to greet them. Keeping Sasha busy. After finally catching a break, she returned to the inn where her companions were waiting and began reading the newspaper. "So tired..." "It’s rough, but hang in there. After all, conquering one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths is a historic achievement. Nobles from the Frizd Kingdom and clan masters want to connect with you, Sasha." Tycoon said this proudly. In fact, over a hundred applications to join their clan had been submitted in just a few days. As soon as people learned Sasha's party was staying at the inn. Hopeful applicants swarmed the inn’s front desk. Robin, bored, muttered.. "Hey, when are we going back to the Heiberg Kingdom?" "Not until we’ve sold off the materials. We only sold one prismatic gem, and the dwarves in this town were stunned when they saw it. Apparently, it’s the legendary stone recorded in ancient texts, Seven-Star Miracle Gem." "Wow, amazing!" "My shield broke, so I’m thinking of using it to get a new one. Your sword too, right, Sasha?" "Yeah... The strain was too much; it snapped." "We’ll reforge it in the Heiberg Kingdom. With the money we’re earning, we can afford it." Reynold, sitting beside Sasha, grinned. Tycoon then said. "Sasha, I just got word.It seems they’re planning a triumphant parade for us in the Heiberg Kingdom. Man, they’re really treating us like heroes." "A parade?" "Yep. As the heroic team that cleared one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. They’re even calling us the finest adventurer team of this generation, standing at the pinnacle of the Four Great Clans." "That’s an exaggeration..." "It’s not an exaggeration!! Fufufu... Oh, Sasha, remember my request? You said you’d listen to it." "Y-yeah." "We all decided. Sasha, you’ll grant us our request, and in return, we’ll grant you one. Anything you want." "I’ll... make a request of everyone?" "Yes. Anything at all. But first... please listen to our request, alright?" Piasora smiled. For now, it seemed that returning to the Heiberg Kingdom would take a bit longer for Sasha’s party. ◇◇◇◇◇◇ After a full day’s rest, Haise visited the Adventurer’s Guild. Shante greeted him and led him to the guild master’s room. "After a day, I’m finally able to accept it. Haise... Congratulations on conquering one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths." "Thanks. Anyway, I’ve cleared the dungeon and achieved my goal. The Adventurer’s Guild acknowledges my conquest, right?" "Of course. Not just the guild—yesterday, even The Count of Monte Cristo acknowledged it. We also informed the Dizarra Kingdom. So your name will go down in history." "I see. Well, I’ll leave the rest to you." "...What?" Haise stood up and headed for the door, only to be stopped by Shante. "W-wait. Where are you going?" "Home. I’ve got nothing else to do here." "G-going home?! What about the report to the Dizarra Kingdom or an audience—" "Pass. I didn’t clear the labyrinth for the kingdom. One of Yamata no Orochi’s heads as proof should be enough." "...Haaah. You really are something else." "Thanks for everything. I’ll be back sometime." With that, Haise left the room. Returning to the guild hall, he saw adventurers abuzz with rumors. "An S-rank adventurer cleared the Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome solo!" "No way! That’s gotta be a hoax." "Not a chance! There was a massive head on display here yesterday." "Apparently, that was the dungeon boss." Few adventurers recognized Haise by face. Finding the attention tiresome, Haise left the guild. Outside, Presea was waiting. "…Where are you going?" "Back to the Heiberg Kingdom." "Right after yesterday?" "Yep." "I’ve got a job to do." "Good luck." "…I’ll finish it quickly, so wait for me." Saying this, Presea dashed off at an incredible speed. It seemed she wanted to return with Haise, but he began walking anyway. Strolling leisurely through the bustling town, Haise nostalgically enjoyed the sights. He stopped by street stalls, bought skewers, and ate as he walked. Reaching the town’s entrance, he stretched deeply. "Man, I’m craving that weak tea from the old inn." ◇◇◇◇◇◇ For several days, Haise walked at his own pace. It had been six months since he’d been to the Heiberg Kingdom. Noticing improved roads, Haise reflected on how time felt both short and long. There were people he wanted to see—like Geist, the innkeeper. When the Heiberg Kingdom came into view, Haise noticed a commotion near the main gate. Approaching closer, he found soldiers stationed about a kilometer away. "Sorry, but there’s a parade happening. You’ll need to enter through the west gate." "A parade?" "Yep! Are you a traveler? You’ll be amazed—S-rank adventurer Sasha’s team just conquered the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans, one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths!" "What...?" "The capital is in the middle of a grand parade! C’mon, you should join in too!" Haise detoured to the west gate. Even there, the festive atmosphere was electric. A newsboy called out, "Extra! S-rank Adventurer Sasha Conquers One of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths! Get your copy now!" "One, please." "Here you go!" After buying a paper, Haise slipped through an alley to the inn. Though the town had changed slightly, the inn remained the same—a bit rundown. But its familiarity made Haise feel truly "home." Opening the door, he saw the gruff innkeeper glance at him. The innkeeper’s eyes widened momentarily before he coughed lightly and said... "Two months of unpaid rent... Pay up." "Right. I’ll pay two months, plus one month in advance. Oh, and I’ll have dinner here too." "...Sure." Apparently, the gold Haise had left before departing had run out. He spoke to the innkeeper. "I’ll be in your care again." "...Yeah." Saying nothing more, Haise went to his room. Despite being away for six months, the room was spotless, exactly as he had left it. Grateful for the care, Haise sat in his familiar chair and opened the newspaper. "Sasha... So, she cleared it too." The collapse of the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans just like the Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome, had caused its disappearance. Haise could no longer challenge it. However, three of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths still remained. Tossing the paper aside, Haise lay on the bed. "Ah... Maybe I’ll visit Geist tomorrow. There’s time before dinner. I think I’ll take a nap." Closing his eyes, Haise let himself sink into the creaky bed. Thus, Haise returned to the Heiberg Kingdom.</p></p>
