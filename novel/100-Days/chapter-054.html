<p><p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths - Haise and Sasha’s Journey 1<br><br><br><br>Haise and Choco Latte chased the demon to the heart of the theme park.<br><br>And there they encountered... an unimaginably enormous "serpent".<br><br>Not an ordinary snake. It had a thick body and eight heads.<br><br>Moreover, its surface wasn’t smooth like a snake’s scales; it was covered in jagged golden armor.<br><br>It was less a serpent and more a dragon with eight heads. That would be a better description.<br><br>On top of the largest of the eight heads stood a demon clutching his shoulder.<br><br>"I won’t forgive you... I won’t forgive you!!"<br><br>He clutched the shoulder Haise had shot and glared at him with bloodshot eyes.<br><br>Choco Latte murmured, "Well, that anger’s justified, I guess..." but Haise ignored him.<br><br>Instead, he materialized an RPG-7 Rocket Launcher and fired it straight at the demon.<br><br>"Useless!!"<br><br>"!!"<br><br>One of the heads swatted the projectile away, causing it to explode on the ground.<br><br>Haise discarded the launcher as the demon spoke.<br><br>"Wait!! Before you kill me, answer this... Where did you get that weapon?"<br><br>"Does it matter?"<br><br>"It matters greatly!! Aren’t you curious? Why a demon like me is in a place like this, or what this monster truly is!?"<br><br>"Not interested."<br><br>[Unwavering... Haise, you’re something else.]<br><br>"Rrrgh... If only we could replicate that 'gun'! It could revolutionize our demon weaponry!"<br><br>"You want this weapon? Too bad—it only works for me."<br><br>Haise materialized an anti-materiel rifle and fired at one of the serpent’s heads.<br><br>But the bullet bounced harmlessly off its golden surface.<br><br>"...Even this doesn’t penetrate."<br><br>"Hahaha!! Foolish!! This is one of the Seven Great Calamities, Yamata no Orochi Jr.! Its hide is immune to physical attacks!! Now, Junior! Take my place and devour him!!"<br><br>[[[[[[[ShaaaaAAAAAAAAAA!!]]]]]]]<br><br>All eight heads roared in unison.<br><br>Even Haise broke into a cold sweat from the overwhelming pressure.<br><br>Choco Latte raised his shield and shouted.<br><br>[Haise, what’s the plan!?]<br><br>"I’d say defeat it... but this is bad. If the rocket launcher and anti-materiel rifle don’t work..."<br><br>[Don’t tell me... those were your strongest weapons?]<br><br>"Pretty much. They’re the strongest I can use. Now what?"<br><br>Haise sweated profusely and clenched his teeth.<br><br>◇◇◇◇◇<br><br>Sasha swung her sword, enveloped in golden energy.<br><br>Even when touched by Shoggoth’s tendrils, her aura prevented her from being dissolved or harmed.<br><br>But now Tycoon and Reynold were in trouble.<br><br>"Damn this slimy bastard...!!"<br><br>"Ugh... Magic doesn’t work well on it!!"<br><br>"Reynold, Tycoon...!"<br><br>"Sasha, don’t worry about us!! Just cut down that woman!!"<br><br>Reynold’s massive shield had melted, and his skin was peeling and bleeding.<br><br>Tycoon’s magic support was repeatedly interrupted by the tendrils.<br><br>Meanwhile, Piasora and Robin remained naked and restrained.<br><br>Nortes stood by them, laughing softly.<br><br>"Come on, try harder, try harder♪"<br><br>"You wretched woman!! Get rid of this slimy mess already!!"<br><br>"My, such filthy language. Naughty boys get punished~♪"<br><br>"Ahh!?"<br><br>At Nortes’s command, Shoggoth sent a jolt through Piasora’s body, making her convulse.<br><br>"Hehe. Keep talking like that, and I’ll tear you apart. Bit... by bit..."<br><br>"You... I’ll never... forgive you...!!"<br><br>Tears welled in Piasora’s eyes as she blushed with anger.<br><br>Robin clenched his teeth, glaring at Nortes.<br><br>But there was nothing they could do. The helplessness was infuriating.<br><br>"Golden blade... huff, huff..."<br><br>Tycoon noticed Sasha’s labored breathing and cold sweat.<br><br>Her exhaustion from overusing her power was obvious.<br><br>"Sasha!!"<br><br>"I know!!"<br><br>Tycoon’s shout was met with Sasha’s strained response.<br><br>Her power, the Sword Master’s ability, was extraordinary—but Sasha was still a seventeen-year-old girl.<br><br>She had never used her abilities at full power for this long before.<br><br>"Can’t lose now..."<br><br>She sliced Shoggoth in two, but it regenerated instantly.<br><br>Tycoon had a realization.<br><br>"Wait... it’s constantly dividing and multiplying, isn’t it?!"<br><br>"Correct~! If left unchecked, it would multiply endlessly, but I’m holding it back on purpose, just for fun."<br><br>"Dammit... Tycoon, got any ideas?!"<br><br>"..."<br><br>Tycoon looked at Sasha, who understood immediately.<br><br>Then he glanced at Piasora.<br><br>"Don’t... look at me like that..."<br><br>His gaze burned with intent, though not lecherous.<br><br>Piasora nodded faintly, unnoticed by Nortes.<br><br>"Come on, give it your all~♪ When you’re exhausted, I’ll turn you into my toys. And those handsome men can join the fun, too~♪"<br><br>The battle was entering its climax.<br><br>◇◇◇◇◇<br><br>Haise was retreating.<br><br>Choco Latte was holding up its shield against Yamata no Orochi’s poisonous fangs.<br><br>[Ugh... Haise, my shield won’t hold much longer...!!]<br><br>"Damn it!!"<br><br>Yamata no Orochi launched its venomous fangs.<br><br>Even a touch meant instant death.<br><br>Choco Latte’s shield was nearly destroyed.<br><br>Haise fired his gatling gun, but every bullet bounced off.<br><br>"Hahaha!! You’re powerless!! Junior, don’t just use fangs—sweep them away!!"<br><br>[!!]<br><br>One of the heads lunged directly at them.<br><br>Haise summoned a rocket launcher but couldn’t aim in time.<br><br>[Haise!!]<br><br>"!!"<br><br>Choco Latte tackled Haise and leaped away, but one of the heads swatted them, shattering Choco Latte’s armor and sending them flying a hundred meters into a house.<br><br>"Hahaha!! Weaklings!! Keep trying in vain!! Feel my pain!!"<br><br>The demon was ecstatic.<br><br>Fortunately, the house was filled with plush toys, cushioning their fall.<br><br>"Urgh..."<br><br>[Ugh... cough...]<br><br>Choco Latte coughed up blood, its side bleeding heavily.<br><br>Haise’s right arm and leg throbbed with pain.<br><br>"Stay with me...!!"<br><br>[Don’t underestimate a Chaos Goblin’s recovery... I won’t die from this...]<br><br>But he couldn’t stand. Choco Latte had shielded Haise at the cost of his own injuries.<br><br>Haise was also too hurt to move properly or wield his weapons.<br><br>The enemy was a demon and the dungeon boss, Yamata no Orochi Jr.<br><br>The situation was dire.<br><br>"...Are you ready to die?"<br><br>[...What?]<br><br>"I said, are you ready to die?"<br><br>[...I am. This life... is yours to share.]<br><br>"...Not the words I wanted to hear from a goblin beastman."<br><br>[What?]<br><br>Haise chuckled bitterly, then steeled his expression.<br><br>"I’ll stake everything."<br><br>Haise resolved to use his trump card.</p></p>
