<p>New Equipment and Preparations<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the Clan Sacred's exclusive meeting room for Sacred members,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha and Reynold sat with their eyes gleaming, looking at what lay on the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""“Whoa…!!”""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their voices harmonized perfectly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sacred’s dedicated dwarf blacksmith, Danban, puffed out his chest with pride.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call this my magnum opus. Heh, it’s a sword and shield made from the legendary stone, 'Rainbow Miracle Stone Seventh Starlight.'”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This is amazing… Danban, I’m truly grateful.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha picked up the longsword with its transparent, rainbow-colored blade.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a gentle swing, the rainbow trail it left behind was mesmerizing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold picked up the large shield with his left hand and attached a round shield to his right gauntlet. With a light swing, he noticed something.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This… feels like it’s half the weight of any shield I’ve ever used… What about its durability?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You fool. Its durability is about twenty times that of your old shield. A dragon’s breath wouldn’t leave a scratch. It practically nullifies both physical and magical attacks. Sasha’s sword is of the same caliber.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No way… That’s incredible.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Unbelievable.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“They’re the Rainbow Couple’s Shield and the Sacred Rainbow Sword Nanatsu Saya. Handle them with care… not that they’ll ever break! Gahaha!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold, showing off the shield, addressed Danban.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Thanks a lot, old man Danban.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No, I should be the one thanking you. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I’d get to touch and work with Seventh Starlight. Honestly, I could die happy now.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, don’t go saying stuff like that! We’re counting on you to drink with us tonight.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, that’s a different story!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold and Danban laughed heartily.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha slid her sword into its scabbard.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Danban, what about the sword I’ve been using until now…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah, the broken one? It can’t be repaired anymore…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Don’t jump to conclusions. I used the hilt and scabbard of your beloved sword to craft this one. Normally, broken swords are laid to rest… Was it too meddlesome of me?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Danban, you are the finest blacksmith there is.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Gahaha!! Quit flattering me, it’s embarrassing. Now, Reynold, let’s go grab a drink. As someone who’s looked after you broke rookies, I’d love to hear how far you’ve come.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sounds good to me. Hey Sasha, you’re coming too, right?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Of course.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The trio of Sasha, Reynold, and Danban headed to their favorite tavern.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After drinking with Danban for hours, they parted ways.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold and Sasha walked home to the clan house, enjoying the night breeze. Reynold glanced at Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Phew… Did I overdo it for the first time in a while?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Under the streetlights, her beautiful silver hair shimmered, and her slightly flushed cheeks were alluring.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The casual outfit chosen by Piasora revealed a bit of her neckline. The smooth skin from her neck to her chest was breathtaking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold thought to himself, “I’ve definitely had too much.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, Sasha. There’s a party at the royal castle tomorrow, right?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. Tycoon has already submitted the formal report, so it’ll just be a celebration.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Think Haise will show up?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. Geist-san apparently insisted he come. Heh, he’s not really into stiff parties like that.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha chuckled softly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Whenever the conversation turned to Haise, her smile became genuine.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It didn’t sit well with Reynold.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, Sasha. Remember our promise?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Huh?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“The one where you said you’d grant any request. Did you do what Piasora asked yet?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Not yet. Tycoon wants permission to enter the royal library; I’ll handle that tomorrow. As for Robin’s request to invite Haise, I’ll ask him at the party.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Can I ask for something too?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sure, anything.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold stopped walking and spoke seriously.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Once things calm down… Let’s grab a meal. Just the two of us.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Huh? That’s it?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. Just the two of us.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Alright, I don’t mind.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Great. It’s a promise, then.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold grinned and started walking again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, oblivious as she was, somehow started to realize.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe… Reynold was—<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next morning, Haise was called to the Guildmaster’s room by Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“There’s a party today. Haise, get ready.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Do you think I’m going to run or something?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Instant reply… Look, I’m not a fan of parties, but I won’t skip this one.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Not happening. Now, come on.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wait, where are we going?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“To get you dressed.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist took Haise to a tailor near the guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Apparently a regular, Geist presented the guildmaster’s black metal adventure card and instructed, “Find something that fits him for the party.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Five female staff members rushed over to take Haise’s measurements.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Whoa!? H-Hey, wait—”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Also, set his hair. And get him a new eyepatch. The party isn’t until tonight, so take your time. Money is no object.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Geist, I can handle this on my own…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. Consider this a gift.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…You’re enjoying this, aren’t you!? Hey, not the pants! Wait—!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Stripped down to his underwear, Haise was fitted with various formal suits.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Once his outfit, new eyepatch, and accessories were finalized, he underwent hair styling and light makeup.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm… It suits you well.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You look so cool, Haise-san!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Really.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When he stepped out, two unexpected figures awaited him: Mina and Presea, both dressed up in elegant gowns.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Why are you two here?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Allow me to explain!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This party celebrates your conquest of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths with Sasha. Nobles from various countries will attend. If they find out you’re solo, noble daughters will swarm you. This is a preventative measure.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…I was going to say that!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“And so, she offered her services.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Standing before Haise was Presea in an elven dress with exposed shoulders, green as its base color.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her once-short hair now flowed past her shoulders, tied back with an emerald hairpin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Light makeup enhanced her beauty to near-perfection.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I didn’t ask for this.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His first words made Presea frown and stomp on his foot.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ow!?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Your mentor went out of their way, and you’re just going to ignore that?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Fine.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise. Don’t underestimate unmarried noble ladies without fiancés. Right now, you’re more valuable than royalty.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I am?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Of course. You might not realize it, but your total assets exceed several decades of a royal family’s annual budget. You could live twenty lifetimes in luxury. Naturally, some noblewomen would want that.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Great.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise, I’m always ready to marry you, just so you know! Asset management is my specialty!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise turned to Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Why is Mina even here?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“My proposal got ignored… Sob, Haise-san doesn’t notice me at all…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I figured having her as my aide would be good experience.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Fair enough… Wait, hold on.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea took Haise’s arm, pressing her chest against it, her expression calm as ever.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Make sure you escort me properly.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Fine.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And so, Haise’s preparations for the party were complete.</p>
