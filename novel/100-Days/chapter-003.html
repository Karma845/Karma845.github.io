<p>Guild Master<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Adventurers' Guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, who had been called to the Guild Master's office, sat on the sofa and drank the tea that was served to him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There were no sweets, just the tea. However, that was enough for Haise. He had no intention of staying long.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Guild Master, who had called Haise, sighed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You seem to have defeated the Mithril Ogre."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, well."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…To hunt a Mithril Ogre solo at an S+ difficulty level. Ridiculous, really."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Please, Geist... Don't say it like that."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Guild Master, Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>An S-rank adventurer, known as 'Combat', one of the strongest in hand-to-hand combat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Normally, an S-rank adventurer would form a clan.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, it's not uncommon for S-rank adventurers like Geist to pass on leadership to their heirs and become the Guild Master of an Adventurers' Guild. In fact, all Guild Masters in the Adventurers' Guilds around the world are S-rank adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By the way... Geist is also Haise's mentor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At that moment, the door to the Guild Master's office was knocked, and a veteran receptionist entered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She had a piece of parchment in her hand, bowed to Haise, and sat across from him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry for the wait. The appraisal for the Mithril Ogre is complete, so here are the details."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"First, the core in its heart. Since it was severely damaged, it went from 700 gold coins to 200. The internal organs were similarly damaged, and about 90% of the blood was lost. The usable parts are the Mithril bones in the arms, legs, and skull. That amounts to 400 gold coins, bringing the total to 600."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That works."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>600 gold coins.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With one gold coin, a commoner could live for 30 days without working.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, Geist sighed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise... Can't you be a little more careful when defeating them?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You know my 'abilities' make it hard, Geist. If it were your martial arts, you could probably destroy the heart without damaging the core."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're really a handful."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist chuckled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The veteran receptionist placed a box-like 'magic tool' in front of Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise held up his Adventurer Card, and it glowed faintly for a moment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>All the money was deposited in the 'bank,' and through the Adventurer Card, it could be withdrawn. To prevent misuse, only the cardholder could withdraw money.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The deposit is complete. Would you like to check?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's fine. I'll leave for today."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stood up, but Geist stopped him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait, Haise. There's something I need to talk to you about."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eh...? I'm hungry, you know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It'll be quick."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The veteran receptionist left the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist moved to the sofa and took out a letter from his pocket.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…What's this?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's an invitation to the S-rank adventurer certification ceremony."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Huh? We already had that ceremony, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That was the one for the guild. It was a simple certification and card update. This invitation is from the royal family."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The royal family… from the Heiberg Kingdom?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Where else would it be from?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait, why is the royal family involved... with the S-rank adventurer certification ceremony?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist placed the invitation in front of Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Once upon a time, the first king of Heiberg Kingdom established the adventurer profession and was the first S-rank adventurer. As a result, those certified as S-rank adventurers receive the king's blessing, and the royal family holds the certification ceremony."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I... didn't know that... So, Geist, you too?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. I received it about forty years ago."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist was 58 years old, meaning he had received it when he was 18.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"After receiving the certification, the royal family gives the S-rank adventurer a request. By accepting it, they are truly recognized as an S-rank adventurer."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The royal family gives a request?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. It's the first request for an S-rank adventurer."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But I already defeated the Mithril Ogre..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't worry about it. And make sure to wear formal attire."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'll recommend a good tailor."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're so considerate, Geist."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't mention it..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist added,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"By the way, Sasha, who also ranked up around the same time, will be at the ceremony too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At that, Haise's expression turned cold.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist sighed heavily.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...You still can't forgive her?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, I can't forgive her."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I've told you many times, haven't I? Sasha expelled you because she didn't want you to die. It was out of kindness."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If she was so kind, could she say things like, 'You're a burden', or 'You're not fit for the team'?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's not what she really meant..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Even so, she expelled me. And that's not all. She... she..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well... I don't mind her way of cutting off the weak to grow stronger. That's how she’ll continue to build 'the strongest team'. And one day, she'll challenge the 'Forbidden Six Labyrinth'..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist, I haven't changed. Even if I become an S-rank adventurer, I don't need any companions. I’ll continue aiming to be the strongest alone... I can't trust anyone as a companion."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stood up, grabbed the invitation, and left the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After Haise left, Geist let out a deep sigh.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Kids these days."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yes, a child.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But... when Sasha expelled Haise and a certain 'incident' occurred, their relationship was irreparably shattered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They were childhood friends from the same village. They came to the capital together, registered as adventurers at the age of twelve, and awakened their 'abilities.' Geist taught them how to fight, and by thirteen, they officially debuted as adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist clearly remembered this day.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist let out another sigh, though he didn't know how many times it had been.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, there was a knock on the door.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Excuse me. Geist, I was told you have something for me..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was Sasha who entered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With long silver hair that shone, a hair ornament with wings, wearing light silver armor made from the materials of the SS-rated disaster-level dangerous species 'Silver Ray Dragon,' and a sword crafted from a dragon's fang hanging at her waist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At sixteen, she had an air of maturity and beauty. When Geist heard that this granddaughter-like girl had ranked up to S-rank adventurer, he secretly teared up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, yes. Actually, it's about the S-rank adventurer certification ceremony..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist relayed the same information he had given Haise to Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Certification ceremony?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. The S-rank adventurer certification ceremony will be held at the royal castle. Of course, your teammates are all invited as well."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Really!? Hey, hey, is there going to be a party? Delicious food and everything!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Robin, you're so greedy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Excited, Robin asked, and Tycoon adjusted his glasses as he spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin pouted, but Tycoon ignored her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Sasha, are you going to wear a dress?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Apparently it's formal attire. I don't think I'll look good in it though."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous! Sasha in a dress would be far less strange than Reynolds walking around the town naked!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Piasora... what kind of example is that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynolds protested, but Piasora completely ignored him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Clinging to Sasha's arm, Piasora leaned in and said,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, let's go buy a dress now!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Now? But it's already evening."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It'll be fine if we go to my usual store! And I'll get one for Robin too! The guys don't need any!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let's go!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, okay..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Pulled by Piasora, Sasha and the others headed to the clothing store.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But, in Sasha's mind... one thing lingered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Ah, Haise will be there too. That... we can't fight.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The words Geist had said, apologetically, echoed in Sasha's mind.</p>
