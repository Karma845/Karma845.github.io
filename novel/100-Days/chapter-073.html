<p>Heracles 4<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was walking alone through the night in the bar district.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sometimes, she just wanted to drink alone. That was how Sasha felt.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The reason... was undoubtedly the lingering impact of what Hijiri had said to her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Just a heads-up. If you keep running your clan like this, you’re definitely going to end up like a dictator. Kicking out people who don’t listen to you, taking out your frustrations on others, pretending to care while pushing your own selfish opinions. People who lack composure are all the same. See ya.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She could recall every word.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That was how deeply those words had pierced Sasha’s heart.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...That’s not what I meant."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her comrades were treasures.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That was something she had learned after expelling Haise, her former self. She was different now.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was true, she lacked composure. Managing the clan, conquering the Six Forbidden Labyrinths, her reputation as an adventurer and clan master had spread far and wide.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even in Uron, Hijiri’s homeland in the west, Sasha’s name was known. So was Haise’s.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha had finally realized that becoming famous meant being evaluated and seen by others. Unlike the way Reynold and the others, who knew her well, saw her, perhaps her lack of composure was visible to outsiders.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...My throat’s dry."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Muttering to herself, Sasha lifted her head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The night bar district sparkled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The main street was lined almost entirely with bars. The smell of alcohol was expected, but so were the aromas of grilled meat and fish, the sounds of cooking, and the laughter of adventurers and locals.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This was probably the liveliest and most fun place in the royal capital at this hour. It looked completely different from the quiet, deserted bar district during the day.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha turned from the main street into a narrow alley.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This was where many small, privately-owned bars were clustered. Without hesitation, Sasha walked straight to one and opened the door.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Welcome. Oh... it’s been a while, Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Master, it’s been a while."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bar: Reminiscence of Light Snow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A small bar tucked away in a corner of the winding alley.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha had been coming here for years. Strangely, she had never seen anyone else in this bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not even Reynold and the others knew about this place. It was Sasha’s secret spot.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Here’s your welcome drink."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thank you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A sweet white cocktail, as white as snow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha downed it in one go and spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Master, I want to get a little drunk... give me something strong."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Understood."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The master poured several types of liqueur into a shaker.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As she watched him, Sasha muttered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Maybe I should try to be more optimistic."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The master shook the shaker, poured the contents into a glass, and added a cherry.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What he placed in front of Sasha was Light Snow... the bar’s original cocktail.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha took a sip. A sweet, deep, and rich flavor spread through her mouth, sliding down her throat and igniting a fire as it reached her stomach. It felt like her insides were burning.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Master, do I... lack composure?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Composure?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Today, someone told me... that I lack composure. That I’ll end up like a dictator someday... I thought the me who expelled Haise was gone... but I was wrong. She was just hiding deep inside me. And today... a girl I just met saw right through me. I’ve just been pretending..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her tone changed, becoming more talkative.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This was a place where Sasha could bare her true self. For some reason, she felt she could tell the master anything.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, you’ve been working hard."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The master smiled gently.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was in his sixties, with a calm demeanor that exuded reassurance. His pure white hair was neatly groomed, and his stylish white mustache was impeccably trimmed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Working hard, huh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She didn’t think working hard was a bad thing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She believed she was getting along well with her comrades and the clan’s adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Lately, she hadn’t been getting irritated or taking it out on others...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Ahhh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, overthinking isn’t good. For now, just empty your mind."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Empty... my mind."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She slumped over and ordered another drink.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Neither Haise nor Reynold knew about this. The weak 17-year-old girl named Sasha existed here.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The master filled a glass with colorful candy pieces and placed it in front of Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It seems like you’ve been bottling up a lot."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha. I don’t know the cause of your worries. But I can tell you this: you have many comrades. Why not confide in them?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...To Reynold and the others? Show them this side of me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Showing weakness isn’t a sin. The real sin is hiding your weakness and pretending to be someone you’re not."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......Pretending."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha. From my perspective, you’re a hardworking, kind girl. But to others, you might seem like a strict clan master or the S-rank adventurer Brynhilde. In other words... everyone sees you differently. Depending on the perspective, there are many versions of Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha. How do you see me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Master is... a kind, mature man... like a father, or a priest..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Actually, I used to be the head of an assassination organization."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha jolted upright. But the master just chuckled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just kidding. But... I also have sides you don’t know, things I can’t tell anyone, and weaknesses too. Yet, the me running this bar is the me you know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha thought.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The her who expelled Haise, the her who is a clan master, the her who is an S-rank adventurer—all of them were Sasha, all of them were her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Was I too trapped?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Probably. You must have been seen through by someone who recognized the part of yourself you didn’t want to acknowledge. That’s why you’re feeling down."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Master, you’re amazing."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m just old, that’s all."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I see. Heh, I am me. The me from back then, the me who’s reflecting on myself now—it’s all me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha finished the rest of her cocktail.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, she started feeling a little more upbeat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The me who calmly rejected that request is me. And... the me who wants to utterly crush Hijiri for looking down on me is also me. Heh, I’m starting to feel better."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Has your worry cleared up?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. I feel like going all out now."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Please don’t cause trouble here, okay?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha laughed, and the master gave a wry smile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After Sasha left, the master polished the glasses.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, the door opened, and a customer walked in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Welcome. What can I get you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───'The snow has stopped.'"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I see. So it’s cleared up, then."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───'No, it’s light snow.'"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The master placed a coaster on the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On it was a drawing of intertwined snakes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Welcome to Ouroboros."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The master smiled warmly at the customer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The customer shivered, took the coaster, and left the bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the now-empty bar, the master murmured softly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha. Everyone has a side they can’t show to others."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No longer the master of Bar: Reminiscence of Light Snow, but the leader of the world’s greatest assassination guild, Ouroboros, and its strongest assassin, Mareborger, smiled with the same gentle expression he had shown Sasha.</p>
