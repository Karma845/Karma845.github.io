<p>Heracles 8<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha stood up, spitting blood from her mouth.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She wiped her mouth and brushed back her disheveled hair.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her beautiful silver hair shimmered under the light, sparkling brilliantly. Moreover, the golden light enveloping her body shone brighter than ever before.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───Hehe."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha laughed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It wasn’t that she had underestimated Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But she had to say it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"For the first time... I feel like I can go all out."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"All out...? Are you looking down on me? Come at me seriously from the start. I’m serious here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is that so? Then, let me tell you. My fighting style is based on 'coordination with my comrades.' Reynold defends, Robin supports, Tycoon assists, Piasora heals... and I fight. That’s how I fight."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmph."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri, seemingly uninterested, clenched her fists again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha pointed her sword at Hijiri, taking a stance unlike any before.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She lowered her body, twisted it, and held her sword horizontally.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wh-what’s this...? This is different from usual."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Haven’t you guys seen this before?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cress asked Reynold, but it was Tycoon who answered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Our team, Sacred, has several combat patterns prepared depending on the situation. Each role, of course, has its own techniques, combat positions, initial moves, and fighting styles tailored to their duties... but as far as I know, I’ve never seen that stance before."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I-I don’t know it either..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"R-Robin too? What about Piasora?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t know..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In response to Myuane’s question, Robin and Piasora shook their heads.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was hard to say, but Tycoon spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Somehow... it looks like a rough stance, unlike Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Only Haise had noticed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That stance..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Do you know it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. That’s the stance Sasha used when she first started learning the sword on her own, before she became Geist’s disciple. It was supposed to have been corrected by Geist before Reynold joined the team."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, seemingly surprised, answered Presea honestly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It seems... she’s gone back to it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Come to think of it, only Geist and I know about Sasha’s wild days."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...???"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea tilted her head in confusion.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Looking at Geist, who was standing a little distance away, she saw him holding his head and smiling wryly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Here I come."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hehe, bring it───"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The moment Hijiri responded, the ground beneath Sasha exploded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri was startled. Sasha had crushed the ground with her foot, swung her sword toward the shattered earth, and used the wind pressure to launch herself forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A chunk of the ground, or rather, the earth itself, came flying.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was about ten meters in diameter. Hijiri could have shattered it, but she chose to dodge sideways, judging that losing sight of Sasha was a higher risk.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But───Sasha was gone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No way!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was there.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha had stabbed her sword into the flying chunk of earth and clung tightly to the wall of dirt.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri had thought it was a feint.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, enveloped in gold, smashed the chunk of earth toward Hijiri, sending fragments flying.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don’t look down on me!! DORARARARARARARARA!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri shattered the fragments with a flurry of punches.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her punches also created a whirlwind, blowing away the dust from the shattered earth.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha... was there. She flew straight at Hijiri from the front.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She must have planned to close the distance and unleash a series of attacks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let’s send you flying again."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next moment, Sasha threw her sword.........<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Straight at Hijiri, without hesitation, she threw the sword, a swordsman’s lifeline.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri hadn’t expected her to let go of her sword.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She had considered deflecting the Rainbow Holy Sword Nanatsusaya with her bare hands, but she judged that the sword, enveloped in dense golden energy, couldn’t be stopped by her flesh.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Instead of trying to knock it down, she dodged with the minimum necessary movement.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The sword had been aimed at her abdomen, so she interrupted her attack and twisted her body to avoid it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Here’s your payback."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wh...!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Why was Sasha now right beside Hijiri?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The moment Hijiri dodged the sword, Sasha’s golden aura enveloped her body with an output of 1000, enhancing her like never before, and she slipped into Hijiri’s guard.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What followed was Sasha’s fist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha’s fist sank into Hijiri’s abdomen───and Hijiri vomited blood as she was sent flying.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh, gah!! Cough, cough...!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"One hit. Hehe, even a [Sword Master]’s fist can hurt, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-you’re... as strong as... grandma... hehehe..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri stood up, spat blood from her mouth, rubbed her stomach, cracked her neck, and took a deep breath.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha extended her golden aura like a whip, grabbing her sword and retrieving it. It was an inelegant use of aura, something Sasha had never done before.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is getting damn fun!! Sasha, you’re not bad!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We’re just getting started. My body’s finally warming up."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Right. This is where it begins!! Hehehe... it’s been a while since I’ve used this!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri spread her fingers, opening both hands───and the earth and stones around her shattered, attaching themselves to her arms and legs.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dirt hardened, the stone’s texture changed... and it became steel gauntlets and greaves.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s been a while since I’ve used my ability too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ability, [Metal Master]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One of the Master-class abilities, it allows her to 'refine any metal'.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Iron, steel, copper, mithril, orichalcum, Damascus—there are many metal materials in this world. Hijiri has the ability to create these materials as long as she has dirt or stone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri mainly refined weapons like gauntlets and greaves, which she wore.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Combining grandma’s Wing-style Eight Extremities Fist with my [Metal Master], this is my own technique... the full power of S-rank adventurer Heracles Hijiri!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Interesting!! Let’s fight!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The battle between Hijiri and Sasha entered its final phase.</p>
