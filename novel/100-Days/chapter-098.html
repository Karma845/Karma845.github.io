Haise was paired with Miina, and Hijiri with Presea, handling the afternoon lectures.</p><p>Sasha spoke to Geist.</p><p>"Geist, leaving Haise aside… do you think Hijiri can handle lectures?"</p><p>"No need to worry. I’ve spoken with Hijiri a few times… that child is sharp. And her combat intuition rivals yours."</p><p>"Sh… sharp?"</p><p>"Hard to imagine from her usual behavior, huh? Well, I trust her."</p><p>Geist grinned.</p><p>To Sasha, Geist was both a mentor and a father figure.</p><p>She believed there could be no mistake in his words.</p><p>Looking ahead, she saw the instructor addressing the students.</p><p>"Everyone, you’ll now face two of the most famous S-rank adventurers. Give it your all and fight without regrets!"</p><p>Sasha would handle armed combat, while Geist took unarmed.</p><p>Surprisingly, seven out of ten unarmed fighters were girls. Boys mostly chose weapons.</p><p>The mock battle began, and Sasha activated a hint of fighting spirit, raising her sword.</p><p>Geist, too, lifted his right hand smoothly, resting his left on his hip.</p><p>A girl wearing gloves snapped into stance and shouted, "Please teach us!"</p><p>"…This feels kinda weird."</p><p>Sasha glanced at Geist.</p><p>The girl’s fists flew at impressive speed, seemingly pressuring him.</p><p>But Geist dodged, then gently guided her final strike to dissipate its force before leveling his left hand at her throat.</p><p>A quiet exchange, a quiet victory.</p><p>"Too much brute force. Typical of the young—relying on momentum over precision."</p><p>"Ugh…"</p><p>"But your strikes are sharp. Focus on technique and fluidity. I’ll teach you the details later."</p><p>"Y-yes, sir!!"</p><p>"Rest for now."</p><p>"Th-thank you…"</p><p>Geist smiled warmly and helped the girl up.</p><p>Sasha thought, "Ugh…" Geist, though middle-aged, moved with ageless grace, exuding a rugged charm only maturity could bring. The girl’s starry eyes said it all: "He’s so cool…"</p><p>Unexpectedly, many female adventurers sought him out.</p><p>"Please teach me!!"</p><p>"Very well, come at me."</p><p>Another fan incoming… Sasha sighed inwardly.</p><p>◇◇◇◇◇</p><p>Haise was struggling.</p><p>Despite prepping, speaking before a crowd was nerve-wracking.</p><p>[So!! I used my fist art to wring ‘em up, crushed their guts, and they puked everywhere—</p><p>Ahahahaha!!]</p><p>From the next room, Hijiri’s voice and laughter spilled out.</p><p>Haise mused: whether in mock battles or lectures, Hijiri might’ve been born to teach.</p><p>Geist had told him to share "experiences," but Haise rarely struggled post-awakening. Most beasts died to a shot or explosion.</p><p>Unlike Hijiri or Sasha, he had no epic tales—just classified fights in the Forbidden Six Labyrinths.</p><p>"Uh…"</p><p>""""""…………"""""</p><p>"Haise, sir, are you nervous?"</p><p>"…Shut up. What am I supposed to say?"</p><p>"Too busy playing around…"</p><p>"I don’t—! Ugh, should’ve stuck to mock battles…"</p><p>"Leave it to me!"</p><p>"…Huh?"</p><p>Miina stepped forward, clearing her throat.</p><p>"Today’s lesson will be unconventional. Presenting S-rank adventurer Darkstalker Haise!! You’ve all got questions, right? So—we’re doing Q&amp;A!! Hands up if you’ve got one!!"</p><p>"W-wait…!?"</p><p>Almost every hand shot up—including Sein, whom he’d met last night.</p><p>Miina smirked and pointed.</p><p>"Glasses-boy—Sein! Ask away!!"</p><p>"Yes!! How do I get as strong as you, sir!?"</p><p>"…Train."</p><p>"Train…?"</p><p>"Yeah. My ability’s Master-tier, but my teacher drilled me to hone my body first. Even after awakening, I kept at it."</p><p>This was true.</p><p>Before his awakening, Haise had trained under Geist alongside Sasha.</p><p>"Body arts synergize with all abilities," Geist preached.</p><p>Even after mastering weapons, Haise kept up unarmed drills—earning Geist’s praise as a top-five S-rank in pure martial skill.</p><p>"No beast waits for you to activate abilities. Your body’s your only constant. Sharp senses, hardened physique, then powers—that’s how I survived the Forbidden Six."</p><p>He caught himself mid-rant, coughing. "…That’s all."</p><p>"Great answer! So, 《Muscle is Justice!》, right?"</p><p>"Wrong."</p><p>"Next question!!"</p><p>"Hey."</p><p>Somehow, Miina’s antics saved the lesson.</p><p>◇◇◇◇◇</p><p>For days, Haise’s group taught as guest instructors.</p><p>Though elite, these trainees showed no arrogance—only fascination. Hijiri grumbled, "Wanted to crush some brats," but peace prevailed until the final day:</p><p>A full-team mock battle outside the city.</p><p>"Rules: seize one armband from each S-rank! Use every skill to steal them! The winning team gets a reward!!"</p><p>Haise fastened his armband, whispering to Sasha:</p><p>"Reward?"</p><p>"Temporary guild membership for dungeon training. They keep all loot."</p><p>"Oh… so—"</p><p>"Yep. My guild’s hosting."</p><p>Twenty teams of five students each would attack using tactics and abilities.</p><p>Predictably, Hijiri was</p><p>"Fired up…!!"</p><p>Haise weighed his Desert Eagle, then swapped to an assault rifle loaded with rubber bullets.</p><p>"…Pistols alone might be rough."</p></p>
