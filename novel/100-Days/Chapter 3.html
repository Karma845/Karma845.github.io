<h2>Chapter 3: Campus Life in a Different World</h2>

<p>&quot;Good morning, Teacher Leon!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Good morning~!&quot;</p>

<p> Under the blue sky, the sounds of greetings came and went.</p>

<p> This is the &quot;School District&quot; avenue paved with white stone. People of many races travel here.</p>

<p> Human and dwarf holding bags and books.</p>

<p> The orcs and Amazons whose clothes were a little messed up.</p>

<p> The little humans who hurriedly put breakfast into their mouths in the cafe, and the goblins who scolded them.</p>

<p> What they have in common with them is that all of them are wearing student uniforms and burgundy ties.</p>

<p> This must be a school scene that I have never seen before.</p>

<p> The &quot;Academy City&quot; is bathed in the morning sunshine, showing a different vitality from the labyrinth city (Orario).</p>

<p> &quot;Good morning, Nimue, Inda. Don't be late for class today.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;&quot;Okay~!&quot;</p>

<p> Among the crowd, the girls passing by us with their skirts flipping up started to make a fuss just because Mr. Wadenberg responded to their greetings. It also sounded like a scream of excitement.</p>

<p> I have seen similar situations many times after leaving Lord Baldr's principal's office&mdash;leaving the central tower.</p>

<p> Regardless of gender, whether human or demi-human, everyone is talking to us.</p>

<p> There is no doubt that the person next to me must be very popular these days.</p>

<p> &quot;Hey. Who is that kid? Look at him wearing the coat of arms of [Badelban].&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;I've never seen that face before. The entrance test hasn't been held in Port Town (Meilian) yet, so there should be no new students.&quot;</p>

<p> ...In addition, I also easily found that the girls I passed by just now were peeping at me and chatting quietly.</p>

<p> This should be regarded as a disadvantage after becoming a first-level adventurer, shouldn't it be a privilege?</p>

<p> After sublimation, my perception has been strengthened. I don&rsquo;t need to mention the sight of others. I can hear clearly even if there is a whispered discussion with a lowered voice, even from behind me.</p>

<p> Not only them, but the surrounding students also cast curious glances at me (the human)&mdash;no, the &quot;orc student&quot;&mdash;who was walking next to Mr. Wadenberg.</p>

<p> Unlike the looks I would receive nowadays in Orario to encourage high-level adventurers, this was pure curiosity.</p>

<p> (Grandpa seems to have said before that &quot;cute transfer students attract attention but are a fixed plot of campus themes~&quot;... Is this, is this similar to that one?)</p>

<p> Ever since the incident with the heretics (Benny and the others), people have gradually commented that my expression is different, that I have grown up, etc. However, once I leave the category of &quot;adventurer&quot; and &quot;dungeon&quot; (stage), I am born Feelings of timidity, tension, and embarrassment came up, and even I felt disappointed in myself.</p>

<p> Of course, fear of being exposed also accounts for a large part of the reason...</p>

<p> Or, would anyone have a similar feeling to being put into a strange environment?</p>

<p> Just when I couldn't calm down for some reason and my shoulders were tense,</p>

<p> &quot;Are you nervous?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;...! Yes, yes, I'm very sorry... Mr. Wadenberg...&quot;</p>

<p> A voice came from the side and spoke to me.</p>

<p> I apologized subconsciously, and then Mr. Wadenberg, whose lion-blond hair swayed, stopped and looked at me.</p>

<p> &quot;You're still a little stiff, Lapi. You should be a student in the 'School District' now, right?&quot;</p>

<p> The man in front of me kept smiling and deliberately called &quot;my name&quot; as a student, which suddenly made me realize.</p>

<p> &quot;Well, let me ask you a question when you visit the &quot;School District&quot;. 'How would teacher Leon Wadenberg want to be called now?'. Well, answer my question.&quot;</p>

<p> Hearing this gentle question, I couldn't help but blush on my cheeks.</p>

<p> Once I really wanted to say it, I felt itchy near my neck... With this feeling, I mustered up the courage and tried to answer the school's first question.</p>

<p> &quot;...&quot;Teacher Leon&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Correct answer. You will make a good student, Lapi.&quot;</p>

<p> He smiled heartily and said his sincere words as a joke.</p>

<p> Blushing and blinking my eyes, I chuckled.</p>

<p> Thanks to this, my shoulders relaxed. &quot;Teacher Leon&quot; saw this and smiled even more happily.</p>

<p> I kind of understand why this person is admired by so many students.</p>

<p> &quot;Look, Teacher Leon has captured a student he has never seen before!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;As expected of 'Knight, but Page (Ultra&middot;Page)'...!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;The combination of the cover-up rabbit servant girl and Leon-sensei... is possible!&quot;</p>

<p> ...I seemed to hear something, but I chose to ignore it completely.</p>

<p> The phantom (Lily) in my mind also shouted, &quot;You must not listen!&quot; &rdquo;, it seems that the choice not to listen is correct. That must be it.</p>

<p> &quot;Did you also get the school bag from Lord Balder?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Ah, yes. Along with the uniform.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Then remember to read it later. It contains a guide to campus life. It includes course selection. If you are unclear about something, ask me immediately.&quot;</p>

<p> Teacher Leon started walking. I walked beside him and put the strap on my schoolbag across my shoulders.</p>

<p> This is a square school bag with a thin texture. A bit like the backpack I used when Lily was still around, the capacity seems to be much larger than it looks from the outside.</p>

<p> &quot;I'm sorry, I just talked while walking. First of all, your student registration number is 4646B3333, and your major is &quot;Combat Techniques&quot;. Your affiliation is the same as mine, [Badel Class].&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Study number? &quot;Combat Skills&quot;? And &quot;Badel Class&quot;...?&quot;</p>

<p> I listened carefully to Teacher Leon's explanation.</p>

<p> However, I don&rsquo;t understand the meaning of most of the words.</p>

<p> This embarrassed me, but I took the plunge and tried to ask about things I didn't understand.</p>

<p> &quot;Uh, I'm sorry I didn't understand a lot of things... First of all, what is [Class]?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Good question. The so-called [class] is a system unique to the 'school district'.&quot;</p>

<p> I obviously wanted to go to the &quot;school district&quot;, but I didn't know anything about it, but Teacher Leon didn't show any sign of boredom, but started to explain carefully.</p>

<p> &quot;The students who belong to the 'School District' are all 'people of study', and they are also 'people who leave the nest' sooner or later. Recruitment of family members is a good example. After deciding on a way out, students will join other factions, or It is an organization like a guild. At that time, students cannot be labeled as &quot;formerly members of the [Family]&quot;, so this is the measure to be implemented for this purpose.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Ah, I see...&quot;</p>

<p> It's easy to forget after joining a faction, but in fact, the public attaches great importance to the label &quot;Family&quot;.</p>

<p> Familia have physical abilities beyond ordinary people, and people who don't belong to them or in the workplace often think that such people are dangerous (after all, the labyrinth city (Orario) has a special origin, so dangers are naturally frequent, and residents are accustomed to it). Even if the word &quot;familiar&quot; is included in the experience, some people will have excessive reactions to it. And if there is a conversion among factions, in the worst case scenario, some people may even be suspected of being spies somewhere.</p>

<p> That&rsquo;s why they call themselves the school district&rsquo;s grade (class) rather than God&rsquo;s sect (family). This shows that the &ldquo;school district&rdquo; is very considerate of its students.</p>

<p> In addition, there may also be an issue of impression.</p>

<p> The students did not transfer from other factions, but just joined the &quot;out-and-out faction of their own faction&quot; after learning a lot of knowledge in the &quot;school&quot;. In this way, they would not think of the other party as an outsider. It will also be easier for the main god to get along with the members.</p>

<p> (The &quot;school district&quot; firmly adheres to the position that it is only an &quot;educational institution&quot; that cultivates talents...Is this what it means.)</p>

<p> Just as I was trying to understand it in my own way, Teacher Leon added:</p>

<p> &quot;The 'school district' relies on a few gods, teachers like me, and many students to run it. Even if it is just to run it, it must have the 'favor of God'. Both teachers and students have received the favor.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Not just from Lord Balder, but from the respective gods, right?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;That's right. These systems are very close to the national system [Familiar]. It's just that Lord Badr only serves as the representative of the 'school district' and calls himself the principal. The status of each [class] is equal.&quot;</p>

<p> When I heard the metaphor of national family [family], my understanding became more concrete.</p>

<p> At a glance, the number of students easily exceeds a thousand. It is almost impossible to control the entire &quot;school district&quot; with just one god - especially things like updating [ability values]. Only by adopting a system of &quot;main god and slave god&quot; similar to the national system [Familiar Family] to perform their respective duties can it operate smoothly.</p>

<p> However, the &quot;slave god&quot; system like the one concluded by Hestia-sama and Miss Hill will definitely have a master-slave relationship.</p>

<p> And here, as Teacher Leon just told me, all the Lord Gods and each [class] have equal rights to speak.</p>

<p> By the way, in addition to [Badel Class], there seems to be [Eden Class], [Brachi Class], etc., with a total of ten classes.</p>

<p> The way to tell the difference is to look at the coat of arms worn on the left chest of the uniform.</p>

<p> This is equivalent to the [Familiar] emblem. What I wear on my chest is the coat of arms of [Badelban]&rsquo;s &lsquo;Light and Ship&rsquo;.</p>

<p> &quot;If the relationship between [Class] and [Class] is difficult to understand, just replace it with [Family]. A teacher like me is the group leader and other faction cadres, and the students are the members.&quot;</p>

<p> Oh oh, I couldn't help but open my mouth in an O shape and felt suddenly enlightened.</p>

<p> This metaphor probably also reveals the power gap between teachers and students.</p>

<p> Since they want to be teachers who guide others, teachers like Mr. Leon must have knowledge, character, and strong power.</p>

<p> &quot;The student status number is used to manage student information belonging to the &quot;school district&quot;. As for your major, &quot;Combat Techniques&quot;... I'll explain it later. &#12303;</p>

<p> A bell like a preparation bell rang in the central tower, and when fewer and fewer students were walking around, Teacher Leon walked along the road and walked into a certain building - it was a &quot;teaching building&quot;.</p>

<p> Like other buildings, the teaching building also has a cyan roof and white stone, and the interior is very clean. Naturally, I looked around curiously like an old farmer entering the city.</p>

<p>  The corridor here is also very white, but it is different from the castle-like interior in &quot;Battle Wilderness&quot;. After walking forward for a while, Teacher Leon stopped in front of a door.</p>

<p> &quot;Okay, here it is. Inside are the people who will soon become your 'level friends'.&quot;</p>

<p> Eh? My eyes widened, but Mr. Leon on the side just smiled and encouraged me, &quot;Let's go in together.&quot;</p>

<p> After a slow beat, I followed the teacher who opened the door and walked in - this is a &quot;classroom&quot;.</p>

<p> &quot;!&quot;</p>

<p> The area is huge. It's kind of like a small theater.</p>

<p> The pulpit and blackboard were at the far end of the room, and a long mahogany table formed a semicircle surrounding the former. The seat is a one-level structure, which is a &quot;mortar type&quot;. Perhaps the impression of a small theater is indeed correct.</p>

<p> There are many students sitting in such a &quot;classroom&quot;.</p>

<p> Humans, orcs, goblins, dwarves, homunculus and Amazons.</p>

<p> People of all races gathered here, all of them in their teens. There were more than fifty people.</p>

<p> Wearing &quot;School District&quot; uniforms, they looked towards Teacher Leon and me as they entered the classroom.</p>

<p> I couldn't help but feel a little unsteady on my feet. At this time, Teacher Leon walked towards the podium at the front of the classroom, so I hurriedly followed him.</p>

<p> &quot;According to plan, today we will give a brief introduction to labyrinth city training. ...However, before that, let me introduce your new partners.&quot;</p>

<p> Lapi, when I heard him softly calling my kana again, I understood.</p>

<p> I'm going to introduce myself here.</p>

<p> This moment is the beginning of the &quot;student self&quot;.</p>

<p> As soon as I figured this out, I felt nervous. The students looked at me with interest.</p>

<p> &quot;It seems like a strange guy is coming.&quot; I feel like I will have such auditory hallucinations at any time. Is this my persecutory delusion (delusion)?</p>

<p> I don't know why, but my feet are shaking.</p>

<p> I made up my mind with a different feeling of uneasiness than exploring a maze.</p>

<p> Breathing in the air gently and desperately through his nose, he took a step forward from the pulpit.</p>

<p> &ldquo;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;uh, ah.&rdquo;</p>

<p> The students' eyes surrounded me, and I felt a sense of oppression. This was probably caused by nervousness.</p>

<p> When I think of teachers like Mr. Leon giving lectures in this kind of place every day, I feel a sense of respect in my heart.</p>

<p> I foolishly escaped from reality, and after a while, I said:</p>

<p> &quot;I am Bell Crane... Lapi Flemand from the capital of Bel Crone!! Please, please give me your advice!&quot;</p>

<p> I nearly said my real name, screwed up the whole thing, and sweat dripped down my neck as I jerked my head down, trying to muddle through.</p>

<p> Fortunately, I heard about the forged place of origin (information) from Lord God (Badr), otherwise it would have been dangerous...! !</p>

<p> Teacher Leon's wry smile could be clearly heard, and I raised my head tremblingly, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p> &quot;Please give me some advice, compatriot~&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Don't be so nervous -?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;If you're a man, you should hold your chest out and your head up!&quot;</p>

<p> The orc boy raised a hand, the human girl spoke up, the red-haired Amazon joked, and the other students laughed cheerfully.</p>

<p> Look, it doesn't seem to matter...</p>

<p> Although I lost an adult, at least I didn't expose myself as the illegal intruder (Bell Crowne) from a few days ago...</p>

<p> &quot;Lappi passed the exam in the capital of Belrang where he had parked before, but due to personal reasons, he entered the school a step late, so he came to this port town (Melian). He doesn't understand this place at all now, so starting from today , I hope you can teach him various things as a class friend. Just like you did when you first visited the &quot;School District&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;&quot;&quot;yes!&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p> Teacher Leon summarized my self-introduction, and then the students nodded readily.</p>

<p> Just when I was surrounded by a sense of relief, I heard Teacher Leon say, &quot;Well, Lapi, find an empty seat and sit down.&quot; Then he replied in a voice that was an octave higher, &quot;Yes, yes!&quot; The result was another burst of laughter, and I left the podium with a blushing face.</p>

<p> When I walked up the steps and looked for my seat, the students still looked at me with interest.</p>

<p> I thought: Fortunately, I used a wig to cover my eyes...</p>

<p> My crimson eyes are rolling around, and I must be behaving suspiciously to the point of being embarrassed.</p>

<p> (Uh... empty position... empty position...)</p>

<p> My head drooped in shame, and I couldn't confirm where the students were sitting, so I wandered around the rows full of people like a headless fly, looking for a seat. At this moment,</p>

<p> &quot;This place is empty!&quot;</p>

<p> One girl raised her hand.</p>

<p> Right in the middle of the classroom. There is indeed an empty spot next to the steps.</p>

<p> I was extremely grateful for this and walked over - when I came in front of the girl, I was shocked.</p>

<p> &quot;Who are you&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p> Slightly pointed ears, long brown hair tied up with ribbons.</p>

<p> A strand of bangs is dyed the color of emerald.</p>

<p> The most important thing is that he has green jade eyes that are similar to someone else.</p>

<p> I have an impression of her.</p>

<p> The half-elf girl I met when I invaded the &quot;School District&quot; for the first time!</p>

<p> &quot;My name is Nina Zul. Please give me your advice, Lapi-kun.&quot;</p>

<p> Zul?</p>

<p> As expected, this person belongs to Miss Eina&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p> &quot;...What's wrong? Is your name a little too familiar?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Huh? Ah, no! How is that possible? Please give me some advice... Zu, Zu'er-san!&quot;</p>

<p> Although I stuttered a bit, I still managed to respond to her greeting.</p>

<p> The incident happened suddenly and I was at a loss for words. I sat down hurriedly and tried to get over it.</p>

<p> &quot;Teacher Leon also said, if you have anything you don't understand, do you want to ask me? I'll be happy to help.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Thank you very much...&quot;</p>

<p> Perhaps because he was taking care of me who was constantly nervous, after sitting next to me, Zuer-san still talked to me with a smile.</p>

<p> The crest on her chest is &quot;Light and Ship&quot;. Like me, they are both [Badelban].</p>

<p> That straight face is also very attractive, but...my attention is always drawn to the similarity to Miss Eina.</p>

<p> She has inherited the blood of a fairy who is often criticized for being mysophobic, but she has a gentle attitude and is kind to others.</p>

<p> Calm with a friendly atmosphere.</p>

<p> Although she doesn't wear glasses, she does look like Miss Eina.</p>

<p> Naturally, I couldn't stare at her all the time, so I just glanced at her from time to time. She felt weird about this, but she still showed a slight hint of me.</p>

<p> Now I look like a different person, and I have only looked at each other once before, so she probably didn't see through my identity, but... I didn't expect that we would get to know each other in this way.</p>

<p> &quot;Although her attitude is very gentle, don't misunderstand me, new classmate. Nina is an honor student and treats everyone like this.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Milly-senpai! Don't say weird things! Teacher Leon is going to give a brief explanation!&quot;</p>

<p> The girl sitting in the front row with her blond hair tied together - she was also a fairy - probably misunderstood my performance and said to me with a smile, which made me shake. Zuer reminded us that we should pay attention to Saw it before.</p>

<p> Well, it&rsquo;s better to be careful.</p>

<p> Although I care a lot, I&rsquo;d better concentrate on class now!</p>

<p> &quot;Well, it was also mentioned in the school-wide meeting held a few days ago that the 'school district' has successfully returned to this port town. Compared with other subjects, the following days will be more important to you who belong to the 'combat skills subject'.&quot;</p>

<p> A clear voice came from the pulpit.</p>

<p> As soon as Teacher Leon opened his mouth, the somewhat impetuous atmosphere in the classroom changed instantly.</p>

<p> &quot;As the name suggests, the 'Combat Skills Subject' is about learning martial arts related to combat, as well as the mental states related to it. There must be many of you sitting in this classroom who want to become combat professionals.&quot;</p>

<p> Teacher Leon talked about the &quot;Combat Techniques Subject&quot; as if he wanted to remind the students of their original intentions. This was probably also an explanation to me.</p>

<p> Belonging to this &quot;Combat Techniques Discipline&quot;, could it be Lord Hermes' suggestion?</p>

<p> Anyway, I think it's just right. If someone asks me what I want to learn and what I want to strengthen, then my first answer must be &quot;combat knowledge&quot; and &quot;combat skills&quot; that are useful for dungeon exploration.</p>

<p> &quot;The knights of the Empire, the marines of the Ocean Kingdom (Dessara), the court magicians of the Sorcerous Kingdom (Altina)... and the adventurers of the Labyrinth City (Orario). There are many ways out for you, but since If we take this as our goal, the experience in the dungeon, one of the 'three great secret places in the world', will be very valuable. It can be said that this is also the focus of the evaluation of teachers like me.&quot;</p>

<p> For the &quot;Combat Skills Subject&quot;, &quot;Visiting the Labyrinth City&quot; is also a big event, and this was revealed in Teacher Leon's words. The students all showed serious expressions, and I seemed to be affected, so I straightened my posture.</p>

<p>  &quot;Three days later, you will be allowed to enter Orario from the &quot;School District&quot;. From that day on, the faction experience will also be open, but for everyone in the &quot;Combat Techniques Department&quot;, the &quot;Special Internship&quot; is the most important .&rdquo;</p>

<p> At this time, Teacher Leon pulled out a piece of chalk from the leather bag on his right waist.</p>

<p> The blackboard began to creak.</p>

<p> &quot;Each 'team' will explore the floors that match your abilities and bring back the 'dropped props' of the monsters specified in advance. Based on the prescribed maze victory results, you will receive corresponding 'credits'.&quot;</p>

<p> The words &quot;squad&quot; and &quot;credits&quot; really concern me, but I won't go into them now.</p>

<p> As Teacher Leon spoke, he wrote a common language and a rectangular diagram on the blackboard that were too beautiful to look like handwriting.</p>

<p> &quot;Of course, the report must also be submitted. Although I believe that you will not do this, there is no use in buying &quot;dropped items&quot; from adventurers and submitting them. You will know whether you have actually explored it, so This behavior is not recommended.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Teacher&mdash;! What will happen if you really do it?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;That's right. A student once did such a thing, and then I personally accompanied him for three days and three nights of tutoring in the dungeon. After returning to the surface, the student shed tears of joy and said, 'So the sun is so &quot;It's beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p> Hearing Teacher Leon interjecting a story about the past, some students couldn't hold it back and burst into laughter. He shook his golden hair and faced the students again.</p>

<p> The writing on the blackboard has been finished, and a simple schematic diagram has been drawn on the blackboard. The rectangular diagrams mark the floors of the maze, as well as the [Ability Value] standards.</p>

<p> The evaluation criteria for ability values &#8203;&#8203;are very detailed. [Ability Value] is Lv. 1. Those in the lower level can go to the 5th floor at most, while those in the upper level are divided even more finely, and the deepest can go to the 9th floor.</p>

<p> Starting from the 10th floor, only Level 2 teams are allowed to enter, and the maximum depth can be attacked to the 15th floor.</p>

<p> (Much stricter than the &quot;ability value attainment standards&quot; set by the guild for each floor...)</p>

<p> I once heard Master Hermes say that the students in the &quot;school district&quot; are very good, and many of them have been promoted.</p>

<p> Thinking about it this way, this restriction seemed quite strict, or &quot;over-protective&quot;. However... I immediately thought that the people in this classroom were not &quot;adventurers&quot;.</p>

<p> In the dungeon, the number of [ability value] is certainly important, but what is more important is whether you have &quot;experience&quot;.</p>

<p> How many times you have experienced the &quot;unknown&quot; and turned it into the &quot;known&quot; will truly determine life or death.</p>

<p> Lily, who was able to move around the 10th floor when she was still a Level 1 supporter, is a good example, but there are also many counterexamples. It is said that it is not uncommon for high-level adventurers who have met the qualifications to die easily in the middle level.</p>

<p> Thinking about it this way, it is natural that students' &quot;experience&quot; in dungeons is overwhelmingly insufficient and they cannot adopt the same standards as adventurers who make a living by exploring dungeons.</p>

<p> The standards prepared by the &quot;school district&quot; were probably developed with the safety of students as the top priority.</p>

<p> &quot;During the internship, teachers like myself will also be placed on each floor. I also want to keep an eye on each of you, but... the dungeon is very wide. Therefore, not every corner is under surveillance, so please remember this. &quot;</p>

<p> &quot;&quot;&quot;...!&quot;&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Not to mention the abnormal situation, in addition to monsters, you may also have conflicts with adventurers. If you are not careful, unreasonable situations will occur and you will easily be forced into a desperate situation.&quot;</p>

<p> His serious words made the atmosphere even more tense.</p>

<p> Zuer and other students next to him all held their breath. At this time, Teacher Leon looked around the classroom.</p>

<p> &quot;In the field investigations and combat missions so far, you students of the &quot;Combat Techniques Department&quot; have especially received physical and mental training. There are also many people who have achieved sublimation. However, I want to make one point clear. The dungeon is nothing like anything you have experienced. The battlefield&mdash;it&rsquo;s all different.&rdquo;</p>

<p> The sound completely disappeared.</p>

<p> I could clearly feel the students&rsquo; tension and high level of motivation.</p>

<p> After a moment of silence, Teacher Leon smiled slightly.</p>

<p> &quot;Please remember what I just said in your mind and approach your training in the Labyrinth City. It doesn't matter. As long as you are not careless and prepared, you will be fine. You students in the &quot;School District&quot; can do it.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;&quot;&quot;yes!!&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p> Then a small craze was born.</p>

<p> It's not morale, nor curiosity... Is this the &quot;will to learn&quot;?</p>

<p> I was also affected by them and tensed up.</p>

<p> Want to learn something, want to experience unknown things. I came to the &quot;School District&quot; with this vague idea, but since I am in the &quot;Combat Techniques Department&quot;, I should also participate in this &quot;Special Internship&quot;. Remember what you just heard.</p>

<p> Hiding the identity of an adventurer and attacking a dungeon sounds a little strange.</p>

<p> After that, Teacher Leon explained the specific schedule and regulations according to the detailed information written on the blackboard.</p>

<p> &quot;That's the brief explanation. As usual, it would be time to answer questions, but... a new partner came to campus today. So let's change the subject this time and listen to his opinions.&quot;</p>

<p> &#8230;&#8230;Um?</p>

<p> I always feel that there is some momentum...?</p>

<p> &quot;Rapi, do you have any ideas?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;...I-I'm here!? E-Eh?&quot;</p>

<p> Since I was not used to hearing this name, it took me a long time to realize that it was calling me, and then I subconsciously stood up.</p>

<p> Teacher Leon looked over from the podium. All eyes in the classroom were focused on me.</p>

<p> The heartbeat that had calmed down became fast again!</p>

<p> &quot;You want to be an adventurer, right? Then, I would like to hear if you have any ideas on how this 'special internship' can teach you more.&quot;</p>

<p> Rather than saying that I want to be an adventurer, it&rsquo;s better to say that I&rsquo;m currently active...</p>

<p> Well, in short, I seem to have this &quot;setting&quot;.</p>

<p> Even if I prepare a false experience, I am not confident that I can perform it perfectly, so this kind of &quot;setting&quot; will indeed make it harder for me to reveal my flaws. This must have been considered by Teacher Leon and Lord Badr for my sake.</p>

<p> Although it's for my own sake, but...I, what should I say? ?</p>

<p> &quot;Rapi, in the 'school district', it's important to express your opinion. It doesn't matter if you're wrong. It doesn't matter if what you say is completely irrelevant. I hope you can come up with your own answer every time, and always keep questioning, no matter what Keep asking questions, both of yourself and of others.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;It is through these actions that we gradually understand what 'learning' is.&quot;</p>

<p> Feeling the &quot;teacher's&quot; eyes that I had never experienced before - different from the gods - I suddenly realized.</p>

<p> Teacher Leon is probably teaching me.</p>

<p> Teach me the laws (rules) of this &quot;school district&quot;, or what should be called the &quot;school district&quot; style of life.</p>

<p> He was about to explain the first &quot;lesson&quot; to me.</p>

<p> &quot;Or what do you think you should pay attention to in the process of becoming an adventurer? Can you let me hear your thoughts?&quot;</p>

<p> the teacher asked kindly.</p>

<p> Stunned on the spot, I accidentally looked to the side and saw classmate Zuer also smiling and silently saying &quot;Come on&quot; to cheer me up.</p>

<p> The student's gaze was still piercing me... I clenched my hands and moved my throat.</p>

<p> &quot;Those who take risks must never take risks...&quot;</p>

<p> My voice trembled so much that I felt even more embarrassed. I suppressed my voice and said these words.</p>

<p> Teacher Leon, who looked at me, had his eyes wide open.</p>

<p> At the same time, you can also feel that classmate Zuer sitting next to you is very confused.</p>

<p> My voice unexpectedly echoed around me, and then the scene became quiet, and then the students around me started talking.</p>

<p> &quot;What's the meaning&#8230;&#8230;?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;You're an adventurer but you can't take risks. What's going on?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;How weird? What did he want to say?&quot;</p>

<p> Just when my sublimated hearing accurately heard the content of the discussion again, which made me break out in a cold sweat&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p> &quot;--marvelous.&quot;</p>

<p> Teacher Leon smiled.</p>

<p> &quot;What Lapi just said sounds very contradictory, but I think it is a truth.&quot;</p>

<p> The students' eyes left me and focused on the podium again.</p>

<p> &quot;In the dungeon, bravery is definitely not worthy of praise. Rather, the more 'cowardly' you are, the better you can protect yourself and the lives of your companions.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;&quot;&quot;!&quot;&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Accurately judge the timing of retreat and act without taking risks. This is the most important thing for adventurers who explore in the cruel environment of dungeons.&quot;</p>

<p> The surprised faces of the students showed more or less expressions of understanding.</p>

<p> Now, everyone in the classroom is listening carefully to every word of Teacher Leon.</p>

<p> &quot;Since we are going to sneak into the dungeon, we need to learn more about the survival methods of adventurers. Thanks to Lapi, I have become a little smarter. - Everyone, applause!&quot;</p>

<p> &mdash;&mdash;In an instant, thunderous applause erupted in the classroom.</p>

<p> The students' voices of praise surrounded me, who was startled and stayed where I was.</p>

<p> The orc boy, the human girl, and the red-haired Amazon all looked at me with admiration. Zuer's classmate on the side showed a bright smile and clapped harder than anyone else.</p>

<p> ...This is the &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p> Frank opinions and well-spoken opinions are welcome without any distinction or discrimination.</p>

<p> Embarrassment and excitement from nowhere filled my heart.</p>

<p> I will get good reviews not because I said it is great.</p>

<p> It was Teacher Leon who carefully interpreted it so that the students could understand it, and also analyzed the hidden meaning in the words in detail to ensure that everyone could fully understand it. It's much more beautiful than someone like me.</p>

<p> What's more, he probably created this opportunity deliberately to allow me, a new student, to integrate into the &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p> Although it hasn't been long since I met him...but he really takes care of me.</p>

<p> Someone like Mr. Leon must be the so-called &quot;amazing adult&quot;.</p>

<p> I felt that almost no one around me had this kind of personality (type), and I frankly felt a surge of respect.</p>

<p> &quot;Lappi. By the way, are the answers you just came up with on your own?&quot;</p>

<p> After the applause stopped, Teacher Leon asked.</p>

<p> I speak the truth frankly and proudly only at this moment:</p>

<p> &quot;No. It was taught to me by someone I value very much.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Adventurers must not take risks.&quot;</p>

<p> These are the words of Miss Eina.</p>

<p> It was also a lesson that saved me from being easily carried away when I became an adventurer.</p>

<p> &quot;Really? I see...&quot;</p>

<p> It seems that Ms. Eina was once a student here. Maybe this teaching rooted in the heart is also an extension of learning in the &quot;school district&quot;. While I was thinking about this, Teacher Leon put one hand on his chin and nodded gently several times.</p>

<p> &quot;I'd like to expand on it and have a discussion, but...there are still classes to attend. That's it for the brief explanation. If there's anything you don't understand, remember to come to me and ask.&quot;</p>

<p> Teacher Leon first took out his pocket watch from the black teacher uniform, and then looked over again.</p>

<p> To be precise, he looked to my side.</p>

<p> &quot;Nina. Could you please show Lapi around the campus?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Okay! I don't have any other classes today besides briefings, so no problem.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Thank you. Lapi, I will pick you up after school. Come to this classroom then.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;I-I know!&quot;</p>

<p> After wiping the blackboard clean, Teacher Leon said, &quot;Then get out of class is over,&quot; and left the classroom immediately.</p>

<p> He's gone, I thought a little uneasily, but he must have classes to attend later... Moreover, I roughly understood what Teacher Leon wanted to say.</p>

<p> This is probably what it means to have in-depth communication and have &quot;school friends&quot;.</p>

<p> &quot;Freshman, what did you do before coming here?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Uh...help the family with farm work...&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;You live in a metropolis (Bellang) but you are a farmer? You said you want to be an adventurer. Do you have combat experience?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;More, more or less...?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;What's your current level?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;L, Lv. 1?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Why is it a question? Didn't you receive a &quot;favor&quot; from Lord Baldr?&quot;</p>

<p> I answered perfunctorily the many questions that overwhelmed me.</p>

<p> After Teacher Leon left, five or six students immediately came around me.</p>

<p> They were interested in me, and I was very happy to come to talk to them. But this time it became difficult. I didn't think about the experience of the students at all... I was thinking of concealing the identity of the first-level adventurer (Bell Crane) anyway, so I said the exact opposite number to Lv. 5 out of desperation. I mixed lies and truth like this and made it incoherently. respond.</p>

<p> At this point, whether it was true or not, the students all laughed and said, &quot;What a weird guy.&quot;</p>

<p> Well, that's what I thought too...</p>

<p> &quot;But Lapi-kun is so awesome. Teacher Leon praised you very much just now!&quot;</p>

<p> Zuer was still sitting next to me, and she praised me cheerfully.</p>

<p> &quot;The sense of moderation in not taking risks... and the restraint in controlling desires, right? It was only after I heard this that I suddenly realized it.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Ah, no, that's really what I learned and sold now. I just accepted other people's teachings...&quot;</p>

<p> I waved my hands in panic, and the students who had been laughing around me nodded in agreement.</p>

<p> She probably changed the topic because she thought I was troubled.</p>

<p> (Although it is not very polite to put it together, but...she is also very gentle, just like Miss Eina.)</p>

<p> I'm not sure yet. After all, if a student (Lappi) who is not an adventurer asks her, &quot;Do you have any family members who work in the guild?&quot; &#12303;It seems strange... But through Zul-san, I recalled the memory of when I first came to Orario.</p>

<p> Recalling Miss Eina's kindness, she helped me countless times when I knew nothing about being an adventurer.</p>

<p> &quot;What's so great? As long as Teacher Leon takes action, no matter how stupid the opinion is, it can be turned into the 'best teaching material'.&quot;</p>

<p> at this time.</p>

<p> A smiling voice came from behind.</p>

<p> I turned around and was shocked.</p>

<p> &quot;Eeglin.&quot;</p>

<p> A few rows away from us, there was a dwarf who raised his bangs with a swish.</p>

<p> This is a boy in a well-dressed uniform. After all, he is a dwarf, so he is naturally shorter vertically and longer horizontally. There is even a beard on his chin. However, there is a rose in her chest. ...What the hell is this.</p>

<p> The man who was called Eglin by Zuul's classmates gave me a contemptuous smile.</p>

<p> &quot;Not only is it unseemly, but the result is Level 1. I really doubt what you came to the Combat Techniques Department for.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Aren't all freshmen in the 'school district' like this? Why do you say that?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;After all, he looks very weak. It's a 'Special Internship', and a complete amateur at this time can really cause trouble.&quot;</p>

<p> The other person was still smiling, Zuer raised his eyebrows and retorted angrily, but I could only open my mouth.</p>

<p> Under the appearance of an annoying handsome boy, his true face is that of a bearded dwarf.</p>

<p> Although it is also rude to say so, his words and actions are really inconsistent with his race!</p>

<p> &quot;The 'team' he wants to join is really worthy of sympathy. Don't hold us back too much, Bunnyman.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Ah, yes, I will pay attention...&quot;</p>

<p> Eglin left his seat gracefully, and I naturally lowered my head before I could recover from the shock.</p>

<p> He brushed his bangs again and left the classroom alone.</p>

<p> &quot;No, don't take it too seriously, Lapi-kun! Iglin is like this to everyone he meets for the first time.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Is that so...&quot;</p>

<p> Zur-classmate beside me hurriedly encouraged me, and the first thing I felt was not injury, but the feeling of an adventurer feeling confused after encountering the &quot;unknown&quot;.</p>

<p> This is the &quot;school district&quot;... A crucible where many races of people that I never knew were mixed together...! !</p>

<p> While I was thinking about this random nonsense, the preparation bell rang.</p>

<p> The other students also stood up, leaving only Zuer and me.</p>

<p> &quot;...Then let's go too?&quot;</p>

<p> As if to change his mood, Zuer-san gave me a wry smile.</p>

<p> I finally calmed down and nodded with the same wry smile.</p>

<p> We left the teaching building where we were before and came to the sunshine.</p>

<p> What lay before our eyes were a group of teaching buildings with blue roofs and white walls, and a wide avenue that certainly didn't look like the scene on a ship. Coupled with the slight smell of sea tide, the scenery of the &quot;school district&quot; surrounded by the sky and soda lake gives people a so-called resort feel.</p>

<p> &quot;If you want to visit the entire school district, even one day is not enough, so today I will show you around the academy floor.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Academy level?&quot;</p>

<p> Fascinated again by the beautiful blue and white scenery, I couldn't help but repeat her words.</p>

<p> Zuer said &quot;Yeah&quot; and nodded with a smile.</p>

<p> &quot;The 'School District' is divided into three large areas, the control layer, the residential layer, and the college layer.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Floor, right? In other words, uh... like a floor in a dungeon?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Huhu. Although it's not the same, you can think so.&quot;</p>

<p> Zul-san smiled like a steady older sister and explained in an easy-to-understand manner.</p>

<p> According to her, the &quot;School District&quot; has a structure in which three huge disks called &quot;layers&quot; are overlapped.</p>

<p> The control floor at the bottom has a large number of large magic stone devices - buoyancy generating devices also used in the lifting facilities of the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot;. The engine room department and &quot;research laboratory&quot;, which can be called the heart of the ship, are concentrated here.</p>

<p> The middle residential level houses student and teacher living quarters.</p>

<p> And finally,</p>

<p> &quot;The top floor of the three-story structure is the academy floor. This is where we are now. As you can see, many teaching buildings and training grounds and other facilities used in classes are concentrated here.&quot;</p>

<p> Each layer takes on different responsibilities, which seems to be the characteristic of the &quot;School District&quot;... In other words, this super ship must adopt such a structure if it wants to keep traveling around the world. There seemed to be over 10,000 crew members, including the operating crew, so I can understand why the ship was organized so clearly. When I looked at this place from the port, I discovered that although the ship was very long horizontally, it was also so long vertically that I had to raise my head until it hurt to see the whole thing clearly...</p>

<p> The three huge layers are stacked on top of each other. This spectacular sight has earned it the nickname &quot;three-layered extra large confectionery (waffle)&quot;.</p>

<p> In addition, this place seems to be likened to &quot;a clock with long needles protruding&quot; and &quot;a majestic dragon's back&quot;. The entire lower world is full of praise for this extraordinary giant ship.</p>

<p> (I can probably understand &quot;a clock with long hands protruding&quot;. When I invaded from the air with Lord Hermes, I saw a long...probably &quot;prow&quot; part protruding.)</p>

<p> So, if you want to say what the remaining &quot;majestic dragon's back&quot; refers to, it is probably that one.</p>

<p> &quot;Blue Feathers&quot; are installed around the edge of this academy floor.</p>

<p> When I and Miss Eina looked at this place from the tall walls of Orario, I had the feeling that a human town was built on the back of a huge sea dragon, and it was probably the same for everyone else.</p>

<p> The feathers fluttering in the wind are now shining steadily and dreamily, as if they have contributed to the blue sky.</p>

<p> (It shines so brightly, it's probably the same as a magic stone lamp... No, it should be a &quot;dimmer&quot;, right? I'll ask about it later.)</p>

<p> After looking at the beautiful feathers in fascination for a while, Zuer and I walked side by side on the road facing several teaching buildings.</p>

<p> &quot;On the academy level alone, there are many roads, just like entering a town. There is a map in the guide, so I suggest you take it with you from the beginning! When I first entered school, I always got lost.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Ahaha...it's really too big here.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;If you don't bring a map and you feel like you're getting lost, just look at the signboard on the magic stone street lamp. The No. 3 or No. 17 Yokocho written there is your current location. Just follow the direction with the smaller number. You can walk to the bridge built in the center...which is the 'Temple Tower'.&quot;</p>

<p> Zul-san, who relaxed the atmosphere with interesting stories, pointed to the central tower where I met Lord Baldr. It is the tallest building in the academy and is undoubtedly a very important facility.</p>

<p> &quot;Besides, there is a park at the stern of the ship.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Ah, that is indeed a park.&quot;</p>

<p> I recalled the campus scenery I saw from above when I invaded a few days ago. At this moment,</p>

<p> &quot;Nina~! What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p> Zuer and I turned around together and saw three girls standing there.</p>

<p> The three of them are all orcs, namely the dog man, the raccoon man and the cow woman.</p>

<p> &quot;Betty, you didn't go to class?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;We don't have classes until the third period today.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Never mind that, Nina, who is this kid~?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Could he be Nina's man!?&quot;</p>

<p> The three girls talked to her intimately, they were probably friends. Zuer blushed a little and said &quot;No!&quot; to deny it. I was also taken aback and became a little restless.</p>

<p> &quot;This child is Mr. Lapi Flemang. Due to family reasons, he came to the 'school district' today to study.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Oh, that's right... I always feel a little weak!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;It feels very unreliable~&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Ugh!?&quot;</p>

<p> The dog-man and tanuki girl called Betty looked at me and laughed loudly.</p>

<p> Zuer-san shouted angrily &quot;You two!&quot;, but... well, it doesn't matter, or it's better than revealing your identity, right?</p>

<p> After that, Zuer's friends said, &quot;You two enjoy it slowly~&quot; and left.</p>

<p> Can this kind of ordinary communication be considered... the fun of campus?</p>

<p> &quot;...?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;What's wrong, Lapi-kun?&quot;</p>

<p> Unintentionally, something caught my eye, which surprised Zuer.</p>

<p> &quot;...I was a little concerned in the morning. Are students working as clerks in that 'shop'?&quot;</p>

<p> At this point we are entering what might be called a sophisticated path to a fashion boutique.</p>

<p> Many buildings are now closed and blocked by crystal walls, but only one is open and a small shop is open. On the inside of the long platform is an orc girl, wearing a school uniform under her cute apron.</p>

<p> &quot;Yes, that's right. As long as you can obtain certain 'credits' in the 'Business Subject' and pass the qualification exam, anyone can run a store.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Anyone can do it? It's amazing...&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;I was surprised when I first heard about it. However, if you want to open a store, you have to see if there is an open store, so I usually start by working as a temporary clerk in a senior's store. &quot;</p>

<p> According to her, this seems to be part of the &quot;course&quot;.</p>

<p> This is a &quot;preliminary exercise&quot; prepared for students who want to pursue careers in the business department and business-related jobs.</p>

<p> In a box like a &quot;school district&quot; - an environment with a population of ten thousand people - it is important to understand the atmosphere of the &quot;market&quot;.</p>

<p> &quot;Every month, we will be ranked according to sales volume, and the gods will give rewards. So people in the business discipline are always very motivated. New products are launched every month, so we also enjoy it very much!&quot;</p>

<p> I always felt that maybe the &quot;school district&quot; was not as disciplined as I thought, but was instead a more relaxed place, I thought with a wry smile.</p>

<p> It's class time now, and there are very few students working as shop assistants. Most of the shops are closed. Starting in the evening, the place will become more and more lively. Many of them are restaurants, but there are also clothing stores and grocery stores. And talking about the store that is open in front of me...</p>

<p> &quot;...Potato balls!?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Ah, by the way. Are potato balls from Orario? They are also very popular in the 'school district', right?&quot;</p>

<p> I was startled by the common language that came into view.</p>

<p> Because the atmosphere in the store and the signboard are very sophisticated, it doesn&rsquo;t look like a potato ball seller at all!</p>

<p> Amazing! It turns out that he gave a thumbs up and said, &quot;Potato balls are world-wide, Mr. Bell?&quot; &rdquo; Lord God is right! Although I don&rsquo;t know what worldwide means!</p>

<p> &quot;It's rare to come here, do you want to go and have a look?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Uh-huh&#8230;&#8230;!&quot;</p>

<p> Although he was not hungry yet, as a resident of the labyrinth city, he felt a strong interest in his heart.</p>

<p> Just like the person I admired (Miss Ais), I was attracted to the potato ball shop.</p>

<p> &quot;welcome-&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Good morning, Misha. What do you want, Lapi-kun?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Uh, this... Zu, Zuer-san, let's choose first!&quot;</p>

<p> Contrary to the elegant appearance of the store, the clerk's greetings were a bit lackluster. I couldn't help but shed a cold sweat while letting Zur-san take the order first.</p>

<p> The parchment menu posted was full of words I had never seen before, and I was a little confused as to what to order. Miss Ming said that when you go to a country, you should follow the locals, so just follow what she said, first see what Zuer Classmates will order, and then order based on it.</p>

<p> &quot;Hmm~ What do you want? After all, it's almost lunch, so I can't eat too much... Okay, it's decided!&quot;</p>

<p> Zuer, who had been guiding me thoughtfully and perfectly, put his finger on his slender chin, and the expression on his face kept changing. Although this is just my personal impression, this kind of place makes me feel that she looks very student-like and looks very warm.</p>

<p> Just when I quietly showed a smile,</p>

<p> &quot;A large cup of potato balls, cocoa nibs, coffee, skim milk, caramel frappuccino, and chocolate sauce.&quot;</p>

<p> what did she say?</p>

<p> A spell suddenly came to my ears, which made me wonder if I heard it wrong, but then I heard a helpless &quot;Okay-&quot;. Not long after, the clerk brought out something amazing.</p>

<p> The crystal container is filled with a drink (cream) plus a large amount of dessert (syrup), and a portion of fried potato balls is inserted inside...</p>

<p> &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;No, this.</p>

<p> Desserts and drinks are the main thing, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like fried potato balls anymore...</p>

<p> If Kami-sama and Miss Ess saw this, they would get angry in unison and shout, &quot;This kind of thing is not authentic at all!&quot; &#12303;&#12303;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p> Also, classmate Zuer, didn&rsquo;t you just say you can&rsquo;t eat too much? Are desserts included separately?</p>

<p> The warm feeling turned into trembling in an instant. How should I put it? In short, it was a strong culture shock...! !</p>

<p> &quot;What do you want-?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;...A portion of fried potato balls, peppery roasted tea flavor.&quot;</p>

<p> After I finished speaking with my face twitching, the clerk said &quot;Huh&quot; and raised the corners of his mouth, as if to say, &quot;You know very well.&quot; No, I just can&rsquo;t eat sweet things, and the one from Zuer&rsquo;s classmate already gave me indigestion...</p>

<p> &quot;Misha, how much is the total for two?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;200 Laguna&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p> Although the seasonings sprinkled on them were rare, what the clerk brought out were ordinary-shaped potato balls. Just when I felt relieved, Zuer-san took out a cute wallet and took out two pieces of &quot; Paper&quot;.</p>

<p> Is that paper money?</p>

<p> Don't transactions in the &quot;School District&quot; use gold coins but paper currency?</p>

<p> wrong--</p>

<p> &quot;P-please wait a moment, Zul-san!? I'll pay!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Korapi-kun hasn't gotten the school district banknotes yet, has he? Even if he has gold coins, he has to go to the student bank to exchange them.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;E-Eh...!? I-I don't understand much about this, but it's not okay to ask a woman to pay!&quot;</p>

<p> Specifically, I will be beaten up by Master! He will definitely say &quot;I've spent so much effort to transform you and it's not enough, stupid rabbit, go to hell&quot; and then fire a volley of mine projectiles (Carrus Hilde)! !</p>

<p> &quot;It's okay! Let's go!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Wow!?&quot;</p>

<p> She neatly handed the banknotes to the clerk, and then, perhaps not letting me say anything else, she took my hand and ran.</p>

<p> The clerk waved and watched us go away, and I felt the softness and warmth of classmate Zur's hand, and I couldn't help but blush on my cheeks.</p>

<p> &quot;This is to celebrate Lapijun's admission!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Celebrate, celebrate enrollment?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Yeah! Let's go to the park to eat together!&quot;</p>

<p> The two of us trotted across the deserted road.</p>

<p> Classmate Zuer held my hand and looked back. Her smile was as dazzling as the beautiful blue sky.</p>

<p> &quot;Congratulations on your admission, Lapi-kun! We are in the same [class], so we should cheer for each other!&quot;</p>

<p> Although she looks very similar to Miss Eina.</p>

<p> But she is indeed not Miss Eina.</p>

<p> While he has a stable personality, he is also as carefree as a child.</p>

<p> Unknowingly, I, who had a troubled look on my face, was moved by the kind-hearted girl in front of me and burst into a smile.</p>

<p> In the spacious and quiet park, we held a small entrance party.</p>

<p> After that, the bells of the &quot;Temple Tower&quot; rang about twice, and then many students appeared from the teaching building, and the hustle and bustle of singing and dancing surrounded the college level.</p>

<p> It&rsquo;s midday when everyone is hungry.</p>

<p> Students who are in the growing stage can't wait to satisfy their appetite.</p>

<p> &quot;It's so delicious...!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;That's right! Of all the cafeterias, this Clear Sky Cafeteria is the one I recommend the most!&quot;</p>

<p> The small portion of macaroni in front of me was dotted with jewel-like fish eggs, which gave me a big shock.</p>

<p> Under the parasol, classmate Zur, who ordered the same dish, put the noodles into his mouth with a happy face.</p>

<p> We are now located in the tall &quot;Temple Tower&quot;, with the student cafeteria built in the middle.</p>

<p> There are also seats on the balcony that extends far out. Besides us, there are also many students sitting here, which is very lively.</p>

<p> &quot;Shops run by students charge a fee, but student cafeterias directly run by &quot;school district&quot; staff or gods are basically free. Among them, the Qingkong Cafeteria is the most popular. It is difficult to come in even if there are no classes that day. ! We are very lucky today~!&quot;</p>

<p> It&rsquo;s hard to believe that there is no charge for such a delicious meal. After asking around, I found out that the Qingkong Canteen is the only one where the gods of the &ldquo;school district&rdquo; personally cook the food. There are only fifty lunch portions available, first come, first served.</p>

<p> I don&rsquo;t know if it was an illusion, but the voice of classmate Zur sitting across the table seemed to have become higher.</p>

<p> Could it be that she likes to eat?</p>

<p> I smiled bitterly while finishing my macaroni.</p>

<p> By the way, we already had fried potato balls, so we didn&rsquo;t order too much.</p>

<p> &quot;This Clear Sky Cafeteria is the last major facility on the academy floor. I want to introduce them all before lunch, so I'm in a hurry, so that's okay, right?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Yeah, that's a big help! Thank you very much, Zul-san.&quot;</p>

<p> Looking out from the balcony, the horizontally open field of view can take in the entire college level. It is really a stunning view. The wind blowing is a bit cool, but it is also quite comfortable. Including this Qingkong Canteen, it was really a happy campus tour.</p>

<p> After I expressed my heartfelt thanks, Zuer, who was smiling all the time... kept staring at me.</p>

<p> &quot;Nina.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p> Then, she suddenly raised her index finger.</p>

<p> &quot;Call me Nina. I'm also calling you Lapi-kun. We are classmates in the same class!&quot;</p>

<p> She suggested that maybe she had always cared about this matter. I was shocked after hearing this.</p>

<p> In the atmosphere of the &quot;school district&quot; - the campus, I couldn't help but blurt out the thoughts in my mind.</p>

<p> &quot;B-But Zul-san came to the &quot;school district&quot; before me...it's really hard for the seniors...&quot;</p>

<p> Speaking of which.</p>

<p> Her ever-smiling face turned a little sharp.</p>

<p> &quot;...Lapi-kun, how old are you?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Age...? Uh, fourteen years old...&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;I am thirteen years old.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Ehhhhhhh!?&quot;</p>

<p> real or fake! ?</p>

<p> Seeing me standing up and shouting, she, who claimed to be younger, really raised her eyebrows this time.</p>

<p> &quot;Ah, Lapi-kun has the same reaction! Forget it, I'm just looking older anyway!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Hey!? No, it's not!&quot;</p>

<p> Should I say that the similar face to Eina-san also confused me or something...!</p>

<p> Perhaps it was because someone had mistaken her age before, so she closed her eyes angrily and looked away.</p>

<p> &quot;It's really not like that. I didn't think of anything weird at all! I was just surprised. How should I put it? Because you don't look like a child at all. You are much more mature than me... and you are also very beautiful... !&#12301;</p>

<p> I was thinking about how to calm her down, so I said all my inner thoughts with a red face, and then,</p>

<p> &quot;&#8230;&#8230;Really.&quot;</p>

<p> She opened her eyes and glanced at me.</p>

<p> Then he narrowed his eyes like a child who likes to play pranks, and showed the same cheerful smile as before.</p>

<p> &quot;Then I'll forgive you.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;call&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Then, try calling me by my name? Don't use honorifics.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;...Uh...N-Nina.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Very good&quot; Nina still smiled and nodded.</p>

<p> A pleasant itching feeling escaped from the corner of my mouth, and I couldn't help but scratch my cheek.</p>

<p> Although it is now a cafeteria, the Clear Sky Cafeteria seemed to have been a lounge in the central tower before. The students did not leave even after finishing their meals and were all chatting animatedly.</p>

<p> The same is true for us who have officially become classmates (classmates). After putting away the tableware, we sat under the parasol and chatted casually.</p>

<p> &quot;...Rapi-kun. What you say next may be a bit nosy. Have you completed the 'course registration'?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;'Course Registration'...?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Yeah. Just choose the courses you want to take in the 'school district'.&quot;</p>

<p> Ah, speaking of which, Teacher Leon seems to have said that...</p>

<p> I pulled out my schoolbag that was sandwiched between my back and the chair. Looking inside, there are guides, several books, quills and other note-taking utensils, and a scroll stamped with the &quot;school district&quot; paint seal.</p>

<p> This must be what Nina was referring to.</p>

<p> I peeled off the wax paint and unfolded it - all the &quot;teaching subjects&quot; were densely written on it.</p>

<p> &quot;Ugh!? These are all &quot;school district&quot; courses...?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;To be precise, it's subjects. There are also courses that you can't take in the first year...&quot;</p>

<p> Making a strange noise, I put it on the table and spread it out. Then Nina pointed with her finger and began to explain:</p>

<p> &quot;The courses are divided into two categories, compulsory subjects and elective subjects. If it is a 'Combat Skills Subject', the compulsory subjects are 'Martial Arts' and 'Field Investigation', as well as 'Combat Missions' and the like. Including 'Field Investigation' &quot;Internship courses including &quot;Special Internship&quot; have now been replaced by &quot;Special Internship,&quot; so you don't have to think about it...&quot;</p>

<p> The problem is elective subjects, Nina said.</p>

<p> &quot;'Combat Techniques Subject' is a compulsory subject with a large proportion of practical skills and internships, but even so, you must complete six elective subjects to get enough credits. If you have to choose, it is best to choose the field that interests you. , or a subject you feel you would be good at.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &quot;Uh, by the way, what will happen if this so-called credit is not enough...?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Maybe you won't be able to graduate. The worst-case scenario is dropping out of school. However, I've never seen anyone come to the 'school district' and just not go to class...&quot;</p>

<p> That's it...that's it...</p>

<p> In other words, you must at least attend class well, otherwise you will not only have to worry about being suspected of being a student. Although I don't know how long I can stay in the &quot;school district&quot;, since I will gain something, I naturally want to study hard and choose courses carefully.</p>

<p> Hmm~ The ones I can choose now are... &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Chanting&quot;, &quot;Magic Development&quot;, &quot;Elfology&quot;, &quot;Fusion&quot;, &quot;Alchemy&quot;, &quot;Blending&quot;, &quot;Cooking&quot;, &quot;Occult Medicine&quot; Blacksmithing&quot; &quot;Monster Training Technique&quot; &quot;Race History&quot; &quot;Ancient History&quot; &quot;Modern History&quot; &quot;God's Age Theory&quot; &quot;Terminal Confrontation Theory&quot; &quot;Common Linguistics&quot; &quot;Elf Language&quot; &quot;Dwarf Language&quot; &quot;Orc Language&quot; &quot;Orc Language&quot; Various ethnic languages &#8203;&#8203;A', 'Orc various ethnic languages &#8203;&#8203;B', 'Lilliputian language', 'Female warrior language', 'Stage studies', 'Performance studies', 'Performance studies', 'Music studies', 'Poetics', 'Swordsmanship', 'Gun skills' Archery&quot;, &quot;Axe&quot;, &quot;Fighting&quot;, &quot;Staff&quot; and &quot;Comprehensive Combat&quot; - how many there are! ?</p>

<p> I looked down at the parchment I was holding in my hands, and I immediately had stars in my eyes.</p>

<p> &quot;Uh huh...!? What should I choose...!?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;It's not good to think too much about exams. Just choose subjects that interest you, right?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Anyone interested...ah, what is this 'comprehensive theology'...?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;It's a subject related to the gods. You can learn the meaning of [sacred words] and how to read them, but...&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Eh!? Really, really? Then try learning this...!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;I don't recommend this course very much... It is said that the passing rate is less than 10%... and there are even fewer people who can actually decipher [sacred texts].&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;One, one percent!?&quot;</p>

<p> Although Nina was there to give me advice, I was still brooding and worried.</p>

<p> In short, I should choose the &quot;History of Heroes&quot; course on the list first, and then... I should be fine with courses related to martial arts. Is it safer to choose it? But now that I want to hide my identity, I should try to minimize the chance of exposing the [ability value] information... What should I do!</p>

<p> I have no clear goals and just vaguely want to study in the &quot;school district&quot;. Is this now the retribution for such thoughts? I held my head that was about to smoke, and at this moment&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p> &quot;...Lapi-kun. Can you lend it to me?&quot;</p>

<p> Nina took the parchment and quill from my hands.</p>

<p> &quot;Rapi-kun, have you decided on the weapon you will use after becoming an adventurer?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Eh? Uh...a dagger, right?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;That's the dagger type. You should be able to do 'swordsmanship'. Do you think history is difficult?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Hmm, well, probably not...&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Then you can choose 'Ancient History' and 'Modern History'. Teacher Adler, who teaches these two subjects, often reviews the content of previous courses as a review, so it is easy to catch up even if you have not been listening at the beginning. On the other hand, &lsquo;Theory of the Dispensation of God&rsquo; requires prerequisite knowledge to understand, so it is best not to choose it.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &quot;Eh, eh?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;If you have the aptitude for magic, I recommend you choose 'Chanting Technique', but...it depends on Lapi-kun. If you still have time to take language classes, I can help with 'Fairy Language'.&quot;</p>

<p> In front of me, with my eyes rolling, Nina was writing something.</p>

<p> Finally, she handed the parchment back, and saw wavy lines under certain &quot;teaching subjects&quot; on it.</p>

<p> &quot;Um, this is...?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;It should be regarded as... a subject that I recommend. After all, students who are enrolling in this winter (period) have already taken a lot of courses, so they may feel that they cannot keep up with the people around them... or that they have to work hard to catch up. Make progress.&quot;</p>

<p> At this time, Nina's cheeks turned red and she seemed a little embarrassed.</p>

<p> &quot;Besides...if we can take classes together, I can try to help you, so I've marked the classes I'm taking as well.&quot;</p>

<p> My eyes widened at her words.</p>

<p> &quot;Why are you so nice to me...&quot;</p>

<p> She raised her head, this time with a happy expression.</p>

<p> &quot;Actually, Lapi-kun and I were the same before.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;the same&#8230;&#8230;?&quot;</p>

<p> &ldquo;When I first came to the &lsquo;school district&rsquo;, I really didn&rsquo;t know anything about it, and there were a lot of things I didn&rsquo;t understand in class&#8230; But, many people helped me.&rdquo;</p>

<p> She closed her eyes and recounted the memories that followed.</p>

<p> &quot;A brief explanation this morning, Milly-senpai in front of me, do you still remember?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Hmm, um, that goblin, right?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;That's right. Then Milly-senpai taught me all kinds of things. Although I also experienced painful things and headaches, thanks to Milly-senpai and the others, I was able to like the 'school district'.&quot;</p>

<p> So, she said, looking straight at me.</p>

<p> &quot;I also want to help those who have just arrived in the 'school district' like Milly-senpai and others. ...Maybe it's just nosy.&quot;</p>

<p> In the end, Nina smiled bitterly, and when I saw this, I hurriedly said, &quot;That's not the case!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Nina really helped me a lot! Even though I'm not very good at studying...but I want to work hard from now on!&quot;</p>

<p> This is what I really think. It's not a lie.</p>

<p> Her kind and enthusiastic figure touched me, making any uneasiness disappear completely.</p>

<p> On the contrary, now I even think, 'I want to like this &quot;school district&quot; even more.'</p>

<p> I don&rsquo;t know if my mood was conveyed, but Nina&rsquo;s face instantly became as bright as the sun, and her pointed ears twitched.</p>

<p> &quot;That's great! I'm very happy to hear you say that!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Yeah! By the way, if you have time, can you teach me how to study? Just tell me which part I should preview...&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;--real!?&quot;</p>

<p> I was also infected by her and asked happily, and then Nina's face became brighter.</p>

<p> &quot;Then let's start now!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Eh, now?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;After all, Lapi-kun will have classes starting tomorrow! Preparation is very important!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Indeed, besides, I don't know what I want to study... Nina, can I ask you for a favor?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;give it to me!&quot;</p>

<p> Although she was a little surprised, Nina was right.</p>

<p> The same goes for dungeons. Exploring without knowing anything about them is tantamount to suicide, let alone the equipment. I happily agreed to the suggestion of a &quot;study meeting&quot; that was quickly carried out, and Nina immediately smiled charmingly.</p>

<p> &quot;Lapi-kun, go back to the classroom where you gave the brief explanation before! No one will be using it today! I'm going to the library to get some reference books!&quot;</p>

<p> So&mdash;boom! ! of.</p>

<p> The table almost dented due to this, and the super-heavy &quot;book mountain&quot; hit my eyes, causing my eyes to turn into two dots.</p>

<p> &quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;It's a bit small, but as long as you master these ranges, you'll be fine!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Study seriously for five hours first, and then take a short test! I will design the questions!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p> I have become a person who can only say eh? malfunctioning doll, and the Nina in front of me was always smiling.</p>

<p> Not only is there any malice, there is also an innocent and invincible smile without even a trace of evil thoughts.</p>

<p> After one shot, I started sweating profusely.</p>

<p> &quot;N-Nina? These amounts are really hard to bear, or it's impossible, or it's a little too difficult for me...&quot;</p>

<p> It's after lunch now. The location is an empty classroom that was previously agreed upon and where brief explanations were given.</p>

<p> I arrived first and waited for her to arrive alone. As a result, Nina brought a mountain of books that should have exceeded ten books. This scene felt a bit familiar, which made my face twitch. The half-elf girl who was one year younger than me tilted her head, as if she found it incredible.</p>

<p> &quot;Eh? But Lapi-kun also passed the entrance exam, right? Interview with the gods.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Interview...? Uh, well, I did meet Lord Badr and had a conversation with him...&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Then it doesn't matter! Those who can enter the &quot;School District&quot; are those who have the &quot;will to learn&quot;! Without the &quot;will to learn&quot;, even if you lie, the gods will see through it, and you won't be able to enroll at all, right?&quot;</p>

<p> Ah, it turns out that the admission requirements (system) are really like this...</p>

<p> Indeed, Ms. Eina also said that the condition for becoming a student in the &quot;school district&quot; is &quot;the will to learn.&quot; In the face of transcendent existence, the lies of the residents of the lower world will be easily seen through, so the interviews of the gods can also be said to be some kind of &quot;the best and most efficient suitability check.&quot;</p>

<p> But I always feel that having a passion for learning does not mean that you are not afraid of the weight of this despairing subject...!</p>

<p> &quot;I'm not very good at studying either, but... wouldn't it make me uneasy if I didn't do it? So let's do our best together?&quot;</p>

<p> very scary.</p>

<p> For the first time, I thought the smiles of young girls were scary.</p>

<p> &quot;No problem, I will teach you well!&quot;</p>

<p> It's Miss Eina!</p>

<p> Miss Eina is here!</p>

<p> Just like that brutal (Spartan) dungeon study session!</p>

<p> The guild's specialty, the half-elf's thorough guide &quot;Fairy Trial&quot;!</p>

<p> This is what d&eacute;j&agrave; vu really looks like!</p>

<p> Sure enough, Nina and Eina are sisters! !</p>

<p> &quot;Then let's get started!&quot;</p>

<p> Needless to say, I was forced to hold my quill tightly and sweat profusely, so I could only accept my fate.</p>

<p> &quot;Amazing!&quot;</p>

<p> Outside the classroom window, the sun had completely set in the west.</p>

<p> Lying on the table next to me who was reduced to ashes, Nina held a makeshift answer sheet in her hands, her face shining, and she was full of praise for me.</p>

<p> &quot;I got half of the tests I prepared correct!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Is this, is this awesome...?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;It's amazing! After all, Lapi-kun, this is a subject you don't understand at all, and you haven't studied it at all, right!? But in such a short period of time, you were able to get half of the answers right!&quot;</p>

<p> I made a dry sound, and Nina was extremely excited.</p>

<p> No doubt...thanks to my experience of holding study sessions with Eina-san.</p>

<p> And Ms. Eina will definitely give a test after the lecture.</p>

<p> Furthermore, many questions are not calculation or analysis, but history and other questions that require memorization. After becoming Level 5, my memory is... wrong, no matter how I say it, it's not like this.</p>

<p> However, if you want to be an adventurer, the act of &quot;recalling&quot; is very important - since you want to confront the &quot;unknown&quot;, you must at least refer to all the known information. This is a matter of life - so I have developed the habit of dragging everything I see to me. And the result is this half-correct answer.</p>

<p> &quot;Rapi-kun, you can catch up quickly with the classes that start tomorrow! Wait for me, I'll go to the library to return these books!&quot;</p>

<p> Nina was sincerely happy for me, then easily picked up the mountain of books and left the classroom. Although it is a matter of course, Nina really does have [ability], I thought as I fell into a semi-conscious state... But just as she left, the breath that had been waiting outside the classroom came in.</p>

<p> &quot;it's over?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Teacher Leon...&quot;</p>

<p> The lion's golden hair swayed with the movements, and the teacher smiled bitterly when he saw me exhausted.</p>

<p> &quot;I could have spoken up, but I thought it would be good for you, so I have been watching until now... I didn't expect it to take so long. I completely forgot that Nina has a habit of learning.&quot;</p>

<p> Teacher Leon looked at the darkening outside the school and said sorry.</p>

<p> Teacher Leon kept his promise to meet after school. When he came here, I also noticed it, but I didn't want to blame him. At that time, I was thinking: Nina worked so hard for me, and Teacher Leon didn&rsquo;t stop her, which meant that this should be necessary for the students in the school district (Rapi Flemish).</p>

<p> &quot;It's okay.&quot; After I replied with a wry smile, Teacher Leon smiled.</p>

<p> &quot;How was it? First day of campus life?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;That's right... I wasn't very familiar with the name 'Lappy' at first. It took me a while to notice that it was calling me, but now I'm used to it. And... I'm very happy. I learned a lot. Things about the &lsquo;school district&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &quot;That's great.&quot;</p>

<p> Teacher Leon nodded generously. At this time, I felt a little embarrassed and said what I wanted to reflect on.</p>

<p> &quot;As a student, I feel a little embarrassed...or maybe I'm nervous all the time.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;But you blended in smoothly.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Y-really...? The other students seem to think I'm weird...&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;No, what I mean is that no one has noticed that you are a 'first-level adventurer'.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;!&quot;</p>

<p> Hear this.</p>

<p> Only then did I understand what Teacher Leon meant, and my eyes under my bangs opened wide.</p>

<p> &quot;You may have noticed that I have observed you and your surroundings several times during class. No one has any doubts about your strength.&quot;</p>

<p> &mdash;&mdash;After all, he looks very weak.</p>

<p> &mdash;&mdash;It feels very unreliable~</p>

<p> This is a comment I heard directly from the students who met me today.</p>

<p> In addition, I also passed many students on the road outside and in the corridors of the teaching building.</p>

<p> But no one noticed that I was a &quot;first-level adventurer&quot;.</p>

<p> &quot;As you know, many students in the 'School District' have experienced sublimation. They are by no means blind. By judging the center of gravity, posture, and body movements, you can see the apparent strength.&quot;</p>

<p> Due to the special nature of &quot;God's Favor&quot;, those who fight have an iron rule, that is, &quot;Don't judge by appearance, even if the opponent looks like a baby.&quot;</p>

<p> At least the students in the &quot;school district&quot; won't judge the &quot;God's Familiar&quot; based on their age gap, physique, and the impression that they &quot;look weak,&quot; Teacher Leon said.</p>

<p> Even so, I still disguised myself and did not expose myself to the students. This was what he meant.</p>

<p> ...As this person said, I have been showing poor &quot;acting skills&quot; all day today.</p>

<p> Concealment of abilities.</p>

<p> This is a &quot;coping method&quot; that I adopt to sharpen my weapons before the battle so that no one will find out that I am Level 5.</p>

<p> &quot;Can I ask what method you used?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;...I took everything I learned from many people and turned it around.&quot;</p>

<p> Miss Aisi, Miss Lyu, and Master.</p>

<p> Their words of wisdom make me feel more and more like a solo adventurer. So if I go against their teachings, doesn&rsquo;t it feel like I&rsquo;m half-baked? This is my superficial thinking.</p>

<p> The postures and movements that Master taught me - even though they were used for dating - are particularly valuable as a reference. Just by violating the extremely cruel (Spartan) teachings engraved into his body, his posture collapsed and his center of gravity was shaky like an ordinary person's, successfully creating an unreliable atmosphere.</p>

<p> This time it seemed to have worked, barely hiding it from the eyes of the students in the &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p> But if you are an experienced high-level adventurer in Labyrinth City, someone who is at least second level, you will probably see through me.</p>

<p> And the person in front of him could easily see through this.</p>

<p> &quot;The disguise of strength...you are indeed an adventurer who knows 'strategy'.&quot;</p>

<p> Not that exaggerated. I just desperately don&rsquo;t want to reveal my identity.</p>

<p> That's what I meant to say.</p>

<p> However, when I saw the natural smile shown to me - a smile that had no gaps, for some reason, I had no choice but to close my mouth.</p>

<p> &quot;Lappi. You said today, 'Adventurers must not take risks,' right?&quot;</p>

<p> The portable magic stone lamp placed on the table became the only light source, illuminating our faces. At this time, Teacher Leon suddenly changed the topic.</p>

<p> &quot;&#8230;&#8230;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;The next step is not as a 'teacher', but as a matter of pure interest for 'me'...&quot;</p>

<p> Just when I was surprised that he called himself me, he said this:</p>

<p> &quot;I believe that no matter who you are, there will come a day when you have to take risks.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;...!!&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Whether you want it or not. Regardless of whether you are an adventurer or not. ...What do you think?&quot;</p>

<p> Different from the &quot;teacher&quot; just now, his eyes are as sharp as swords now.</p>

<p> At the same time, how should I put it, I always feel that there is also expectation in it.</p>

<p> Jinghe came to visit, and their eyes intertwined with each other.</p>

<p> With my eyes wide open... I slowly and unhurriedly turned my thoughts into words.</p>

<p> &quot;...I also feel that one day there will be an inevitable 'adventure'.&quot;</p>

<p> What comes to mind is the duel with the Minotaur.</p>

<p> The black giant (Goliath) who clashed on the 18th floor.</p>

<p> After meeting the heretic, he fights again with his powerful enemy (that person).</p>

<p> Disaster, the cruelty of the &quot;deep&quot;, and the battle with the Beauty God Faction (Freya Familia).</p>

<p> In addition, I also experienced many &quot;adventures&quot;. As I looked back, I continued:</p>

<p> &quot;No matter how you avoid taking risks...even if you always choose the safe path, one day you will have to take a challenge.&quot;</p>

<p> This is not to deny what Miss Eina said.</p>

<p> That is undoubtedly an important lesson that can exhort adventurers who are greedy for desire and the &quot;unknown&quot;.</p>

<p> However, in another place, we will one day face the day when we must become &quot;adventurers&quot;.</p>

<p> &quot;So, what are you going to do?&quot;</p>

<p> I already know the answer to this.</p>

<p> &quot;Be prepared in advance. In order to be able to cope with any situation, keep cultivating yourself.&quot;</p>

<p> It is wrong to be foolhardy and foolhardy.</p>

<p> But the day will come when you have to take the risk and do it.</p>

<p> Maybe it will be a year later, maybe it will be a day later, or maybe it will come in a few seconds. In order to be able to transcend the past by then, you must cultivate it. To cultivate various things.</p>

<p> Explore the optimal solution every moment, prepare in advance, and cultivate your mentality.</p>

<p> People who are called first-level adventurers must have come here like this. This is also to avoid regret.</p>

<p> This is the belief I gained after fighting the fastest group at the lower level (Shenyan) during the first &quot;Expedition&quot;, and now I tell the truth.</p>

<p> &quot;Really? This is your answer, adventurer.&quot;</p>

<p> A moment.</p>

<p> It really only lasts for a moment.</p>

<p> When Teacher Leon looked at me, the person he judged was not the student (Rapi), but &quot;Bell Cronny&quot;.</p>

<p> I feel this way.</p>

<p> &quot;Have you decided what class you want to take?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Ah...yes.&quot;</p>

<p> Suddenly asked about this, I reluctantly nodded.</p>

<p> &quot;Can I take a look?&quot; He stretched out his right hand. I was a little confused, but I still took out the course registration form decided with Nina from my schoolbag and handed it over.</p>

<p> Teacher Leon browsed the parchment for just a few moments, and then took out the quill from the leather case.</p>

<p> So, my course registration form was written on again.</p>

<p> &quot;'Modern History' and 'The Eschatological Confrontation'. It would be better to listen to these two subjects as well.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Eh&#8230;&#8230;?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;'Today I will see you clearly'. This is what Lord Badr and I have agreed on.&quot;</p>

<p> Before I understood the current situation, Teacher Leon smiled like a &quot;knight&quot; as if he recognized something.</p>

<p> &quot;You're right, we need to prepare. In order to challenge the end, we must face each other one day.&quot;</p>

<p> I blankly accepted the parchment handed back.</p>

<p> The lower realm (we) must one day confront the end (things).</p>

<p> Even if the brain doesn't know what he is referring to, the heart will understand everything subconsciously.</p>

<p> Teacher Leon looked down at me sitting on the chair, smiling like a &quot;teacher&quot; again.</p>

<p> &quot;We will officially notify you in a few days, Lapi, that you will join a certain 'team'.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;'Team'...?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Ah. This is also Lord Baldr's arrangement...and I very much want to hand over this team to you.&quot;</p>

<p> Finally, the lion-gold eyes with the same hair color spoke to me clearly with expectation:</p>

<p> &quot;You are joining the 'Third Team', and Nina is there too. I hope you will point them to the right path.&quot;</p>
