<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 3 &#8211; I Don’t Have Time to Talk With His Highness</h1><p class="calibre2">&mdash;89 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is the meaning of this, Lelouche&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was just after the lunch bell rang. His Highness, who belonged to different grade, barged into my classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how little of my days remained, I couldn’t skip class. Although, the idea did excite me. Still, I couldn’t shame the duke’s family. Aristocratic minors are nationally obligated receive an education. The given obligation must be fulfilled until the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless, there were break times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was happy that he visited me, but I didn’t have time to deal with him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, Your Highness Sazanjill, I have something to do after this.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">So, keep it short, please.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing my words, His Highness flared up even more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Now, you listen&mdash;! Lumiere has been crying every day&mdash;! Are you overexerting her until late into night&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, that. I’ve received Baron Alban’s permission. We even studied in front of the baron yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing that I received dinner as a symbol of gratitude from the baron didn’t quell His Highness’ anger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is your true intention&mdash;!? Do you enjoy bullying Lumiere that much&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Bullying, you say… even though we’re just studying?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">For some reason, he emphasized the word, ‘bullying,’ so I emphasized, ‘studying.’</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, His Highness seemed to be truly furious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But in reality, Lumiere has been crying every day!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Indeed, I know her for having weak lacrimal glands. I think the ease with which she can cry is wonderful.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Besides, it seems that His Highness has forgotten that we’re in public.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I was aware that I was also being difficult, but…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I thought he was being crass towards a lady. It also looked like he was about to strike me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I pointed that out, he denied it. “I was merely trying to grab your shoulder!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Well, I wonder how much of that is true?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When His Highness looked to his surroundings, he seemed dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Maintain your anger, Your Highness, for everyone is scared.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…I see, Lumiere truly means a lot to him…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although my chest hurt a little, I still kept smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was proud of him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, then, I have plans after this. Now, if you excuse me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gave a light bow and started walking away while tying my hair. Of course, it was a trivial act. I really didn’t have enough time. I never tried to tie my hair myself, so it was a bit messy. Still, it was better than nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, wait&mdash;! Lately, what is it that you’ve been doing&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes??”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I involuntarily turned around.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, does he still have some interest towards me?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m just practicing my swordsmanship.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Sword training!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His surprise… wasn’t unreasonable. Aside from the boys, I had never heard of a lady from the Kingdom of Lapisenta, which has been peaceful for hundreds of years, practicing swordsmanship. Of course, I had only wielded the sword for the first time nine days ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, it couldn’t be helped&mdash;I needed to grasp it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Of course, I had no intention of telling His Highness about the reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Once I got a taste of it, it was surprisingly fun. If you’d like, why don’t you join me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N, no, I…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, of course, I already expected that.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Your Highness, you aren’t good at exercising, are you?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, he worked hard to maintained the top grade in the academy. However, it seemed that he worked too hard, his immunity towards women was underdeveloped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I laughed unintentionally, which seemed to have offended His Highness. I covered my mouth and apologized.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did you just laugh at me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Yes&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;</em>and at the same time, I was also jealous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how much female immunity His Highness lacked, I still lacked charm. That was exactly why a woman’s jealousy was ugly. I should just excuse myself before I exposed more ugliness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, Your Highness, excuse me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the academy, I made a curtsy that wasn’t at all in character for me. Then, I turned on my heels.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wondered if His Highness was still concerned about me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was a little sad because I couldn’t see his face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even that day, I was still training at the edge of the academy grounds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm… this isn’t working.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Arrange for personnel to help me overnight was difficult. After all, not only my fiancé, the crown prince, the school director and my father were also opposed to the idea&mdash;since it was dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, I managed to procure a sword. After disguising myself as a male, I began training on the academy grounds. I trained with members of the swordsmanship club that would soon participate in the national competition. They seemed to have discovered me… but in my defense, I wasn’t getting in the way&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">so please bear with me a little…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Due to my lack of attention, the sword that I was swinging made a clicking sound as it hit something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ouch!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The rebounding sword made an arc and fell to the ground. While I held my wrist, which couldn’t withstand the recoil, a shadow was cast across my sight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I could hear a tight laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I don’t think you have enough strength, Lelouche&mdash;especially grip strength. If you can’t endure a shock like that, it’s over for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Your Highness Zafield?”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">Once I looked up, I beheld a certain, familiar, boy&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;it was none other than His Highness Zafield Lewis Lapisenta. He was the younger brother of His Highness and also the second prince. He resembled his older brother. However, unlike him, he had a long silver-hair which reached his neck. He was commonly known as the ‘Silver Prince.’ Also, His Highness Zafield was shorter, and the outer corners of his eyes were a little low. He still had no fiancée, but he was quite famous for being a womanizer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because we were of the same age, and were in the same class, I was close with Zafield. Moreover, there was also the fact that he was going to become my brother-in-law in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He mercilessly told me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I know you had a fight with my brother a while ago… but why don’t you just stop? If you want to exercise, dancing should suffice, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, I want to become stronger.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While turning away, I tried to pick up the fallen sword. However, Zafield grabbed my arm for some reason&mdash;then, I was pulled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Uh-oh, the skin on your hand has peeled away. Doesn’t it hurt?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It does hurt…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That much should be obvious. Regardless, I had to put up with it. When I admitted the truth, Zafield laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha, but you still want to continue?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, shall I teach you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Come again?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I opened my eyes to his sudden, fortunate, proposal, Zafield gently caressed my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Since it can’t be helped, let me teach you the basics of the sword. Although, it might be spartan.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zafield was touted as the ace of the swordsmanship club amongst the first years. Unlike his older brother, Zafield specialized in martial arts. His Highness had academical prowess, while Zafield had combat expertise. It was as if the two were complementing each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I was so grateful for his suggestion, I could barely muster my gratitude&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;I, is it alright…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although everyone was against me learning the sword, Zafield reached behind my neck. Then, he took hold of my hair which I had tied into a ponytail.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…More importantly, let’s stop training in public? After all, everyone finds Lelouche’s white nape… <em class="calibre3">tempting.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The glances and gazes were due to that!?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I turned towards the swordsmen who were training, they all averted their gazes at once. I involuntarily covered my face.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">H, honestly!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">But it’s been a while since I’ve begun training here!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Does that mean, I won’t be able to get a fiancé for the rest of my life!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I could hear Zafield’s joyful laughter.<br class="calibre4" /><br class="calibre4" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">That night, I performed the movements I had learned from Zafield about 100 times. Tired and about to faint, I fell onto the bed. Then, I met him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, if it isn’t you, god. I’m glad you’ve come to see me tonight.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Are you being sarcastic because I come to visit you every day?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No way, I’m really happy?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every night, god appeared in my dreams. To be honest, I was beginning to get used to it. But I didn’t dislike it. Every night, he expressed his concern towards me. Due to that, I didn’t feel the slightest bit tired the next morning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…To be able to converse with a god, my fear of death had long vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That night, in a pure white world, I was able to meet god.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“So, what kind of sermon did you receive today?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Sermon…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“When you started practicing the sword, everyone suddenly became noisy, didn’t they?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Noisy…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone did advise me against the idea. But could that be considered noisy? They were merely expressing concern for my safety, some were also in doubt as to whether or not I could master it overnight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, for a god to be involved with my life…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">They really were just giving some advice.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The god was still staring at me with his impressive eyebrows.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Hey, are you really going to continue practicing?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“For an amateur, and not to mention, a woman to train for only 100 days…you won’t be able to defeat those assassins. They’re professionals. You can’t protect that man.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I won’t know unless I try.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…It immediately denied, but his extremely serious face hurt me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Was there anything scarier than such a beautiful, serious, face?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I lowered my gaze, the god spoke in quick succession.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Why’re you attempting such a pointless endeavor!? Shouldn’t you have more fun!? Isn’t there anything else you want to do!? Don’t you want to go on a trip, eat delicious food, play… to train and pursue education until your final day&mdash;are you sane!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Of course I am.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though my eyes were cast down, the corners of my mouth didn’t hang in dejection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had to smile&mdash;gracefully, beautifully, even if I were to be drenched with sweat and blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For such was my pride.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Even if you do that, you can’t change the fact that you’re going to die.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I was told that, I wouldn’t stop smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m a stubborn person.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Then have it your way!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The god turned away and disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His sulking form was cute, I felt sorry for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I slowly closed my eyes so that I could wake up from my dreams. I didn’t forget to thank the god who would still be watching over me on the following day.</p>
