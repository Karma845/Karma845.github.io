<h2>Chapter 2: Academy, Heaven, Hell, Port Town, Meilian.</h2>

<p>It was built along the lakeshore about 3K away from the southwest of the labyrinth city. As its name suggests, it is a &quot;port town&quot;.</p>

<p>Meilian is located next to the huge soda lake &quot;Lake Rolog&quot; that is connected to the sea. For Orario, which is located on the westernmost side of the continent, it is regarded as the &quot;gateway to the sea&quot;.</p>

<p>Countless foreign ships enter the port every day, transporting countless people and goods to the &quot;center of the world&quot;. On the other hand, what was heading to the ocean was a transport ship loaded with &quot;magic stone products&quot;. I have heard that the main transportation route for the magic stone product trade monopolized by Orario is not by land, but by sea. Thinking about it this way, it is not wrong to say that ships from all over the world gather in this port town.</p>

<p>Although this is not my first time coming to Meilian, every time I come here, I always have the illusion that this is a &quot;foreign country&quot;.</p>

<p>I heard that the smell of fresh water and seawater mixed in Soda Lake is more peaceful than the smell of the tide, but for me, who was born in a mountain village, this is definitely an unusual entrance.</p>

<p>The main street is bustling like an exotic market, and the many shops display fresh seafood. Tanned fishermen, foreigners from island countries or desert worlds, and gods all told me that this was a so-called &quot;port town.&quot;</p>

<p>It has always been surrounded by tall city walls - truly isolated from the outside world, which made me almost forget that Orario was so close to the sea.</p>

<p>Normally, I would look around frequently like an old farmer entering the city, but I must have been dazzled by the scenery of the port town.</p>

<p>But this time it was different.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow...!!&quot;</p>

<p>Under artistic steering, the &quot;super giant ship&quot; passed through the lake strait and entered &quot;Lake Rolog&quot;.</p>

<p>The sight is truly breathtaking.</p>

<p>The small boat that had just left the port - in fact, it was already a large ship (Galenic sailing ship) with a total length of more than 40 meters - hurriedly changed its direction. It swayed its blue feathers and approached the port like an elegant sea dragon.</p>

<p>The shadow is huge enough to cover the countless stone warehouses and homes built along the lake shore.</p>

<p>You have to raise your head until your neck hurts to see it in full view.</p>

<p>The port itself on the west side should be enough to accommodate hundreds of ships, but now it is filled to the brim with overly large hulls.</p>

<p>Around me, who was dumbfounded and looking stupid, the entire bay burst into cheers.</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome back, 'School District'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of adventure have you experienced this time&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome to Merian! New kids!!&quot;</p>

<p>It's a dance.</p>

<p>The joy of everyone joined hands and danced in the clear sky of the port town.</p>

<p>The cheering has not stopped since entering the soda lake in the &quot;school zone&quot;, and now it has reached its climax.</p>

<p>There were so many people gathered along the harbor that it seemed like all the residents of the port town were here.</p>

<p>Many humans and demihumans were waving their hands or flags, and some were even playing musical instruments.</p>

<p>Looking at the children running around, I stood still in the crowd and was stunned again.</p>

<p>&quot;It's amazing...it's really like a celebration.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, that's true. For Orario, the return of the School District to Hong Kong once every three years is considered a big event.&quot;</p>

<p>After hearing my thoughts, Ms. Eina who was standing next to me explained.</p>

<p>After seeing the super ship on the city wall.</p>

<p>She suggested, &quot;Can we go to the port now?&quot;, so I came to this port town (Meilien).</p>

<p>To be precise, it was Miss Eina who made the suggestion with a wry smile because she couldn't stand the way my eyes were shining like a child's.</p>

<p>Originally, the inspection at the gate of Orario City was very strict - especially for the dependents and Lord Gods of the [Familiar Tribe] who are regarded as the &quot;urban combat power&quot; - they had to go through complicated procedures and time to go outside the city, but ...&quot;School District&quot; seems to be very &quot;special&quot; when he returns to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know the details yet, but only during this period, the southwest gate directly connected to the port town seems to be always open. If it were an adventurer, the guard from [Ganesha Familia] would still stop me for inspection, but this time, I was exempted from the inspection on the grounds that I was helping the guild employee (Miss Aegina).</p>

<p>So I came here with many citizens who rushed out of Orario.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh...after all, what exactly is a 'school district'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right. To put it simply... it's the largest 'school' in the lower world that travels around the world.&quot;</p>

<p>After the super ship docked in Westport, I looked at it for a while, but I could still hear cheers from everywhere.</p>

<p>After a while, people started to move, and we followed the crowd.</p>

<p>Walking towards the huge &quot;school&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;The 'School District' is a mobile educational institution operated with the support of the Guild. During the voyage, we will actively recruit and accept children from six to eighteen years old from all over the world who have the will to learn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-all the world? Why would you do such a thing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First of all, this is the intention of the funder, the guild. Orario, known as the &quot;center of the world&quot;, has gathered many people and gods, but this alone is not enough. For the sake of city operation... and also to achieve the three major adventures The guild is always looking for outstanding talents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing that my ignorant side was completely exposed, Miss Eina seemed a little happy.</p>

<p>Just like a child who no longer needs to worry about now needs to be taken care of again, she raised her index finger and started explaining to me.</p>

<p>&quot;If anything, it's the will of the gods who guide the 'school district' forward... No, it should be called 'enthusiasm', right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? Gods-sama... Could it be that on that ship...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right. The 'School District' is run by more than one [Family Family], which is the so-called faction alliance.&quot;</p>

<p>Alliance of factions. When I heard this word, my eyes widened.</p>

<p>At the same time, there is also a feeling of doubts being answered.</p>

<p>I heard that within the [Family] system, which is famous for its exploration (dungeon) department and business department, there is another type called the &quot;academy department&quot;. This type will use tuition as a price to grant all kinds of knowledge to those who don't belong, especially children, in order to run a faction. It seems to be very common to teach them knowledge and directly invite children with potential to become team members.</p>

<p>As far as I know, because the academy department [Family Family] is inseparable from the area where it is located, or it is easier to produce excellent talents and hire people, it is very popular in the towns or countries where the academy called the base is located, but with Compared with other [Familiar Clan], the Academy Department [Family Clan] must recruit outstanding members - &quot;Instructors&quot;, so it will be more difficult to operate. They belong to the [Family] type where emerging factions are most likely to fail.</p>

<p> Maybe this is just the prejudice of a country bumpkin from an ordinary village, but in my self-conception, &quot;school&quot; is a place only wealthy people, such as nobles, can go. But in fact, there are also [families] from colleges and universities, and as long as they are prepared with money and other rewards, they can get the opportunity to study.</p>

<p>It's a pity that there is no such academic faction in Orario - that's not right.</p>

<p>Maybe just the opposite?</p>

<p>In fact, all the academic and family members are gathered there, for that huge educational institution?</p>

<p>The &quot;school district&quot; is a collection of colleges and departments [family members]...?</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter race, wealth, or experience. All that's necessary is the 'will to learn.'&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Eina said this while looking at the children passing by us.</p>

<p>&quot;That is, the 'heart of exploration' itself that constantly seeks what one can become. This is the condition for becoming a student of the 'School District'.&quot;</p>

<p>Regardless of origin.</p>

<p>It doesn't even require money.</p>

<p>It can be said that only those who admit their immaturity and want to become &quot;students&quot; can be selected, Ms. Eina said with a little pride.</p>

<p>&quot;...Miss Eina really knows the 'school district'. It's amazing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huhu. In fact, I was once a student in the &quot;school district&quot;, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!? Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>The unexpected answer surprised me and made me scream.</p>

<p>People walking on the road looked at me, which made me blush... However, what made me even more ashamed was that Miss Aegina clearly took care of me, but I didn't understand her at all...</p>

<p>But, it turns out that&rsquo;s the case.</p>

<p>Miss Eina is so knowledgeable not just because she is a guild employee.</p>

<p>Many things taught in that huge school have helped us adventurers time and time again through Miss Eina.</p>

<p>When I thought of this, I suddenly felt grateful and had a strong interest in the &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p>I am an adventurer now and can no longer be a student, but... I wonder what kind of place that ship is?</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, because I am a former student... so when I returned to Hong Kong from the 'School District', the guild also asked me to be responsible for the main procedures, but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Miss Eina?&quot;</p>

<p>at this time.</p>

<p>Miss Eina's proud profile just now seemed to be cast into a shadow.</p>

<p>Just as I was peering into her face, the crowd suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>We arrived at Sihanoukville with the crowd.</p>

<p>It would be more accurate to say it is a huge shipyard.</p>

<p>People all pushed forward, wanting to observe the &quot;school district&quot; near the shore from a close distance. The guild staff and the [Ganesha Familia] other than Miss Eina were preventing the crowd from getting too close. It seems that even adventurers and gods cannot approach easily at present, let alone ordinary people.</p>

<p>&quot;We are back, Port Town (Meilian)!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come back&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First meeting! Port town (Melian), and labyrinth city (Orario)!!&quot;</p>

<p>People's cheers had not stopped. At this time, the edge of the &quot;School District&quot; with a height of more than 60 meters - which should probably be called the &quot;Shipside&quot; - also gathered many human and demihuman boys and girls, waving in response.</p>

<p>Both men and women were wearing similar uniforms, and it felt like there were many people my age among them. Are they students from the &quot;school district&quot;?</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Eina looked up at these students, squinting her green jade pupils, looking a little sad.</p>

<p>No, this should be...what are you hesitating about?</p>

<p>I felt a little confused, but I still mustered up the courage to ask her what happened&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;Mugu!?&quot;</p>

<p>But a hand suddenly reached out from behind to cover my mouth, and then dragged me deeper into the crowd.</p>

<p>&quot;...Bell-kun, I'm sorry. I have to work after that, and I have to go there... Huh? Bell-kun? Bell-kun&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pfft guch~~~!?&quot;</p>

<p>One hand covered my mouth, and the other held my shoulder, forcing me to separate from the crowd and move forward.</p>

<p>My feet almost tripped together. In order not to fall, I tried my best to walk backwards. It wasn't until I rushed out of the crowd that the other party let me go.</p>

<p>&quot;Haha!? Hermes-sama!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Bell-kun! It's only fate that I meet you here!&quot;</p>

<p>Snapped! With a loud sound, he flicked the brim of his iconic feather hat.</p>

<p>Seeing Lord Hermes' exaggerated movements, I was so moved that I looked up to the sky and sighed.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems that the reason why you are here is because after seeing the &quot;school district&quot; from the city, you subconsciously stepped forward like an adventurer attracted by the &quot;unknown&quot;... right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm...! Y-yes, you are absolutely right...&quot;</p>

<p>The divine power that I felt vaguely just now prevented me from forcibly untying the restraints. Now under the observation of the god, I can only confess honestly.</p>

<p>I rolled my eyes in surprise and asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Lord Hermes, why are you here...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The 'School District' is back. As a god with [Familiar], I naturally want to come and see it in person!&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Hermes put his arm around my shoulders and whispered like a secret conversation:</p>

<p>&quot;Come, take a look. Inside the crowd, and on the roof of that building... can you see some gods and adventurers mixed in among the children?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, it's really...&quot;</p>

<p>In the direction that Lord Hermes pointed to, there were indeed gods and dependents who were probably the main gods of the [Family]. They all stared at the &quot;School District&quot; and whispered to each other with malicious expressions on their faces.</p>

<p>The fact that I felt the &quot;precursor of turmoil&quot; from this means that I have completely taken on Orario's color... Just when I had a bad premonition, Hermes-sama said the &quot;answer&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Those are all here for the recruitment of [Familia].&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Recruiting...? Are you recruiting students from the 'school district'? But why...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course that's because the 'school district' is a treasure trove of talents!&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Hermes, who was clenching his fists so emphatically, said &quot;Let's chat for a little while&quot; and changed places.</p>

<p>But it was only in the gap between the buildings, near the entrance of the alley where the &quot;school district&quot; could be seen.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you know that the 'School District' is an educational institution that travels around the world?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes. Miss Eina told me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's easy to say. The 'School District' is very famous, so it's easy to get involved in all kinds of 'trouble'. If the town sends a request, it will go to deal with the monsters, and sometimes it will intervene in the country's affairs. disputes among them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;F-dispute?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Will is a sword, knowledge is a staff, and failure is a crown.' It would be better to say that the 'school district' will actively participate. This will be called an 'internship,' and the purpose is to allow students to grow.&quot;</p>

<p>What's going on, I suddenly feel that the &quot;school district&quot; seems to be an uneasy place...!</p>

<p>&quot;In this context, although the 'School District' is not as good as Orario, it is an environment that never lacks challenges. It is natural for students to reach Level 2. I heard that there are students at Level 3 recently. Appear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lv. 3!?&quot;</p>

<p>I've been surprised since just now, but there's nothing I can do about it.</p>

<p>Staying in Orario will cause a big deviation in people's perception, but in fact, the Familia who can sublimate are very exceptional. As long as there is one person in a village or town, no matter how big the group of monsters on the ground is, they will definitely be able to repel it. This shows how contrary to common sense this is.</p>

<p>Since the advent of the gods, today has been described as &quot;quality is greater than quantity.&quot; In today's era, as long as there is one sublimated person, it can even overturn the battle situation. And after two sublimations - Level 3 is an absolute powerhouse in the world outside the city, and it is said that he will be invited by major organizations. The labyrinth city with hundreds of high-level adventurers is an exception, but other than that, Level 3 is already very unusual.</p>

<p> Therefore, from the perspective of combat power alone, the &quot;school district&quot; that does not have an absolute environment like a magic cave (dungeon) but still has Level 2 and Level 3 is indeed enough to be called a &quot;treasury of talents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And many of the current high-level adventurers are from the 'School District'. The [Thousand Fairies] of the [Loki Familia] are the best example.&quot;</p>

<p>[Sen no Fairy]...The fairy with Yamabuki-colored hair...Ugh, my head...!</p>

<p>&quot;The 'school district' is, after all, a place for education. Most students will graduate and go their own way. Of course, there will also be children who want to be adventurers. And the gods really want to recruit these people! That's it. .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I see...&quot;</p>

<p>This is true... no wonder the gods are so active.</p>

<p>It would be better to say that if Lady Hestia also heard about this, her eyes would light up and she would want to come to recruit people...</p>

<p>&quot;That control is not only to suppress the enthusiasm of ordinary people, but also to prevent the gods and the Familia on the Orario side from coming into contact with the students.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah. Both 'Recruit' and 'Intern' prohibit sneaking away. This is a rule set in advance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Recruit&quot;? &#12302;Intern&#12303;?</p>

<p>The unfamiliar words made me tilt my head, and Lord Hermes clenched his fist tightly.</p>

<p>&quot;However! Of course, a child with a promising future wants to strike first! As the main god of the [Familiar Clan]! Do you understand, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;haha a&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>He suddenly started talking passionately. I was overwhelmed by this momentum and managed to nod my head at the same time.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s not a big deal, maybe it&rsquo;s because we were talking secretly, so even though we didn&rsquo;t do anything bad, I felt uncomfortable...</p>

<p>&quot;That's it, Bell-kun! Start now and sneak into the 'School District' with me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why did it become like this!?&quot;</p>

<p>Ah, I suddenly feel very guilty!</p>

<p>&quot;We [Hermes Familia] have always recruited job-hopping people, no, we are eager for ready-made combat power! Facing the gold mine of talents in the 'School District', we must not follow in the footsteps of other forces!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I have no reason to help at all!? Instead of asking me, why don't you ask Asfi-san for help...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Asfi... I asked her to take a vacation. After all, she has been working all the time...&quot;</p>

<p>ah&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>Hearing Lord Hermes look into the distance and explain, I couldn't help but look into the distance.</p>

<p>The same is true for the therapist Miss Hayid, and Miss Asfi is overused due to her incompetence, and has always been the most miserable person in the labyrinth city (Orario) with dead fish eyes...</p>

<p>&quot;It's better to say that if I don't give her a day off, I might be killed. At the time of the 'Goddess Festival', I originally planned to let her take a break, but... you see, isn't it the case of 'Migami-sama (that kind of thing)' happened again? &quot;Things are so confusing&quot;?</p>

<p>&quot;Well&#8230;&#8230;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Asfi is really running around. It's so sad. Her body doesn't get any rest at all.&quot;</p>

<p>He mentioned an incident that could be said to have been caused by me, which made me make a sound like biting into rotten fruit.</p>

<p>I heard that the group leader (Ms. Asfi)&rsquo;s recuperation seemed to be an opportunity, and the other group members also started taking vacations.</p>

<p>At least this time, it seems that no one can accompany Lord Hermes to deal with his troubles (requests).</p>

<p>&quot;Although I don't want to say this, the reason why I didn't even bring my family members and why I came here alone is because of Bell-kun, right~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;During the 'Faction War', I also worked hard for Hestia~&quot;</p>

<p>Oops, ouch...!</p>

<p>This is the rhythm of the God of Words (Lord Hermes)...!</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of which, Bell-kun? In order for &quot;Little Ciel&quot; to stay in the city, I secretly worked hard to convince the goddesses who are hostile to &quot;Freya-sama&quot;... Don't you think someone should be a little bit more... Can you comfort me?&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Hermes smiled and closed one eye.</p>

<p>I lowered my head feebly.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Bell Crane was naturally unable to completely reject the &quot;God's request&quot;.</p>

<p>Normally, outsiders are absolutely prohibited from entering the &quot;school zone&quot;.</p>

<p>Except for the students, teachers, gods, and related personnel who belong to the ship, all other factions, other forces, and unaffiliated humans will be captured if they enter.</p>

<p>The reason is that the &quot;School District&quot; itself is a collection of &quot;secrets&quot;, such as the production of &quot;Oliha Steel&quot;, which is known as the hardest refined metal.</p>

<p>The &quot;School District&quot; has many outstanding graduates - people with technical expertise such as magicians and alchemists, so they have accumulated unique technical knowledge and things called &quot;mechanisms&quot;, so that these are not used in other places. The good thing is that the &quot;school district&quot; strictly prevents the leakage of information. If people from outside want to enter the &quot;School District&quot;, they have to go through the same complicated procedures and time as entering Orario. No matter how great a king or how powerful a person is, the first-level adventurers of Orario are no exception - these are what Lord Hermes told me.</p>

<p>In short, what I want to say is that it is extremely difficult to invade the &quot;School District&quot;.</p>

<p>At the port, not only the relevant personnel of the &quot;School District&quot;, but also the elite high-level adventurers (Ganesha Familia) are closely monitoring it. Even if it becomes &quot;transparent&quot;, the aura will definitely be detected. Inspections of moving-in supplies are more thorough. Invasion from land is simply impossible.</p>

<p>So what about the invasion path at sea? It is indeed very difficult.</p>

<p>Even if a small boat is prepared to approach, it is impossible not to be discovered. Even if it is finally attached to the super ship, it still has to climb the frighteningly high belly of the ship.</p>

<p>Although I am still at Level 5, it is still a bit reluctant to sneak in with a god... I raised this opinion with the last glimmer of hope, but Lord Hermes smiled and answered simply. I.</p>

<p>He said, then just do it &quot;from the air&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu_?&quot;</p>

<p>Holding Lord Hermes in my arms, I was falling from the sky and screamed so embarrassingly.</p>

<p>I completely forgot about not being noticed by the &quot;school district&quot;, and the screams merged into the violent roar of the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so right to borrow the &lsquo;Jet Black Helmet (Hades Helmet)&rsquo; and &lsquo;Flying Boots (Talalia)&rsquo; from the Familia&rsquo;s room!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;Is this really right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course! This is a successful invasion from 'heaven'. I'll ask you to operate it well from now on, Bell-kun&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know how to operate it at all!?&quot;</p>

<p>In order not to be drowned out by the wind that seemed to swallow our hearing, we tried our best to talk loudly, and I was forced to put on Asfi-san's &quot;Flying Boots (Talalia)&quot; - a spare part - Zhengjuezan is falling.</p>

<p>It was about ten minutes ago that I put on this magical item that I didn&rsquo;t know how to use.</p>

<p>After becoming &quot;transparent&quot; with Lord Hermes, who was wearing a suspicious helmet, I managed to float up to the sky unsteadily, hiding from the eyes of everyone and reaching the top of the distant &quot;school zone&quot; - but the miracle ended there.</p>

<p>Now, Lord Hermes and I are falling from about 500 meters above like fools whose wax wings have been melted! !</p>

<p>&quot;I heard that Hestia and Asfi took a sky trip without telling us! Then of course we have to have a heartbeat&#9734;landing of two men, right?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They say now is not the time to say such things, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Hermes, who was lying on his side, kept laughing in my ear, and my bangs and clothes were all messed up by the wind pressure!</p>

<p>It was different from when he fell from the giant blue waterfall. Now a primitive sense of terror surged from his abdomen, and big tears welled up in the corners of his eyes! The tears just formed and immediately flew into the distance! !</p>

<p>As if the gods in the sky were laughing at me as I gradually fell into panic, the artificial earth was approaching visibly to the naked eye&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Dongwahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?&quot;</p>

<p>I successfully fell into the corner of the &quot;school district&quot; where wooden boxes and other things were piled up - the materials storage area.</p>

<p>The moment before the violent conflict, as if reacting to my screams, the &quot;Flying Boots&quot; spread their four wings and braked suddenly, but it was only a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p>I couldn't completely stop the momentum and rushed into the hill of the wooden box with my feet in front, making a rather exaggerated sound.</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Still, still alive&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you are worthy of being Level 5! I was unscathed even though I was a baggage. I'm making great progress, Bell-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>I tried my best, thinking that the only thing I had to do was protect the god. As a result, Hermes didn't even have a scratch, and he was even in a very happy mood.</p>

<p>I straightened up from the broken wooden box fragments (bed) and was about to burst into laughter, when</p>

<p>&quot;What was that sound just now!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It must be Orario's intruder again! Hurry!!&quot;</p>

<p>Beep----! !</p>

<p>Accompanied by the high-pitched &quot;siren&quot; sound, the surroundings suddenly became noisy.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh-huh!? This, this, there is no doubt that it should be...!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The intrusion was exposed. Yes, it made such a loud noise after all.&quot;</p>

<p>Needless to say!</p>

<p>In my mind, I slapped my cheeks with both hands and screamed, and at the same time I hurriedly stood up.</p>

<p>&quot;H-stay in the 'transparent' state and run away! This way you don't have to worry about being discovered...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, actually they invaded with jet-black helmets a long time ago. But the 'school district' developed a magic tool that can see transparent people clearly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing!?&quot;</p>

<p>By the way, it turns out he has a criminal record! ?</p>

<p>No wonder the &quot;school district&quot;, including the port, maintains such strict vigilance!</p>

<p>While we were making such a noise, someone's presence had already approached the place where the materials were placed! !</p>

<p>&quot;Then Bell-kun, let's carry out the decoy operation!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I just have a bad premonition, what kind of battle is it like!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're my bait and I'm running away! That's it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hermes-sama&mdash;!? Uh, ahhh&mdash;!?&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't even have time to refute, Lord Hermes took off the helmet I was wearing - a magic item that remained &quot;transparent&quot; even after falling from the sky - and boom! The ground gave me a push.</p>

<p>I flew directly over the wooden box fragments and sat down on the metal ground. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Lord Hermes in the transparent state apologized, and then said, &quot;Then please!&quot; with a crisp breath. Stay away from me! By the way, the &quot;flying boots&quot; were also recycled, and only my shoes were thrown back! !</p>

<p>Lord Hermes~~! ? Just when I was letting out this shameful cry in my heart,</p>

<p>&quot;I say you!&quot;</p>

<p>The male and female students in uniform appeared like executioners.</p>

<p>At this time I had just put on my shoes, holding my breath and sweating like rain.</p>

<p>I feel like a thief being chased to the edge of a cliff!</p>

<p>Then.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you get caught in the explosion!? You weren't hurt, were you!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-yes...it doesn't matter to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you seen anyone suspicious!? Do you know where to go!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, uh... I saw it. That... over there...&quot;</p>

<p>I quickly stood up. The human female student approached me eagerly to express concern. The orc male student was worried about me, who was covered in dust, and asked about the whereabouts of the intruder.</p>

<p>I tried not to meet their eyes, lowered my head, and pointed in the completely opposite direction from where Lord Hermes left.</p>

<p>&quot;That's right over there!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are so unlucky! Remember to go to the health room immediately!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It must be the [Hermes Familia] again! To invade from the sky, only the magic items of the [Almighty One] can do it!&quot;</p>

<p>Instead of doubting me, the students comforted me and ran out in the direction I pointed.</p>

<p>After several demihumans completely disappeared, I really seemed to have lost all my strength this time and collapsed on the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;S-I'm saved...&quot;</p>

<p>The sense of liberation after the high tension turned into a long sigh, leaking from his mouth.</p>

<p>I sat on the ground and looked at the blue sky for a while, then stood up unsteadily and looked down at my body.</p>

<p>&quot;Lord Hermes, the reason why you asked me to wear the 'uniform'...is for this time.&quot;</p>

<p>What I am wearing now is not the clothes I am used to wearing, nor is it a combat uniform.</p>

<p>Instead, they were wearing &quot;school district uniforms&quot; just like the students just now.</p>

<p>The base of the costume is white, and the collar is a burgundy tie that Mr. Hermes helped me put on.</p>

<p>The hem at the waist is divided into two long parts like the tuxedo he once wore at Lord Apollo's banquet.</p>

<p>It can be said to be a compact style with long sleeves and trousers, or it can be said to be the tight-fitting style that the gods say...</p>

<p>Forget it, let's be clear, this dress fits my body just right.</p>

<p>Could it be that Lord Hermes... planned to let me wear this dress from the beginning, or that he planned to involve me in it?</p>

<p>Otherwise, how could such a uniform be prepared in advance? I wiped my sweat and thought about this matter, and it suddenly dawned on me.</p>

<p>Although he managed to evade suspicion, it was too suspicious to remain standing at this crash landing site. If I were cross-examined, I would not be confident that I could deceive the other person.</p>

<p>So I left the scene in a hurry.</p>

<p>And not long after, I said &quot;exclamation&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow...!&quot;</p>

<p>After leaving the intricate trails - or rather zoning - the scenery that unfolded in front of me was enough to make me forget that I was still on a boat.</p>

<p>A complex of buildings built with white stone and blue roofs. The symmetrical structure alone creates a beautiful atmosphere like a work of art, reminiscent of words such as church or church.</p>

<p>Since it is said to be a &quot;school district&quot;, are all these buildings &quot;teaching buildings&quot;?</p>

<p>I walked on the deserted stone road and kept looking both ways.</p>

<p>The design of the magic stone street lamp standing on the roadside is very exquisite, and it is not inferior to Orario. It is engraved with &quot;Graduation Work of the 42nd Period of Craftsmanship&quot;, which seems to be the work of a student. So are the other buildings, the beautiful arches, and the statue of the goddess!</p>

<p>I looked around with interest and sighed with emotion. If someone saw me in my current state, they would probably think, &quot;This guy is definitely not a student.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if they say they dug up a town somewhere and moved it here directly... I will believe it.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;school district&quot; is so broad and well organized.</p>

<p>The limited space of the ship is obviously filled with buildings, but probably because of the clever planning, I don't feel bored here at all. In addition to man-made products, evergreen trees are planted everywhere here, which is very eye-catching. You can also see some &quot;shops&quot; that are obviously not &quot;teaching buildings&quot;. Although they are not open now, they still give me the feeling of walking in a fashion boutique street or a high-end residential area that I have never been able to get along with.</p>

<p>This is... &quot;School District&quot;.</p>

<p>This is actually the view from the boat!</p>

<p>&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>I could no longer suppress the excitement that gradually emerged and started running.</p>

<p>Just like when I first came to Orario half a year ago, I became a prisoner of the new world!</p>

<p>This even made me forget the current situation, run across the road, rush up the steps, and reach a relatively high place.</p>

<p>I put my hands on the railing and looked at the &quot;school&quot;. What a beautiful sight in front of me.</p>

<p>&quot;Amazing&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Everywhere you look are white buildings and blue roofs.</p>

<p>There are more than 50 of these beautiful teaching buildings that can only be seen.</p>

<p>It can be said to be a paradise of sea and sky.</p>

<p>Several avenues start from the central area and extend radially outward to separate various districts. Among the buildings that are uniformly painted in white and blue to create a beautiful contrast, what is particularly eye-catching is a facility that is probably an arena. The material used is white diamond, which can also be used as a weapon material from the excavated maze. In the eyes of an adventurer (me), this is the only majestic building in the beautiful streets.</p>

<p>Deep in the field of vision, there is a green area near the stern of the ship...could it be a park?</p>

<p>Even if you just look at the area, it's big enough to accommodate the three arenas just now.</p>

<p>(But let&rsquo;s talk about the most powerful one...)</p>

<p>It should be the most conspicuous &quot;tower&quot; standing in the center.</p>

<p>Although it is not as high as the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot;, this huge tower soaring into the sky is so high that you have to look up to see the whole thing.</p>

<p>Like other teaching buildings, the beautiful white tower also has a blue roof, which is more magnificent than spectacular.</p>

<p>Looking at it this way, the entire &quot;school district&quot; looks like a subsidiary town built starting from a huge central tower. Even if you don't know anything about it, it's not difficult to imagine that this tower must play an important role in this super giant ship.</p>

<p>At the same time, I also felt a little familiar.</p>

<p>&quot;This structure...is similar to Orario?&quot;</p>

<p>I recalled the entire &quot;school district&quot; I had seen from the air before I fell.</p>

<p>If we exclude the countless &quot;Blue Feathers&quot; that surround the giant ship itself - probably used as parts of the &quot;Sail&quot;, the structure of the &quot;School District&quot; is a standard circle. Like a labyrinth city surrounded by huge walls.</p>

<p>Ms. Eina said that this place is under the support of the guild, plus there is a huge tower standing in the center, and there are several avenues (main roads) extending outward from the middle... Maybe my reasoning is not wrong. Maybe this place is really based on the labyrinth city.</p>

<p>A small maze city. In other words, Orario's brother.</p>

<p>Just neater and prettier than the prototype.</p>

<p>The reason why it has such a label is because one side is an &quot;Adventurer City&quot; and the other side is a &quot;Student Town&quot;.</p>

<p>I leaned forward as hard as I could, imprinting the scenery of the &quot;school district&quot; in my mind.</p>

<p>&quot;You are really amazing, Nina!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I heard that you came first in the small written test (test)! Leave the &quot;Crane Tail Team&quot; quickly and come back to the teaching subject~!&quot;</p>

<p>at this time.</p>

<p>The noise reached my ears and caught my attention.</p>

<p>It was a stone road facing the steps above. Just below me.</p>

<p>Girls of different races were passing by talking and laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;It's just a coincidence. I just happened to hit the test range.&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at &quot;her&quot; who was at the center of the conversation, and my eyes widened.</p>

<p>She has long brown hair, tied up with a bow near her back.</p>

<p>The ears are more slender than humans, but not as pointed as goblins.</p>

<p>Although he is a half-elf, one of his bangs is dyed emerald, which seems to indicate his noble bloodline.</p>

<p>The pupils are also green jade.</p>

<p>Even though there was a distance, I could still see that her profile was very straight and adorable.</p>

<p>However, there is something more important than these banal reflections.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but see the shadow of &quot;that person&quot; in this girl.</p>

<p>&quot;...Miss Eina.&quot;</p>

<p>She doesn't wear glasses and is a different height.</p>

<p>The hairstyle and the surrounding atmosphere are also different.</p>

<p>Even so, I still called that person's name.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>There was no way she could hear this murmur.</p>

<p>But she stopped and looked back at me as if she was being guided by the wind speeding on the sea.</p>

<p>My crimson pupils looked downward.</p>

<p>Her emerald eyes looked upward.</p>

<p>Under the clear blue sky, the two people's eyes intertwined with each other.</p>

<p>&quot;--emegency notice! emegency notice! The school district found traces of the intruder! &#12303;</p>

<p>at this time.</p>

<p>As if the increasingly transparent air between the two people was torn apart, the amplified sound was deafening, resounding throughout the entire &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;According to the investigation of the Alchemy Department, there are two intruders! One is a god and the other is a dependent! The report of the Disciplinary Committee pointed out that the latter was probably wearing a uniform and pretending to be a student! ! &#12303;</p>

<p>The source of the broadcast is a loudspeaker made of magic stone mounted on buildings and pillars.</p>

<p>As if to inflict divine punishment on lawbreakers who have entered the sacred realm, the female announcer became more and more angry, and my face became paler.</p>

<p>&quot;The race is human and the gender is male!&quot; Characterized by white hair and red eyes! Repeat, pure white hair like a crazed rabbit, and a human with red eyes like a pervert with bloodshot eyes! ! &#12303;</p>

<p>This description is considered slanderous&mdash;&mdash;! ?</p>

<p>But I didn't even have time to protest.</p>

<p>Originally there were only half-elf girls looking at me, but now there are more and more of them, with sights coming from all directions, covering me tightly like a forest of guns.</p>

<p>&quot;White hair, red eyes...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, isn't this...the one over there...&quot;</p>

<p>The students walking on the street started making noise for five seconds.</p>

<p>Sweat trickled down his cheeks to his chin, which took a second.</p>

<p>An unusual atmosphere arose around him for half a second.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;The intruder found&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!!&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>The roar sounded the next moment.</p>

<p>The loud noise made by the students made the half-elf girl's shoulders shake in fear, and at the same time, I turned around in an instant.</p>

<p>There was a crash and a lot of sweat spewed out from my face and back. I tried my best to run away! !</p>

<p>&quot;The target is running away!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go north from the Sixth Sector and head towards the Ninth Sector! Let the people from Qingkong Canteen outflank us!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ask the supervisor for permission to use weapons and magic in the academy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute!!&quot;</p>

<p>Naturally, the students chased after him, and there were no less than twenty in number.</p>

<p>Every time I ran across a road, more students would join the chasing team from the fork in the road. I felt dizzy because of this, but I still didn't stop running hard. What also didn&rsquo;t stop was the cold sweat and uncomfortable heartbeat!</p>

<p>I instantly became a &quot;fugitive in the school district&quot;, and the current situation made me lose all blood!</p>

<p>&quot;The impenitent Orario adventurers have invaded again!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't even think about it, you have violated the rules and contacted the students (us), how could we accept the invitation!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take him! Send him to Orario and hold his faction (familiar) accountable for his management responsibility!&quot;</p>

<p>By the way, is this considered a crime?</p>

<p>Even if he is not caught, he will be sued by the &quot;school district&quot; and put in the guild's prison! ?</p>

<p>The constant outpouring of pessimism and despair made me almost faint and fall to the ground. But at this moment, I suddenly discovered something.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop it&mdash;&mdash;!!&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I turned a corner and came to another road, I found that students had erected a human wall in front of me.</p>

<p>I rushed into a place where students gathered?</p>

<p>No&mdash;I was induced! ?</p>

<p>&quot;Same as the instructions! [Badelban] is outflanking us!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The road is blocked! Take him!&quot;</p>

<p>Absolutely right. The students who found me were keeping a close distance behind me to intimidate me. At the same time, they quickly issued instructions to the surroundings and formed a surrounding network at the induced location in front.</p>

<p>All this happened in just a few minutes, and the cooperation of the students was amazing!</p>

<p>Watching their uniform movements - compared with the labyrinth city where it is difficult to cross the [Family] barrier - I couldn't help but feel respect.</p>

<p>And this respect is directly related to my safety! !</p>

<p>&quot;Um!&quot;</p>

<p>Therefore, I forcibly twisted my body, or in other words, made a decisive &quot;big jump&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Varied--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Flying!?&quot;</p>

<p>Running on the stone slabs, I stepped hard and twisted my body like a juggler, high over the roofs of the 10-meter-high teaching buildings lined up along the road, and reached the next door area.</p>

<p>I drew a parabola and disappeared into the depths of the teaching building. At the same time, from the corner of my field of vision, I caught a glimpse of the students looking up at me speechlessly, wanting to attack from both sides.</p>

<p>&quot;...Hurry up, hurry up and chase!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's going on with that guy!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You just skipped the teaching building!?&quot;</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to land on an empty road and it took less than five seconds total.</p>

<p>After a brief blank period, confused shouts erupted from the adjacent road on the other side of the teaching building.</p>

<p>The sound caught me breaking through the siege and running, and hit my back again.</p>

<p>In the dungeon and with [Apollo Familia] and [Ishtar Familia], I had no choice but to develop the skills to escape from large groups of people. Although it was very empty, I have now fully utilized it! The story of Bell Crane, who even showed &quot;escape (power)&quot;, is the story of escape. I will omit it below! !</p>

<p>Then there is the level gap.</p>

<p>Lord Hermes told me something before, but now I see that the students chasing me do have physical abilities comparable to those of senior adventurers. Coupled with the smooth cooperation of the students, there is no doubt that it is enough to pose a threat.</p>

<p>However, now I am Level 5.</p>

<p>Now that I can do it even with some force - now after experiencing the competition with the fastest in the city (Mr. Allen) - I will never lose in a pure pursuit. This is not confidence, but &quot;fact&quot;.</p>

<p>Two students rushed out from the fork in the road. I leaned forward and ran past them.</p>

<p>Just like this, the students lost sight of me and couldn't help but look around.</p>

<p>Although the current situation is a bit special, it still makes me feel that I have truly become a &quot;first-level adventurer&quot; again.</p>

<p>If it were me now, maybe I could get rid of the previous arrest scene with [Apollo Familia] and [Ishtar Familia] by myself.</p>

<p>only&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that human being Bell Crani?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;[White Rabbit Swiftfoot]!? The one who is said to be Lv. 5!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;White hair and red eyes...that's absolutely right! He's the fastest rabbit in the world!&quot;</p>

<p>(Exposed&mdash;!?)</p>

<p>An adventurer who becomes famous will inevitably face a certain fate, something like a price, and now I have to go through this process.</p>

<p>Under the current situation, wearing a uniform to disguise oneself has completely lost its meaning.</p>

<p>The students chased me and started shouting at the same time.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks to my coming, Orario, I'm really looking forward to seeing you in person!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Obviously I'm still a little yearning for it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a mistake!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Too disappointed!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Illegal intruder!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;criminal!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;He's just an adventurer after all!!&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>(Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuah&mdash;&mdash;!?)</p>

<p>Loud roars and scoldings came from behind, which made me roll my eyes and feel shocked inside!</p>

<p>It was almost the same as when I injured the orphans due to the heretic incident. In short, my spirit was weakened in every sense of the word, and I was about to fall to my knees. With tears in my eyes, I tried to run around the &quot;school zone&quot;.</p>

<p>By the way, when will I run away?</p>

<p>Is it possible to jump into the sea and escape? ?</p>

<p>But leaving Lord Hermes behind and escaping alone is a bit...! ?</p>

<p>I was caught between inner criticism and entanglement, and was trapped by my natural indecisiveness, which probably lasted for several minutes.</p>

<p>At this time, maybe I couldn't stand it anymore and kept running around. Like reinforcements, new students rushed out of the teaching building!</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Stop&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!!&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?&quot;</p>

<p>No more!</p>

<p>There are too many people and there is no way to escape!</p>

<p>Students rushed towards me from both the stone pavement and the rooftops, and I was chased to the center of the &quot;school zone&quot;. It is no longer possible to jump from the side of the ship into the sea!</p>

<p>Maybe I can force an opening in the siege, but...if I hurt a student because of something like this, I would really be a criminal!</p>

<p>Since they can't mess around, the only way left is to escape into the &quot;tower&quot; built in the center of the &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;He escaped into the Temple Tower (Bredablik)!&quot;</p>

<p>I rushed into the tower with its open door, looking intently ahead, and rushed up the huge spiral staircase.</p>

<p>Naturally, the students also poured in, chasing me until I could only run upward.</p>

<p>People on each floor, probably students or teachers, screamed when they saw me climbing the stairs quickly. I kept saying &quot;I'm sorry!&quot; in my heart, and at the same time muttering &quot;This is bad.&quot;</p>

<p>There is no doubt that if this continues, there will be no escape!</p>

<p>Then, we can only try to hide it somewhere...!</p>

<p>The students were thrown far below by me, and I reached the top first.</p>

<p>After walking through the empty corridor, I pushed open the double door made of ash wood at the end.</p>

<p>&quot;--ah.&quot;</p>

<p>then.</p>

<p>After breaking into the room - a pillar of &quot;god&quot; appeared in the field of vision.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh? You are...&quot;</p>

<p>This god is very beautiful.</p>

<p>Although she is a male god, she is as beautiful as a goddess.</p>

<p>Longer blond hair that is richer than Miss Ais, and delicate white skin.</p>

<p>I have never seen anyone with such a slender figure, which is why I think he is &quot;as beautiful as a goddess&quot;.</p>

<p>However he is much taller than me. Wearing a long sacred cassock, from the right shoulder to the arm, the original skin is exposed. Is the crown on your head made of mistletoe?</p>

<p>Can't see his eyes.</p>

<p>Closed eyelids covered his pupils.</p>

<p>Despite this, the male god still really &quot;saw&quot; me.</p>

<p>I stared blankly at this noble figure and understood only one thing.</p>

<p>What this god is in charge of must be something sacred related to &quot;light&quot;.</p>

<p>His eyes that should not have been able to see me turned towards me, and the male god showed a soft smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Lord Balder!&quot;</p>

<p>A girl pushed the door open.</p>

<p>Her actions were right on the line between rude and not rude, and she could still maintain the minimum etiquette in such an emergency, probably because she was a student in the &quot;school district&quot;. As if she wanted to declare that the current situation was an emergency, her face changed drastically and she said loudly:</p>

<p>&quot;Is there a white-haired human here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No? What happened, Arisa?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You didn't come to the top floor (here)? Did you hide behind the stairs on the way...?&quot;</p>

<p>The armband tied to her arm swayed, and the girl showed a thoughtful expression for a moment, then came back to her senses and replied with a straight posture, &quot;I'm very sorry, there is an intruder!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have been invaded by Orario's forces again...! And this time the adventurer is the fastest rabbit in the world (Bell Crane)!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We will definitely capture him! Please wait for our report!&quot;</p>

<p>Bet on the prestige of the &quot;school district&quot;!</p>

<p>The girl showed an expression that suggested she might say that, and then left the room.</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you very much...&quot;</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;Hiding in the shadow of the table and holding my breath to listen to the entire exchange, I instantly lost my strength.</p>

<p>After rushing into this room just now, thanks to the kindness of the male god in front of me, I was able to hide here.</p>

<p>&quot;B-but, why help me...? Uh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Badr. You are Bell Crane. Although the order is a bit out of order, it is the first time we meet. Orario's new hope.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H-hope...? Ah, no, I am! First, first time meeting!&quot;</p>

<p>Just as I put on a guilty expression, Lord Balder smiled slightly and said hello leisurely.</p>

<p>I looked blank at first, then hurriedly lowered my head. Miraculously, the feelings of guilt and nervousness were gradually disappearing.</p>

<p>It seemed that only around this male god, the flow of time slowed down... How should I put it?</p>

<p>I feel like as long as I talk to that steady voice and words, my heart will calm down.</p>

<p>After my body was no longer tense, as if he had calculated the opportunity, Lord Balder answered the question I just asked.</p>

<p>&quot;As for the fact that I will protect you, it's because before I received the report of the intruder... I happened to talk about you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;And the person you are talking to is me!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uwaaaah!? H-Hermes-sama!? So you are here!?&quot;</p>

<p>I was really shocked this time when I saw Lord Hermes remove some of the stone slabs on the outside of the large carpet.</p>

<p>It seems like he was hiding under the floorboards before I got here.</p>

<p>&quot;After I separated from Bell-kun, I happened to walk to this bridge... which is the 'Temple Tower'. So I hid here for a while with Balder, who I have a close friendship with!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really... I only speak so nicely when something happens.&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Hermes walked over, twirling his hat with his fingers, and Lord Balder actually chuckled calmly.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the relationship between Lord Hermes and Lord Balder is, but... just by looking at the exchanges between the two, I can feel that these two have probably been friends for a long time.</p>

<p>&quot;In addition to recruiting students, I also want to have a 'conversation between gods' with Baldur. Now is the perfect time!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As long as I send you a document, I will still have free time for the interview... You are still the same, you come as fast as the wind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's nothing I can do. If I go through formal channels, I will definitely be delayed again and again, and then the Guild will inform me that we can't meet until a month later. After all, the &quot;school district&quot; is so busy during this period... You are still the &quot;principal&quot; God, even more so.&quot;</p>

<p>I looked back and forth between Hermes-sama and Baldur-sama, who said they had something to discuss, and as a complete outsider, I couldn't help but whisper &quot;Hey&quot; when I heard this word.</p>

<p>&quot;The school, the principal is saying...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Literally. Baldr is the greatest god here. ...And if we trace the origin, he is also the god who came up with the idea of &#8203;&#8203;a 'school district'.&quot;</p>

<p>The God who came up with the idea...that is, the God who came up with the idea to establish this &quot;school district&quot;! ?</p>

<p>I looked over in surprise. Lord Baldr still had his eyes closed and his mouth slightly deflated like a wry smile.</p>

<p>&quot;The word &quot;greatest&quot; is a little inappropriate. After all, this 'school district' is just an alliance of the academy and the [family members]. All the gods have equal rights to speak. ...However, when something happens, I will lead everyone and bear the responsibility. , in this sense, I am indeed the top person in charge of the &lsquo;school district&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I should have thought a long time ago that the fact that the divine chamber can be built in such a high central tower shows that the status of this divine creature is not low... After hearing his position, my body became tense again.</p>

<p>It was only now that I felt uneasy, not knowing how I would be treated, which led to my behavior becoming very suspicious.</p>

<p>Although he protected me just now, I was trespassing illegally after all, and he was standing right here...!</p>

<p>&quot;So, what do you think? Baldr. Are you willing to agree to the 'request' I just said?&quot;</p>

<p>Beside me, who was extremely nervous, Lord Hermes asked with a calm expression.</p>

<p>&quot;ask&quot;&#8230;&#8230;?</p>

<p>I wonder what they were talking about before I came? After all, Lord Baldr just said, &quot;You talked about me (Bell Crane)&quot;, but why did you talk about me?</p>

<p>&quot;yes&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>While I was standing there blankly, Lord Balder looked over.</p>

<p>I felt very confused, but after a while, the male god curved his eyebrows into a gentle arch and said:</p>

<p>&quot;Okay&mdash;Bell Cronny, are you interested in becoming a student in the &quot;School District&quot;?&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment, time seemed to stand still here.</p>

<p>Then, motionless, I understood the meaning of the words and shouted out.</p>

<p>&quot;Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go to the 'School District' to study!? Bell-sama!?&quot;</p>

<p>Got into trouble again!</p>

<p>Hearing Lily's frantic voice that contained this meaning, I couldn't help but shrink into a ball.</p>

<p>&quot;You went to the guild and never came back. You thought something happened. Did you receive such an invitation?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's not an invitation... I should say it's a 'condition in exchange'... or maybe Hermes-sama pushed ahead without permission...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really! How come it's Master Hermes' fault again!&quot;</p>

<p>It's about to get dark, in the large dining hall of &quot;Zaohuo Pavilion&quot;.</p>

<p>After I told everything about what happened in the &quot;school district&quot;, Welf, who was sitting next to me at the dining table, was speechless, and Lily opposite me shouted angrily, as if she was going to bang her hands at any time! Slapping the table.</p>

<p>And I felt very embarrassed when I came up with this stupid explanation of &quot;It turned out like this when I came back to my senses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bell, let me confirm, this is not [Recruit] or [Intern], right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh... I'm sorry, Lord Hermes also said these two words, but what do 'Recruit' and 'Intern' mean...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Recruit means 'Family Recruitment'. Intern means 'Faction Experience'... that is, trial membership of [Family]. Both of these are policies for the faction to recruit outstanding talents from the 'School District', Mr. Bell.&quot; .&rdquo;</p>

<p>Welf and Lily explained it to me who still knew nothing about the outside of the maze.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, the &quot;Family Recruitment&quot; seems to be a recruitment meeting for Orario's faction that is held within a specified date. Of course it is approved by the &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p>Representatives of each [Family Family] will hold a faction presentation meeting in the [School District] to publicize and attract students to join. The Orario side can acquire outstanding talents, and the &quot;school district&quot; side can also show students various ways out.</p>

<p>Orario is known as the &quot;Center of the World&quot;, and among the [Factions] belonging to Orario, there are not only exploration-type factions, but also many other types of high-level factions, which are clearly different from other cities and other countries. Then there will definitely be more people in the &quot;school district&quot; who want to join. This activity that benefits both Orario and the &quot;school district&quot; seems to have a long history.</p>

<p> &quot;In the 'Family Recruitment', there are also [Family] who can accept the invitation of the 'School District' and send members to stay for a long time...that is, the 'Family Recruitment Officer'. In this way, you can have in-depth communication with the students and better publicity. My own faction. What Lord Welf wants to ask about is probably the Familia Recruitment Officer (about this matter).&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing Lily's addition, I thought that was the case and nodded.</p>

<p>The larger the [Familiar], the more likely it is that they will be selected to dispatch the [Family Recruiter]. The reason given by the [School District] is that &quot;there are many students who want to join this [Family]&quot;.</p>

<p>The other &quot;Faction Experience&quot; is more simple, requiring students from the &quot;School District&quot; to participate in the &quot;Faction&quot; activities on the Orario side.</p>

<p>In this way, Orario's [Family] can let students understand their own factions, which in turn is a kind of care, preventing students in the [school district] from discovering after joining that &quot;this shouldn't be the case!&quot; This kind of failure .</p>

<p>Different from ordinary job hunting, joining [Familiar Clan] and engraving &quot;God's Favor&quot; is a very important choice - not only do you have to stay in the same faction for a whole year, but sometimes you also do like Lily , it is difficult to quit the group or change religion - so it is easy for me to understand.</p>

<p>At the same time, it also made me think, 'How considerate'.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like comparing the hard work I put in before meeting Lady Hestia, but it should be said that she took great care of her, treated her well, or something... By the way, I just felt that she was too polite. Being able to think like this means that I have completely become an adventurer in Orario.</p>

<p>No, maybe this is because the talents in the &quot;school district&quot; are very good and the competition is too fierce.</p>

<p>Compared with farmers who grew up in who knows which village, perhaps even the comparison seems offensive.</p>

<p>In short, &quot;Family Recruitment&quot; and &quot;Faction Experience&quot; seem to be very important things that can promote communication between Orario and the &quot;School District&quot;. But now I was just invited to be a &quot;student&quot; and had nothing to do with it, so I clearly denied it.</p>

<p>&quot;After all, why do you want to become a 'student'? Isn't it good to be an adventurer in the past?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... it seems that my invasion of the &quot;school district&quot; has completely spread... Therefore, I probably won't get any good looks, and I won't be welcomed... or I will definitely be opposed...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;[White Rabbit Swiftfoot] and [Hestia Familia] are both disgusted, that's what you mean, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh...! Huh, sorry, Lily!&quot;</p>

<p>I answered Welf's question vaguely, and then subconsciously apologized to Lily who sighed.</p>

<p>As the leader of the group, I caused the problem again, which made me feel very guilty. In addition, after hearing the topic of &quot;Family Recruitment&quot;, I realized how big of a mistake I had made. The two together made me He hung his head in shame.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm really sorry... If [Hestia Familia] cannot recruit Familia because of me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, don't worry about that. It doesn't matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh...no, it doesn't matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. We have discussed it with Lady Hestia before. Now that there are new super-foul recruits, the recruitment of Familia in the 'School District'... or the recruitment itself should be temporarily stopped.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all, Lily and we have been promoted to B level and gained an extra reputation. Now with the celebratory atmosphere after the war game, Lily and we seem to be well-known, but... other [Family], especially the powerful The faction will definitely alienate Lily and us secretly.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't notice it at all. Lily's answer surprised me and I kept blinking.</p>

<p>According to Lily, the policy of her and Kami-sama seems to be &quot;We have enough level 6 members to join the group, so we won't compete with you in the recruitment of the &quot;school district&quot;~&quot;</p>

<p>To be more specific, it probably means &quot;I'll leave Level 2 and the Ascended above to you, so don't take it too seriously -&quot;. But if someone wants to join us, please let us go -&quot;</p>

<p> It&rsquo;s been a long time since Kami-sama&rsquo;s debt turmoil and no one has wanted to join the group. I thought she would seize this opportunity to win the war game to recruit members for a long time, so I was confused about this decision. . But after listening to the explanation, I understood.</p>

<p>After I joined the group, [Hestia Familia], which was originally a super small faction, grew at a frightening speed. The other factions who have been working tirelessly for a long time must have some ideas about this. For example, feelings such as unwillingness or feeling an eyesore.</p>

<p> &quot;At least one thing is certain. If they continue to expand their power, they will be regarded as a trouble. Although they should be afraid of Lily and the tough warriors behind us and dare not start a 'struggle', but... harassment It&rsquo;s still very easy. Just like in the dungeon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don't want to cause unnecessary conflicts or conflicts between factions.</p>

<p>Lily said clearly, at this time,</p>

<p>&quot;The first shot kills the first bird. Remember what Dongfang said, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Ms. Liu.&quot;</p>

<p>Ms. Liu appeared from the kitchen and neatly placed dinner in front of us who were talking.</p>

<p>Today, Miss Liu and Miss Ming are responsible for cooking for [Hestia Familia].</p>

<p>Ms. Liu, who admitted that her cooking skills were only slightly better than Ms. Hill's (and even apologized sheepishly), was responsible for putting the dishes on the table, while Ms. Ming was responsible for cooking. Miss Haruhime is also helping.</p>

<p>Miss Lyu, who has been trained by the &quot;Rich Mistress&quot;, is very beautiful in every move she makes. Even though she is only wearing casual clothes and an apron, her figure is still fascinating to watch.</p>

<p> When she is not exploring dungeons and other [Familiar] activities, Miss Lyu will become a temporary helper of the &quot;Housemistress of Harvest&quot; - for Miss Ryu, the Tavern of Harvest is a very precious place, and she seems to want to continue to serve her. Miss Mia and Miss Hill returned the favor - so it was actually the working tavern clerk who graced the family table.</p>

<p>Should I say it's too luxurious or something... The scene is so luxurious that people can't help but straighten their sitting posture.</p>

<p>&quot;Although it hasn't been long since I transferred to the [Familiar Clan], but... I didn't expect the next commotion to come so soon. You are really a person who has no shortage of topics.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-I'm very sorry...&quot;</p>

<p>After placing Welf's portion, I also placed a slightly smaller vegetable rice bowl in front of me (a dish that Mikoto considered taking care of Lyu-san, who is an elf). Even though there was no meat or fish, it was still extremely delicious. ), I apologized awkwardly, and then Ms. Liu smiled softly.</p>

<p>&quot;No. It's not Bell's fault, it's because of the surroundings. You are called a first-level adventurer...and the fastest rabbit in the world, and you must have met this fate.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe you were born under such a star.</p>

<p>Miss Lyu, who was once a Star Maiden's Familia (Asteria Familia), commented with a smile. It didn't sound like a joke at all, so I could only respond with a dry smile.</p>

<p>&quot;But what's the actual situation? Are there any examples of adventurers becoming students of the 'school district'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are a lot of other things on the other hand, but... at least I've never heard of them.&quot;</p>

<p>Although Miss Ming was in the kitchen, she seemed to have been paying attention to the conversation here. She and Miss Haruhime brought out the grilled fish and miso soup that Welf wanted to eat, and joined in the conversation at the same time.</p>

<p>After Miss Lyu, the most experienced adventurer, answered, Lily, who was born in Orario, closed her eyes and nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>&quot;After all, this is something Hermes-sama proposed without permission. It hasn't been decided yet, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right! Lily and we have nothing to gain, and we don't know what the gods of the &quot;school district&quot; are up to! Reject them, Bell-sama!&quot;</p>

<p>Welf's opinion is very correct, and Lily's statement also makes sense.</p>

<p>In fact, if this matter is decided, it will be done in secret without telling the guild.</p>

<p>Although I have just become a first-level adventurer, the guild will not let me idle just because of this.</p>

<p>&#8230;&#8230;but.</p>

<p>&quot;...What do you think, Lord Bell?&quot;</p>

<p>After setting the food, Ms. Liu and Ms. Ming sat down, and Ms. Haruhime, who was wearing a maid outfit, also sat down and looked at my face.</p>

<p>So does everyone else.</p>

<p>I looked up at the ceiling while accepting the gazes of Lily and the others, thinking about Kami-sama and the others who were probably talking to me right now.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha... you really bring us trouble time and time again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Hestia, didn't I explain it before? This is not troublesome.&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing the muttering of Hestia who was sitting on the bench, Hermes, who was also sitting on the opposite bench, waved his hands and said so.</p>

<p>&quot;The 'School District' is a garden of knowledge that travels around the entire lower world. Mr. Bell knows nothing about the outside world including Orario. For him, it must be an unprecedented excitement.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What I mean is, don't say it on the premise that you must promote his growth no matter what... Why do you want to let him be manipulated by God's will and let him do whatever he wants?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just gave him a chance. Besides, this will also be good for Bell-kun and Hestia.&quot;</p>

<p>Hestia, who was completely exhausted after her part-time job, just came back when she found Hermes coming to visit.</p>

<p>Although they brought him to the empty room on the second floor, Hestia's attitude still became a little casual due to fatigue. She first sighed, and then assumed a listening posture.</p>

<p>&quot;Bell-kun has become Level 5. And at an unprecedented speed. Now he is a genuine 'hero candidate'. Did the guild also urge you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Ah. Uranus called us over and talked about it before. He said he would let us take a short rest, and then we would work harder to explore the dungeon.&quot;</p>

<p>That was right after War Games ended. In the underground altar of the guild, Hestia and the old god once had such a conversation.</p>

<p>Ouranos thanked Bell and Hestia who were running around in the incident surrounding [Freya Familia] and expressed his condolences. At the same time, he also made a clear request to move forward. .</p>

<p>[Hestia Familia] took the &quot;Faction War&quot; as an opportunity - and decisively - to gain attention both inside and outside the city, and is now part of the &quot;wave of the times sweeping the lower realms&quot;.</p>

<p>The founding god of the guild said so.</p>

<p>&quot;The last of the &quot;Three Great Adventurer Commissions&quot; shouldered by the Labyrinth City. When the &quot;Black Dragon&quot; is defeated, Mr. Bell will definitely appear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For this reason, I hope he can also look outside the city (Orario), not just the underground labyrinth (dungeon). I hope he can expand and deepen his knowledge. After all, the Last Dragon is The town seat is outside Orario.&quot;</p>

<p>Although he didn't say it directly, Hermes no longer concealed his desire to make Bell a &quot;contemporary hero.&quot;</p>

<p>Half a year ago, Bell and his friends were killed in the &quot;middle level&quot; and when they formed the rescue team, he had already revealed a hint of interest in Bell. At that time, Hestia couldn't help but cast a reproachful look.</p>

<p>&quot;The world is hungry for heroes.&quot;</p>

<p>Hestia also knew what this sentence meant, however.</p>

<p>&quot;...You mean, the 'school district' is his so-called first step to expand his knowledge?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At least if you go there, you can understand most of the world's situation. It is much more efficient than traveling around the world with the God of Travel (me). - If you want to understand the current miserable situation in the lower world.&quot;</p>

<p>The atmosphere became a little heavier.</p>

<p>Hestia closed her mouth. At this moment, Hermes seemed to have the idea of &#8203;&#8203;giving it a try and spoke &quot;the truth&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;The most important thing is that there is another &quot;Lv. 7&quot;. I want Bell-kun to come into contact with him.&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing the words &quot;Lv. 7&quot;, Hestia showed her greatest surprise since this conversation.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides that fierce man, are there other Level 7s? And in the 'school district'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah. I hope 'he' can give Bell-kun some stimulation. He is an outstanding person who is called a 'modern hero'.&quot;</p>

<p>Hestia had just arrived from heaven not long ago, so she didn't know much about the situation in the lower world.</p>

<p>After learning that there was an &quot;exceptional&quot; person equal to that Otta, she was greatly shocked.</p>

<p>Moreover, he is a &quot;modern hero&quot;. If Bell knew about it, he would probably be so excited that his eyes would light up.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, this may be the last 'rest' for Bell-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Don't say such unlucky words.&quot;</p>

<p>After a while, Hestia seemed to be exhausted and finally replied.</p>

<p>However, that should be it.</p>

<p>Just as Hermes said, Orario was betting everything on the dragon's subjugation, and Belle could no longer escape.</p>

<p>The young man must survive in the inevitable violent turmoil from now on.</p>

<p>&quot;Becoming a first-level adventurer&quot; means standing at the center of the times.</p>

<p>&quot;But in the end, it all depends on Bell-kun's wishes. If he doesn't want to go, I won't force him.&quot;</p>

<p>He was so knowing and asking, Hestia gave him a sharp look.</p>

<p>Before bringing Hermes to this room, Hestia had listened to Bell's report on what happened today, and also asked about the boy's inner thoughts.</p>

<p>&quot;Well...after going to the &quot;School District&quot;, it would be a lie to say that I wasn't excited. &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;I've talked to Eina-san before, and I'm thinking that if I want to do something new, the most suitable time would be now. &#12303;</p>

<p>In the corridor where he and Hestia were the only two people, he uneasily and frankly revealed his thoughts.</p>

<p>&quot;If I can take a detour... I want to go to the &quot;school district&quot; to have a look. &#12303;</p>

<p>If it would cause trouble to the [Family], they would refuse, as the leader, Bell said.</p>

<p>Bell can no longer be a child, but if the time and place permit, she still hopes that Bell can maintain his childlike innocence. This is Hestia's true divine (parental) heart. And to be honest, I haven't had anything to worry about recently. Rather, she hoped that Bell could rest more and stay away from the dungeon.</p>

<p>Although he didn't realize it, Bear Cronney was becoming addicted to adventure.</p>

<p>When the day comes when his adventurer resume reads &quot;Special Skill: Labyrinth Raiders (Dungeon)&quot;, Hestia will surely sigh to the sky and change her job to the goddess of sorrow.</p>

<p>(Also, that Bell-kun is going to &quot;school&quot;... It's really emotional.)</p>

<p>Whether it is the main god from the perspective of a god (parent), or the one-pillar goddess who admires him.</p>

<p>Although it is very uncomfortable to follow Hermes' ideas, Bell has become a first-level adventurer, so he does need an &quot;accumulation period.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'School District'...what did Badr say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Allowing him to enroll is considered a 'quid pro quo'. He is allowed to enroll secretly, and the condition is that the 'problem children' over there are given to him to take care of. Mr. Bell doesn't know about this.&quot;</p>

<p>That is, the exchange of interests between both parties (Give&middot;and&middot;Take).</p>

<p>After hearing that there was a being as outrageous as that fierce one (Otta), she regarded the &quot;school district&quot; as a place similar to the incredible warrior group (Freya Familia). However...she knew very well about being the principal. of Baldr, and the godhead of other gods.</p>

<p>Putting Bale there won't do him any harm.</p>

<p>(It seems that I am the same, I still dote on my dependents (children) too much.)</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the emotion that a god (parent) who has children should have.</p>

<p>Hestia still looked at the smiling Hermes with her eyes half-open, sighed again, and decided to respect the child's opinion.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay. I agree with Bell-kun to study in the 'school district'.&quot;</p>

<p>again.</p>

<p>The moment I put on that &quot;uniform&quot;, my heart beat violently.</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha! It feels good, Bell-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it suits you very well.&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Hermes and Lord Balder praised me, but I blushed and felt embarrassed.</p>

<p>Three days after being invited to go to school in the &quot;school district&quot;, it was early morning.</p>

<p>After getting permission from Kami-sama and Lily, I rushed to the &quot;school district&quot; and changed my clothes in Tabadeel-sama's shrine in the center - or should I call it, the principal's office.</p>

<p>The white-based &quot;school district&quot; uniform is indeed very tasteful, and it's a bit unsettling for me who usually doesn't care about what I wear.</p>

<p>But now, what concerns me even more is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, I can't see clearly in front... Is it really okay with this 'appearance'?&quot;</p>

<p>I touched the &quot;brown bangs&quot; hanging down near my eyes over and over again and looked in the mirror.</p>

<p>The person standing in front of the bright mirror is not a white-haired human, but a &quot;brown-haired beastman&quot;.</p>

<p>The brown wig has long bunny ears, and there is a short fluffy tail behind the uniform pants.</p>

<p>Her bangs almost touched her eyes, making her crimson pupils looming.</p>

<p>After putting on the &quot;costume suit&quot; prepared by Lord Hermes, Bell Crane turned into a &quot;Bunnyman&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;After all, all the students in the school know about the commotion of the past few days. Now, as Bell Crowne, if you say 'I am a transfer student~', you will definitely get a blank look. Therefore, we have to implement &quot;Pretending to be someone other than Bell Crowne&quot; Battle&quot;!&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Hermes snapped his fingers, and I smiled twitchingly, observing myself in the mirror.</p>

<p>At first glance, no one would notice that I am &quot;Bell Cronny&quot;. This is said to be a special magic tool made by Ms. Asfi before - or rather an orc wig (cursed tool) that covers my features beautifully. It is said to have a mild cognitive impairment (curse) effect at no cost.</p>

<p>It wouldn't be clear if it was someone I had a close friendship with, but at least the students who were chasing me before wouldn't be able to tell... I hope so.</p>

<p>I did tell Kami-sama and the others that I wanted to go to the &quot;School District&quot;, but now, this deceptive behavior makes me feel bad, or a little guilty, in short, I feel very uncomfortable...</p>

<p>&quot;From today on, when you are in the 'School District', your name will be 'Lappy Flemish'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lappy Flemish...I-I know!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In your case, before returning to Orario's port, you passed the entrance exam in &quot;Belran City&quot;, but family reasons caused you to board the ship in the port town (Melian).&quot;</p>

<p>I chanted the new name &quot;Lappi&quot; over and over again, and suddenly became nervous. I don't know if he saw through my heart, but Lord Baldr showed a soft smile and put his index finger to his lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Please hide your identity and ability (power) well. If this matter is exposed, I, the principal, will also be severely punished.&quot;</p>

<p>His face still looked divine, but at the same time it felt a little naughty.</p>

<p>I always feel that Lord Badr seems to be enjoying this situation...</p>

<p>&quot;Then, let me greet you again... welcome, Bell. No, Lapi. You want to know what you can become, and the School District welcomes you.&quot;</p>

<p>Under the gaze of Lord Hermes, the male god smiled and put a crest on my left chest.</p>

<p>It was the school seal with the theme of light and a huge ship - the emblem of the &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p>It felt like beneath the glowing coat of arms, the tension and excitement naturally made my heart beat violently.</p>

<p>&quot;excuse me.&quot;</p>

<p>Just then, there was a gentle knock on the door.</p>

<p>Lord Badr said please come in, and then a man pushed open the ash wood door and walked in.</p>

<p>Lion-gold hair covering his neck. Same color pupils.</p>

<p>He is very tall and looks very slender at first glance, but his body does not give people the feeling of being unreliable at all.</p>

<p>The straight face, which is different from that of a fairy, gives the impression of being somewhere between powerful and beautiful.</p>

<p>He looks like he is in his late twenties.</p>

<p>He is a &quot;mature man&quot; who makes himself, a member of the same sex, think about &quot;this is the kind of person I want to be in the future.&quot;</p>

<p>The word &quot;beautiful man&quot; must be suitable to describe him, but how to put it, it doesn't feel like this.</p>

<p>The best way to describe him would be to be more single-minded and upright - such as &quot;knight&quot;.</p>

<p>(&mdash;&mdash;So strong.)</p>

<p>My eyes widened and I felt this subconsciously.</p>

<p>&quot;I told him everything about the situation. I think he is someone who can understand you and is also a special 'homeroom teacher'.&quot;</p>

<p>He nodded to Lord Balder and Lord Hermes who said this with a smile, and then walked up to me.</p>

<p>The sleeves, leather boots and left side of the trousers are engraved with sword-shaped gold crests.</p>

<p>In the leather holster on his right waist were several pieces of chalk and a pointer as slender as a short stick.</p>

<p>The man in black dress-like clothes&mdash;&mdash;a &quot;teacher&quot; uniform smiled and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Leon Wadenberg. Please give me your advice, Lappy.&quot;</p>

<p>I shook his hand back blankly. this day.</p>

<p>I entered the &quot;School District&quot; not as Bell Cronny, but as Lapi Fleming.</p>
