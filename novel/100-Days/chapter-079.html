<p>Study Session<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Two days after the battle between Sasha and Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, as usual, headed to the Adventurer's Guild to browse through requests.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Hijiri appeared and slapped Haise on the back with a loud bash.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Morning, Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Stop hitting me every time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Cold as ever, huh? It's been two days since we last saw each other."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri had fully recovered from her injuries thanks to Apollon's healing, but she took a break to rest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>During that time, the request to defeat Hijiri was withdrawn. Now, she’s here as just another adventurer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, Haise spoke with a hint of annoyance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Are you staying in the royal capital?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Of course. I still need to settle things with Sasha, and you're here too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t care either way."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then win. And then leave as soon as possible… That’s what Haise truly thought.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Honestly, Haise isn’t fond of Hijiri’s energy. It’s not the same as Mina’s; there’s a unique 'noisiness' that’s hard to accept. It’s not that Haise dislikes Hijiri. Her straightforward pursuit of strength is something to respect.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, I’ll leave being the strongest to you for now. I can still get stronger too, you know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, wait up!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Haise ignored her and started walking, Hijiri followed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Haise. You remember what’s happening today, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…The party, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yep. Sasha’s 'Congratulations on Clearing the Six Forbidden Dungeons Party'… Hehe, actually, I’ve been invited too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You too?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yup. Sasha said, 'Hijiri, I’ll invite you to the party too'. There’s a dress fitting at noon or something. It’s a hassle, but Presea won’t stop nagging me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Somehow, she’s become close with Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Apparently, she moved out of the inn the guild recommended and into the one where Presea is based. She even asked the innkeeper to put her in the room next to Presea’s.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She’s also gotten along with Sasha, and the day after their duel, she was casually hanging around the clan. Haise vaguely thought that Piasola would probably be in a bad mood about it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Are you taking any requests?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nah, nothing good today."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise never planned to take any requests from the start.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Today is Sasha’s party… He only came to the guild because he was bored.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After noon, he plans to change clothes and head to Clan Sacred in the royal capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, why don’t we take something? If you and I team up, even an SS-rank would be a piece of cake."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No thanks. I’m not interested in teaming up. You aren’t either, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, yeah. But with you, it might be okay… I could also gauge your strength."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s your real goal, isn’t it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Caught me, huh? Hey, you’re a Master-class, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see. Hey, I’ve been wondering, what’s a Master-class?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise looked at Hijiri with disbelief, as if he’d seen something unbelievable.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise took Hijiri to the Guild Master’s room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri sat on the sofa, gulped down the tea she was served, and munched on cookies.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise only sipped his tea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Haise mentioned the question Hijiri had asked Geist… Geist was genuinely shocked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hijiri. You… don’t know about abilities?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I only know that I can refine iron from dirt and stones. I remember people making a fuss when my ability was appraised, though."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Didn’t you hear any explanation back then?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm? I think they were rambling, but I didn’t pay attention. I only remember the name [Metal Master]."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Geist, don’t they explain abilities in West Country Uron? Even kids know about them…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm, hmm…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey!! Both Haise and old man Geist are treating me like an idiot, aren’t you?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri puffed up in anger.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist sighed and moved from his desk to the sofa.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…I’ll explain a bit."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eh? It’s a hassle, so don’t bother."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No, I must. It’s unacceptable for an S-rank adventurer to be so clueless about Master-class and abilities… Hijiri, there are adventurers who look up to you. Don’t let them down."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm… Fine, I’ll listen."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Then, I’ll leave."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No! You’re staying too!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? Hey, let go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist said, "Give up," and began speaking calmly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"First, what do you think abilities are?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t know. I remember having a vague sense of something when I was a kid, though…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Right. You know you 'have' an ability. And when you turn twelve, you can 'receive' it. In West Country Uron, there’s a church for the baptism, right? That’s where you first receive it and learn the name of your ability."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ooh… Now that you mention it, I think my grandma took me there."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri fell into thought. She seemed to recall something.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Abilities are divided into several categories."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s it! What’s a Master-class?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don’t rush. I’ll explain in order."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ability categories.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It’s said that 40% of the world’s population has abilities, and those who awaken to them are called Holders.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Over 80% of ability users become 'adventurers', challenging dungeons or working as mercenaries. However, not all abilities are combat-related.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Abilities are broadly divided into four categories:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>・Combat<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>・Production<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>・Recovery<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>・Special<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Combat abilities are the most common.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>First, there are magic abilities: [Fire Magic], [Water Magic], [Wind Magic], [Earth Magic], [Lightning Magic], etc. Next are abilities like [Body Enhancement] and enchantments. Rare combat abilities that combine these are called [Sage]. [Sage] abilities are extremely rare, with fewer than a hundred users worldwide.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Production abilities, as the name suggests, are for creating things.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Alchemy], [Tool Creation], [Potion Brewing], [Ether Refining], [Blacksmithing], etc. These abilities specialize in making everyday tools or recovery items.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Recovery abilities focus on healing or detoxifying the body.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Injury Recovery], [Detoxification], [Paralysis Recovery], [Petrification Recovery], [Disease Recovery], etc. Those who awaken to recovery abilities are obligated to join the church organization run by the Highbelk Kingdom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Special abilities encompass everything that doesn’t fit into the above categories.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin’s [Sure Hit] is often thought of as a combat ability, but it’s technically classified as a special ability. Cres’s [Doppelganger] and Presea’s [Spirit Summoning] are also special abilities.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see. So what about my [Metal Master]?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yours is a production ability."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Really… I was hoping for a combat one. So, what’s a Master-class?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Master-class abilities are particularly powerful abilities within the four categories. There are four in each category, totaling sixteen Master-class abilities. Those who possess them are extremely rare."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hohoho… I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Though the number sixteen might not be exact. There could be unconfirmed Master-class abilities out there."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wow… That’s amazing."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, that’s the gist of it. If you want to know more, check the guild’s archives."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nah, I’m good."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri immediately declined.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise yawned and stood up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, I’m heading back."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, me too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The two left the room and exited the guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Abilities are complicated, huh…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Was there anything complicated about that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ve never studied this stuff. Anyway, thanks for the info. See you at the party!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri quickly ran off.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It turned into an unexpected study session. Haise stretched and started walking back to the inn.</p>
