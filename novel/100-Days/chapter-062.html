<p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths Conqueror Party<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Presea were riding in a carriage.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Of course, they weren’t alone. Being a carriage from the Adventurers’ Guild, Geist and Mina were with them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, seemingly not in the mood, stared blankly outside.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Do you really not want to go that much?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well… yeah. I don’t really want to deal with nobles.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m a former royal, though.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Former, right?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...True. So, that’s fine now, isn’t it?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wait, Presea-san, you were royalty!?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Former, yes.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise glanced at Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She wasn’t in her usual adventurer attire. Being a former royal, she was clearly accustomed to wearing dresses like this.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The difference in aura compared to someone of common birth, like Haise, was apparent. Geist, for his part, looked perfectly composed, as though it were natural for him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina, however, fidgeted like a child, kicking her legs restlessly and unable to settle down.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Mina, stop kicking your legs. Act like a proper lady.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Okayyy. But hey, I’m a blossoming sixteen-year-old, you know? A maiden, you know? This is my first party, and… oh, what if a handsome nobleman talks to me?! Hey, hey, Haise-san!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...What’s with that dry laugh?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The carriage arrived at the venue at Heiberg Royal Castle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had been here once before when he was appointed as an S-rank adventurer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While Geist chastised an excited Mina, Haise stepped out of the carriage. Presea then fixed her gaze on him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What is it?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Did you forget I’m your partner?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...Ah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He had completely forgotten.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Realizing this was disrespectful, Haise awkwardly extended his hand. Presea chuckled softly and took it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Thank you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...I don’t really get formalities, so cut me some slack.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Of course. But you’re doing quite well.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just then, another carriage arrived, bearing the emblem of Clan Sacred.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Out stepped Sasha, with her partner Reynold. Tycoon also exited and escorted Robin. Piasora muttered, “I wanted to escort Sasha…” and descended alone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha took Reynold’s arm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...Ah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She then caught sight of Haise walking ahead, arm in arm with Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah, sorry, Reynold.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. Stay focused.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha took a deep breath and began walking toward the venue alongside Reynold.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Haise entered the hall, he was met with thunderous applause.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“S-rank adventurer Dark Stalker Haise has arrived!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This announcement, likely from the host, drew even more cheers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The hall was filled with gentlemen and ladies in elegant attire. But there were also rugged men unaccustomed to formal wear and muscular women in dresses. Likely, they were the invited adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise offered a slight bow and entered the hall. Sasha, Reynold, Tycoon, and the others followed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the far end of the room sat the king on a luxurious throne, flanked by Prince Chris and Princess Mione.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and the others approached and knelt before the king.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Raise your heads.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When they obeyed, the king greeted them with a warm smile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise, Sasha, and your companions, your achievement of conquering the Forbidden Six Labyrinths is truly astonishing. Congratulations.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“‘We are most honored.’”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Sasha spoke in unison as Reynold and the others bowed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise, you slew the Yamata no Orochi, correct? The sword and armor crafted from its materials will be passed down through the royal family. While I could offer platinum coins as compensation, you already possess significant wealth. Thus, I will grant you a title instead.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“W-What…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was shocked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A title would only bring complications, he thought, but the king continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah, worry not. It’s not the kind of title that requires you to govern land as a noble. That would be too burdensome for you at present. Thus, I bestow upon you the Heiberg Celestial Rank.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...I-I am most honored.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Celestial Rank? Haise was puzzled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Noble titles were supposed to follow the order of duke, marquis, count, viscount, and baron.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A glance at the other nobles revealed their stunned expressions.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“In time, I shall grant you land as well—a place where you can enjoy a peaceful retirement once you decide to leave adventuring behind.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I-I am most honored…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise hadn’t anticipated this.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Yamata no Orochi’s severed head, presented as proof of its defeat, had transformed into an unfamiliar title and the promise of retirement land.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Next, the king addressed Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha, the miraculous rainbow stone you offered was remarkable. Combined with the Yamata no Orochi’s materials, it will create the finest sword and armor.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“As a reward, I hear your clan received over 500 membership requests. I grant you land on the outskirts of the capital for Clan Sacred’s headquarters. It shall be designed to accommodate 1,000 adventurer teams under your banner. The current headquarters in the capital will serve as your city branch.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I-I am most honored.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha barely managed to speak.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold, Tycoon, Robin, and Piasora trembled with awe.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Land exclusively for a clan? Aside from the Four Great Clans, none possessed such a thing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The king instructed his chancellor Bonnet to proceed with the arrangements. Bowing, Bonnet exited the hall to handle the matter swiftly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This concludes the formalities. Now, let us celebrate! Everyone, raise your glasses!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With the king’s toast, the party officially began.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise reunited with Presea and Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As the festivities commenced, young women stared at Haise, but none dared approach. Presea clung to his arm, ensuring it stayed that way.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Conscious of Presea’s softness, Haise tried to focus as he addressed Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Um, Geist-san.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah, Haise. I must admit, I’m impressed you received the Celestial Rank.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah, but… what is that exactly?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist folded his arms, pondering.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Simply put, it’s a ‘ducal title without land or a mansion’. In the Heiberg Kingdom, there are four noble houses with ducal titles, but your rank surpasses theirs. However, it’s non-hereditary. Even if you marry and have children, they won’t inherit the title.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see… And this is a reward? It feels kind of… odd.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Fool. The king was preempting any trouble. You conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, but you’re still an S-rank adventurer. High-ranking nobles might try to control you or monopolize your talents. You’d refuse, but noble requests aren’t so easily declined—unless you’re leading a clan like Sasha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...I didn’t realize.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“By granting you the Celestial Rank, the king ensured high-ranking nobles couldn’t make demands of you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“So that’s why…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise glanced at the king, who met his gaze and slyly winked, swirling his glass.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Barbaros, you sly devil… He’s playing games,” Geist chuckled wryly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Realizing the king’s intentions, Haise sighed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Then I can keep living as I have and take on requests?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes. Though you might want to move into a better inn.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Haise contemplated, the orchestra began to play, signaling the start of the dance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea pulled Haise’s arm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s time for the first dance.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...Got it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stepped forward with Presea for the dance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha and Reynold followed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For a moment, Haise and Sasha’s eyes met.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Haise quietly averted his gaze.</p>
