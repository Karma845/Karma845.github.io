<p>Guidance Complete<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That concludes today’s training.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“““““Thank you very much!!”””””<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The training ended, and all the students bowed their heads in unison.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and the others’ adventurer guidance was over.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha smiled, Geist nodded, Hijiri pumped her fist, and Haise wore an indescribable expression.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As for the mock battle results… Haise was the only one who lost his armband.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The students who faced Sasha seemed satisfied, the ones who faced Geist had the girls strangely swooning, those who fought Hijiri were utterly wrecked, and the adventurer who sparred with Haise was exhilarated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They returned to the academy, exchanged farewells, and Haise’s group headed back to their lodgings.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After dinner, they all went to a bar with private rooms.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That was so fun!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri said excitedly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, she glanced at Haise and smirked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You were the only one who lost your armband, huh? Heheh, maybe you should give up that ‘strongest’ title.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…………”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise silently sipped his cocktail.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, trying to change the subject, spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Whether it was fun or not aside… it seems the students learned a lot.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Miko, was it?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Geist… you were watching?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. The girl with the [Paladin] ability, right? I thought her slender arms couldn’t handle a greatsword… but you showed her a new path.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes. After the fight, Miko came to thank me. She said she’ll focus on spears and horseback riding from now on.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm. I see.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“And… Sain. That boy decided to become a Strategist without relying on his abilities.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sain? The glasses kid?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise spoke, and Sasha nodded with a “Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Strategist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A specialist who devises dungeon strategies based on intel. They analyze monsters, terrain, traps, and tailor party compositions, gear, and items accordingly—a crucial role.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Major clans always have a few. In Sasha’s clan, Tycoon doubled as their Strategist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I told him if his family ever disowns him, he’s welcome in our clan. That kid’s sharp. He’ll bloom into a fine strategist.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha looked somewhat pleased.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise watched her as he tilted his glass.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With their temporary instructor duties in AdAd over, the conversation naturally shifted to the Graveyard of Ruin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist addressed the group.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Right… we’ve been granted permission to enter the Graveyard of Ruin.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>““!!””<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ooh, it’s finally happening! Heheh, wonder what kinda monsters are in there.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri’s eyes gleamed with battle lust.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Actually, today, the guild relayed a message to me. Seems the king smoothed things over.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist downed his brandy in one go. Even while drinking, his sharp expression never wavered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Tomorrow, we’ll head to the Seifert Knights and meet Crossfald.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“W-wait, to the Sword Saint’s place?!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. The Seifert Knights oversee the key to the Graveyard of Ruin.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Huh? Sasha, didn’t you already visit them?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…I did, but couldn’t meet him. Some urgent business came up, apparently.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha slumped.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist laughed. “Hahaha,” then added:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Priscia, what about you? The academy assistant job’s done, so you’re free to leave.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Of course I’m going.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Good. Then, the team heading to the Graveyard of Ruin is Sasha’s group ‘Sacred,’ plus Haise, Priscia, and Hijiri.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Old man Geist, what about you?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Heh, I’m too old to tag along. I’ll handle post-op in AdAd. Mina’s assisting.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Got it!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Geist. Tomorrow, you said…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. Reynold’s group arrived in town this morning. They’re resting after resupplying.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see… alright.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha straightened her expression—but Geist cut in, “Save the reunion for tomorrow.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise set down his glass, placed a gold coin on the table, and stood.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Thanks for the meal. I’m turning in.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, he left for the inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist picked up the coin and sighed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Tch… I was gonna treat everyone.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Very like Haise.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes!! Hey, hey, if there’s extra gold, can we order more?!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise’s the best!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…You two, have some restraint.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri and Mina eagerly scanned the menu for more drinks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Night. Haise was alone in his room, reading an ancient text, when a knock came.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He opened the door to find Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sorry for the late visit.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s fine…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was in sleepwear.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Having returned from the bar and showered, she carried a sweet fragrance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her hair was down, no accessories, no armor or sword—just Sasha as she was.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her thin nightwear left her collar slightly loose, revealing a hint of cleavage.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise averted his gaze.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What’s up?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Just… tomorrow. Mind if I come in?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Sure.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He let her inside.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Offering her the sofa, he retrieved a pot from his item box—the herbal tea he’d brewed during their last camp.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Since he’d stored it boiling-hot, it was still steaming.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He poured her a cup.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Here. It’s good after drinking… helps with the smell.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Thanks—…mm, delicious.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise drank too.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The tea was mildly sweet, crisp, and soothing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A recommendation from Hermine, the owner of his usual bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“So, what’s the matter?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Right. Tomorrow, we’re meeting Reynold’s group, but…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…I won’t pick fights with Piasora. I know.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. And… regarding the Graveyard, Tycoon’s probably set some strategies. I’m sure you have your own thoughts, but…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha, let’s be clear.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise met her eyes squarely.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m just a ‘follower.’ I won’t interfere with you, and you don’t interfere with me. One thing’s certain—commands and plans are for ‘comrades.’ I’m not yours. If your strategy hinges on me, rethink it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Figured you’d say that.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Glad we agree. We’re just headed the same way—”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha drained her tea and stood.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Tomorrow, we’ll regroup with Reynold, then head to the Seifert Knights. We’ll discuss plans after.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You should worry more about Hijiri and Priscia than me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hijiri said, like you, ‘Let me do what I want.’ Priscia agreed to cooperate with our plans.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…That’s all. Sorry for bothering you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the door, Sasha paused.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…………Haise.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hm?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well… good night.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah, good night.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha smiled and left.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She seemed happy he’d returned the farewell.</p>
