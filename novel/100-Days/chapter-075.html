<p>Heracles 6<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The guild carriage carrying Sasha was heading towards the Overlook Wilderness.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside the carriage, Sasha was alone. Arms crossed, eyes closed, focusing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Soon, the battle would begin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not as an adventurer fighting magical beasts. This time, her opponents would be humans. And formidable ones at that.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha remained silent, swaying with the carriage.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She calmly reflected.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>S-rank adventurer Heracles Hijiri. At first glance, Sasha recognized Hijiri as a "powerful foe". Likely, an equal match for Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Throughout her adventurer career, Sasha had fought and even killed humans.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her first opponents were bandits and thieves.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This was back when Haise was still with Sacred. They happened upon a village under attack by bandits while on a quest, and Sasha fought to protect herself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her first human combat. She still remembers her hands trembling, her teeth chattering.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But───seeing a little girl's father cut down before her eyes, Sasha snapped.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She couldn't remain calm like she does now.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She unleashed her full power as a [Sword Master].<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Blood splattered, flesh and screams flew. When she realized the screams were from the bandits... it was all over.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After taking a human life for the first time, Sasha couldn't eat properly for a week.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Nostalgic."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was because Haise was by her side that she managed to recover.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Back then, Haise had always been there for Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Haise is no longer here.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Likely, the fight with Hijiri will be a battle to the death.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Sasha was smiling.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Some part of her was looking forward to it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is also me..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then───...the carriage stopped.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The door opened, and Sasha stepped out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>About ten meters ahead, Hijiri emerged from another carriage.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You came, Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What she felt was fighting spirit.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her expression was different. The childish air was gone, replaced by the eyes of a beast hungry for battle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was the same.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You are one of the walls I must overcome to become the strongest. Next is Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry, but... I'm not a wall you can easily climb over."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha and Hijiri both wore the smiles of hungry beasts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>About an hour before Sasha and Hijiri arrived.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, the members of Team Sacred, the Heiberg royals Cress and Myuane, and their four knight guards had already arrived at the Overlook Wilderness.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, the last to arrive, greeted Geist, who was already there.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good morning, Geist. You're early."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. I got here yesterday and took care of the magical beasts in the area. I gave them a good scare, so beasts below S-rank won't come near."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"R-really... You're as amazing as ever."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A little further away, Reynold and the others were gathered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Beyond them was a tent bearing the Crest of the Heiberg royal family.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just now, Haise noticed Cress and Myuane laughing together with Reynold and the others.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not wanting to bother with greetings, Haise avoided eye contact.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then───it... arrived.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ohhhh~!! You must be Haise-chan!! Mmm, what a fine man~!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wha!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise almost instinctively drew Desert Eagle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Geist approached.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Apollon, don't startle him."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Gei-chan!! Nfufufufu~, isn't it fine? A fine man is vitality!! Energy, you know!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………Uh, um..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, let me introduce you. This is Apollon. S-rank adventurer Panacea Apollon... Ah, despite appearances, she's the top healer among S-rank adventurers."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nfufu~n, nice to meet you~n!! Mwah!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eek!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise leaped back with all his might as Apollon tried to kiss him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>S-rank adventurer Panacea Apollon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She wore a pure white nun's habit adorned with golden embroidery and held a staff glittering with embedded gems.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But... for some reason. Apollon was unmistakably male. His body was a mass of muscles, the nun's habit straining to contain him, on the verge of tearing. His face was rugged, and he had no hair, but his scalp was tattooed with a flame pattern. His ears were pierced with numerous earrings, his face adorned with flashy makeup, and his bright red lipstick was impossible to miss.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was genuinely puzzled. He even wondered if Apollon was a new species of humanoid magical beast.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah... I get that you're confused, but think of him as a 'man with the heart of a woman'."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No!! Not a woman, but a maiden!! A maiden's heart in a girl's body!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Apollon's deep voice contrasted with her girlish demeanor as she swayed her hips and approached Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was nothing short of suspicious.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist let out a heavy sigh.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise. Despite appearances, Apollon is a cardinal of the 'Church' and holds the power of the [Saint King], who commands all [Saint]. Look, Piasora's turning pale."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, really."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora was hiding behind Reynold's shadow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Pale, avoiding eye contact.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The Church, right? I only know that Piasora was part of it... So the top of the Church is an adventurer, and... quite the character. Why an adventurer?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Because I'm 'free', you see~. Ufufu."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not understanding, Haise decided to let it go.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>All Haise knew was that when a healer's abilities were identified, they were obligated to report to and join the Church.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Apollon was the head of the Church.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not understanding and not wanting to, Haise decided not to dwell on it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Anyway, you don't need to worry about injuries. With Apollon here, even if someone dies, they can be revived within a day."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"R-really? That's amazing..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's not amazing."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then───Apollon suddenly turned serious, gently touching Haise's right eye... the eyepatch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'm sorry..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Apollon."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's fine. Gei-chan..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist sighed again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Apollon spoke apologetically to Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"When you lost your right eye, Gei-chan contacted me. He asked me to heal your wounds... but I couldn't make it in time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Within a day, even if you lose a limb, or your body below the neck, or are just a head, or even a single finger, I can revive you. But... after a day, it's impossible. I... couldn't make it in time to heal you. I was outside the capital, and by the time I got the message, more than a day had passed..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I owe Gei-chan a lot. I would do anything for him. But... I couldn't do anything."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Apollon, that's enough."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist patted Apollon's shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I didn't call you here to make you feel regret. If Sasha and Hijiri get injured in today's duel, heal them without a scratch."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Okay!! I'll do my best!! I love you, Gei-chan!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Stop that. Haise, sorry... Let's leave it at that for now."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, I don't mind. Besides, I've gotten used to not having my right eye."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They didn't discuss it further.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, two carriages arrived.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Stepping out were Sasha and Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, let's go, Haise, Apollon. We have a job as witnesses."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yess~!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Understood."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The duel was about to begin.</p>
