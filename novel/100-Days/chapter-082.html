<p><p>Extra Chapter thanks to rvlast on Ko-Fi<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Forbidden Six Labyrinths・Congratulations Party for Clearing 3</p><p><br><br></p><p>Even now, Haise couldn't help but feel a certain way about the fact that the official name of this party was ‘Forbidden Six Labyrinths・Congratulations Party for Clearing’. It was immediately clear who had come up with it... it had to be Robin.</p><p>In a corner of the venue, Haise drank wine alone.</p><p>He kept his presence low, so few noticed him. Hijiri and Presea, who had come with him, were chatting with Robin and enjoying the food.</p><p>Geist was also chatting amiably with Apollon and the king, while Ibis was reminiscing with her companions.</p><p>Reynold was surrounded by noble ladies, Tycoon by scholarly nobles, and Piasora stood behind Sasha, glaring to keep men at bay.</p><p>Haise stepped out onto the balcony.</p><p>"...Maybe I should go home."</p><p>He had shown his face.</p><p>He hadn't greeted anyone, but it was probably too late to greet Sasha now.</p><p>He might have some complaints about Hijiri being egged on, but it didn't feel urgent.</p><p>He finished his wine and placed the glass on the balcony table.</p><p>He decided to leave and walked out of the party venue.</p><p>"Leaving already?"</p><p>Then, outside the venue, Sasha stopped him.</p><p>Turning around, he saw her holding her hair, smiling happily.</p><p>"Yeah. I've done my duty by Robin."</p><p>"I see..."</p><p>"See you."</p><p>As he waved and started to walk away, Sasha quickly moved ahead of him.</p><p>"Wait. Don't you have something to say to me?"</p><p>"Uh... yeah, well."</p><p>"Come here."</p><p>Grabbed by the sleeve by Sasha, he was led not back to the party venue but to Clanhome.</p><p>They climbed the stairs, walked down the hallway, and entered a door a little further ahead.</p><p>"...What is this place?"</p><p>"My private room."</p><p>"Eh..."</p><p>"You're the first man I've brought here."</p><p>It was a simple room.</p><p>A large bed, curtains, a table, chairs, a sofa, a desk, a bookshelf, a closet. All were simple and unadorned. The only decoration was a vase by the window.</p><p>Sasha took out wine from the cupboard and two glasses.</p><p>"Care to have a drink?"</p><p>"...What are you planning?"</p><p>"Nothing. I just feel like drinking with you."</p><p>"Well, alright."</p><p>Somehow, Haise agreed.</p><p>He sat on the chair, and Sasha poured red wine into his glass.</p><p>"Is it okay to sneak out?"</p><p>"I told them I was fixing my makeup. I didn't know... but apparently, women's makeup takes time."</p><p>"What's that about?"</p><p>Haise took the glass, and Sasha clinked hers against his.</p><p>Ting... the glasses resonated.</p><p>After a sip, he realized it was high-quality red wine.</p><p>"Haise. Why did you egg Hijiri on?"</p><p>"...I don't know. I thought it'd be better if you did it than me."</p><p>"Intuition, huh? Reynold and Piasora were angry, but in the end, I gained something from it. For that, I thank you."</p><p>"...Yeah."</p><p>"But egging her on is a different story. You pitted two S-rank adventurers against each other, and it could be seen as trying to trap me... If I reported it to the guild, you'd be punished."</p><p>"........"</p><p>Indeed, that was true.</p><p>When Haise accepted Hijiri's challenge, ignoring it or taking it himself would have been fine. But egging on another S-rank adventurer, Sasha, was problematic.</p><p>Haise put down his glass.</p><p>"That's true... so, what are you going to do?"</p><p>"...I have a request."</p><p>"For me?"</p><p>"Yes. To be precise, I want you to accept a joint request with Team Sacred. In exchange, we'll forget about this incident."</p><p>"A joint request with Team Sacred? Does Reynold know?"</p><p>"No, not yet. I'll explain it to them."</p><p>"Hey, hey..."</p><p>Haise was genuinely troubled.</p><p>He never expected to end up taking on a request alongside Team Sacred.</p><p>But Haise said:</p><p>"I don't need to accompany them. I'll take the request alone."</p><p>"That won't do. This request is a confidential one from the royal family... I'm telling you because it's you. The request is about investigating the Forbidden Six Labyrinths."</p><p>"Wha!?"</p><p>Haise's eyes widened.</p><p>The Forbidden Six Labyrinths. Three remain. One of them is hinted at by Sasha.</p><p>Sasha drank her wine.</p><p>"Haa... What will you do? This time, it's not about the labyrinths themselves, but information related to them."</p><p>"...Alright. Let's do it together."</p><p>"Good. Hehe... It's been years since we worked together."</p><p>"Maybe."</p><p>Haise finished his wine and put down the glass.</p><p>"Submit the request as a designated request to the guild."</p><p>"Got it. It'll take a few days, so wait in the royal capital."</p><p>"Alright. Anything else?"</p><p>"...Not really."</p><p>"Then, I'm leaving."</p><p>As Haise was about to leave the room, Sasha stood up.</p><p>"Haise."</p><p>"..."</p><p>"Um..."</p><p>"...That dress suits you."</p><p>Haise muttered and left the room.</p><p>"...───~~~~"</p><p>Sasha turned bright red and poured herself another glass of wine, downing it in one go.</p><p>◇◇◇◇◇◇</p><p>Regretting saying something so out of character, Haise returned to the party venue.</p><p>Just as he was about to step inside... he saw only familiar faces.</p><p>Presea, Hijiri. Reynold and the others. Ibis, Balgan. Other familiar adventurers, and even Cress and Myuane.</p><p>Haise didn't enter the venue but sat on a small bench outside.</p><p>"...Sigh."</p><p>He was supposed to be aiming to be the strongest alone, but now he was surrounded by acquaintances.</p><p>Sasha must have several times more connections than him.</p><p>Casually looking up at the night sky, he heard:</p><p>"Can I say this... Haise, you're a man who suits being alone."</p><p>"Huh... Ah, Your Majesty!?"</p><p>Haise stood up and knelt.</p><p>His Majesty the King───Barbaros gestured for Haise to rise and then sat on the bench Haise had been on, patting the spot next to him.</p><p>Sitting next to the king───Haise was about to protest, but the king's gentle smile left him speechless.</p><p>As Haise sat down, Barbaros also looked up at the sky.</p><p>"Beautiful night, isn't it?"</p><p>"Y-Yes."</p><p>A king of a nation, sitting next to him.</p><p>Haise scanned the surroundings, but there was no sign of any hidden guards.</p><p>"No guards. Hehe, my son's ability has fooled you."</p><p>"Eh..."</p><p>"Besides, if there were any troublemakers, you'd be here."</p><p>"...Thank you."</p><p>Haise was nervous.</p><p>But the king's carefree smile slowly eased his tension.</p><p>"Sasha told you, didn't she?"</p><p>"...About the information on the Forbidden Six Labyrinths?"</p><p>"Yes. A map marking the location where one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, The Aerial Fortress Drena de Stal, appeared."</p><p>"!!"</p><p>Haise's eyes widened.</p><p>The Forbidden Six Labyrinths, The Aerial Fortress Drena de Stal... A legendary dungeon that appeared somewhere in the human world thousands of years ago, luring many adventurers.</p><p>It appeared in the sky, landed on the ground, and many adventurers entered the sky castle. And then... not a single one returned.</p><p>Now, its location and what happened afterward are unknown. Haise's ancient texts have no such records.</p><p>"In the past, there was one. An adventurer who tried to challenge the sky castle but gave up. He didn't enter even when it appeared. That adventurer accurately marked the location of the sky castle on a map and tracked its floating path, marking it on the map. Then, he disappeared, still holding that map..."</p><p>"...Where is that map?"</p><p>"Far north from here. In the SSS-class dungeon, the Graveyard of Ruin, one of the most dangerous areas in the human world outside the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. The map is in its deepest part."</p><p>"How do you know that?"</p><p>"Hehe, it's natural to doubt. This is truly a coincidence, but the map marking the sky castle's path... let's call it the sky castle map. The descendant of that adventurer found a letter left by the adventurer to his wife in her grave. That's how we learned of the map's existence... Well, we don't know if the letter is genuine or if such a map really exists."</p><p>"..."</p><p>"But it's a clue."</p><p>Haise had unconsciously stood up.</p><p>"Haise. It's fine if you want to do it alone. But... this is an order from your king. Cooperate with Clan Sacred and conquer the SSS-class dungeon, the Graveyard of Ruin."</p><p>"...Understood. But..."</p><p>"Not as comrades, but as fellow travelers... right? And, I have one more request for you."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Haise listened to the 'king's request' and agreed.</p></p>
