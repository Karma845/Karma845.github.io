<p>Awkward Dance<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Long ago, Haise learned how to dance from Geist. The idea was that if he made a name for himself as an adventurer, he might be invited to a royal party.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And if that happened, he didn’t want to embarrass himself if someone asked him to dance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though years had passed, Haise and Sasha still remembered the steps.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea, being former royalty, and Reynold, who claimed it was "a gentleman’s duty," also knew how to dance. To the music, the four of them stepped in rhythm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Not bad."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea said with a smile as she danced with Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise smiled faintly in return.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Surprisingly, I still remember it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He glanced over at Sasha, who was dancing in sync with Reynold’s steps. She didn’t seem awkward at all, moving fluidly with him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, you’re doing great."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s because Reynold is matching me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold chuckled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh, it’s only natural for a man to match a woman."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The song changed, and so did the steps.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Other nobles began joining the dance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After the second song, Haise and Sasha finished dancing and stepped away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise grabbed a glass of water from a server and handed it to Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thanks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea took the glass and lightly clinked it against Haise’s. After taking a sip, she said.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re being targeted."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Look. The noble ladies are glaring at me and giving you heated looks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Scary."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Do you not have any interest in girls? You seemed interested when you saw me naked."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don’t be ridiculous. I’m just not in the mood for that right now."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm. So when are you in the mood?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Who knows?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise finished his water and set the glass down.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While Presea was drinking, he distanced himself, and she was quickly surrounded—by adventurers with strong builds, noble sons, and others vying for her attention.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Beautiful lady, may I have this dance?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’d love the chance to dance with someone as stunning as you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Please, take my hand..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea ignored them completely, but the crowd was too thick for her to reach Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, meanwhile, slipped behind a group of middle-aged nobles chatting and made his way out of the party hall.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The atmosphere had become stifling, and he needed to take a deep breath.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Oh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Outside the party hall, near a small fountain, stood a silver-haired girl.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her elegant silver dress left her shoulders bare, and it might have been his imagination, but Sasha, whom he hadn’t seen in half a year, seemed to have grown a little taller.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh, what are you doing out here alone?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I could ask you the same. Where’s Reynold?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"He’s stuck dancing with noble ladies who won’t take no for an answer. I slipped away to get some air... You too?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah... But if I’m bothering you, I can go somewhere else."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha stopped him. "Want to talk for a bit?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Sure."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise sat down on the bench next to Sasha. It felt natural, as if no time had passed since they last sat side by side. There was no awkwardness, just the familiarity of old friends.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""…………""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The two sat in silence, their closeness making the quiet feel heavier. Finally, Sasha spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise... Congratulations on conquering the Forbidden Six Labyrinths."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thanks... You too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Silence fell again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This time, Haise broke it. "Oh, just so you know, it’s only fair to tell you. When I fought a demon in the deepest part of the Delmadrome Labyrinth, it said that of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, one is in the demon realm, and the other three are in the human world."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"R-really?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. You’ve already cleared the Dilloromance Great Salt Lake, so there are three left..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, right... Um, Haise, congratulations on your title."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thanks... And congratulations on your territory..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""…………""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The conversation was a mess. Haise covered his face, and Sasha turned away, fiddling with her hair. There was no denying it—both of them were feeling unusually embarrassed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Yeah?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We’ve both become adventurers who’ve conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The conversation lapsed again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But... it wasn’t a bad silence. The music from the party hall flowed between them, filling the quiet.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Sasha stood up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise. The music’s still playing... Want to dance?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just for now. Not as childhood friends, not as former teammates, but as fellow adventurers who’ve conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths... I’m asking you to dance."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha reached out her hand. Haise stood up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was a strange feeling. Haise hadn’t fully forgiven Sasha yet. As fellow adventurers striving for greatness, he respected her. But the betrayal, the false information that cost him his right eye and nearly his life—he hadn’t fully let that go.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And yet, here she was, asking him to dance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Under the shining moon and starlit sky, Sasha looked like a goddess. Her beautiful dress, her silver hair, her hand reaching out to him—it was enchanting.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Maybe, just for now, he could let himself be swept up in this sweet dream.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise took her hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m pretty bad at this, you know?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don’t worry, so am I... I almost stepped on Reynold’s feet a few times."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The music that began to play was a waltz. To the rhythm, Haise and Sasha began to dance. It was a slow, gentle waltz, their eyes locked as they moved in quiet steps.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, you’re not bad."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don’t tease me. You’re better, Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The song was easy, perhaps meant for beginners. As it neared its end, Sasha stumbled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Whoa—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She fell into Haise’s chest. They stared at each other, closer than they’d been in years. Haise’s eyes traced Sasha’s face, her lips. Sasha met his gaze.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""…………""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Time seemed to stop.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was still in Haise’s arms, her chest pressed against his.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Sa—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Sasha, where are you?! Hey!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold’s voice broke the moment, and Sasha and Haise quickly pulled apart.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise spoke first.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ll head back first. Uh... see you later."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yeah... Later."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Promising to meet again, Haise slipped back into the party hall from the opposite direction, avoiding Reynold.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea finally managed to escape the crowd. Through her connection with her spirit, she had seen Haise dancing with Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then they had gotten dangerously close—close enough to kiss.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........No."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just then, Reynold appeared, and the two separated. As Haise hurried back into the party hall, Presea approached him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Ugh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Whoa, hey?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Idiot."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re my partner, aren’t you? Don’t leave me behind."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"R-right... Sorry."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Idiot."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea clung to Haise’s arm. The last "idiot" sounded strangely lonely to Haise.</p>
