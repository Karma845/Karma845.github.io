<h2>Prologue: Story from the Sea</h2>

<p>&quot;It was so awesome!!&quot; Missia shouted.</p>

<p>She shouted the cheers that Eina had heard so many times, and the volume was surprisingly loud.</p>

<p>&quot;The war game between [Hestia Familia] and [Freya Familia]! It's really~~~~, so awesome!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mi, Micia, keep your voice down...&quot;</p>

<p>The adventurers went into the dungeon, and it was an afternoon when fewer people visited the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot;.</p>

<p>In the office next to the reception window, Eina, who was sorting documents at her desk, stopped and tried to stop her noisy colleague Missia Flot, but she still failed.</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter, everyone is nodding! After all, it's just that powerful!&quot;</p>

<p>If you look around, you will find that both the other guild staff and the receptionist are nodding their heads as Missia said. Whenever they have free time, they are all discussing the same topic.</p>

<p>This topic is the &quot;War Game&quot; that was held just five days ago.</p>

<p>Known as the &quot;Faction War&quot;, it is the battle of the century between the faction alliance and the strongest faction (Freya Familia).</p>

<p>&quot;No matter which scene you watch, it's extremely powerful, and all the first-level adventurers are unreasonably strong! What's more, Brother-kun and the others even defeated that [fierce man]!&quot;</p>

<p>Missia shook her peachy hair and danced around like a child.</p>

<p>She has been like this since watching that amazing battle.</p>

<p>And it seems that she still hasn't gotten rid of her excitement. She was looking back at the scene at that time and kept talking.</p>

<p>&quot;[Half Wind] started rushing to rescue, bang bang&mdash;&mdash;!! Like this!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The behavior of [White Demon Wand] scared me, but it was so exciting!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;[The Fierce One] is simply too strong!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, my brother-kun is still the most handsome~!&quot;</p>

<p>Wait, wait, thoughts.</p>

<p>Eina can understand Missia's mood.</p>

<p>In fact, many adventurers and residents are now discussing the fierce battle. Perhaps this is also the case in many countries outside the city.</p>

<p>Defeating that [Freya Familia], this great achievement is worthy of people's enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Eina also understands.</p>

<p>Although I understand, but.</p>

<p>&quot;Brother-kun is so active, isn't Eina proud of you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's no point in being proud...I didn't do anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No way~!! With this result, the salary of Eina, who is in charge of my younger brother-kun, will definitely increase! I'm so envious~!&quot;</p>

<p>Without any malice, Misia even began to praise Eina lavishly.</p>

<p>The other receptionists also said something like &quot;Oh, it means standing out!&quot; and teased her with praise.</p>

<p>Eina's only response was a wry smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't have the heart to be happy at that time, nor did I have the heart to cheer him on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eina...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even now, I wonder if I will wake up and find that everything before was a dream, and feel scared, or uneasy... In short, that's how I feel.&quot;</p>

<p>This is what she means.</p>

<p>The adventurer Eina was responsible for was the one at the center of a series of commotions. Until the &quot;Faction War&quot;, too many things happened, and she could not get any respite either mentally or physically.</p>

<p>My heart never calmed down and I couldn't sleep at night.</p>

<p>And when the war game started, her face was always livid because of the desperate fighting situation, and there were always parts of her body that couldn't help but tremble.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times I shed tears.</p>

<p>So much so that the moment Bell and the others' victory was certain, she collapsed on the spot.</p>

<p>And even now that everything is over, she still wonders if her memory has misperceptions like she did a long time ago... In short, she still doesn't have the strength to make a fuss like Missia and the others.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, it is completely a state of fatigue caused by tension.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah~ That's right. After all, Eina likes her brother-kun the most~!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;S-What is your favorite...M-Micia!&quot;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Missia understands Aegina&rsquo;s mood, but she smiled cheerfully.</p>

<p>Eina blushed and responded loudly, however,</p>

<p>&quot;But, then we should definitely celebrate! Celebrate [White Rabbit Swiftfoot], who Eina always thought of, 'Come on~' to cheer him up!&quot;</p>

<p>After hearing these seemingly reasonable words, she lost her momentum again.</p>

<p>She wanted to pout and complain, &quot;Really&quot;...but immediately relaxed her cheeks.</p>

<p>(At that time, I really didn&rsquo;t have any energy left and had no time to care, but... next time I meet Mr. Bell, I can just praise him as much as I want, right?)</p>

<p>After the war, both the person involved, Bell, and the guild employee Eina were busy dealing with the aftermath of the war game, so the two never met.</p>

<p>It seems like it would be best to think about what to say to him the next time you meet him.</p>

<p>Is it the &quot;Thank you for your hard work&quot; that can't be faulted the most?</p>

<p>Or say &quot;I'm worried about you&quot;?</p>

<p>Or is it &quot;so awesome&quot;?</p>

<p>Or say it or say it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Really hard work&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was really on tenterhooks&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;you are so handsome&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I like you the most&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eina!?&quot;</p>

<p>Eina put her head in her hands and lay down on the desk, surprising Misia.</p>

<p>Other staff members were also startled by this strange behavior.</p>

<p>Although the last one was a bit too out-of-the-box and inexplicable, but, well, well, if she and Bell were eye-to-eye at close range now, Eina felt that it was very possible, or quite confident, that she would accidentally say this. Words come. Maybe she would just be so moved that she would hug him tightly.</p>

<p>If Bell becomes the object of the Goddess of Beauty (Freya), Eina's thoughts will turn into regrets that she cannot express and will stay with her for the rest of her life. So the options of hugging, expressing love, or simply extending an invitation to dinner for two are helpless, right?</p>

<p>(Anyway, in short, you must be careful not to think about strange things!)</p>

<p>Eina, whose pointed elf ears and cheeks were slightly red, raised her glasses and finally raised her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, if you linger any longer, the 'school district' is coming.&quot;</p>

<p>at this time.</p>

<p>Eina, whose mind was full of things about the boy, stopped when she heard Misia's words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the &lsquo;school district&rsquo; &#8203;&#8203;really comes, the staff (us) will be busy again~!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Missia stopped making noises and immediately began to make strange noises.</p>

<p>Eina stopped moving and looked out the window silently.</p>

<p>&quot;Really... It's already reached this time.&quot;</p>

<p>It's almost the beginning of winter now.</p>

<p>Orario, located on the westernmost side of the mainland, has also begun to cool down, gradually taking on the flavor of winter.</p>

<p>The remaining autumn sunshine shone from the blue sky, and Eina narrowed her green jade pupils in the depths of her glasses, as if she was looking into the distance.</p>

<p>&quot;Orario is coming...that child.&quot;</p>

<p>You can see the &quot;tower&quot;.</p>

<p>A giant chalk tower rising into the sky as if it were about to penetrate the sky.</p>

<p>Named after the Tower of Babel, it is said to be the longest building in the world and is clearly visible from the sea.</p>

<p>Below that tower is the &quot;City of Heroes&quot;.</p>

<p>The unique labyrinth city in the lower world is also the &quot;center of the world&quot;.</p>

<p>It's also the destination that &quot;her&quot; hopes to change, but in her heart she doesn't want to visit.</p>

<p>&quot;There it is, Orario...&quot;</p>

<p>A &quot;huge ship&quot; that moves majestically on the sea.</p>

<p>The girl standing on the deck of the ship narrowed her green eyes sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;Elder sister&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>
