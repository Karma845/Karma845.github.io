<h1>Chapter 10 &#8211; I Caught a Cold</h1>

    <p>27 days remaining.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;I failed.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The weather was fine that day. His Highness Sazanjill must have waited for me at the school gate that morning as well. Meanwhile, His Highness Zafield probably went to the training ground during lunch break with an awkward expression. I also wanted to ask Lumiere about yesterday.</p>
    <p>However, as it was, I could only imagine it.</p>
    <p>Because I couldn&rsquo;t move from top of my bed.</p>
    <p>As of the present, I, Lelouch Elcage, was in an inadequate state. I had a cold. After being drenched by a drink, I didn&rsquo;t want to go to sleep without first taking a bath. However, the weather outside was still cold. This says nothing of the fact that I had pulled all-nighters for three days in a row.</p>
    <p>&hellip;Alright, I might had overdone it.</p>
    <p>Outside my window, the sky was already giving way to dusk.</p>
    <p>The sinking red sun was so vivid, it was dazzling. However, it also seemed lonely.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, I recalled the &lsquo;Nameless Sunset&rsquo; painting.</p>
    <p>The dance party to be held in the future was an annual party for the purpose of viewing that masterpiece together. Andre Oscar, who painted it, was a graduate of our academy. He was the one who donated said painting to our academy. However, it was usually kept in the royal castle because it was considered a national work of art. In respect to Andre Oscar&rsquo;s will, it&rsquo;s shown to the students once a year.</p>
    <p><em>&hellip;Ah, by the time of the dance party, this history must be learned by Lumiere&hellip;</em></p>
    <p>When I sullenly thought that, the door was knocked.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Lelouche, I tried making porridge. Can you eat it?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>There was a small pot in my mother&rsquo;s hand as she entered the room. She placed it on the side table and poured it on a bowl. It was a gentle chicken soup with thick grains.</p>
    <p>It looked very delicious, but&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to get up.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; I&rsquo;ll eat it later&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;What else do you want? Anything is fine. Ice cream, pudding&mdash;mother will absolutely cook anything for you!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>My mother, who was enthusiastically attending me, was wearing an apron. The apron had an awkward embroidery of a rabbit, it seemed to have been made by my mother with the maids. My mother, who was touted as the beautiful princess of the foreign country, and also a beautiful witch, had become quite homely in just a few tens of days. The change was so absurd that I laughed while coughing.</p>
    <p>Then, my mother hurriedly rubbed my back. Her voice was gentle.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Lelouche. You&rsquo;ll get better soon. Your father will be back tomorrow. Let&rsquo;s look forward to his souvenirs. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll buy a lot of things.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>My father went out for a two-night, three-day inspection earlier that day. However, because of my cold, he suddenly decided to wrap it up in one day.</p>
    <p><em>How overprotective&hellip;</em></p>
    <p>Even if it was for a souvenir, I hoped he didn&rsquo;t waste money. After all, I&rsquo;d be gone in 20 days.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, my mother continued to speak in a warm voice.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Once you&rsquo;ve recovered, let&rsquo;s all go on a trip somewhere. Let&rsquo;s join your father on his inspection. I&rsquo;d like to see Baron Aljerk&rsquo;s field with my own eyes. This rice was also given to us by the baron. He told me that the golden ears of rice are very beautiful, it&rsquo;s as if they&rsquo;re shining. If it&rsquo;s such a beautiful scene, I&rsquo;d like to bring Rufus&hellip; Maybe he could take a short break from his apprenticeship?&rdquo;</p>
    <p><em>Aah, mother, that indeed sounds very entertaining&hellip;</em></p>
    <p><em>&hellip;As for Rufus, I wonder about that. As an artist, it&rsquo;d be good for him to be able to widen his horizon, but what would the other disciples think?</em></p>
    <p>However, I couldn&rsquo;t respond. It was because I was sleepy, and not because my body was &nbsp;in pain.</p>
    <p>When that future became a reality, I would no longer be of this world.</p>
    <p><em>So please don&rsquo;t be so kind&mdash;otherwise, I&rsquo;ll cry&hellip;</em></p>
    <p>Anyway, I&rsquo;d still be gone in a little more than 20 days.</p>
    <p>Pretending to be sleepy, I closed my eyes.</p>
    <p>God persistently stared at my face.</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Hey, are you whimpering? Or perhaps, are you crying?&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crying!&rdquo;</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie. You&rsquo;re definitely crying.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>I didn&rsquo;t want to see god that night.</p>
    <p>Yet without exception, I met god in my dream that night, too. In my dream, I didn&rsquo;t feel tired nor was I coughing, but I couldn&rsquo;t help my feelings&hellip;</p>
    <p>I responded by snorting.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t prepare any tea today.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Hmm? I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a problem.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p><em>&hellip;What does he mean?</em></p>
    <p>When I couldn&rsquo;t help but raise my head, I saw a small pot and a bowl on the table. It was the porraige made by my mother.</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Now that it has come to this, just eat! Even if it&rsquo;s in the dream world, you should still be hungry!&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>God said that the taste and smell should be the same.</p>
    <p>That was right&hellip; yesterday&rsquo;s tea was delicious, too. It was time to regain my mind. I went to pour the soup into the bowl, yet before I could do anything, god did it for me. He did it with such skill, it as if he was accustomed to it.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
    <p>When I tried to thank him&mdash;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<em>Aah?&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>&hellip;What was that?</p>
    <p>God was trying to spoon-feed me.</p>
    <p>On the small spoon, rice gruel with the scent of chicken had been placed.</p>
    <p>While I was blinking, &ldquo;Is it hot?&rdquo; God blew on it, and again&mdash;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;&mdash;<em>Alright, aah~&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>God smiled as he hovered the spoon in front of my face.</p>
    <p>&hellip;No way, was he for real? I was no longer a child, right?</p>
    <p>However, as if provoking me, god smirked and just kept repeating, &ldquo;Aah.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><em>This&hellip; is he messing with me!? Does he want to make fun of me that much!?</em></p>
    <p><em>Two people can play this game!</em></p>
    <p>I closed my eyes and opened my mouth. My face was merely burning because of the cold! Because god was behaving unreasonably, I ended up with a cold!</p>
    <p>However, the flavor of the chicken gruel that was gently put in my mouth was very soothing. The umami warmed my throat, chest, and stomach. It was a dream world, but the realness of the taste was truly strange.</p>
    <p>I thinly opened my eyes. God prepared the next spoon. I opened my mouth again and waited. God didn&rsquo;t say anything and had me eat another spoonful.</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Is it delicious?&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yes, after all, my mother made it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Not because of me?&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re merely spoon-feeding me, right? Let&rsquo;s move on to the next one as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Alright, alright, Lelouche&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>Was my mind playing a trick on me? Even if it was deliberate on his part, that was his first time ever calling me by name.</p>
    <p>I was sure that it was because of my mind. Because of my mind, my fever only increased!</p>
    <p>I shut up and opened my mouth again.</p>

<br></br>

<p>&mdash;26 days remaining.</p>
<p>When I woke up the next morning, my fever had dropped slightly. According to the doctor, I should be able to achieve a full recovery if I were to rest for another two days. It seemed that starting from next week, I&rsquo;d be able to take care of myself and go to the academy once again.</p>
<p>Honesty, I believed I could attend my classes despite the slight fever. However, there was also the issue that my parents were overprotective.</p>
<p>Even so, the fact that it was a mere cold relieved me. As I thought, illness wouldn&rsquo;t be the cause of my death. Most probably, I&rsquo;d die from an accident or as a result of someone&rsquo;s malicious action.</p>
<p>In other words&mdash;<em>who&rsquo;d&nbsp;</em>be the cause?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of business do you have, Your Highness Sazanjill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None in particular&hellip; Moreover, what&rsquo;s wrong with coming to visit my fianc&eacute;e?&rdquo;</p>
<div>
    <div><br></div>
</div>
<p>With a respectful expression befitting of the &lsquo;Golden Prince&rsquo;, the first prince of the Kingdom of Lapisenta visited my mansion.</p>
<p>Just then, I noticed that the wound on his chin had healed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;When I fell down the stairs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A, about that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was right, I had an important matter to discuss with His Highness.</p>
<p>Therefore, I bowed my head with self-satisfaction&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Thank you for helping me, even though it resulted in you suffering an injury.&rdquo;</p>
<div><br></div>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Nyuah!?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Nyuah&rsquo;&hellip;?</em></p>
<p>What kind of prince made such a noise?</p>
<p>When I inadvertently stared at him with a frosty gaze, His Highness immediately averted his gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From where did you hear about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;A god&rsquo;s prophecy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered while laughing. At that moment, His Highness&rsquo; lapis lazuli eyes turned towards me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recall Lelouche made a brilliant landing at that time. That must&rsquo;ve been god&rsquo;s will!&rdquo;</p>
<div>
    <div><br></div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my. My landing was so brilliant, I didn&rsquo;t wake up for an entire day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s right! I was impressed by your three-and-a-half-turn twist, I fainted myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;<em>Your Highness, you&rsquo;re being a little too unreasonable with your delusion right there.</em></p>
<p>I was a little worried. For the future king to be so bad at lying&hellip;</p>
<p>Within the next 26 days, I should be able to tutor His Highness, as well&hellip;</p>
<p>I hid my face as I giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I do, I can&rsquo;t think of anything else to say&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all, I&rsquo;m glad that Lelouche looks well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing me as such, His Highness sat down in relief.</p>
<p><em>Ah, he has a very gentle face.</em></p>
<p>It had been a long time ever since I last saw His Highness&rsquo; face&hellip;</p>
<div><br></div>
<p>&hellip;Indeed, a while had passed since I was last able to take a good look at His Highness&rsquo; face.</p>
<p>I wondered why&hellip; the reason might had been because we were alone.</p>
<p>By the way, she wasn&rsquo;t here that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Ms. Lumiere isn&rsquo;t with you today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A, about that, I invited her to go with me, but she adamantly refused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my. What did you do to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put my hand on my cheek and tilted my head.</p>
<p><em>Oh my, they&rsquo;re so close they can go meet each other during on our consecutive days off&hellip;</em></p>
<p>However, before I could say anything, His Highness spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that while you&rsquo;ve been away, she&rsquo;s been studying more. You see, we&rsquo;re having out regular test at the beginning of next week, right? To repay me, she wants to show me a fascinating score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, isn&rsquo;t she just dilly-dallying?&rdquo;</p>
<div><br></div>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;I don&rsquo;t even know why you started that spartan education for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t spartan at all. I&rsquo;m just making her focus on the basics of the princess education for 100 days.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t know what Lumiere thought about it, but I&rsquo;ll listen to His Highness about why she was free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;I have no intention of making my vow to anyone else but Lelouche.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Lumiere and god told me the otherwise.</p>
<p>As I thought, it was scary.</p>
<p>They might had misunderstood me as a witch or a monster, but I was still an ordinary woman. As such, the reality that my fianc&eacute; had been robbed of me by another woman was still saddening. I didn&rsquo;t have the faintest clue about what love was, but I always believed that I&rsquo;d be with him for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Thus, having to give that up&hellip; it was still regrettable, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>If that was the way it was, then running away should be fine?</p>
<p>After all, I only had 26 days left. God may had looked down upon my pathetic way of life, but I&rsquo;d still never change my way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, His Highness interjected.</p>
<div><br></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for causing you to misunderstand about Lumiere. She&rsquo;s just a friend. We&rsquo;re on a good term with each other. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m willing to set a boundary with her. If you like, from now on, I&rsquo;ll only choose those of the same sex as my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Highness said something unexpected and asked me what I wanted him to do.</p>
<p>He had a very serious expression. It was as if he was carrying out public affairs.</p>
<p>To decide between the two choices&hellip; He said that he&rsquo;d carry out the decision I made.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand what he said at all&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;No, I wanted to pretend that I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Did you get along with Ms. Lumiere to help her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It looks like she&rsquo;s being shamelessly harassed. Thus, I decided to become her shield. I wanted to explain it to you, but I couldn&rsquo;t get the chance&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Highness told me what I already knew. Indeed, I knew. His Highness was a serious person. At the same time, he wasn&rsquo;t good at telling lies. He was also truly straightforward, his actions made one think he lacked self-esteem.</p>
<p>Even if I wanted to misunderstand, it was difficult.</p>
<div><br></div>
<p>What did Lumiere say about that?</p>
<p>I still had a lot to teach her&hellip; because she&rsquo;d take my place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rumor is that I was bullying her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s true. I was wondering if by letting you meet with Lumiere, said rumors would disperse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could be lying about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have to lie, because you didn&rsquo;t do it in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t answer my question.</p>
<p><em>Enough already&hellip;</em></p>
<p>I felt foolish to the point of laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a clumsy person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deny that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><br></div>
<p><em>Why did you bow so seriously?</em></p>
<p><em>How could you believe in me so much?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for making you feel so unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed deeply. Then, he raised his face, &ldquo;The reason everything happened in the first place&hellip;&rdquo; He was trying to get something out of his pants&rsquo; pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t stand his apology which was too sincere.</p>
<p>I rejected him many times. I was a weak woman who had escaped from reality numerous times.</p>
<p>I was the one unsuitable to respond to his feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Your Highness Sazanjill.&rdquo;</p>
<div><br></div>
<p>Ah, I should had only spoken to him at the end.</p>
<p>I could barely smile, much else laugh. It wasn&rsquo;t a way to talk before meeting Lumiere.</p>
<p>What was more, if I were to say something like that&mdash;I&rsquo;d be disqualified as a lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have someone else I like.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m sorry, Your Highness Sazanjill.</em></p>
<p>To respond to your sincerity&mdash;I thought that&rsquo;d be the worst decision of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So please annul your engagement with me.&rdquo;</p>

<br></br>

<p>&ldquo;I heard&mdash;did you turn down my brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Did the rumors already spread throughout the academy?</em></p>
<p>Instead of answering, I only glared at the person. I was in a bad mood. It was nice of the person to visit me&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;<em>but do forgive me.</em></p>
<p>My body felt sluggish, and my fever had yet to disappear.</p>
<p>As of the present, I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to face him.</p>
<div>
    <div><br></div>
</div>
<p>His Highness Zafield&mdash;also known as the &lsquo;Silver Prince&rsquo;, showed off his womanizing smile once again that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be&hellip; you&rsquo;ve fallen for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the mood to joke around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed at me and quick denial, saying &ldquo;How terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&hellip;What&rsquo;s so terrible about it?</em></p>
<p>In the first place, for such rumors to spread&mdash;<em>isn&rsquo;t it your fault?</em></p>
<p><em>Had you not manipulated Ms. Lumiere from behind the scenes, would everything have even turned out like this?</em></p>
<div><br></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I sighed, His Highness Zafield turned to gaze at me.</p>
<p>What I was playing with was a small, white, stuffed animal. Well, calling it a stuffed animal was a stretch. It was truly worn out. While it should had been a rabbit, the face was beyond ugly. The felt fabric was probably pink in color. Not to mention, its vertically elongated ears were barely long.</p>
<p>The strange stuffed animal that a child would&rsquo;ve made had been re-sewn with a new thread. Although, the sewing was clumsy&mdash;<em>well, I&rsquo;m not in a position to say anything about that.&nbsp;</em>Of course, I practiced a lot, but my skill was less than average.</p>
<p>While immersing myself in the memories of sticking thread into a needle, I proceeded to answer His Highness Zafield&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Highness Sazanjill forgot to take this home yesterday. Would you please return it to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew my brother has such a hobby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fufu, as it&rsquo;s a great hobby, it&rsquo;s no wonder he doesn&rsquo;t make it public.&rdquo;</p>
<div>
    <div><br></div>
</div>
<p>For the future king who&rsquo;d soon turn 18-years-old to still be carrying a dirty stuffed animal&hellip; it would bring rise to a bunch of nasty rumors. Even so, for him to carry it around everywhere&hellip; I was certain it was important to him.</p>
<p>However, when I tried to return it, His Highness Zafield only waved his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;ll have to reject that. I don&rsquo;t want to talk to my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my, what&rsquo;s the reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It should go without saying that the two lived together in the royal castle. The academy was about half an hour away from the royal castle, so the two would usually head straight to the royal castle instead of the dormitory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, we had a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was probably a quarrel. As it was the day after they fought, there was no injury to be found on His Highness Zafield. Perhaps because I was tilting my head, His Highness Zafield continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, it was my complete victory. My brother did hit me, but the moment I retaliated, he was defeated in one shot. I still feel guilty about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;As the ace of the swordsmanship club, don&rsquo;t you lack awareness, teacher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think about being Lelouche&rsquo;s teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<div><br></div>
<p>His Highness, who deliberately shrugged, cupped his cheek as he crossed his legs. He stroked his slender neck with his fingertips. I was sure that there&rsquo;d be many female students who&rsquo;d swoon just by looking at that figure.</p>
<p>I merely averted my gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, what was the reason behind the fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? You&rsquo;re curious about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not tease me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although, he had already done so.</p>
<p>Afterwards, His Highness Zafield spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;My brother suddenly rushed me, saying &lsquo;<em>What did you do to my Lelouche?!&rsquo;&nbsp;</em>So, I fought back. Rest assured, as of the present, I&rsquo;m the only one who knows about your annulment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Highness Zafield smiled bitterly while lamenting about how foolish his brother was.</p>
<p>I replied, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of us paid no heed to the presents piled up within the room. They all arrived that morning. When the maids inspected the contents, we discovered it consisted of bedding, nightwear, life-sized teddy bears, and also books&hellip; I had ordered for the fruits and other ingredients to be sent to the kitchen. Even so, there was nothing I could do about the gifts that filled the room.</p>
<div><br></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, at my funeral, can you be more spartan than this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Huh?&nbsp;</em>If it&rsquo;s a joke, then it&rsquo;s in bad taste. Let&rsquo;s not incite any kind of misfortune, so don&rsquo;t talk like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The response was colder than I expected, so I laughed.</p>
<p>His Highness sighed at me and presented a classic sympathy bouquet. An orange rose that impressed anyone who saw it.</p>
<p>His Highness Zafield then said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;After receiving such gifts, I think this one inferior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the case. Even though there are so many gifts, none of them are flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my brother is that kind of person after all&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Highness Zafield spoke in fake astonishment that might as well be serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honesty and kindness are indeed virtues. However, for those who stand on top, are they truly necessary?&rdquo;</p>
<div><br></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my. Hence you think you&rsquo;re more suitable to become king&mdash;because you&rsquo;re sly and wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ve indeed thought about that many times, so I tried to turn my hand a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably, to him, bullying Lumiere was part of an experiment.</p>
<p>I stared at His Highness Zafield, the man who had planned to ensnare another&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e. After successfully making her into a tragic heroine, what was he going do next? Would His Highness cut her off and subsequently turn her into the villain? &mdash;Or,&nbsp;<em>protect her?</em></p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with his thought pattern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you still harassing Ms. Lumiere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. You caught me, after all. It doesn&rsquo;t make much sense to continue anymore. Of course, if you think I&rsquo;m more suitable to become king, I&rsquo;ll do my best to crush her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s such a fussy joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I snorted, and His Highness Zafield proceeded to stand up while tidying up his outfit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re feeling better than I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for your concern. I&rsquo;m planning on retunring to the academy next week, so please teach me again.&rdquo;</p>
<div><br></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still going to train!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Truly, despite her appearance, Lelouche is fearless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that a compliment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just leave me be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While waving his hand, he went towards the door. Nevertheless, he didn&rsquo;t open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Lelouche.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you like the most, Lelouche?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I just smiled while gazing at his lapis lazuli eyes.</p>
<p>Then, he sighed once again, before going out of the room while saying, &ldquo;Take care.&rdquo;</p>
<div><br></div>
<p>The door was closed, and I looked at the bouquet I had just received.</p>
<p>Orange roses&mdash;in the language of flowers, they meant &lsquo;bond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So&hellip; he was saying that he wanted our bond to not change? Or, did he mean to give it to his brother with whom he had quarreled with? There was also a possibility that His Highness simply didn&rsquo;t know the language of flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I indeed had loved you, that might&rsquo;ve been a happy future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While thinking about such an impossible future, I put the worn-out stuffed animal and the beautiful bouquet on the side table. Then, I laid down and closed my eyes.</p>
<p>&mdash;25 days remaining.</p>
<p>The time I had left was about to be cut down to a quarter.</p>
