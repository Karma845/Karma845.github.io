<p>Encounter<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was walking through the old commercial district with Reynold.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Today, the entire area seemed to have turned into an Antique Book Market.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Stalls lined with bookshelves, doors of old bookstores usually closed wide open, even makeshift café spaces turned into reading areas—there were so many people enjoying reading and shopping.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This looks like something Tycoon would love.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“He’ll probably come another day. Uh, looks like it runs for ten days.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold said, glancing at a parchment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, he stole a glance at Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“The scent of old paper and ink is nice…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seeing Sasha in casual clothes was a rare sight.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A simple shirt and skirt—that was all. She didn’t seem fond of accessories, wearing only a wing-shaped hair ornament. The small bag with her wallet hung from her hand as she walked, drawing more than a little attention.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, isn’t that the S-Class…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“And that’s A-Class Reynold.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“The rumor that they’re dating must be true.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Man, Sasha’s so cool.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Probably adventurers, they whispered among themselves.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Reynold didn’t mind it at all.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It had been a long time since he’d been alone with Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“H-Hey, Sasha. Let’s take a look around.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sure. Oh, that bookstore over there… Hm, let’s check it out.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was a stall run by an elderly man wearing glasses.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The stall had just two small bookshelves and sold bookmarks as well.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Silver-crafted bookmarks…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Welcome. Would you like one?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…The craftsmanship is exquisite.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha complimented him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The butterfly-shaped bookmark was incredibly detailed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The old man smiled warmly as he spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“My grandson made those bookmarks… Heh, aren’t they beautiful?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes, they’re lovely… Alright, I’ll take this one.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Much appreciated. How about the books?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Oh, let’s take a look at those too.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha began browsing through the bookshelves.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold stood beside her, watching her with satisfaction.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had stumbled upon an interesting book stall and bought a few intriguing antique books.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He stashed them in his item box and continued to browse other shops.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His companion, Presea, had vanished at some point. It seemed she had really gone off to explore bookstores on her own, which was a relief for Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When he reached the center of the old district, the place was bustling with energy.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise entered the largest bookstore in the area and began browsing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s been a while since I came here, but this is great.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reading was his hobby. Haise liked books enough to say that outright.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At first, he had read to gain knowledge.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He enjoyed tactical books and memoirs written by retired adventurers. About half of those books were said to be “exaggerated,” but Haise enjoyed them all the same.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After leaving the large store, he entered a smaller antique bookstore on the outskirts and browsed the shelves.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He found a book with an interesting title.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Oh, ‘The Adventures of S-Class Adventurer Gerald’… Was there really an S-Class adventurer named Gerald?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>S-Class adventurers were recorded in the Adventurer Registry of the Heiberg Kingdom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The guild could confirm it too, so Haise thought he might look it up when he had time. He reached for the book.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At that moment, a soft hand reached for it from the side.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>““Ah—excuse me… huh?””<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Both of them had reached for the exact same book at the exact same time.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah… s-sorry.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“N-No, it’s fine.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The conversation ended.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was momentarily flustered but quickly regained his composure.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then Reynold appeared.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, Sasha—wait, Haise? You’re here too?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ve been busy since I was kicked out, didn’t have the time before.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Is that so.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There was a slight edge to Haise’s words, and Reynold frowned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Are you two on a date? Must be nice, being such a close couple.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“W-Wha, a couple…?!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, something like that.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold casually put his arm around Sasha’s shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“R-Reynold?!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“See ya, Haise. Have fun.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…………”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wait, Haise. We’re not actually—“<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea appeared beside Haise, arms full of books.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Looks fun. What’s going on?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Nothing.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Okay. Hey, want to grab some tea? I’m tired from all this walking.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That’s your own fault for carrying so many books…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise started walking, with Presea following behind.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha stared after them, dumbfounded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Hah. Looks like he’s not lonely, at least.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For some reason, Reynold’s words struck Sasha right in the chest.</p>
