<p>Past 3<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>───A few days before Haise set out to collect white clover flowers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was sitting in a shabby room near the slums, examining an ancient manuscript he had found in his bag.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He couldn’t understand the writing, but it intrigued him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was likely someone else’s possession, but Haise couldn’t bring himself to part with it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm… What is this writing? And… this diagram?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was a strange diagram.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A slender, tube-like object, resembling some kind of odd spring.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The writing was incomprehensible.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In its unintelligibility, it seemed to echo something about Haise’s own ability.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, no matter. I’ll try decoding it bit by bit. Who knows… it might be the key to awakening my ability."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise closed the book and put it back into his bag.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He strapped on the large basket sitting in his room, secured the copper sword he had painstakingly bought, and went downstairs.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The elderly owner of the inn shot him a sharp look.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, I’m off."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No response. Haise didn’t dislike the old man, though.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When he entered the adventurers’ guild, eyes turned toward him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That guy… used to be in Sacred."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Got kicked out, didn’t he?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"He’s just an herb-gatherer now."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Guess he got tossed aside."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Still hanging on as an adventurer, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was used to the whispers by now.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After accepting an herb-gathering request, he headed toward a nearby forest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mornings were for herb collecting. Afternoons, for training in a beginner dungeon outside the royal capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That was Haise’s routine.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After finishing herb-gathering in the morning, Haise went to the dungeon in the afternoon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Typically, dungeons were tackled in teams.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But with his reputation as someone exiled from Sacred, no one wanted to partner with Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So, as always, Haise entered the dungeon solo.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He could barely defeat the weakest monster on the first floor, the goblin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He had grown accustomed to taking hits from goblin clubs.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ouch…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Today was no different—he had been hit several times.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Still, he managed to defeat twenty goblins in one day, a personal best.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise smiled to himself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m getting stronger."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was undeniably better than the day before.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise believed that steady progress was the first step on the path to true strength.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next day.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After finishing his herb-gathering and reporting to the guild as usual—<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh───"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He ran into Sasha and the others as they were leaving the guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He had nothing to say to them. Truthfully… he wanted to apologize for what he said before being expelled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Sasha and the others had become people he could no longer casually approach.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So, he bowed and tried to walk away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, listen."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"To the west, on the way to the Ohara Kingdom, there’s a small marsh. There’s a field of white clover flowers there—the material for healing potions. It’s an untouched spot."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s all. Later."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha spoke with a hint of awkwardness.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her expression was as cool as ever.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Haise, who had known her for years, could tell.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This was the same Sasha as always.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Feeling a bit happy, Haise walked into the guild at a slightly brisker pace.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A few days later.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Haise was heading to his usual forest for herb-gathering, he remembered Sasha’s words.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A small marsh on the way to the Ohara Kingdom, huh…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A field of white clover flowers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Among the ingredients for healing potions, white clover was one of the most valuable.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If he collected a lot, he could sell them for a good price.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Maybe even afford a new copper sword—or perhaps an iron one.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though it was a bit far, Haise decided to go.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Spending a full day gathering herbs didn’t sound too bad.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, let’s do this."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Buying some bread for lunch, Haise set out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The path to the Ohara Kingdom was a bit tricky, but with a map, he wouldn’t get lost.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After walking for half a day, he finally saw it—a small marsh surrounded by a little forest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Without hesitation, Haise stepped in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Whoa…!! This is amazing."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The marsh was overflowing with white clover flowers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise carefully harvested them, taking care not to damage the roots.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If the roots were left intact, the flowers would grow back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh… Thanks, Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their worlds were different now… but maybe it wouldn’t hurt to thank her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Lately, the bad rumors about him had been getting him down.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But at least for today, things were going well enough to forget about that.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then───something completely unexpected happened.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Huh? Nighttime?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly, it grew dark.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Looking up, Haise saw a jet-black something descending into the marsh before him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What the—?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Grrrrrooooaaaaarrrr!!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was a dragon, towering over 30 meters tall.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bipedal, with long arms, a long neck, and short legs. A slow-looking, humanoid dragon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Haise, this marsh was the dragon’s bathing spot.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah… ah…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Graaaaaaahhh!!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Agh!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dragon’s massive hand reached for Haise like a cat playing with a caterpillar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise slipped on the muddy ground and fell.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dragon’s claws grazed him as he fell.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its claws ripped through Haise’s right eye.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh───!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Blood gushed out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Haise collapsed, the dragon swatted him with its tail, sending him flying.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Guagh!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He slammed into a tree at high speed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Blood poured from his mouth, and his vision turned completely red.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was strangely clear-headed despite being on the brink of death.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One thing was clear: this marsh was the dragon’s territory.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…So…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Why?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Why had Sasha told him about this place?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Did she know it was a dragon’s bathing spot?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Grrrrrrr…!!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was going to die.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not as an adventurer, but as nothing more than food.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His hands and feet wouldn’t move. Only his mind remained oddly sharp.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>All he could think about was his time with Sacred.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And the awful rumors he’d heard.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That Haise guy… He’s like a stain on Sacred’s reputation, right? Sasha and the others probably hate him too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Had Sasha known?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…No."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No way.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He didn’t want to die.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tears of blood streamed down Haise’s face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dragon loomed closer, drool dripping from its massive jaws.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was going to be eaten. What could he do?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Fight? His sword had broken at some point.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What could he do?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>───His ability.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For the first time, Haise remembered the day he had awakened his ability.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, the power you’ve received is... [Sword Master]!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Abilities.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The unique powers possessed by 40% of the world’s population.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the age of twelve, one either awakens to these abilities or does not.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Both Haise and Sasha were among those chosen.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At twelve, the gift reveals itself. While it's clear one has a power, its nature remains a mystery until they use the magical tool known as the Book of Ability Confirmation found at adventurer guilds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When the book is opened, it reveals the ability’s true nature.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was overjoyed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"[Sword Master]...!! I did it!! Haise, I got a Master-class ability!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah!! Congratulations, Sasha!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Master-class abilities were rare.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Many S-ranked adventurers were gifted with Master-class powers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Now, it was Haise's turn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, your ability is───…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise also received a Master-class ability.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, no one at the guild—not even the S-ranked adventurers—could understand its nature.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though he had gained a power, its use was incomprehensible.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With no discernible enhancements to his physical abilities, Haise began his journey as a regular adventurer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, torn apart by the dragon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His mind, though lucid, felt an overwhelming desire to sleep.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His eyelids grew heavier.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If he closed his eyes, he knew he'd never open them again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...??"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly, his blood-soaked vision fell upon the ancient text he carried.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its pages flipped, wet with blood, and Haise saw the once-indecipherable letters clearly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then he realized—he could read them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Summoning the last ounce of his strength, he shakily raised his trembling right hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In that instant, an immense power gathered in his hand, taking form and manifesting in reality.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was... a strange-looking cylinder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[GRRAAAAAHHHHH!!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dragon opened its gaping maw wide.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, pouring all of his remaining strength, pulled the trigger.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise’s ability was registered in the Book of Ability Confirmation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This... What does this even mean?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Er, well, it’s definitely a Master-class ability, but..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ve never heard of this before. Sasha, do you know?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No idea..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Um, we called the Guild Master over!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let me see… Hmm?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Guild Master, Geist, tilted his head in confusion.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"[Weapon Master]...? What does that mean?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Not even the Guild Master understands?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm... Let's confirm this with an S-ranked adventurer I know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise’s ability was labeled [Weapon Master].<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Neither a sword, nor a lance, nor an arrow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No one could decipher the meaning of weapon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What the cylinder in Haise’s hand fired was a grenade.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The projectile shot forth at an incredible speed, lodging itself in the dragon’s throat before exploding violently.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The blast tore the dragon’s neck from its body, the head rolling to the ground before Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Now, fully understanding his ability, Haise felt strength surge through him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He stood up, clutching the ancient text, and gazed at the cylinder in his hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is... my ability. [Weapon Master]."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The ancient text described it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Perhaps because he now understood, Haise could read its words.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Weapons of another world."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The object he summoned was an M79 grenade launcher—a weapon of a foreign realm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The launcher, imbued with Haise’s power, was far stronger than its original form.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And once its role was fulfilled, it shattered like glass, leaving no trace behind.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I'm alive."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had survived.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But at the same time───rage began to boil within him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hah... Hahaha... AHAHAHAHAHA!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He couldn’t stop laughing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was alive.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tough luck."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Perhaps it was all in his head. But at that moment, he couldn’t help but believe it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had been betrayed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The information Sasha had given him nearly killed him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I won’t forgive this."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Never again would he trust anyone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He no longer needed companions.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That day, Haise died.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Having lost his right eye, he was reborn as a shadowy figure of vengeance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus began the swift and ruthless rise of the Dark Stalker, whose name would echo in legend.</p>
