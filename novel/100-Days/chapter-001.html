<p>Prologue<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Did you hear!? That Silver Valkyrie Sasha has finally been recognized as an S-Rank Adventurer!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Idiot, that’s already been the talk of the town."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The largest kingdom in the human world, Heiberg.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The talk at the tavern in the capital, Luzern, was about Sasha, the girl who was recognized as an 'S-Rank Adventurer' at the youngest age of sixteen.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With her flowing silver hair and a figure that defied her sixteen years, Sasha was a popular figure in the tavern where many adventurers gathered, and many had confessed their feelings to her... but all were turned down.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The tavern was buzzing with talk of Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, if she’s an S-Rank Adventurer, doesn’t that mean she can form a 'Clan'? Do you think we could join her team?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Idiot. A team like ours, always stuck at C-Rank, will never be able to get her attention."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But, Sasha's such a kind person, right? She always smiles kindly even at low-ranking beginners."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s about you, isn’t it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, does Sasha have a boyfriend?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"She does. It’s Reynold, from the same team. I hear he’ll be S-Rank soon too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, but don’t you think Reynold would stay in the same Clan with Sasha instead of going solo?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Maybe. So, when’s the ceremony?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Idiot, it’s today! And it’s already over!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah!! Speaking of which, there’s one more person who got S-Rank, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just then─── the door to the tavern opened, and a boy walked in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The moment he entered, the tavern went silent.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ignoring the silence, the boy walked up to the counter and sat down.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…The usual."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Right away."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was a boy dressed in black.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A thick black coat, shirt, pants, and boots—everything was black. His features were sharp, yet youthful… though there was a scar-like mark on his right eye, and he wore an eye patch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The unusual presence made the tavern fall into silence.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Soon, a plate of steak was placed before him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The boy silently began eating the meat, and finally, a modest chatter returned to the tavern.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One of the customers spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s him…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Come to think of it, you just arrived in the capital, so you wouldn’t know, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One of the tavern customers said while looking at the back of the boy in black.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Aside from Sasha, there’s one more adventurer who got S-Rank, and that’s him."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Just some kid, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"He’s no ordinary kid. He’s a monster who hunts S-Rank dragons all by himself. His nickname is Dark Stalker… Even though four clans have tried to recruit him, he’s a lone wolf who doesn’t belong to any team."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Really… so what’s up with that huge scar?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t know. Best not to get involved with him. Apparently, his 'ability' is dangerous because it can drag his teammates into it. That’s why he ended up killing one of his own."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Scary… just get out already."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The boy finished his meal.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He left money on the counter and walked out of the tavern.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As soon as he left, the tavern was filled with chatter again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"By the way, I heard a rumor..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Another rumor? Sounds fishy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Shut up. I’m telling you, that kid and Sasha… they used to be on the same team."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? No way."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The night in the tavern continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It's a different bar, not the one where the boy in black had eaten.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This tavern has an inn on the second floor and a bar on the first.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Today, it’s reserved by the S-Rank Adventurer Sasha’s team, Sacred.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the center of the tavern is a large round table, covered with a variety of dishes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Around the table are five people.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So, everyone got their mugs?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A young man with blonde, pompadour hair and a sturdy build grins widely.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Reynold, how many times have I told you to stop with that creepy grin? You’re ruining the celebration… Ah, gods."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Piasora, you're terrible!? Hey, Sasha, do something about this guy's sharp tongue… I’m gonna cry, you know?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold, with his fake tears, is met with a huff from the beautiful white-haired girl in a nun’s outfit, Piasora. Yes, Piasora absolutely hated men.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the silver-haired beauty, Sasha, flashes a dignified smile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Piasora, could you let it slide just this once?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If Sasha says so!! Aah, Sasha… can I come to your room tonight?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before Sasha could respond, Piasora slipped into her chair and threw her arms around her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yes, Piasora loved Sasha deeply. She even dreamed of having children together someday.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a big sigh, a boy with messy brown hair and glasses speaks up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Honestly, I can’t believe in something like same-sex love. Sasha, you have to say no if you don’t want it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? Hey, Tycoon, what did you just say?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I said 'The saint who hides her claws'."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ahhh!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora’s face contorts as blue veins appear on her forehead.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, Tycoon, as he’s called, simply pushes up his glasses and smiles.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It’s the usual banter… so Sasha doesn’t stop them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, a girl with emerald green hair tied in a ponytail, Robin, chimes in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, let’s toast!! I’m about to burst from eating so much~"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, that sounds good. Alright, everyone, cheers!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At Sasha’s command, everyone raised their mugs.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They drank their ales in one go… and first, Piasora spoke in a sweet voice.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, congratulations on becoming an S-Rank!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thank you, Piasora."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hehehe… this is one step closer to marriage!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha looks a bit flustered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Tycoon, sipping his ale slowly, adds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Once you’re recognized as S-Rank, you can establish a Clan. If we recruit adventurer teams and expand our Clan, joining the 'Four Great Clans' might be within reach… No, if we join, it’ll be the 'Five Great Clans.' That way, we could have a stable life."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora’s "one step closer to marriage" had a hidden meaning.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin, drinking her ale, blushes and says.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I… I want to keep challenging dungeons. There are so many more dungeons in the world."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Me too. Besides, Sasha isn’t the type to sit around doing paperwork for a Clan. I think she looks the most beautiful when she’s fighting."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Stop teasing me, Reynold."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha blushes and looks away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her gesture is so cute that Piasora wraps her arms around Sasha again and presses her plump chest against her. If she were a man, it would have a stronger effect, but being the same sex, it doesn’t have much impact.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Aah, Sasha… I really love you. Hey, if you make a Clan, and when you get some free time, let’s nurture our love together?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ve told you many times, Piasora. I can’t return your feelings… I’m a woman."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It doesn’t matter!! Women can do it too!! We can even have children!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We can’t have children… you idiot."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Aah!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora snaps at Tycoon, but he remains unfazed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Reynold speaks up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Even if you establish a Clan, there’s still a lot of work ahead. Adventurer teams will be applying to join our Clan. Plus, we can’t just keep living at an inn forever. We’ll need our own base of operations. And being S-Rank, you’ll get requests from the kingdom. You’re a celebrity, so they’ll definitely come. These next few months are going to be busy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I understand. But I’m not worried."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Reynold. Because you’re here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……Y-You’re good at flattering, Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I mean it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha says this with a slightly tipsy red face, and Reynold looks away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As food and drink continue, the fun time passes quickly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Perhaps because of the alcohol, Piasora accidentally lets something slip.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Speaking of which, that man!! He also got recognized as S-Rank, didn’t he? I wonder what kind of tricks he used─── …Ah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That man.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At those words, everyone immediately thinks of one particular boy… and falls silent.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even Piasora covers her mouth as if saying "I’ve messed up."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, everyone turns their gaze to Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…He’s gotten stronger. I’m really surprised."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Sasha, I’ll say it again. Your choice back then wasn’t wrong."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold tries to comfort her, but it seems to have little effect.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then Sasha speaks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I never imagined that Haise… would be recognized as S-Rank, just like me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The black-haired boy.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Also known as Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The S-Rank Adventurer, Dark Stalker’s real name.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was once a member of Sacred… no, he was the vice-leader of 'Sacred,' the team that Sasha started with him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was Sasha’s childhood friend, a kind-hearted boy.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And… he was the boy that Sasha exiled from Sacred.</p>
