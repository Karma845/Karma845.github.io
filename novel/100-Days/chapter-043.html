<p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths - Sasha’s Journey 2<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha’s group arrived at a mid-sized town located at the border of the frigid nation, Frizd.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Here, they would switch carriages.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The prepared vehicle was a cart that could be converted between sled and wheels, pulled by special creatures meant for sledding.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin’s eyes sparkled as she saw the sled creatures, prepared in advance by the A-rank team sent ahead to make preparations.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Adorableeee~!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What had been arranged could best be described as "giant, shaggy dogs".<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With fluffy fur, round eyes, and sturdy, thick legs, they immediately drew admiration.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Sasha lightly petted one, it barked softly, "Woof, woof," in a unique tone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Beyond, the leader of the A-rank team Ice Cream, explained.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"These are snow dogs. Essential creatures for hauling in snowy lands. They're friendly, pretty strong, and as you can see, they handle cold well and move smoothly through snow with those powerful legs."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Never seen one before..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"They’re said to be born from crossbreeding large dogs and magical beasts. They start off the size of puppies but grow this big over time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Beyond patted the snow dog’s head, it rubbed against him happily.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We’ve got all the gear ready too. If you need anything else, let me know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thanks for your help."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Sasha expressed her gratitude, Beyond chuckled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haha, you're taking on the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans. Of course I'll lend a hand. Now, drop your stuff at the inn. We’ve got food waiting for you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With Beyond leading the way, Sasha’s group headed to the inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The town’s best inn had not only showers but also bathtubs.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Beyond explained that the fire was fueled by burning magical beast oils and bones.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why do bones burn?" Tycoon wondered curiously, but Sasha didn’t care.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just having a bath was a blessing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……Haah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She sank into the hot water, pouring it over her arms and neck.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, she looked down at her chest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Have they gotten bigger again?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Recently turned seventeen, Sasha had grown into a young woman whose beauty matched her S-rank adventurer title.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She’d even been proposed to several times by leaders of A-rank teams and S-rank adventurers running other clans. Naturally, she turned them all down.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Touching her chest lightly, she gave a wry smile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"They’re such a nuisance… If only I’d been born a man."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To Sasha, being a woman was a handicap.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cumbersome breasts, monthly pains, less muscle, and lower stamina than men.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though she’d trained her dexterity and speed to extremes and used Battle Aura to surpass ordinary male strength, the handicap remained a burden to her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yet there were moments she felt glad about it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Touching her lips, she recalled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……Tch."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The kiss she’d impulsively placed on Haise’s cheek still lingered in her memory.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She knew it now.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I… fell in love with Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She wasn’t sure anymore.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If Haise had stayed in Sacred and awakened his abilities, Sacred might’ve become unstoppable with them as its dual pillars.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They could have become the strongest adventurer team, clearing the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, retiring years later, and then—<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───Tch!! What am I even thinking?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She plunged her face into the bathwater, chasing away the silly thoughts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Imagining herself with children was absurd.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise is my childhood friend. Even though we’ve taken different paths, reuniting as adventurers at the peak is enough. Yes, that’s fine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Nodding firmly, she splashed water on her face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just then, the door to the changing room opened.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sashaaaaa~!! Let’s bathe together~!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Pi-Piasora!? Doesn’t your room have its own bath!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I want to bathe with you! Take this!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora leapt into the cramped tub, sticking close to Sasha and leaning in as if for a kiss.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha held her back by the face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Q-Quit it! Save that for someone you love!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I love you, Sasha!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"T-That’s impossible between two women!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s not! Sasha can do anything! Hmm? ───Sniff sniff… Sasha, were you thinking about Haise?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why can you tell from my scent?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I knew it! That jerk Haise!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Calm down! Stop flailing!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thanks to Piasora’s antics, Sasha’s mind cleared in a strange way.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Two days later.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After finishing their preparations, the group left town.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Everyone was dressed in winter gear over their equipment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Feels a bit restrictive, but better than freezing."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With thick gloves, earmuffs, and a hat, he held the reins.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His puffy winter jacket made him look slightly plump.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tycoon, you look warm."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, but the deeper into Frizd we go, the colder it'll get. Just thinking about it gives me chills."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I can’t handle the cold. I’d rather deal with heat. Haise’s in that desert country, Dizarra, right? I wonder if it’s hot there."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Who knows."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon replied vaguely.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Was he wandering lost in Delmadrome’s labyrinth?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Challenging the Forbidden Six Labyrinths solo was reckless. Tycoon wouldn’t dream of it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Tycoon."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Do you still dislike Haise?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s a pointless question."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is it? Sasha’s already on good terms with Haise, you know? He even specifically requested her help before leaving the kingdom."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That doesn’t mean they’ve reconciled. Haise hasn’t accepted her apology. There’s some ‘something’ between them that only they understand."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What’s that ‘something’?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No idea. But Sasha changed after talking with Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Maybe it’s love?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Love?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Back then, Sasha was so harsh with Haise, wasn’t she? She was frustrated that he worked so hard yet didn’t awaken his abilities. She lashed out at him for it. You wouldn’t know, but after yelling at Haise, Sasha would always cry alone in her room, regretting it. Then the next day, she’d do the same thing and regret it again. She’s clumsy like that. She loved Haise so much."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……You notice a lot."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m a girl."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t get it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon couldn’t understand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But strangely, her words felt on target.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They were getting closer to the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans.</p>
