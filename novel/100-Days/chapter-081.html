<p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths・Congratulations Party for Clearing 2<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The party began, and King Barbaros started his speech.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"As you all know, Team Sacred has conquered one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. This marks the beginning of adventurer history and can be considered the first great achievement!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>All eyes turned to Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, today's party was hosted by Sasha. It was not desirable for the spotlight to be on anyone other than the main character. Perhaps Barbaros understood this, as he only gave a slight glance towards Haise and did not mention him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Barbaros continued his speech for about a minute before raising his glass.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha. Everyone is waiting for your words. Hahaha... As I get older, I tend to ramble on."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"N-no, not at all..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Come on, give your greetings to everyone, and then let's toast."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, though embarrassed, stepped forward with a glass in hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>All eyes were on Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The beautiful, silver-haired princess.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not just her bravery and strength as an adventurer. Despite not being a noble, her noble aura and mature figure drew admiring glances from both men and women.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha raised her glass and smiled gently.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The Forbidden Six Labyrinths. For our team, it was a series of hardships."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold, Tycoon, Piasora, and Robin came to Sasha's side and raised their glasses.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Those who supported our clan while we were delving into the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. And───..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha seemed to glance at Haise... or so Haise thought.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thank you for everything. And from now on, let's continue together───... Cheers!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""""Cheers!""""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold and the others raised their glasses, and everyone in the party venue followed suit.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Reynold spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Enough with the formalities. Now, let's do it the adventurer's way!! Everyone, drink, make noise, and eat until you drop!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ooooh!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon was shocked at the thought of such behavior in front of the king, but the first to cheer was the king himself. For a moment, everyone was stunned, but soon the invited adventurers started to make a ruckus.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist muttered, "Barbaros... truly, even as a king, his love for parties hasn't changed," and Apollon happily patted his shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus, the Forbidden Six Labyrinths Conquest Party began.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was busy attending to the constant stream of guests.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As the host, it was only natural. She had prepared herself, and Reynold and the others were with her... but she was getting tired. However, she couldn't just ignore them, and some very important guests were arriving.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good to see you're doing well, Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ibis-sama!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes, yes, it's good to see you're well... hmm?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis stared at Sasha, then suddenly pointed her index finger straight up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What? Just as Sasha thought that, Ibis poked her chest with that finger.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wha-!? Ah, Ibis-sama!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm. It's gotten bigger again. Growth spurt, growth spurt. Hahaha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"P-please, stop that."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why not, why not!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A man bonked Ibis on the head as she waved her hands around.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A gentleman. That was the only way to describe him, a man in his fifties. He was dressed in formal attire and, having been granted permission to carry a sword, had a ceremonial party sword at his side.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Crossfald-sama, it's been a while."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. Sasha-dono, thank you for inviting me today."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A perfect bow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha also curtsied, holding the hem of her dress.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis, holding her head, glared at Crossfald.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Crossfald!! How dare you bonk a maiden on the head!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Know your place. Honestly, don't try what Nobunaga did to you on other girls."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wha-!? N-Nobunaga has nothing to do with this!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis turned bright red and flustered, which was a fresh sight.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, a man slowly approached Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A muscular man covered in scars. It was rude to say, but he looked absolutely out of place in formal attire.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Thank you for inviting me this time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Balgan, it's been a while. Ah, sorry Sasha, I invited him. Do you know him? Balgan from The Count of Monte Cristo."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wha-!? O-of course I know him!! One of the four... no, five great clans, the clan master of The Count of Monte Cristo, Balgan-sama!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>More than just being unfriendly, it seemed to be his nature.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Balgan bowed to Sasha. He still looked out of place.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's been a while, Balgan."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Crossfald."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. Anytime after tomorrow is fine. Would you like to see my sword? And since you're in the capital, why not have a drink with me? What do you say?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey!! I'm joining too!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""......""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-what's with those looks!! Fine, I'm joining!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sounds fun, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───Eek!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, another voice chimed in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Appearing behind Sasha, someone hugged her softly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A large chest pressed against her back, and slender, supple hands caressed Sasha's abdomen.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, a small face rested on Sasha's shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, Merryabel, you're here. Still as flashy as ever."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ibis... you're still as tiny as ever, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Shut up!! And get off Sasha already."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Okay~"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The woman's name was Merryabel.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One of the five great clans, the clan master of Fantastic Fantasia, which runs the largest entertainment district in the human world.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha greeted her again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"N-nice to meet you... I'm Sasha, the master of Clan Sacred."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nice to meet you~♪"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was an enchanting woman.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Taller than Sasha, with the largest chest Sasha had ever seen, wearing a sexy, revealing dress, with honey-colored long hair, peach-colored eyes, and holding a golden pipe.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crossfald spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha-dono, it's best not to stare into Merryabel's eyes for too long... even if you're the same gender, you'll be seduced."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Merryabel is a succubus, a rare race."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...A succubus?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha tilted her head at the unfamiliar race.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Merryabel chuckled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Unfortunately, I've lost the charm I had in my youth. I'm not like I used to be, when I could seduce a thousand men at once... I've grown old too♪"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good, if that's the case."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Really, you and Nobunaga and Balgan were never affected by my seduction, and I'm still bothered by it, you know?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry about that. Right, Balgan?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Whatever."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey!! Don't ignore me and have fun without me!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crossfald, Balgan, Ibis, Merryabel.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The legendary S-rank adventurer team, Hinomaru Yamato, was all here.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha gulped in front of the legendary four.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before they knew it, Sasha and the others were being watched from a distance. Even the nobles who had wanted to greet Sasha could only step back in the presence of these four.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis spoke nostalgically.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's nostalgic... I'm an elf, Balgan is a dwarf, Crossfald is a dragonkin, Merryabel is a succubus... all long-lived races. We're all old now. I can't help but reminisce about the old days."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...That's right. Those were the most fun times. I had passionate love affairs too, you know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh... yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Mhm."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crossfald, Balgan, Ibis, Merryabel. And one more.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For a moment, it seemed like they saw the illusion of a man with a carefree smile, his arm around Crossfald's shoulder, patting Balgan's back, stroking Ibis's head, and gently holding Merryabel's hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise seemed to see it too.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...What's that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For some reason, the ancient manuscript he had tucked in his chest seemed to heat up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He took out the book and flipped through the pages... there was a picture.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A picture of a young group of five, gathered around a round table, raising their mugs, like an adventurer team's celebration.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Under the picture, there was writing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[My precious comrades. The greatest treasure of another world.]</p>
