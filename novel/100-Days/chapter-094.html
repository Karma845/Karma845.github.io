<p>A Chance Encounter<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Three days had passed since Haise and the others entered the Holy Cross Adramelech Divine Kingdom<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While Sasha and the others seemed busy with sightseeing and shopping in the town, Haise was relaxing in his room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, there was a knock on the door, and Mina came in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise-saaan, let's go out to eat together for once!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...You, for the past three days, you've been eating out every single time. For once, eat the food at the inn."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ehh? But we're in a foreign country, a foreign country! It'd be a waste not to try the local food!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't Sasha and the others say anything about you shopping every day?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Everyone's having fun! Sasha-san's been buying lots of souvenirs for everyone in the clan. Presea-san's been getting books, and Hijiri-san's been getting sweets and meat and stuff."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, hey, let's go! It's almost evening."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Sigh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stood up and put on his coat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As they left the room, he asked Mina,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So, where are we going? And is it just you and me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, Sasha-san will be joining us too. Hijiri-san took Presea-san to a yakiniku place on the outskirts of town."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yakiniku... I'd rather go there."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No way! We're going to a pancake place!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Pa-pancakes? Isn't that usually for breakfast?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Come on, it's fine! Ah, Sasha-saaan!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As they left the inn, they found Sasha, who had changed into casual clothes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A simple white shirt, a dark blue skirt, long boots, and a thin belt with a sword hanging from it. Her long hair was left down, and she wore a headband with a feather decoration.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You came, Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Hey, Sasha, apparently dinner is pancakes..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"U-uh. Well, I think it's fine?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Yakiniku."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Haise said that, Sasha twitched slightly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Despite her appearance, Sasha was a meat lover. To be honest, she could eat more than Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Come on, let's go! Pancakes~♪"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina started walking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise glanced at Sasha and said,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't push yourself too much. If there's something you want to eat, just say it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"S-shut up. It's just that, for once, I want to... you know, eat something girly like pancakes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure, sure."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, wait! You're really something..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not far from the inn was the pancake shop.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A pure white brick building with a wreath of white flowers on the door.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Mina opened the door, the inside was bright and had a nice atmosphere.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Welcome. Please take any seat you like."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They sat at a four-person table by the window, and the waitress handed them menus.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise looked at the menu and muttered, "Oh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is a pancake place, right? They have Black Diamond Oak steak here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, you're right. It seems the menu changes for dinner time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then I'll have the steak. What about you two? It's a pancake place, so are you getting pancakes?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was being a bit mischievous. Sasha looked at Mina.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Fufufu. As a delicate maiden, it's only proper to eat pancakes elegantly at a place like this. Right, Sasha-san?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eh, ah, uh... yeah, not meat, uh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───Pfft."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise almost burst out laughing. Sasha, being a meat lover, probably wanted the steak.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It wasn't like she was hiding her love for meat, but the atmosphere made it hard for her to order.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the end, Sasha ordered a cream-topped fruit pancake (extra large), and Mina ordered a regular-sized one.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What arrived was a beautiful pancake.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then, a sizzling, jet-black oak steak. Moreover, it was the highest-grade cut, the "Diamond" cut.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The price was fitting, but it wasn't a problem for Haise at the moment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Gulp."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wow, the meat smells amazing!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Looks delicious."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, two plates of steak were placed in front of Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? Haise-san, did you order two servings?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah... I must've ordered by mistake. I can't eat two servings... Hey, Sasha, want to swap half your pancake for my steak?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Looking at that pancake made me want something sweet. How about it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Really, Haise-san, you're impossible. And there's no way Sasha-san can eat all that, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"True. Well, as long as you can eat it, it's fine. What do you say?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Fine, I'll eat it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wow, Sasha-san, you're so kind!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And so, Haise and the others enjoyed their meal.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By the way, according to Sasha, the oak steak was exquisite.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They left the shop.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Haise covered his mouth, looking pale, and said,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, sweet... It's like the pancake was made with hellish sugar."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Really? I thought it was super delicious!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, it was exquisite. Fufufu... meat."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Somehow, Sasha seemed to enjoy the pancake too. Though she probably enjoyed the meat the most.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh... my stomach feels sweet. Maybe I'll grab a light drink somewhere nearby."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, I'll come too!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then I'll join as well."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Fine, whatever."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And so, the three of them started walking to look for a bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thanks to their few days of staying, they had gotten a grasp of the town's layout. As they walked toward the bustling district, they could hear the voices of many adventurers enjoying themselves at the eateries.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Speaking of which, we haven't been to the guild in this town... Hey, Sasha, one of the Five Great Clans is here, right? Have you been?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No, I sent a request for a meeting on the day we arrived. I plan to go greet them tomorrow."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Even for you, it takes time to meet the clan master, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Fufu, just so you know, even if they're called one of the Five Great Clans, I don't consider myself their equal."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I know. You're that kind of person. Then I guess I'll visit the guild tomorrow."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm, are you taking on a request?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No, I won't take any in this country. But... I might as well greet the guild master. Geist probably already did, though."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist had hardly been at the inn these past three days.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It seemed he had acquaintances at the adventurer's guild and had been busy greeting them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Mina, who was walking a few steps ahead, said,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, there's a bar over there. Come on, let's go... Huh? Sasha-san, Haise-san... what's that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina pointed to an alley next to the bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There, a man and a woman were surrounded by five rough-looking boys and girls.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A fight?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait. Those uniforms... they're from Adad. Could they be students from the academy?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What should we do?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Mina, Haise, go ahead and secure a seat at the bar. I'll check things out and join you later."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Got it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eh, eh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha will be fine. Unless they're SSS-rank magical beasts or something."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Haise went into the bar. Mina also looked worriedly at Sasha, but when Sasha smiled, she hesitantly followed Haise inside.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey. Hand over your money."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You two, the bottom of the class, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just give us what you've got, and we'll let you go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was clearly extortion.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The ones being extorted were a bespectacled boy and a spirited-looking girl with a ponytail.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The boy was unarmed, but the girl had a sword at her waist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha called out to them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, what are you doing?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? Who the hell are you... Don't you know who we are?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't know. Well, I can tell from your uniforms that you're students from Adad, but you just look like criminals extorting your fellow students."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...You're an adventurer, huh? Heh, there's a difference in experience between an elite like me and a bottom-feeder like you. If you don't want to get beaten up, get lost. Little girl. Gyahahaha!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There were five extortionists. Three boys and two girls.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The leader mocked Sasha, and the rest laughed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just as Reynold had said, elite adventurer trainees from the academy tended to look down on those who started from the bottom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha sighed. What should she do in this situation?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? Hey, hey, you're a real beauty. How about ditching these guys and hanging out with us instead? Hehe, and hand over your wallet too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Hmm, what to do."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, don't ignore us!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The boy swung his fist at Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Dodging was easy. But adventurers were forbidden by the "Adventurer Law" from attacking civilians without just cause. She was about to dodge, but a hand was placed on her shoulder, pulling her back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wha—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise pulled Sasha back and took the punch to his face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The boy must have held back, as Haise only got a small cut on his lip.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise spat out some blood.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The Adventurer Law states that adventurers cannot harm civilians without just cause... but that's only if there's no 'just cause.'"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? What the hell are you talking about?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You know what? 'Self-defense' allows you to attack civilians if they strike first. You threw the first punch, and I'm bleeding because of it... which means I can neutralize you to protect myself."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haah? You're full of crap."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bam!! Haise's Desert Eagle fired, and a rubber bullet hit the boy square in the forehead.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, it hurts!? Wha-what the hell!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Non-lethal rounds are like this. Well, they're useful for mock battles."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You little brat!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The boy lunged at Haise, but Haise fired his Desert Eagles in both hands repeatedly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The boy crouched down, covering his face in pain from the rubber bullets.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!! Stop, stop, stop!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignored him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When he ran out of bullets, he ejected the magazine, and another boy lunged at him───but Sasha stepped forward, grabbed the boy's arm, and threw him to the ground with a single motion.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Haise reloaded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, it hurts... damn you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bam!! A live round embedded itself in the ground next to the crouching boy, leaving a hole in the brick pavement.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Next time, it won't just hurt... What'll it be?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, that's enough."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Right, got it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eek!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The boys ran away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise holstered his gun and rubbed his cheek. Then, Sasha gently pressed a handkerchief to his cheek.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't be reckless... You could've claimed self-defense without taking a hit."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...It's fine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"True. Fufu, thanks, Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Let's go get a drink."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then───they finally remembered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, um!! Th-thank you so much!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That was so cool... Really, thank you so much!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eh, ah, yeah. Are you two hurt?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes!! Um, I'm... I'm Sain!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, yeah. I'm Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Onii-chan, thank you so much!! I'm Miko."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sein and Miko.</p>
