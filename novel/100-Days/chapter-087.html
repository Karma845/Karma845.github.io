<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………I’ve been had."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha walked alone through a forest shrouded in mist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She couldn’t tell left from right. It wasn’t her first time here, but the fog was so thick that she couldn’t recognize where she was.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Somehow, she had felt something was off.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ever since that man… Chaos, the clan master of Clan Judgment, had spoken to her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha pressed on through the forest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A forest enveloped in mist. Alone, she walked through the Forest of Thick Fog.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I need to get back soon……───Ahh, ahh!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a thud, the ground beneath her gave way.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She hadn’t seen it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was swallowed by the earth, struck her entire body, and lost consciousness.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Time rewinds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the home of Clan Sacred, Chaos, the master of Clan Judgment, arrived.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The topic of discussion was his desire to submit to Sacred.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As a clan master, there was no reason to refuse. It was common for clans to submit to others, and recently, there had been so many requests that some cases couldn’t be handled. Having a large clan like Judgment under them would be a great help.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Moreover, many teams had recently left other clans to join Sacred.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It wasn’t uncommon for a clan that someone once belonged to to submit to a newly joined clan, and while disputes sometimes arose… under the current adventurer laws, there were no rules governing such matters. Clan disputes were entirely the responsibility of the clan master. That was part of being a clan master.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So, is that alright? Little lady."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the reception room of Clan Sacred, Chaos and Sasha faced each other.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha spoke with a stern expression.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"First, could you stop calling me 'little lady'? Master Chaos of Clan Judgment."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oops, my apologies. Then, Master Sasha of Clan Sacred… will you accept my clan as your child?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Generally, a clan that submits to another becomes the child, and the one above becomes the parent.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Currently, seven clans had joined as children under Clan Sacred.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha gave a small nod.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Very well. Then, it’s a contract."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Without a word, Taikun, who had been standing behind her, placed a parchment on the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A Clan Alliance Certificate… a special document created through the power of a vow. Breaking what was written here would result in punishment by the vow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The content was simple. 'Do not betray the clan'… that was all.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Chaos signed it. Then, he bit his finger and pressed his blood onto the document.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"With this, we’ve joined under Clan Sacred."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Indeed."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Fufu, then I’ll have some of my members stationed here right away. Do you have rooms?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ll show you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha stood up and was about to leave the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Chaos spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Master Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What is it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I apologize for insulting you before, during the Stampede."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You seem wary, but I’m genuinely impressed and respect that a seventeen-year-old girl like you has been recognized by the Four Great Clans and conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is that so? Goodbye then."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha said only that and left the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Chaos snorted and leaned back on the sofa.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Taikun sat down across from Chaos.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Did you notice?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Your smirk, it’s just like a little villain plotting something. It’s hard not to be wary… many teams have transferred from Clan Judgment to us. Just don’t cause any trouble. You don’t want to find out what happens if you break the vow, do you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Scary…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If you want trust, show it through your actions."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Chaos said "Yeah, yeah," and started smoking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Several days had passed since Clan Judgment joined.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Requests from Sacred started coming in, and teams that had left rejoined, allowing Judgment to gradually return to its former activities.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Kint, Chaos’s right-hand man, spoke with dissatisfaction.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Boss, aren’t you being too serious?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I mean, you used to say cool stuff like 'I’ll teach you a lesson,' but now you’re too serious… I thought you were going to trap Sasha or something."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Idiot. If I did something suspicious right after joining, it’d be obvious it was me. Plus, there’s the vow’s power. I can’t afford to mess up."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haa…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, being serious for a while has let me see a lot. Just wait and see…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Boss, show us your cool side!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Shut up!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One day. After finishing her usual paperwork, Sasha headed to the adventurer’s guild for the first time in a while.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She went to the guild master’s room to greet Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist-san, it’s been a while."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, Sasha. Long time no see… since the party, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As she sat on the sofa, a veteran receptionist brought tea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha sipped her tea and let out a small sigh.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Phew…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You seem tired."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes, well… being a clan master is much busier than I realized. I’ve hired clerks, but there’s still a lot of paperwork I have to handle myself…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s how it is. When I was a clan master, I barely had time to sleep from all the documents I had to go through."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Speaking of which, you also founded a clan, right? What about now?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ve left it to my nephew. He’s far more capable than I ever was."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let’s see… in the royal capital?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No, in the Holy Cross Adramelech Theocracy to the north."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…The one with the human supremacists?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s in the past. Sure, there’s a history of excluding other races, and there are still remnants of that… but as long as Lord Crossford is there, there won’t be any problems."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha drank her tea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Holy Cross Adramelech Theocracy, the largest nation in the north, is said to be the place where gods descended and granted powers to humans. It houses the Sacred Adramelech Grand Temple, which worships Adramelech, the creator god who governs all, and is home to the Seifert Knights, led by the strongest sword saint, Crossford, who serves as the clan master.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The clan Geist once led was called Bear Knuckle, and its membership condition was 'those who wield no weapons.' It was said to be the strongest clan in hand-to-hand combat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"To be precise, I didn’t create Bear Knuckle. My sister founded it, and I was the second master. Now, my nephew, who was also my disciple, is the master."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-wait, Geist-san, you have a sister? This is the first I’ve heard of it… and you were the second master?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s right. My sister handed the master position to me when she became pregnant. I still exchange letters with my nephew… fufu, he always ends his letters with 'come back,' which I find quite endearing."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haha…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist looked pleased.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha found herself wanting to meet Geist’s nephew.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, you’ll probably head north eventually, right? I’ll write you a letter of introduction so you can meet him."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re going to the Graveyard of Ruin, right? You’ll have to pass through the Holy Cross Adramelech Theocracy to get there."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, that’s right. Actually… we haven’t even finished preparing for the journey. Not at all."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Several days had passed since the party.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After hearing from His Majesty that there was information about Drena de Stahl, one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, in the Graveyard of Ruin, they still hadn’t been able to make a move.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha finished her tea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist-san, I should get back to work."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright. Come anytime."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sa-Sasha!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The door to the guild master’s room burst open, and the receptionist, Mina, rushed in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, Sasha!! An urgent request just came in. Roland, the leader of Team Thousand, seems to have gotten lost in the Forest of Thick Fog!! His teammates have submitted a rescue request…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What…? The Forest of Thick Fog?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yes… that place is too dangerous for anyone below B-rank. Roland just got promoted to C-rank, so it might be tough for him…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ll go. Mina, report this to Reynold and the others."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yes!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait, Sasha, that forest is always shrouded in mist. Even veterans get lost there often. You should prepare before───"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s fine. I’ve been there many times. I know the terrain and when the fog gets thick."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Sasha rushed out of the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina also ran out to report to Reynold and the others, leaving Geist to sigh.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As always, Sasha cared deeply for her comrades.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, there was a knock on the door.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Excuse me. Um, Geist-san… Sasha just rushed out. Did something happen?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The one who entered the room was───Haise.</p>
