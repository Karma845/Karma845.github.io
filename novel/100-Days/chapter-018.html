<p>Green Elephant Dragon<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The entrance to Mount Gagazia is guarded by Yggdrasil.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise shows the guard at the entrance a request from the royal family.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The guard smiles and says:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, you must be Haise. I've heard about you from Clan Master Ibis. Please, go ahead."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Th-thank you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise instinctively looks back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Behind him, the towering World Tree of Yggdrasil looms.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Moments ago, he had spoken with Ibis there before heading straight for the mountain.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He wondered how Ibis had described him to the guards.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With permission granted, Haise enters Mount Gagazia.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So, this is where the Everlasting Moonlight Flower grows?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"At the summit. Let’s go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea moves ahead of Haise at a brisk pace.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise follows her. Though Presea’s expression remains neutral, her urgency is clear.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sensing the presence of magical beasts nearby, Haise quickly retrieves a new weapon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Its shape is different."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"M4 Assault Rifle. A new acquisition... Let’s see how powerful it is."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise fires at a massive hawk descending from above.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The rifle’s intermediate bullets, larger than those of a handgun, pierce the hawk, riddling it with holes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Blood rains down, and Haise and Presea dodge to avoid it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While reloading the magazine, Haise comments:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s easy to handle, packs more power than a handgun, and can fire in bursts... I like it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…As always, your firepower is ridiculous."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise readies the M4 and begins walking again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The M4 proved to be more user-friendly than a rifle or a Desert Eagle, easily dispatching the magical beasts encountered on Mount Gagazia.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The magazine could generate infinite ammo, and most beasts would become Swiss cheese after a burst of fire.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea, armed with a bow for backup, remained behind Haise, but it seemed she wasn’t needed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Hey, can we move a little faster?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"There’s no point rushing. And I don’t see why I should listen to you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……Fine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea suddenly passes Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m going ahead."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ll collect the grass and wait below. You’ll get your payment then."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea breaks into a run and disappears into a nearby thicket.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Watching her go, Haise sits on a nearby rock and props up the M4.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"She’s in a rush… Was this urgent or something?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Pondering this, Haise materializes a Desert Eagle, removes its magazine, and checks the ammo.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───…I have to hurry."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea runs swiftly, climbing trees and leaping from branch to branch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Most magical beasts stick to the ground, so this method allows her to move unnoticed and quickly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Having entered Mount Gagazia, the next step was to obtain the Everlasting Moonlight Flower.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, she would secure the final ingredient.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Elixir of Eternity… Just wait. I’ll definitely make it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea hurries toward the summit.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Finally, she is about to accomplish her goal.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After several hours with barely a break, Presea reaches the peak.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Made it…!! The Everlasting Moonlight Flower, where is it…?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>All she finds is a sea of ordinary green weeds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea is stunned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This can’t be… The Everlasting Moonlight Flower should glow faintly…!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She scans her surroundings, but only ordinary, unremarkable grass stretches before her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Collapsing to her knees, Presea’s hope drains away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……Ah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was her last chance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Without the Everlasting Moonlight Flower, the Elixir of Eternity couldn’t be made.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A single tear escapes her eye.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…I’m sorry, Sister."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As her body goes limp, the sky darkens, and a violent wind arises.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eh───…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Nightfall?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No, a massive creature descends from above, landing on the weed-covered summit.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Grrrrrroooooooaaarrr…<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What the…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A deep green, frog-like creature appears.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its mottled skin shifts in color.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its mouth is wide, and its throat inflates with each breath. It has no teeth and is designed to swallow whole prey and digest it directly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bat-like wings extend from its back. Most notably, it is over thirty meters long.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A Green Elephant Dragon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its guild-assigned threat rating: SS+.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With SSS reserved for nation-destroying crises, this is just one level below.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The frog-like dragon stares at Presea with its bulbous eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This is bad.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea stands, drawing her sword-bow hybrid, but she feels no confidence.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dragon seems to appraise her with its bulging eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its large mouth opens, and a long, wiggling tongue lashes out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Damn…!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea nocks an arrow and fires at the tongue, hoping to distract it and escape.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The arrow strikes the tongue but bounces harmlessly off its elastic surface.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Now perceiving the attack as a threat, the Green Elephant Dragon focuses its bulging eyes on Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>GUUUUURRRROOOOOAAAAARRRRR!!!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ahh!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her legs give way, and a warm liquid spreads beneath her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Shaking uncontrollably, she drops her weapon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Overwhelmed by the SS+ monster’s presence, Presea freezes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The tongue wiggles, extending toward her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When it nears her face, the tongue splits open.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The split tongue resembles claws.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───…Sister…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She couldn’t save her sister. That was her only regret.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As the tongue wraps around her body───...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What the hell are you doing, idiot?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a loud BAAANG!, the tongue-binding Presea is blasted apart.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Shakik! The slide racked, chambering the next round.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They called it pump-action, but Haise couldn’t care less.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A new weapon he had conjured: the Benelli Nova shotgun.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“A frog, huh.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Run! That’s an SS+ ranked Green Elephant Dragon!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m not running.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise leveled the shotgun and fired repeatedly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The buckshot scattered, designed for medium-sized beasts, biting into the dragon’s body. However, it caused only minor bleeding, far from fatal.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“In that case…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise discarded the shotgun, grabbed two Desert Eagles, and broke into a sprint.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While running, he circled the beast, firing rapidly. As expected, the Green Elephant Dragon was slow. It turned sluggishly, struggling to track Haise’s movements.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Big target!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise tossed the Desert Eagles aside and conjured a new weapon: a submachine gun.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A Thompson SMG with a drum magazine.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Normally wielded with both hands, Haise gripped it in one.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Take this!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Brrrrrrt! Bullets sprayed in a torrent.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The recoil was intense; even Haise’s trained arms struggled to control it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But the dragon was massive, and the scattered shots riddled its body.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Gyaoooooooon!!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dragon thrashed, rolling on the ground.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its blood stained the earth, killing the grass—it was a potent toxin. Alchemists claimed it could be refined into a universal cure.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When the magazine ran dry, Haise discarded the SMG.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He picked up an M1873 Winchester rifle and aimed for the dragon’s head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Firing, reloading with the lever action, and firing again, he repeated the process, slamming bullet after bullet into the dragon’s skull.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Finally, its brain oozed from its shattered cranium, and it convulsed violently.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise discarded the rifle, pulled out a Desert Eagle, and fired several more shots into the creature.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Only then did it stop moving.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Phew… finally dead.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...No way.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Green Elephant Dragon had fallen.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>True, it was slow. Haise’s method of circling and firing could deal damage.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But this dragon’s defensive power was legendary. Its elastic skin rendered slashes and stabs almost useless.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yet Haise’s bullets easily surpassed that defense.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, you okay?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah… don’t worry about it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...Huh? Ah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Only then did Presea notice the steam rising from her soaked pants.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her face turned red.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Why did you come for me?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea asked while changing behind a boulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, leaning against it, replied nonchalantly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No particular reason.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Don’t joke.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m not. If you died, I wouldn’t get my reward.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The sun set, and darkness crept in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Green Elephant Dragon’s massive corpse loomed nearby.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea emerged from behind the boulder, fully dressed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“For now, should we camp here? It reeks of blood, though. Want to move?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What’s up?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea pointed not at the dragon’s corpse but at the grass it had been lying on.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s glowing.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Some of the grass glimmered faintly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea gazed upward, realization dawning.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Of course… by day, it’s just grass, but at night, it glows. This must be the Everlasting Moonlight Flower.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Huh, really?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“But—”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The glow quickly faded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dragon’s toxic blood poisoned the soil, killing the grass.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea frantically searched for any unharmed blades, but all the light had gone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No… no way...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...Hm? Hey, over there.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Huh?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But there was still one glowing blade of Everlasting Moonlight Flower.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It hadn’t been touched by the dragon’s blood.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea carefully retrieved a trowel from her item box, dug it up without damaging the roots, and potted it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Clutching the pot gently, she turned to Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This is yours.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You killed the dragon. This belongs to you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...You sure?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes. All the grass here is gone, but there might be more elsewhere.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise accepted the pot, placing it into his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He also collected samples from the dragon: its blood, eyes, and other fluids.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though the core near its heart had been shattered, he salvaged it just in case.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, good for you. That completes your request.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And so, Haise successfully fulfilled the quest to gather the Everlasting Moonlight Flower.</p>
