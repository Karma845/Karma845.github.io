<p>Haise's Journey 1<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Mm... Such nice weather."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise strolled along, enjoying a leisurely walk alone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Checking his map, he confirmed there was a small town along the highway. Deciding to stop there for the night, he set his course.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A quick glance behind him revealed a young elf girl, who had introduced herself as Presea, following exactly thirty meters behind him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was too much trouble to bother with, though. While their conversations had unexpectedly flowed well, Haise didn't feel the need to engage with her. As long as she didn't interfere, he thought letting her follow him to the Sacred Peaks would be fine.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly, a large goblin known as a hobgoblin leaped out from the bushes by the roadside.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Winchester M1873.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise pulled the lever to load a bullet, aimed at the hobgoblin’s head, and squeezed the trigger. The gun roared, and the hobgoblin’s head exploded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The empty cartridge fell and disappeared as it hit the ground. Presea, who had been readying her bow, widened her eyes slightly and murmured.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…What power."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, figured you'd think that."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thinking Haise’s reply meant the conversation was now allowed, Presea approached.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She stared intently at Haise’s weapon—a bolt-action rifle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is that your ability?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Mine is [High Pixie]—I can freely command invisible spirits. They can communicate over long distances, spy for me, or even make me invisible at their request."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…What are you rambling about?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What's your ability?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re sneaky."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Once someone asks about your ability, you must share yours in return. It was an unspoken rule for building trust.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a sigh, Haise brought the rifle closer to Presea’s face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"My ability is [Weapon Master]. I can use weapons from another world—not this one."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A mastery-type ability… Wait, not from this world?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Not sure myself. That’s all I’ll say about it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As the rifle melted away, Haise resumed walking. Presea, however, fell into step beside him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Hey."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'm just walking next to you. It's not like I have anything to talk about."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise sighed and picked up his pace slightly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They arrived at the nearest town east of the Heiberg Kingdom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It wasn’t large—lined with homes and shops at the center, with a few inns scattered about—a rest stop for travelers heading to the royal capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Surprisingly, the town was bustling.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise showed his adventurer’s card to the guard at the entrance and asked,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why’s it so lively here? Something happening?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, it’s the town’s 200th anniversary festival. Wait—S-Rank Adventurer?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The guard, stunned after checking Haise’s card, exclaimed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Great. Wonder if there are any inns left with vacancies…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Not sure, but there’s a hidden gem if you’re not picky. Head straight down that alley to a place called Little Bird Inn. Locals sometimes forget it’s even an inn."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Got it. Thanks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, your companion too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, having forgotten Presea was behind him, sighed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea followed silently as they made their way to the inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…It’s rundown. Oh well."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The inn wasn’t much different from the shabby one Haise used as a base in the capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Since it was only for one night, he didn’t mind. The festival atmosphere filled the town.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"One night, please."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise said at the front desk.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure thing. Sorry, but we’ve only got one room left."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s the festival. Even our dump fills up. Are you okay sharing?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sharing? Ah…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea had caught up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We’ll share."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Here’s your key. The walls and doors are thick, so don’t worry about noise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thanks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea, misunderstanding something, grabbed the key and walked off.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, wait!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The room’s this way."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside, the room was shabby but spacious. The bed was large, and surprisingly, there was a shower. The place had the feel of an inn meant for… other activities.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea began removing her gear and undressing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait—what are you doing?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Prepaying my share of the reward."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m taking a shower."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait, stop!! Stop!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…What? Would you prefer I stay like this? I’m sweaty."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Stop saying weird stuff!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Completely unashamed, Presea stood naked before Haise, tilting her head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She didn’t even try to cover herself. Haise averted his gaze, his ears turning red. Presea noticed and remarked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Could it be… you’re inexperienced?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Shut up."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re an S-Rank adventurer. Don’t you have the money? At your age, you should be, you know…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, I’m inexperienced too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What are you even talking about? Put some clothes on. And what do you mean, prepaying?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You can do what you want with me. Once I get the Everlasting Moon Flower, I’ll pay you in cash."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…No need."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ll take the money, not your body."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…A bit insulting. I’m confident in my looks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To be fair, Presea was stunning.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her flawless white skin, perfectly proportioned figure, and supple body made Haise’s face flush red.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Then tell me why you want the herb."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Everlasting Moon Flower. What’s it for?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea pulled new clothes from her item box and dressed. She sat on the bed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"My sister is ill."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"An illness…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"An Elixir would cure her. I’ve gathered almost all the ingredients, but the Everlasting Moon Flower is impossible to find. I applied to enter the Sacred Peaks, but the request was denied. Dangerous beasts are in their breeding season, and even the Four Great Clans avoid the area."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But you’re different."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. You’re taking on the Heiberg Kingdom’s request. With their permit, we can enter the Sacred Peaks and find the herb."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I overheard you discussing your destination with the Guild Master. I was surprised when you said the Sacred Peaks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea needed the herb for her sister.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why were you in the west?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Searching for the herb elsewhere. If I couldn’t get into the Peaks, I had to try other places."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Please. When you go to the Peaks, let me accompany you as your ‘companion.’ I’ll give you all my savings once I get the herb."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Fine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thank you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But you’ll follow behind me. We’re not companions. I’m a solo adventurer. You’ll tag along briefly."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Of course. I’m used to working solo too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good. About this room…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s only for a few hours. Sharing is fine. If you want, I won’t refuse."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Not interested. Geez…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stood up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Where are you going?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Food. With a festival like this, there must be stalls."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I might join you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Suit yourself."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They left the inn. Presea didn’t follow this time, leaving Haise free to explore the bustling festival stalls.</p>
