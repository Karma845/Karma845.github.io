<p>Forest Kingdom Yggdrasil and the Sacred Great Tree 2<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One of the Four Great Clans, Yggdrasil<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Where is its headquarters? The answer was quite astonishing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No way... This great tree is the headquarters of the Four Great Clans?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To Haise's surprise, there was a large gate at the base of the tree, and beyond it was a town.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Actually, it wasn’t exactly a town, but rather a residential area for adventurer teams belonging to the Yggdrasil Clan. They had carved out the inside of the tree, creating a town-like space.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The elderly man guiding Haise spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is the area where F to D-rank adventurer teams live. The higher you go, the higher-ranked teams reside."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Incredible... By the way, how many teams are there in Yggdrasil?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"About seven hundred, roughly."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Whoa... seven hundred?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was amazed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Apparently, this clan could handle 80% of the requests brought into the vast Forest Kingdom of Yggdra. This included not only direct requests but also high-difficulty ones that the Adventurer Guild couldn’t manage.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Now, this way."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...What’s this? It’s kind of cramped."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is an elevator."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...???"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Elevator?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise repeated the word.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The room he was led to was rather small. As soon as he entered, the door closed... and, to his surprise, the room began moving upwards.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before he could even process it, they quickly reached the top floor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To his shock, the top floor was actually outside the tree, on a thick branch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Several houses looked like bird nests built on the branches.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s the base of an A-rank adventurer team."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh... such an amazing location."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"And over there is the shrine of the Clan Master of Yggdrasil, Ibis-sama."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The elderly man pointed to the largest building at the end of the branch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and the guide immediately headed there.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As they approached, several adventurers from the A-rank team came out and stared at Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Douglas, who’s that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"He’s a guest of Ibis-sama, an S-rank adventurer."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"S-rank? He’s human."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The adventurers were all from an all-female elf team.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>All of them were beautiful, but their gazes toward Haise were filled with disdain and mockery.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise didn’t feel comfortable.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let’s just go already. I want to get to the Sacred Mountain Gagazia quickly."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hah?! A human like you is going to the Sacred Mountain Gagazia?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignored them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He urged the elderly man to hurry, but one of the female elves grabbed Haise’s shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait a minute, what do you mean? Even we can’t get permission to enter the Sacred Mountain Gagazia, and a human like you is going?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s none of your business. Let’s go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, hold on, Roshe. We’re in a hurry. I’ll listen to the details later."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The elf woman named Roshe let go of Haise’s shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They then proceeded toward the shrine at the far end. As they arrived, the large doors opened on their own.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside was a spacious, empty room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, in the center of the room, a sixteen-year-old girl was lying on a cushion with a pipe in her mouth, smoking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, you’ve arrived, Geist’s apprentice."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Uh, you are... Ibis-sama, the S-rank adventurer?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yep."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The girl sat up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She had long, straight white hair and beautiful emerald green eyes. She wore a cloth wrapped around her chest and a thin outfit, which was so thin that everything beneath it could be seen.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She wore accessories made of grass and stones, looking like an elf you could find anywhere.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis, the Infinite Ancient Tree,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The most noble elf in this world, and one of the oldest elves.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is Geist doing well?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-Yes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ho ho ho, I read your letter. You said it was a greeting to me and that you were asking for help... and that you might not need assistance, but you’re showing the letter anyway."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>".........."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ha ha ha, hit the mark, didn’t it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, well... I just wanted to let you know that I’m Geist’s apprentice and that I’m entering the Sacred Mountain Gagazia. That’s all."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ho ho, what a cheeky little brat you are."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis laughed and flicked the ash from her pipe into an ashtray.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh, this brings back memories... the smell of gunpowder."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re from another world... aren’t you? Hmm."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, you know about gunpowder... do you know about guns?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Of course. I once fought alongside him."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was shocked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Without thinking, he pulled out the old manuscript and showed it to Ibis.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then... do you know about this?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Well, well."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis’s eyes widened—her face briefly twisted, looking as though she might cry.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise wasn’t sure, but it seemed like it might not have been a mistake.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s still here..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…You know about it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. It’s Nobunaga’s diary and records."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nobunaga?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Kamishiro Leonhart Nobunaga... a 'Japanese' person who was transferred to this world."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Kamishiro Leonhart Nobunaga..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh, it’s a hard name to say, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis smiled nostalgically and asked Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let me see it for a bit."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She took the book and began turning the pages.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re Haise, right? Can you read these characters?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, just a little..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise explained how he had come to possess the book.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Haise pulled out his Desert Eagle and showed it to Ibis.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s a gun... I see. You’ve awakened the same ability as Nobunaga. And with that, you can now read this 'English', right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Probably. Um... about that book of Nobunaga’s..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This book is written in characters only Nobunaga can understand. I don’t know the contents, just that such a book exists. As for the ability... I couldn’t understand that either."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I... I see..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had hoped to understand something, but it seemed like it was in vain.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He took the book back and absentmindedly flipped through the pages.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hm, what’s wrong?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, there’s a page I can read."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Really? That’s interesting. Could you share it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What’s the matter? I’ll pay whatever price you ask."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis snapped her fingers, and the guide Douglas appeared, holding a large bag of gold coins.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise hesitated for a moment, but seeing Ibis’s sparkling eyes, he nervously began to read.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh... please don’t get mad."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm? Just hurry up and tell me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Okay, here goes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>〇月〇日。<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Today, Ibis keeps playfully clinging to my arm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So cute. My chest feels all warm and fuzzy. I’ll spoil her plenty tonight.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A fiery, strong-willed elf girl who uses grandpa-style speech—what other wife could be better? None. My Ibis is the cutest in the world!!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When I’m cleaning and maintaining my gun, she always comes over and snuggles up like a cat. Maybe if I gave her cat ears and a tail as a present, she’d like it?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If I got her naked and put on cat ears and a tail, and rolled her onto the bed... Ah, just thinking about it makes me...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Alright, I’ve decided. I’ll go hunt a cat monster outside and make cat ears and a tail.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Heh, I’m really fired up now.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...That’s it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-W-W-What?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was an awful entry.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise regretted reading it aloud and felt like burning the book.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis turned bright red.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, were you... lovers with this Nobunaga?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Aaaahhhhhhh...!! T-T-Today’s over!! If you need my help, call me!! Yes, that’s it!! Goodbye!!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis, now completely flushed, kicked Haise out, and he left the shrine.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re late."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...A lot happened."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Haise exited the great tree, Presea was waiting.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She tilted her head, seeing Haise looking somewhat worn out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But now, they could finally move on.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let’s go. Our goal is the summit of the Sacred Mountain Gagazia."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They moved past the East Gate and could finally head toward the Sacred Mountain Gagazia.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise looked up at the great tree one last time.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...People have history, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh? You’re using that phrase?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well... it just felt right."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Considering how the pages he could read increased at the most unbelievable timing, Haise couldn’t shake the feeling that the old book had its own will.</p>
