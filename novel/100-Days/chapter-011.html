<p>Heading South<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Confirming. The destination is the mining region south of the Kingdom of Heiberg, specifically the town of Listerl.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Our task is to exterminate the Crystal Golem that has appeared in the largest crystal mine in Listerl."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha confirmed with everyone at the southern gate of Heiberg's capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora nodded emphatically, Reynold grinned broadly, Tycoon adjusted his glasses, and Robin gave a cheerful thumbs-up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cress simply said, "Got it," while his sister Myuane puffed out her flat chest and exclaimed, "Leave it to me!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus began the seven-member journey to exterminate the magical beast.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They soon left the city and began walking, when Myuane spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Aren’t we taking a carriage?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Listen here, princess. Our policy is to avoid unnecessary comforts. If we can walk, we walk.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If we can carry it, we carry it. If we can save, we save. Understand?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmph."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora’s words left Myuane pouting, but Cress gave her a light pat on the head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"He's right. Apologies, Piasora. Myuane… we may be royalty, but here, we’re the lowliest members.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Follow the team’s policy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh, fine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good grief… and just so you know, if you say you're too tired to walk, we’ll leave you behind," Tycoon added.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Myuane scowled, but Sasha stepped in to ease the tension.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But this is the first time Cress and Myuane are adventuring alongside us. We’re not in a rush,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>and we’ve been to the south several times. If you have questions, ask, and we’ll do what we can."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha… you’re like a saint!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What? I’m the saint here!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re more like a devil."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Say what!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hah, devil—fitting, don’t you think?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Reynold, you jerk!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"P-Piasora… your face is scary!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin cowered, hiding behind Reynold.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The seven of them set off, heading south to the mining town of Listerl.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What’s on your mind?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tycoon…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha walked at the rear, with Tycoon matching her pace.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thinking about Haise, aren’t you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…You can tell?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Pretty much."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon adjusted his glasses—a habitual gesture.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"During the appointment ceremony, you left halfway. You went to see Haise, didn’t you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You figured as much?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"More or less. I don’t know what was said, but you seemed a bit lighter afterward."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…He said a lot. I… I think I may have been looking down on him, after all."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…I’ve always known you carried guilt. Honestly, I’ve wondered if things would’ve been different<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>if we hadn’t exiled him. With Haise awakened to his ‘ability’, the three of you—Reynold, you, and him—might’ve formed the strongest team imaginable."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Childhood friends, sharing the same dreams… You’ve been through a lot, haven’t you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. I thought I’d fulfill our dream for him, but… Haise said it was meaningless to achieve<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>the dream we shared alone. We can’t dream of building the strongest team together anymore."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s why Haise is aiming to become the strongest adventurer. I think his dream is to challenge the Forbidden Six Labyrinths."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sounds like it’s your dream, too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. If he’s aiming to be the strongest, I’ll aim to be the greatest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If we’re heading to the same place, we’ll meet again. And when we do, I’ll hold my head high."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I was such a fool. I avoided Haise out of guilt, then waited until we were both S-rank adventurers<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>to apologize, thinking it was the right time… It was meaningless. I even told him I’d do anything<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>he wanted, offered my body—and got rejected."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wh-what!? You actually said that!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Piasora would lose her mind if she heard! Reynold too—who knows what he’d do… Sasha,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>don’t tell anyone what you just told me!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm? Alright."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon sighed, looking ahead.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora and Myuane were bickering, Reynold was laughing, Cress sighed, and Robin flitted about nervously.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, you said you’d aim to be the greatest, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, I did."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ll support you. I’m a bit of an oddball, and most teams found me a nuisance, but meeting you saved me. You’re my benefactor."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What’s with this all of a sudden?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We’ll build the greatest team. Do as you please—I’ll handle the planning."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tycoon…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haha… it’s going to get busy. But first, we finish this royal request.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The reward is anything we want, remember? I suggest we ask for a clan home.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The big clans’ homes are like small villages themselves, after all."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait, slow down, Tycoon. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but you’re too close."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, sorry… hmm?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They noticed Reynold and Piasora glaring daggers at Tycoon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What are you doing, you creep?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tycoon, just what do you think you’re doing, getting so close to Sasha?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t have romantic feelings for Sasha, alright? Honestly… talking a little longer, and you idiots jump to conclusions. Ridiculous."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""What did you just say!?""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Amid the familiar antics, Sasha felt like she could finally laugh again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Heading south from the capital, the road grew quieter, flanked by woods and groves.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Naturally, that meant encountering magical beasts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"—Everyone, prepare for battle."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was the first to notice.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Cress, Myuane. This time, just watch. Reynold, guard them."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Got it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tycoon, Robin, Piasora—same as usual."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"""Roger."""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, um…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let’s see what S-rank adventurers can do."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cress said as he pulled Myuane back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold stood in front of them, shield raised, while Robin leaped into a tree.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon and Piasora took position at the rear—Team Sacred’s formation was perfect.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A beast leapt from the bushes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"An ogre, huh? There’s a village nearby… We can’t let it go further."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha readied her sword, and the ogre roared.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Gwoooaaaaarrr!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>An arrow struck its right eye, followed by a fireball from Tycoon, igniting its face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The ogre thrashed wildly, hurling a boulder. Sasha dodged, and Reynold blocked it to protect Cress and Myuane.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tch."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A pebble grazed Cress’s cheek, drawing a thin line of blood.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With an annoyed expression, Piasora healed it with a touch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Gwoooaaaarrrr!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Silver Flash—[Air Slash Blade]!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha’s sword, glowing with silver energy, released a blade of light, decapitating the ogre.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As it fell, she sheathed her sword.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Amazing…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Now I understand why they’re called the capital’s strongest."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Myuane murmured in awe.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora, however, wasn’t impressed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Reynold! Watch those flying pebbles!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry, sorry. Cress, you alright?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Honestly… Protect him properly next time!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Got it, geez…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, let’s move out," Sasha commanded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After processing the ogre, Team Sacred resumed their journey south.</p>
