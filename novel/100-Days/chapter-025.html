<p>Return<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha and her team returned to the royal capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They reported to the guild, then headed straight to the royal castle to announce the success of their mission.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before the king, they knelt and reported the completion of the mission... and explained about the demon race.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The demon race, you say?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes, our team engaged in battle with a demon and emerged victorious. The enemy’s incompetence and the exceptional support of Prince Cress and Princess Myuane allowed us to secure victory."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Your Majesty, what Sasha says is true. I’ve confirmed it myself."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"M-me too! I mean, yes, I have as well!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Cress and Myuane spoke, the king grimaced with a "Hmm..." but eventually nodded firmly and said:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Cress, Myuane, I will hear the details from you later.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, the mission is complete. Well done."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thank you, Your Majesty."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Now, I shall grant you your wish. What would you like?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then, we would like a ‘home.’"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A home, you say? So, a clan home. At last, you plan to establish a clan?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Understood. I will provide you with a property in the capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I’ll leave the details of available locations to the Prime Minister. Let Sasha’s team choose freely."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"As you wish."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hah, while Haise failed his mission, you seem to have succeeded splendidly."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait… what?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise failed?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha let the words slip out and quickly covered her mouth.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The king chuckled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"He failed to collect the Everlasting Moonlight Flower. It seems, according to the report from Yggdra, that he abandoned the flower for the sake of the queen."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…???"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If you’re curious, ask the Prime Minister."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus, the audience ended… and Sasha’s team obtained a clan home.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the castle’s waiting room, they split into teams.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One team would go with the Prime Minister to select the clan home, while the other would exchange the crystal golem materials.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The home selection team was Sasha, Robin, and Tycoon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The exchange team was Piasora and Reynold.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nooo!! Why do I have to go with Reynold?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ahahaha, because it’s a fair draw. Sasha, let’s pick the home together, okay?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Arrrghhhh!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Enough noise… Honestly, exchanging materials is an important job, too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Hey, Piasora, that stings a bit."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Shut up!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora stormed off alone to the exchange counter, with Reynold following behind.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sasha and her group waited in the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Soon, the Prime Minister entered, carrying a stack of large parchment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Phew, I’ve selected properties that I think will satisfy you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Prime Minister Bonnet… thank you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon stood and gave a deep bow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The parchments were spread across the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They began reviewing immediately. Tycoon, clearly excited, scanned the property details, muttering to himself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin, on the other hand, was smiling as she looked at the floor plans, commenting,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wow, the bath is huge," or "I want this one to be my room!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, glancing at the parchments, asked Bonnet:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Um, Prime Minister… about Haise failing his mission..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Does it concern you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Yes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha nodded slightly, and Bonnet smiled warmly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise had nearly completed his task. He obtained the Everlasting Moonlight Flower and only needed to return to the capital to deliver it, but…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then, what happened?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let me backtrack a little. Before heading to Yggdra, Haise encountered an elven girl. Her name was Presea, the younger sister of Queen Arcela of Yggdra. She was searching for the Everlasting Moonlight Flower, a material for Elixir, and had traveled from the west to the central lands. Hearing Haise’s plans to head east, she requested to accompany him."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, with a companion!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha and Robin were stunned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bonnet chuckled wryly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"More like traveling together. Presea reportedly said they weren’t companions."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Unbelievable. That Haise, who prefers solitude, traveled with someone?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon spoke while reading the parchments.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Currently, Yggdra’s sacred mountain, Mt. Gagazia, is restricted due to the magical beasts’ breeding season.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise used a mission permit to enter with Presea. Near the summit, they unfortunately encountered an SS+ ranked magical beast, the Green Elephant Dragon."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"An SS+ rank… That’s an enemy a nation’s entire army would struggle against."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Indeed. Haise fought alone to protect Presea and emerged victorious… But at the cost of the Everlasting Moonlight Flower’s habitat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Flower Haise found was the very last one."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"""..."""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The three listened in silence.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At some point, they had stopped looking at the clan home parchments.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"After descending the mountain, Yggdra’s soldiers came to escort Presea back. She parted ways with Haise. However, when she reached Queen Arcela, she found the grass Haise had collected inside her item box. It was used to create an Elixir, saving the queen’s life. She’s now fully recovered and resuming her duties."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Haise…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha smiled warmly, clutching her chest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She felt a deep happiness, as though it were her own triumph.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Although Haise failed his mission, saving Yggdra’s royal family member led the king to offer him a reward… But Haise declined."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Such a waste!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin exclaimed, and Tycoon agreed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha wasn’t sure she could have made the same decision in his place.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To prioritize the mission or a life… It wasn’t an easy choice.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She felt a mix of admiration and envy for Haise’s freedom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"By the way, what happened to Presea, the elf?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"She received a reward for her efforts but… haha, she renounced her royal status and broke off her engagement. She now works as an adventurer in Heiberg Kingdom. It seems she took quite a liking to Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Hmph."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For some reason, Sasha found that rather amusing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Why are you here?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the adventurer’s guild dismantling area, Reynold and Piasora ran into Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The area was lined with large platforms where prey was dismantled and assessed. High-value items were further evaluated in private rooms before payment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By chance, their platforms were next to each other.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora grimaced, then smirked at Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I heard about you. Failed your mission, didn’t you? Refused the princess, set out alone, and returned in failure… how pathetic! Hahaha!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Knock it off, Piasora."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, come on, Reynold. Even you think he’s lame, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Seriously, stop. Look… Haise, get yourself some teammates."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thanks for the advice."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise placed the battered corpse of an S+ rated Desmond Spider on his platform.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dismantler winced.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, this is barely salvageable. It’s just bones and scraps of hide."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry, A-rank dungeon beasts were tougher than expected."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hahaha! Reynold, show him what you’ve got!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah… Why are you even competing?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold pulled a chunk of crystal golem remains from his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its SS rating overshadowed Haise’s.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dismantlers exclaimed in awe, and Piasora puffed up with pride.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Assess this! Hahaha!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re ridiculous… Anyway, get it done."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With their assessments complete, Reynold and Piasora were taken to a private room, while Haise received his payout on the spot.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Being called to a private room indicated something exceptionally valuable.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let’s go, Reynold. Hahaha!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah… Later, Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They left.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise received his payment and exited the dismantling area.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"All done?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s none of your business."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Okay. Have you eaten? I’ll join you if you haven’t."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignored Presea and began walking, but she naturally followed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They ended up eating at the same restaurant, at the same table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus, Haise and Sasha successfully completed their respective S-rank missions.</p>
