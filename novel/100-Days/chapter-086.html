<p><p>Extra Chapter thanks to Verio on Ko-fi<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><br><br></p><p>The Cost of Growth 1<br><br><br><br>The Four Great Clans, now the Five Great Clans.<br><br>The greatest clans in the human world, the legendary clans that adventurers and adventurer teams aspire to join.<br><br>Recently, the master of Clan Sacred, which newly joined the Four Great Clans, is said to be a teenage girl.<br><br>One is Clan Yggdrasil, which has many members of different races.<br><br>The clan master is the S-rank adventurer, Infinite Old Tree Ibis.<br><br>Eighty percent of the clan's members are of different races, and the condition for joining is 'having a non-human in your team’.<br><br>Non-humans refer to races other than humans. Elves, dwarves, succubi, incubi, nagas, beastmen, and others—many races that live in this world, distinct from demons.<br><br>Once, there was a movement called 'Human Supremacy', which sought to exclude non-humans.<br><br>A young elf who stood up and fought to protect the non-humans. That elf is the clan master, Ibis.<br><br>She appears to be a girl of about twelve to fourteen years old. However, she is an Elder Elf, even rarer than High Elves, and is said to be the progenitor of the elf race.<br><br>It is said that she once fell in love with a human and traveled with them.<br><br>One is Clan The Count of Monte Cristo, formed by dwarves.<br><br>The clan master is the S-rank adventurer, The Count of Monte Cristo Balgan.<br><br>The members are exclusively dwarves. It seems they were once a rough group, but after Balgan fought to a draw with a certain young swordsman, they began to walk a righteous path. They have also challenged the Forbidden Six Labyrinths.<br><br>In the middle of the southern desert, the dwarves of The Count of Monte Cristo set up a workshop and began forging weapons for adventurers. A merchant then opened a shop, and many dwarves, humans, and non-humans gathered, forming a 'town'. This led to the birth of the largest desert kingdom, Dizara... However, Balgan apparently said, "It's too noisy, so don't come here," and the town was built a little away from The Count of Monte Cristo's workshop. Thus, the workshop, which should have been the center of the town, became just one part of the town's layout, making it a peculiar clan.<br><br>Balgan is a dwarf.<br><br>Dwarves are typically short, bearded, and fond of alcohol. But Balgan, perhaps due to a mutation, is over two meters tall and possesses strength greater than the average dwarf.<br><br>It seems that after a fight with a certain human, he began traveling with that human.<br><br>One is Clan Seifert Knights, composed solely of humans and those with sword-related offensive abilities.<br><br>The clan master is the S-rank adventurer, Sword Saint Crossfald.<br><br>A knight order composed of the strongest human swordsmen, once called the ultimate weapon of human supremacists. In truth, they were a combat group, not adventurers, and were the core force of the non-human exclusion movement.<br><br>However... after battling certain adventurers and non-humans, they changed their ways and repented. They joined hands with non-humans and rebelled against the human supremacists.<br><br>Crossfald, the clan master, is a rare race known as a Dragonkin, called the Peerless Beauty. While he usually looks like a human, he transforms into a Dragonkin when he fights seriously.<br><br>It is said that only five people have survived after seeing Crossfald's [Dragonkin Form].<br><br>He once fought a certain mutated dwarf to a draw and was utterly defeated by a certain human, after which he traveled with both the dwarf and the human.<br><br>One is Clan Fantastic Fantasia, which only allows female members.<br><br>The clan master is the S-rank adventurer, Aphrodite Merryabel.<br><br>A beautiful succubus who runs the largest pleasure district in the human world, Fantastic Fantasia.<br><br>Human supremacy, non-human exclusion—none of that matters here. She welcomes all races as guests and remains neutral.<br><br>Within Fantastic Fantasia, humans and non-humans are treated equally as guests and loved.<br><br>But───... any disruptive behavior, ideological disputes, or trouble-making results in immediate expulsion. Once, when human supremacists and non-humans caused trouble within Fantastic Fantasia, Merryabel 'punished' both sides... What exactly happened is not told, but both factions were thoroughly warned, "Don't cause trouble there."<br><br>Merryabel, alongside Crossfald, was called the Peerless Beauty.<br><br>However, she fell in love with a certain human who came as a guest and began traveling with him.<br><br>And the newly joined one, Clan Sacred.<br><br>The clan master is the S-rank adventurer, Brynhildr Sasha.<br><br>A seventeen-year-old girl who leads five hundred adventurer teams, a young heroine.<br><br>She has exceptional leadership, charisma, and is highly respected. And her appearance... her beauty, which seems beyond her years, has attracted many adventurers, and many teams continue to apply to join.<br><br>Her greatest achievement is likely the conquest of one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans.<br><br>Sasha and her team conquered one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, said to be impossible to clear. This feat will likely be recorded in history textbooks and told for generations.<br><br>These are the Five Great Clans.<br><br>The greatest clans that adventurers aspire to join.<br><br>But, of course... there will always be those who envy their achievements.<br><br>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br><br>A large three-story building slightly away from the center of the royal capital.<br><br>The headquarters of Clan Judgment, where the S-rank adventurer Venom Chaos is fuming in his office.<br><br>"Dammit... another team left?"<br><br>Once a large clan with two hundred teams, it has now dwindled to eighty.<br><br>The reason... is Clan Sacred.<br><br>Leaving a clan and transferring to another is free. While disputes over teams can arise, there are no clear rules in the current Adventurer Laws.<br><br>It's not just Clan Judgment; other clans are facing similar issues.<br><br>Then, Chaos's subordinate, the B-rank adventurer Kint, knocked on the door and entered.<br><br>"Boss, I have a report."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>"Clan Caseworker seems to be joining Sacred... and, well, they're disbanding."<br><br>"What? That old hag Mama Cha is going under that brat Sasha!?"<br><br>"Well, not exactly 'under'... but in the form of 'adventurer guidance', they'll be training adventurers at Clan Sacred's headquarters in the suburbs. It's basically retirement..."<br><br>"...Dammit."<br><br>In other words, she won't be taking S-rank adventurer requests anymore.<br><br>She's become a workhorse for Sacred. Chaos clicked his tongue in annoyance.<br><br>"That brat, conquering one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, riding high on her success."<br><br>"But there's no doubt they're the most influential clan right now. Not just us, but smaller clans are also losing teams, with many joining Clan Sacred or swearing loyalty to Sasha..."<br><br>"At this rate, Sasha will end up managing all the clans in the capital."<br><br>"...Yeah."<br><br>"Tch... that brat's so annoying. I'd love to kidnap her and have my way with her..."<br><br>"She's got a great body, after all. If you sold her, you could get a hundred, maybe two hundred platinum coins, right?"<br><br>"Maybe. But... that brat's strong. I once saw her eating with an elf girl, and she noticed my gaze instantly and went on guard. She's a monster."<br><br>"Uh, yeah..."<br><br>"...Don't make that face. If we attacked her, we'd get beaten and lose our adventurer licenses. As much as I'd like to, no."<br><br>"......Right!!"<br><br>"But that brat's getting a little too full of herself. She needs to be taught a lesson."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>"That brat's still a kid. She's inexperienced, and that's her weakness... just watch. I'll give her a little... adult punishment."<br><br>"You're the best, boss!! Devious!! Cunning!!"<br><br>"Shut up!!"<br><br>The ashtray Chaos threw hit Kint square in the face.</p></p>
