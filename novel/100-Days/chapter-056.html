<p><p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths - Haise and Sasha’s Journey 3<br><br><br><br>"………Nn."<br><br>[You're awake, Haise.]<br><br>"………You."<br><br>When Haise awoke, he was lying on a bed in a civilian house.<br><br>However, the house was in shambles. The walls were crumbling, the cabinets and tables toppled, and shards of glass scattered from the windows.<br><br>As he tried to sit up, sharp pain shot through his body.<br><br>"Ugh... ow, ow."<br><br>[Don’t push yourself. You're covered in bruises. No broken bones, but...]<br><br>"…What about you?"<br><br>[I'm in a similar state. But I’m not human, so this much isn’t a problem.]<br><br>Choco Latte flexed its muscles with a proud "hmph."<br><br>Its armor was shattered, its helmet destroyed, and its shield obliterated. Now, it was dressed only in the loincloth it wore when they first met.<br><br>In the corner of the room, however, lay black armor and a sword.<br><br>"Armor… is that new?"<br><br>[Hm? Ah, that. I made it myself. Can you stand? Look outside.]<br><br>Haise managed to get up and looked outside… It was an unbelievable sight.<br><br>A wasteland—perhaps the best way to describe it.<br><br>Vehicles were utterly destroyed, and the remains of a ferris wheel lay scattered everywhere. Only a handful of buildings remained intact, making the scene look tragic.<br><br>And among it all, what caught his eye… was a golden severed head.<br><br>[If I recall, it was the Yamata no Orochi Jr. There were six severed heads rolling around. I used its scales to forge the armor and helmet. When heated, the scales turned pitch black, but the new gear is much sturdier than the old.]<br><br>"Impressive…"<br><br>Haise stored the severed heads in his item box.<br><br>Looking around, he noticed the demon man was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>[Who was that man, anyway?]<br><br>"No idea. Come to think of it, I never got his name… Not that it matters."<br><br>[True. So, what’s next?]<br><br>"This place is a mess, but I want to investigate. There might be a dungeon core or some treasure."<br><br>[In that case, there was a path leading underground at the spot where the demon man was. It was far enough away to avoid the threat of the Iron Destroyer.]<br><br>"Iron Destroyer…? Oh, you mean the Bunker Buster. It's called a Bunker Buster."<br><br>[Iron Destroyer, Bunker Buster… Got it.]<br><br>"…Yeah, sure."<br><br>Haise decided it wasn’t worth correcting further.<br><br>"By the way… how do you even know about the path underground?"<br><br>[It’s been three days since you passed out. I had time to investigate.]<br><br>"Three days!? Ugh… Now that you mention it, I’m thirsty. And hungry too…"<br><br>First, they needed food.<br><br>◇◇◇◇◇<br><br>"……Nn."<br><br>"Sasha!!"<br><br>"Whoa!?"<br><br>When Sasha woke up, she found Piasora’s face close to hers, and he hugged her tightly.<br><br>"Ah, thank goodness…"<br><br>"Piasora… You’re okay too. Wait, what were you trying to do just now?"<br><br>"Of course, a wake-up kiss."<br><br>"………"<br><br>Piasora’s unapologetic attitude was typical of her. Sasha quickly distanced herself from her.<br><br>Reynold, Tycoon, and Robin also seemed unscathed.<br><br>Sasha, still feeling heavy, sat up and asked Tycoon:<br><br>"What’s the situation?"<br><br>"A full day has passed since the battle began. Both the demons and the Shoggoth are gone. This place is a warehouse past the battlefield, and we’re using it as a base for nearby investigations. Piasora also healed all our injuries."<br><br>"I see…"<br><br>"Sasha, how’s your condition?"<br><br>Reynold peered at her, and Sasha nodded.<br><br>"No issues. As expected, combining Tycoon’s super enhancement and Piasora’s super healing as a trump card worked brilliantly. Tycoon… You understood my intent well in that moment. And you too, Piasora."<br><br>"Naturally. That monster, the Shoggoth, could only be defeated with your 'battle aura.'"<br><br>"I thought Tycoon was ogling my naked body with ulterior motives."<br><br>"In that situation, how could I possibly have such thoughts? Besides, I have zero interest in your body, clothed or otherwise."<br><br>"Excuse me!? What did you just say!?"<br><br>"You should fix that two-faced personality of yours."<br><br>"Arrghhh! I’ll kill you!! I’ll seriously kill you!!"<br><br>"Wait, wait! Calm down! Tycoon, stop provoking her!!"<br><br>"I only stated the truth."<br><br>"And Reynold!! I won’t forget you staring at my naked body either!!"<br><br>"I thought it was a sight for sore eyes. Hahaha!"<br><br>"Grrrr!! I really hate men!! Robin, you too, right!?"<br><br>"W-Well, given the situation, it couldn’t be helped… Sure, it’s embarrassing, but…"<br><br>Everyone was acting like usual.<br><br>Sasha found comfort in that and smiled softly.<br><br>Robin then handed her a cup.<br><br>"Have some tea."<br><br>"Thanks."<br><br>"Everyone’s tired… Let’s take a break, yeah?"<br><br>"Good idea. We’ve defeated the dungeon boss. All that’s left is to seal this dungeon. Forbidden Six Labyrinths… Finally, we’ve cleared it."<br><br>"Haha… We’ve found the ultimate treasure. The true purpose of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, the Seven Great Calamities, and the demons… I need to organize the information in my head!! Forget gold; I’ve obtained a far greater treasure!!"<br><br>"Hey, Tycoon, you’re too loud."<br><br>"Throw him out of the warehouse. He’s giving me a headache."<br><br>That day, Sasha and the group rested before resuming their investigation the next day.<br><br>◇◇◇◇◇<br><br>Led by Choco Latte, Haise ventured further beyond where they had fought the demon man.<br><br>They found a massive entrance leading underground.<br><br>Even after the bunker buster’s huge explosion, the staircase showed no signs of damage.<br><br>As they descended, they encountered an iron door.<br><br>It opened automatically as Haise approached.<br><br>Inside were glowing metal boxes, strange wiring, and a constant mechanical hum.<br><br>"What is this place…?"<br><br>[Come to think of it, didn’t that demon man mention something about a seal?]<br><br>"…I don’t remember."<br><br>[Wait, look, Haise. That door…]<br><br>Before them stood a massive door, vastly different in size and design from any they had seen before.<br><br>Both Haise and Choco Latte felt it—this was something they should not touch.<br><br>"Let’s leave this one alone."<br><br>[Agreed. My instincts tell me the same… we shouldn’t mess with this.]<br><br>"Look over there. There’s another room."<br><br>In front of the room was a plaque.<br><br>"Uh… Control Room? Let’s check it out."<br><br>The door opened automatically, revealing beds, glowing metal boxes, and tables, suggesting it was a resting area.<br><br>There was another door inside.<br><br>Opening it led to a large iron door labeled “Special Materials.”<br><br>"A vault, maybe… Let’s try opening it."<br><br>[Can you?]<br><br>"Looks like it’s locked. Too ba… Wait, what?"<br><br>The vault door was already open.<br><br>Inside was a glass case containing a rainbow-colored gem.<br><br>Haise picked it up.<br><br>"I’ve never seen a gem like this. Might be valuable… Well, let’s call this the dungeon treasure."<br><br>He placed it in his item box.<br><br>Meanwhile, Choco Latte pointed to a nearby box.<br><br>[Look, Haise. This box here… it’s really cold inside.]<br><br>"Hm, let me see."<br><br>Haise opened the white box and found it indeed cold, though empty.<br><br>Amused, he stored any usable tools in his item box.<br><br>On the table, he noticed a large box and a panel with several small buttons.<br><br>"What’s this box…?"<br><br>[Hmm, could it be a detector of some kind?]<br><br>Choco Latte pressed a square button labeled ‘Enter’ on the panel.<br><br>Suddenly, alarms blared throughout the room.<br><br>"Wha—What’s going on!?"<br><br>[Is this my fault!? S-Sorry, Haise!!]<br><br>"Ah, we’re leaving the room!!"<br><br>As they exited, a voice echoed.<br><br>[Activating final safety protocol. Activating final safety protocol. Initiating final freeze seal for Yamata no Orochi. Once the freezing seal is complete, 'Yamata no Orochi' will be permanently sealed in the underground shelter. This facility will be destroyed afterward. All personnel must evacuate immediately. Access to the surface transport has been granted.]<br><br>The floor near them opened, revealing a glass-like tube.<br><br>"What’s that…?"<br><br>[Freezing in progress. Freezing in progress.]<br><br>[H-Haise… It’s freezing…]<br><br>"F-Freezing…? Are they freezing it!?"<br><br>[All personnel must evacuate immediately. All personnel must evacuate immediately.]<br><br>"Damn it, Choco Latte, we’re going into that tube!!"<br><br>[Wha…]<br><br>"I don’t know what’s going on, but it’s dangerous here!!"<br><br>[O-Okay!!]<br><br>As Haise and Choco Latte jumped into the tube, a sensation of floating overwhelmed Haise, and his vision was consumed by light.</p></p>
