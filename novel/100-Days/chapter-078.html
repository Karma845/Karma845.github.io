<p>Heracles 9<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>How much time had passed?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri's full power was terrifying. Equipped with metal gauntlets and armor on both arms and legs, she knocked down Sasha's sword and unleashed a relentless barrage of attacks that ignored defense.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It wasn't just about creating weapons. Hijiri also crafted metal shields and walls to blindside her opponent, and even made multiple daggers to throw at Sasha. Her tactical range was impressively wide.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On the other hand, Sasha's combat aura output had skyrocketed several times over compared to before.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Normally, Sasha fought with her teammates in mind, keeping her aura output restrained while generating power in sync with them. But now, she was pouring out everything she had without holding back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It probably wouldn't last more than a few minutes. Yet, in terms of speed, she overwhelmingly surpassed Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Speed versus power—Sasha's speed against Hijiri's strength.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri's fist shattered Sasha's armor, gouging her chest and causing blood to spurt out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha's slash tore through Hijiri's back, causing massive bleeding.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even so—both of them were smiling.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They laughed, bared their fighting spirits, and continued to strike and slash at each other.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ahahahahaha!! This is fun, so much fun, Sasha!! More, more, let's keep going!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Of course!! Ah, my body feels so light... No one can stop me now!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri's right arm was clad in a gauntlet made of orichalcum.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha raised her sword.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri's straight right and Sasha's downward slash collided head-on. The gauntlet shattered, and Sasha was sent flying backward, tumbling across the ground.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It no longer looked like a proper fight.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri had no regard for martial arts. She simply crafted iron and kept punching and kicking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, too, seemed to be swinging her sword with brute force. Her sharp, fang-like slashes were nowhere to be seen.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Both of them fell to the ground, staggering as they got back up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their faces were stained with blood, but they were still smiling... though their bodies seemed to have reached their limits.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Let's end this."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They both took a deep breath... and their eyes snapped open.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri raised both hands, and the stones and dirt from the ground gathered in the air, forming massive right and left hands.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Each hand was over ten meters long.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crystal-like fists, shimmering and translucent, floated in the air.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"[Heracles]!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In response, Sasha concentrated all her combat aura into her holy sword.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A massive golden holy sword, over ten meters long, appeared in her hands.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"[Callbrand]!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The golden holy sword and the adamantine fist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their ultimate techniques clashed, overwhelming the surroundings.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-what the hell...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Defend! Everyone, behind me!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon deployed a magical barrier.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cress pulled a stunned Reynold into the barrier.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea extended her right hand and whispered "Protect", forming an invisible shield made of spirits.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist and Apollon did nothing. They simply watched, waiting to see the outcome.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""Let's settle this!!""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They both shouted, and their ultimate techniques collided head-on.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha's flash and Hijiri's adamantine fist clashed directly, creating a brilliant flash of light.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Surprisingly, there was no sound of impact.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For some reason, there was only light between Sasha and Hijiri. The adamantine fist and the golden holy sword collided, their forces repelling each other in silence.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The light was too bright to see anything—but Haise saw it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha's golden light began to fade, and cracks formed in Hijiri's adamantine fist... before it exploded in an instant.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise leaped forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"——!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But he couldn't see.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Where had Hijiri been blown to? Where had Sasha been blown to?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Who was at the spot he was leaping toward?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise trusted his instincts and reached out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And what his hand grasped was...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"——...uuh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was completely unconscious. But she hadn't let go of her sword.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As the light faded, Hijiri was also lying nearby, collapsed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha's holy sword was unscathed, without a single scratch or crack despite the immense impact.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But her body was in terrible shape. Her armor was shattered, and the underlayer was torn, revealing her bare skin. Her chest was gouged and bloodied, making it hard to look at her for reasons other than her nudity. Her right arm was also shattered, with bones protruding in places.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Gently laying Sasha down on the ground, Haise picked up Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"M-My... vi-victory...!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri was in tatters.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Both of her arms were shattered, swollen and dark red from the elbows to the fingertips.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her entire body was battered and bloodied. Yet, Hijiri's eyes still gleamed fiercely.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her determination to win... Haise raised his hand and declared to Geist and the others.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This match goes to Hijiri!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And so—the battle between Sasha and Hijiri came to an end with Hijiri's victory.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri, still conscious, and Sasha, completely unconscious.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The result of the match was clear.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Apollon lightly tapped Sasha with his staff, and her wounds, clothes, and armor were completely restored. Similarly, Hijiri's injuries were fully healed by Apollon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As their wounds healed, both of them opened their eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh... Reynold?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ahhh!! Sasha, I'm so glad you're okay!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Piasora... and Tycoon, Robin?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good work, Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Great job. That was amazing!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Surrounded by her comrades, Sasha stood up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She looked at Hijiri, who was already on her feet, and then at Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This match goes to Hijiri. In the final blow, Sasha was completely unconscious, but Hijiri was still conscious. Her determination to win... Hijiri was superior."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha looked down, but Hijiri stepped forward and grabbed her face with both hands.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't look down. Got it? You were insanely strong. I don't feel like I won at all. If I'm gonna win, I want to crush you completely. So, sorry Haise. I'll leave the title of strongest with you for now. Once I beat Sasha in a way that satisfies me, I'll come for you!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright. Understood."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh... Could you let go now?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, we're doing this again. I'll train even harder, and we'll fight again!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri grinned and finally let go of Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha laughed with a "Hah!" and thumped her chest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Next time, I'll win. Thanks to you, I realized something... I lack experience in one-on-one combat. Just watch... I won't lose next time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmph, that's interesting."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha thrust out her fist, and Hijiri bumped her own fist against it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Mmm~!! The birth of a rivalry!! So intense!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Apollon. Shut up for a bit..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist pushed Apollon aside and stepped between the two.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This match goes to Hijiri. Neither of you disputes the result, correct?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""No.""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With the referee's declaration, the duel was over.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise turned to leave, but at that moment—<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wha—!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri jumped onto his back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Like I said earlier, just wait a bit longer. Next time, I'll crush Sasha completely and then come for you!! You were right, after all. Sasha is strong!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"H-hey, get off me!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why? Hehe, just so you know, you're the one I'm most interested in. I kinda feel like you're even more dangerous than Sasha. Hehehe, my blood's boiling!! Hey, where's your place? I'm moving in with you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? Hey, get off!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri's chest pressed against Haise's back as she clung to him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Presea grabbed Haise's arm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let's go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, go on your own. Stop pulling me!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea silently pulled his arm. She seemed a bit sulky, though Haise couldn't be sure.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then Sasha approached.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Hey, Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-what?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I wanted to know why you egged Hijiri on, but you seem... busy. Hmph... Well, fine. I'll get the story out of you later."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Busy? Does this look like I'm busy?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With Hijiri clinging to his back and Presea pulling his arm, Haise felt like he was in a troublesome situation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"See you later."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Sasha returned to Reynold and the others.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise managed to peel Hijiri and Presea off him. Then Geist and Apollon approached.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're quite the... popular one, aren't you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A real lady-killer, huh? Hehe, reminds me of young Geist."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Please, spare me..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Haise. You better take good care of Sasha, okay?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Take care of her?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hehehe. I like you. Let's have tea together sometime!! Bye-bye now~! Mwah!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eek!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise barely dodged Apollon's kiss and hid behind Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good grief... Anyway, let's go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yeah... Ugh, I'm exhausted."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. That was an incredible fight. It's been a while since I've seen a battle between master-class fighters."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"True. I never expected Hijiri to be master-class."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri was chatting with Presea, laughing cheerfully. She pulled Presea's arm and joined Sasha and the others, then loaded Sasha and Presea onto the carriage she had arrived in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise. You're in for a rough time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh... I thought it was just Sasha and Presea, but now Hijiri might join the mix."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...??? What do you mean?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just an old man's ramblings. Let's get going."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist started walking toward the carriage, leaving Haise puzzled and tilting his head in confusion.</p>
