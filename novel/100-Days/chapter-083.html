<p><p>Extra Chapter thanks to Gus on Ko-fi<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The Day After the Party／Returned to Everyday Life</p><p><br><br></p><p>The day after the party.</p><p>"Haaa～～～……"</p><p>"Hey, Piasora, don't let out such a gloomy sigh."</p><p>"Shut up. I'm feeling really depressed right now. Could you not talk to me?"</p><p>The regular meeting of Team Sacred had ended.</p><p>Then, Piasora let out a big sigh and slumped onto the desk.</p><p>As Reynold tilted his head, Sasha spoke up.</p><p>"Speaking of which, Piasora, you've been down lately."</p><p>"Uuu～…… Sasha, you really pay attention to me, don't you～?"</p><p>"Hey, hey, just a thought, but could it be related to that bald guy?"</p><p>"Bald guy…… Robin, that's the Cardinal of the Church you're talking about."</p><p>Tycoon adjusted his glasses. Piasora, still slumped on the desk, spoke.</p><p>"That's right. My former boss, the head of the Church with the ability of the [Holy King]…… I just can't seem to handle him. It's like, how should I put it…… he's scary."</p><p>"Bwahaha, Piasora's scared? Seriously?"</p><p>"Reynold, don't make fun of her."</p><p>Scolded by Sasha, Reynold waved his hand dismissively, saying, "Yeah, yeah."</p><p>He had also come to greet Sasha. A former S-rank adventurer who was in the same class as Geist, he now also managed the clan Asclepius.</p><p>The Cardinal of the Church, which manages the [Healing] ability users under the Heiberg Kingdom. He possesses the most powerful healing abilities among them, capable of even limited resurrection of the dead.</p><p>In fact, Sasha had personally experienced that power.</p><p>"An incredible healing ability. It's rare to see something like that."</p><p>"He's several levels above me in healing. He can use my ultimate skill, [Messiah Raiser], just by waving his staff."</p><p>"Hmm, then why are you scared? I can't understand that."</p><p>Tycoon looked at Piasora suspiciously, and Piasora turned her face towards him.</p><p>"Well, that face…… it's scary."</p><p>"……That's it?"</p><p>"Th-that's it, you say…… Aren't you guys scared!? He's a mass of muscles, always smiling, with tattoos, scary when he laughs, and looks like a girl……!!"</p><p>She lifted her face abruptly and addressed everyone.</p><p>"I don't mind. He's big and muscular, and I thought he looked like a frontliner, but that's it."</p><p>"Me neither～? I saw him eating a big fruit platter in the town square before."</p><p>"I don't mind either. Everyone has their own tastes, right?"</p><p>"Hmm. I don't mind either. In fact, I felt he was quite strong. I'd like to spar with him once."</p><p>"Wh-what……"</p><p>It seemed that Piasora was the only one who was scared.</p><p>◇◇◇◇◇◇</p><p>The day after the party.</p><p>Haise was drinking tea in the small dining area on the first floor of the inn.</p><p>Though it's called a dining area, it's just a small partitioned space next to the reception counter with a few chairs and tables for meals.</p><p>It seemed to have changed a bit while Haise was away.</p><p>Sipping his tea and reading the newspaper, he found an interesting article.</p><p>"Huh? Oh…… Reynold's going to become an S-rank adventurer."</p><p>There it was: 'Reynold, the shield warrior of Clan Sacred, on the verge of promotion to S-rank adventurer.'</p><p>Indeed, given Reynold's abilities, it's only natural he'd become an S-rank adventurer.</p><p>Reading the article, there was even an interview with Reynold.</p><p>"'No intention of leaving the clan. I will continue to act as the shield warrior of Sacred'…… That's just like him."</p><p>Finishing the newspaper, he put it in his item box.</p><p>He placed a gold coin in front of the innkeeper, who was reading the same newspaper at the counter.</p><p>"One month extension. With newspaper and tea."</p><p>"……Sure."</p><p>After the biweekly transaction, Haise left the inn.</p><p>He headed straight for the adventurer's guild.</p><p>The request about the 'map of the floating castle' he discussed yesterday still seemed to be taking time. Soon, Team Sacred would likely send a request to Haise.</p><p>Until then, Haise would act as a regular adventurer.</p><p>Arriving at the guild, he saw a familiar face.</p><p>"Huh? Haise, is that you?"</p><p>"……As slow as ever, huh."</p><p>It was Hijiri and Presea.</p><p>Both holding request forms, they seemed to be waiting for the reception to open.</p><p>Haise casually raised his hand, and for some reason, the two came over.</p><p>"There are no good requests left. Mine's the strongest monster subjugation!!"</p><p>On Hijiri's request form, it read: 'Subjugation Rating S+ Killing Viper Subjugation.'</p><p>It seemed a giant snake monster had taken up residence in the large swamp on the way east.</p><p>"Not as strong as Sasha, but it should be fun. See ya～"</p><p>Hijiri cheerfully headed to the reception.</p><p>Presea silently showed her request form.</p><p>"……Baobab fruit gathering. Rare, but easy for me."</p><p>"Uh, I didn't ask……"</p><p>With Presea's [Spirit Summoning], she could usually find anything. Presea herself was quite strong, so unless she went to a particularly dangerous place, there was no danger.</p><p>Presea fluttered her request form as she headed to the reception.</p><p>Finally alone, Haise went to the already empty request board.</p><p>"Hmm…… What to do. Actually, there are quite a few requests left."</p><p>Currently, there are about three hundred clans in the Heiberg Kingdom.</p><p>Many requests are brought directly to them, and Clan Sacred also receives numerous requests. Yet, the adventurer's guild still gets plenty of requests.</p><p>Are there not enough adventurers, or are there just too many people in need?</p><p>"Well, I'll just do what I can."</p><p>The request Haise picked up was for the subjugation of Fire Orcs appearing on the southern road.</p><p>◇◇◇◇◇◇</p><p>"You…… You overdid it."</p><p>"Ugh……"</p><p>The Fire Orc corpses Haise brought to the dismantling site totaled seven.</p><p>All of them were torn in half, mangled, with most of their internal organs missing.</p><p>Daimon, the head of the dismantling site, held his head.</p><p>"Fire Orc meat is a delicacy and a high-end ingredient, but it's no good in this state. Only the bones are left for good broth…… but with them this mangled, all the bones combined would only make up one set."</p><p>"R-really?"</p><p>"Ten gold coins. What'll it be, cash or card?"</p><p>"……Cash."</p><p>"Here you go."</p><p>Daimon took out ten gold coins from the dismantling site's safe and handed them to Haise.</p><p>Fire Orcs.</p><p>When Haise arrived on-site, they were attacking a merchant family's carriage. The carriage was wrecked, the father severely injured by the orc's fists, and the young children were trying to protect their parents.</p><p>Haise silently deployed his AA-12 shotgun. Firing in full-auto, the orcs' bodies were blown apart, and he took down all seven in an instant.</p><p>Afterward, he took the father to a doctor, saving his life, and the family was relieved.</p><p>Haise took out a wooden box from his item box and showed it to Daimon.</p><p>"Daimon. Do you know what this is?"</p><p>"Huh? This is…… Lycan Spider silk. Common fabric, but what about it?"</p><p>The wooden box contained torn fabric.</p><p>There were twenty more boxes like this. These were the merchant family's cargo, which Haise had collected and stored in his item box.</p><p>"Also, about this carriage, can it be repaired?"</p><p>"Whoa!?"</p><p>Haise brought out the broken carriage at the dismantling site.</p><p>"Hey, we're a dismantling site. Repairing isn't our specialty…… but I'll do it for an extra fee."</p><p>"Ah, you look evil."</p><p>"Well, it's a side job outside my duties. Let's see…… Hmm, this should take about an hour. Materials and repair fee included, one gold coin."</p><p>"Alright, thanks."</p><p>"Welcome. Hehe, thanks, Haise. How about a drink tonight?"</p><p>"Sure, but it's on you."</p><p>"Sure, sure."</p><p>An hour later, Haise stored the repaired carriage in his item box and left the dismantling site.</p><p>◇◇◇◇◇◇</p><p>Haise headed to a small hospital for commoners.</p><p>There, the merchant's family was. The father's treatment was done, and the children looked worried.</p><p>Haise knocked on the hospital room door, and the merchant's wife opened it.</p><p>"Ah, you are……"</p><p>"Hello."</p><p>"Ah, onii-chan!!"</p><p>"Cool onii-chan!!"</p><p>"Hey. How's your dad's injury?"</p><p>"He's fine but…… Dad's in pain."</p><p>Haise went to the merchant.</p><p>He seemed to have injured his leg and was bandaged.</p><p>Noticing Haise, he tried to sit up, but Haise stopped him.</p><p>The wife took the children and left the room.</p><p>"Adventurer. Thank you for saving our lives……"</p><p>"Skip the introduction. Let's get to business."</p><p>"……Huh?"</p><p>"I'll buy all the cargo from your carriage. Ten gold coins. And I'll cover the missing part with the carriage repair."</p><p>"……What?"</p><p>Haise placed ten gold coins on the table, opened the window, and took out the carriage from his item box.</p><p>"W-wait. Ten gold coins, that's…… more than ten years of my earnings."</p><p>"Buy something nice for your kids. They were trying to protect you and your wife when you were injured."</p><p>"Eh……"</p><p>"With ten gold coins, you can buy a horse and live comfortably for a while. See ya."</p><p>"Ah, wait!!"</p><p>Haise left the hospital room.</p><p>Then, the children lined up and handed Haise a small silver coin.</p><p>"Onii-chan, thank you for saving us!!"</p><p>"This is mine and onii-chan's treasure. I'm giving it to you."</p><p>"……Alright, I'll take it."</p><p>It seemed to be an old silver coin from some country.</p><p>Haise accepted it and put it in his pocket.</p><p>"Take care."</p><p>Haise patted the child's head and left the hospital.</p><p>Playing with the silver coin in his fingers, he put it back in his pocket.</p><p>"Now then, let's grab a drink before heading back……"</p><p>Haise stretched and headed to Hermine's bar.</p></p>
