<p>Heracles 1<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"HEEEEEEEEEEEY!!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The door of the Adventurer's Guild was flung open with such force that it came off its hinges and crashed to the ground.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was the time between noon and evening. If it were an early-bird adventurer team, they would have already completed their quest and returned to report. Today, every team had finished their tasks early and returned to report.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus, the Adventurer's Guild was crowded. And everyone turned their attention to the person who had just burst through the door.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Among them were Haise and Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'm Hijiri, the strongest S-rank adventurer from Uron in the west! My alias is Heracles! I heard there's the strongest adventurer in this country, so I came all the way here by marathon! Now, uh... what was it again? Dark something, uh... Hamper? Come out!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her voice echoed loudly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Everyone in the guild turned their attention to Haise, who had been talking to Miina.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea, standing next to Haise, chuckled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"She's calling for you, Hamper-san───ow!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise flicked Presea's forehead.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea teared up, holding her forehead, and pouted.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise said.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ignore her. That idiot looks like trouble if I get involved."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But, Haise, she's... a super beautiful girl, you know? Hehe, she's on the same level as me, Presea-san and Sasha-san."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then, I'm leaving."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're ignoring me again..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise decided to avoid the idiot girl───Hijiri, who was asking the adventurers in the guild, "Where's the strongest!?" and said to Presea,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, I'll pay you to make me disappear."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don't need money. But... if you treat me to dinner..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............Fine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Deal."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea snapped her fingers, and a spirit clung to Haise, making him invisible.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise tried to walk past Hijiri confidently with Presea and leave the guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───Wait."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Hijiri stood in front of Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea was startled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just a moment ago, Haise and Presea had walked right past Hijiri. But... suddenly, Hijiri was in front of Presea, and her gaze was fixed on Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're there, aren't you? You're strong. Are you the 'strongest'?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............Seems like it's pointless."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea snapped her fingers, and Haise's figure reappeared.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri stared at Haise and approached.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............Wow, you're scary. You reek of death. And you're covered in scars... nice."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What do you want with me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise took a closer look at Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was shorter than Haise, slightly taller than Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her hair was silverish. But not the shining silver like Sasha's; it was more of a grayish silver.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her long hair, reaching down to her waist, was tied in a ponytail.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her eyes were a deep green, and her face was undoubtedly that of a beautiful girl, but the way she grinned, showing her teeth, made her look more like a mad dog than cute.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her outfit was unique. A sarashi covering her large chest, a jacket with exposed shoulders, her midriff bare, and iron-plated fingerless gloves. She wore spats and short shorts, with iron-plated boots.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just by her appearance, it was clear. Hijiri was a martial artist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'm Hijiri. The strongest adventurer."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're the adventurer who conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm... Your story has reached the west. A master-type ability user, aiming to be the strongest adventurer all by yourself. Just like me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You get it, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri thrust her fist toward Haise's chest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, she tried to lightly jab Haise's chest... but.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Private fights are prohibited in the Adventurer's Guild."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a snap, Geist grabbed Hijiri's hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was surprised but didn't show it. Presea and Hijiri were shocked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What the..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is it you? The adventurer causing a ruckus in the guild. Sorry, but I need to check your card."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...You're dangerous too. But even more interesting."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri handed over her adventurer card. It was unmistakably proof of an S-rank adventurer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist returned the card and said to Hijiri,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I'll say it again, private fights are prohibited."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Right. Then, I'll post a request."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri briskly walked to the center of the Adventurer's Guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, she shouted loudly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"S-rank adventurer Hijiri is posting a request!! The request is for a subjugation quest!! The target is me!! The reward is 5,000 gold coins!! And I'll throw myself in too!! I'll do anything──tea serving, chores, carrying luggage!! Any adventurer confident in their skills, come at me!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She pulled out a request form from her pocket and slammed it on the counter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Process the request."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yes, ma'am!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miina hurriedly processed the request.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Officially, the 'Subjugation Request for S-rank Adventurer Hijiri' had been issued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No complaints now, right? You there!! If you're aiming to be the strongest adventurer, don't you dare run from my challenge!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri pointed at Haise and grinned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What a mess."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Presea had come to Hermine's bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sitting at the counter, they placed their orders... and a somewhat bitter citrus cocktail, perfect for Haise, was served.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea, drinking the same thing, said,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That girl, she's an idiot but not a fool. She knows you're the strongest adventurer, so she made that move."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Adventurers confident in their skills will challenge her. And she'll beat them. If that keeps happening, the weaker adventurers and bystanders will think, 'If only Haise, the strongest adventurer, would step in.' If you don't, they'll think, 'Haise is running away because he can't win', and your reputation will suffer."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"For a while, adventurers challenging her will flood in. A to B-rank ability users blinded by the 5,000 gold coins, or S-rank adventurers wanting to test their skills. And while private fights between adventurers are prohibited, there's no problem if it's in the form of a request. It's already been accepted and posted on the board."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Haise. What are you going to do?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What can I do... I'm not interested."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Really? Your reputation might take a hit, you know?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's even less interesting. I'm not fighting to be praised by anyone."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm... Well, well, I wonder what will happen?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? What do you mean?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're the 'strongest,' but... there's another famous person in the royal capital, right? Your childhood friend, for example."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise finished his cocktail and ordered another.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sasha, who had heard about the commotion at the Adventurer's Guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...S-rank adventurer, 'Heracles, Hercules'... challenging Haise?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. That's what it seems."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Currently, Reynold was in Sasha's office.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The other members were all busy with work. Reynold, having finished his tasks for the day, had invited Sasha out for a meal.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha's work was also nearly done. She was thinking of going to a nearby pub street with Reynold for the first time in a while when Reynold told her about the incident at the Adventurer's Guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Do you know her? S-rank adventurer 'Heracles, Hercules' Hijiri."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. I've heard rumors."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>S-rank adventurer 'Heracles, Hercules' Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Like Haise, she was a solo adventurer who had conquered several high-difficulty dungeons alone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While Sasha and the others were challenging the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, she had conquered seven A-rank dungeons by herself. For a time, she was called the strongest adventurer, but after Haise conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, he took the title, and her reign as the strongest was short-lived.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A seventeen-year-old martial artist with a silver-gray ponytail, they say."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Silver-gray..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Your hair is a beautiful, shining silver, while hers is more like iron, a grayish silver."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"B-beautiful...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yeah. Your hair is beautiful. No doubt about it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"R-really...? Thanks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The conversation drifted, and the two fell silent for a moment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Being suddenly called beautiful, even Sasha was flustered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, well, anyway, that's the kind of person she is. I know she's from Uron in the west, but that's about it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see... Well, no big deal."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just then, there was a knock on the door.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold said, "Yeah, come in," and a flustered member of their clan entered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"S-Sasha!! It's bad!! Some weird girl is saying, 'I need to talk to Sasha'!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...What?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"She knocked out the seniors who tried to kick her out...!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha stood up and headed to the clan home's entrance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There, several A-rank adventurers were lying on the floor. And there stood the silver-gray ponytailed girl.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Who are you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah... sorry, I just tapped them and they went down. So, are you the clan master?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I asked who you are."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A golden aura enveloped Sasha as she drew her sword and pointed it at the intruder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The troublemaker, Hijiri, shivered with excitement.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wow... you're good too. But, uh, this is bad. Listen, I'm Hijiri. I'm really sorry about these guys... I heard at the guild that there are other strong adventurers besides Haise, so I came to meet this Sasha girl."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I am Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wow, really!! Hey, hey, won't your clan take my request?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...What?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri happily smiled and pulled out a request form.</p>
