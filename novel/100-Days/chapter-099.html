<p>S-Rank Adventurer's Guidance 4<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was troubled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Umm..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Non-lethal bullets—riot-suppressing rubber rounds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Since he couldn't use live ammunition against the students this time, he opted for these rubber bullets... but they were far less effective than he'd expected. A hit to the limbs wasn't enough to take a student down.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So, it was double the work: using rubber bullets to suppress while relying on hand-to-hand combat to knock them out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But that wasn't all.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The students were stronger than he'd anticipated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Now, what should I—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"HAISE, MOVE!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next instant, Hijiri flung a hulking student straight at Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Startled, he barely dodged in time—only for an arrow shot by another student to graze his armband, tearing it off.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Damn it..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"GOT IIIIIIT!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A boy caught the armband... and just like that, Haise lost.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We did it!! We beat an S-Rank adventurer!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Woooh!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"VICTORYYYYYYYYY!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The students erupted in excitement.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Around twenty had come for Haise—all of them now cheering.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise raised both hands and spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"My loss. Good work, everyone."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"""""THANK YOU SO MUCHHHHHHHH!!"""""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise smiled, not a trace of bitterness in his expression.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Presea approached with a towel.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good work."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, thanks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As he wiped his sweat and took a drink, a few female students stared intently at Haise and Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Finally, one of them spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"U-Um... by any chance, are you two dating?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hah?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I mean, Presea handed you the towel and drink so naturally..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It looked super smooth, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We're not dating. We just understand each other well enough that we don't need to."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""""Eeeek!!"""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, don't say weird stuff."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise shot Presea a glare before turning his attention to the remaining S-Rank adventurers' battles.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri was wreaking havoc, while Geist fought silently.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A stark contrast—Sasha mused as she deftly handled the attacks of twenty-five students coming at her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She thought to herself:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>(How interesting...)<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There were a hundred students in total—twenty teams of five, with five teams assigned to each S-Rank adventurer. If any one of those five teams snatched the armband, they'd clear the challenge.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Most teams charged in with the mindset of "Our team will take the armband!"... but the five teams (twenty-five students) facing Sasha moved as one, coordinating flawlessly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha's eyes landed on the boy giving orders from the back—Sein.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Shield team forward, sniper teams spread left and right, vanguard team surround Sasha, rearguard team assist... yeah, like that. Go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They were relaying commands via someone's ability, maintaining perfect coordination.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The vanguard team encircled Sasha, supported by the rearguard, while snipers positioned themselves in her blind spots. Somewhere among them were a few students lying in wait to target the armband.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Impressive teamwork for an impromptu unit, Sasha noted approvingly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Miko, wielding a wooden greatsword, stepped forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, here I come!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miko's body glowed as an enchanter ally bolstered her with physical enhancement magic.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A lower-tier ability under Tycoon's [Sage]. Sasha coated her arms in a faint golden aura and blocked Miko's sword head-on.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Guh...!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good strength. But—still not enough."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh...!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha deflected the wooden blade with the flat of her sword, then drove a palm strike into Miko's stomach—splintering the greatsword in two.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah...!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"[Paladin], huh... A fine ability. But—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I’m not cut out for this, am I? Too small, can’t even swing a sword without help..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Miko. How much do you actually understand about your ability?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"[Paladin] is a composite ability—multiple [Swordsman]-type abilities combined. The most well-known style involves a greatsword and shield... but Miko, you should understand your ability better."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Sasha lunged forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She cut off the girl issuing commands, then isolated the shield-bearing student. A beast tamer rode a horse-like monster, providing support.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miko pondered what she should do.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............[Paladin]."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Miko first learned of her [Paladin] ability... her parents had told her, "Paladins are so cool! They fight with greatswords and shields, like true knights."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So, she'd wanted to be like that too.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She picked up a greatsword and shield... but couldn't wield both.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So, she settled for just the greatsword... but it was too heavy to swing properly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She paused—and thought.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She vaguely recalled reading it in an "ability manual" once.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The strongest blade-related ability was [Sword Master]. That was undisputed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The weakest was [Swordsman]... but [Swordsman] was compatible with all bladed weapons—no, any weapon with an edge.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Paladin] was specialized for greatswords and shields.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But that wasn't all.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"——...Ah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It hit her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She'd been fixated on the cool appearance—greatsword and shield.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But... [Paladin] wasn't just that.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Gwah!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The beast tamer boy was sent flying by Sasha's fighting spirit.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, the spear-wielding boy and axe-wielding girl had their weapons knocked away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Trusting her instincts, Miko—dashed forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She snatched up a fallen spear, then leaped onto the horse-like monster the beast tamer had been riding.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seeing this, Sasha smirked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"——I can do this!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Correct."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The [Paladin] ability wasn't limited to greatswords and shields.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It had aptitudes for mounted combat—equestrianism and spearmanship.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A spear wasn't as heavy as a greatsword. Even an iron one was manageable for Miko.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The horse monster obeyed her surprisingly well, neighing happily as she gripped the reins.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"YEEEEEAHHH!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miko was certain now—this was her style: spear and steed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She tightened the reins, urging the horse into a charge—straight at Sasha.</p>
