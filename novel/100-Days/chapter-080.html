<p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths・Congratulations Party for Clearing 1<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise returned to the inn and changed into formal attire.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A shabby inn. Haise had rented two rooms. One was for storing tools and clothing, and the other was a bedroom with just a bed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After changing, he looked at himself in the mirror.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He touched his eyepatch and hesitated over whether to switch to a decorative party eyepatch he had prepared.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was something Geist had bought for him, but he thought it wasn’t necessary and left the room as he was.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When he went downstairs, the innkeeper was reading a newspaper at the counter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I don’t need dinner. I’ll be back late.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……Alright.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By the way, the innkeeper lived in the main house behind the inn. At night, the inn was completely unmanned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise received the key to the inn’s entrance and left.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Faaah…… I’m sleepy.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As soon as he left the inn, he wanted to go back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reluctantly, he walked to the central road of the royal capital, where a carriage stopped.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As if aiming precisely, it stopped in front of Haise, and when the coachman opened the door…… there were Presea and Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Get in.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……Your timing is too good.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I just got a message from the spirit I attached to you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Huh!? You’re still putting weird things on me!?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Just kidding.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, hurry up and get in! Delicious food is waiting for me!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…………”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise reluctantly got into the carriage.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea and Hijiri were sitting facing each other. He hesitated over where to sit but, not wanting to have another spirit attached to him, sat next to Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah, I wonder what kind of food they’ll serve. Sasha said she’d prepare a feast.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Is food all you think about?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Of course. I really don’t like wearing these frilly clothes.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri was wearing a one-shoulder dress. It was a pale purple color, with a necklace and earrings, and her long ash-silver hair was tied in a ponytail. She kept tugging at the chest of her dress, revealing even more of her cleavage, causing Haise to look away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……It’s obvious what you’re looking at.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No, I wasn’t.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea seemed somewhat sulky.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was also wearing a dress with a thin veil and one shoulder exposed, perhaps a traditional elven outfit. Her chest was slightly smaller than Hijiri’s, but her smooth white skin looked quite alluring.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Hijiri grinned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise, here!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What!?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri suddenly clung tightly to Haise’s arm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm hmm. Haise is bad with women. This might be good data!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……Hijiri, that’s indecent.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hehe. I don’t really care about that stuff. Haise is currently the 'strongest', so I want to try all sorts of things with him.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……Tch.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, let go.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What’s the big deal? I’ve been told I have a 'nice body,' and men like that, right?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri pressed her chest against his arm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise made a disgusted face and moved away from Hijiri. Then, reluctantly, he sat next to Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This time, Presea clung to his arm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“H-hey.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, let go.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmph.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea tightened her grip.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri, amused, sat next to Haise and took his other arm. Unable to move, Haise sat there with a displeased expression as they headed to the Clan Seikrid clan home.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Clan Seikrid’s clan home.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Currently, a new headquarters was being built on the outskirts of the royal capital. The current base in the capital was being used as the Hivelberg Royal Capital branch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Over the next few years or decades, Clan Seikrid would grow even larger. It was one of the five great clans, and the number of joining teams was still increasing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When they arrived at the clan home’s entrance and Haise got out of the carriage, he was greeted by……<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yo, Haise.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Reynold…… I didn’t expect you to be the one greeting me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, Sasha’s busy. But still……”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold’s gaze turned to Hijiri and Presea in their dresses.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Aren’t you jealous? Huh?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I can guess what you’re thinking, but it’s not like that. Just show us the way already.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Guided by Reynold, they entered the clan home.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They were led to a large building next to the training grounds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside, a large number of people were happily chatting.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This is the party venue. Chancellor Bonnet had it built when the clan home was being constructed, saying it would 'be necessary'…… I never thought it would actually be used.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold said this, then added, “Do as you please. Just make sure to greet Sasha,” before leaving.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As soon as Reynold left, noble ladies, middle-aged nobles, and adventurers immediately surrounded him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Alright, I’m gonna eat my fill!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri headed for the table with the food.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea, standing next to Haise, said,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll keep an eye on her. She might get the borrowed dress all messy with sauce.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Make sure to greet everyone properly.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You’re annoying, just go already.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea chuckled and went after Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was left alone. He took a glass of wine from a waiter and stood by the wall.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Casually looking around the venue, he spotted a few familiar faces.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah, Geist…… ugh, Apollo too.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He saw Geist and Apollo talking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Tycoon joined them and bowed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Apollo waved his hand…… and Piasola, with a pale face, forced a smile and curtsied toward Apollo. It was the first time Haise had seen the usually brazen Piasola look so frightened. Apparently, she didn’t like Apollo.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin had already joined Presea and Hijiri and was eating with them. The friendly Robin would probably get along with Hijiri quickly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, the doors to the party venue opened.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Oh, you’re all here. Hahaha, it seems I’m the last one.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Father, please don’t get too excited.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That’s right. You’re the king of a nation, so act with more dignity!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hahaha. My apologies, Cress and Myuane.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The king, Cress, and Myuane arrived with their guard knights.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Everyone, including Haise, bowed. Then, Sasha hurried over.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Prince Cress, Princess Myuane, welcome.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was wearing a beautiful blue and silver dress.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A stunning silver-blue dress that fit her body perfectly. She wore a thin veil over her exposed shoulders. Since Presea and Hijiri were dressed similarly, Haise thought it might be a popular style among the women of the royal capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hahaha. I’ve been looking forward to today. Right, Cress?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Eh, ah…… yes.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm? Hahaha!! Sasha, it seems my son is captivated by you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Eh……”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“F-Father!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hehe, big brother is so shy.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“~~~~”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cress turned red, and Sasha’s cheeks also flushed, perhaps out of embarrassment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Reynold stepped forward and bowed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, we have prepared seats for you over there.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm, I see.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold guided the three of them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He whispered to Cress, “Don’t lose,” and Cress muttered, “This’ll be interesting.” Haise wasn’t imagining it. And the king, who seemed to have heard everything, chuckled softly. That probably wasn’t his imagination either.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stood by the wall, gazing blankly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…………I’ll leave soon.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His wine glass was empty, and he looked for a waiter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then───he made eye contact with Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……Ah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise lightly shook the wine glass in his hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For some reason, Sasha smiled happily.</p>
