<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-23"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 7 &#8211; What is Love?</h1><p class="calibre2">&mdash;42 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On a cloudy morning…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche! I believe you were able to meet Baron Aljerk safely! So, do you have any other worries?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m doing well. Thank you for introducing me to the baron. Thanks to you, my father made a new friend, so I’m not worried anymore.”<br class="calibre4" /><br class="calibre4" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;41 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then on a rainy morning…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche! Today, there’s no need to hesitate! Just say what you want!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m doing well. I have no other worries today. Even if there were, I won’t admit to them in public. I still have modesty, after all.”<br class="calibre4" /><br class="calibre4" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;40 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once more on a sunny morning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, come here! Let’s talk about your worries! I’ve reserved the entire cafeteria for you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m doing well. Unfortunately, home room will begin in five minutes, so let’s talk on another opportunity.”<br class="calibre4" /><br class="calibre4" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;39 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even on a slightly chilly morning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche! Today, your homeroom teacher is off! You’ve studied enough, so let’s go to the cafeteria!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m doing well. However, I’ll have to I’ve been feeling morose lately due to always failing to respond to Your Highness’ invitations, therefore, I’ll have to excuse myself…”</p

<br></br>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;38 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Again, on a morning with a strong breeze&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Good morning, Lelouche! This is such a great morning! Hence why&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Oh, if it isn’t Your Highness. I’m doing well. That’s right, the weather is very nice today. It’s a day where I can aim for more. For some reason, my homeroom teacher has been forced to use his paid leave every day this week. I feel a bit lonely, so I’d like to resolve this feeling through self-studying, excuse me…”<br class="calibre4" /><br class="calibre4" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;37 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, a morning where I could go to the academy without being called out to by weirdo arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was rude to refer to him as a weirdo, for he was the first prince, Sazanjill, of the Lapisenta Kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless, being ambushed by your unfaithful partner at the academy’s gate every morning was disconcerting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Somehow, his habit had become an academy custom. Day by day, he attracted even more attention from the students. Behind the scenes, it seemed that bets were being made over whether or not I’d turn down His Highness’ concerns. It was commonly referred to as ‘Today’s Pick-up Line from His Highness.’ Well, even if it was called gambling, the rewards were a glass of juice at best. Besides, it wasn’t very likely anyone would ever win that bet in the first place, so I pretended to not notice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, more and more people seemed to be taking part in the betting. Other than that, I didn’t know much because I believed His Highness should be the one to deal with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…So, how many people could’ve expected that day’s development?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche! I’ll have you talk to me today!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…He rushed into my class. I wasn’t the only one who expected that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I thought, he had resorted to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had expected him to arrive along with my homeroom teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While listening to him, I answered while continuing to face forward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness Sazanjill, I’m doing well today. But right now, I’m in class? And I believe you should be as well? Shouldn’t His Highness be taking exam about world history at this time?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ve already answered all the questions! The teacher was surprised, but can’t say anything about it because all my answers were correct!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Even though it has only been three minutes since class has started?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">What excellent academic ability, one truly suitable for the next king&mdash;but wasn’t it also a waste of talent?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I replied bluntly while facing forward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But as you can see, I’m in class. I’m sorry, but let’s discuss this at some other time.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But you don’t have time in the morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because I’m on my way to school.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You also don’t have time during lunch break.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That is a precious time when His Highness Zafield teaches me swordsmanship.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;or even after school!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have study sessions with Lumiere.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, how about our next day off?! I’ll pick you up at the Elcage Family residence!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll be work in the fields from early morning. After eating my mother’s specially made breakfast, I intend to practice swordsmanship. After having lunch, I’ll be going into town with my father to look at some seeds. I’m also planning to go to the house of Baron Alban to speak with Ms. Lumiere, and then go home again to enjoy my mother’s exquisite dinner. I don’t have time to see Your Highness.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was talking, I heard a voice from the corridor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why, if it wasn’t Lumiere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did she leave her class to take a peek?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ‘voice’ I heard wasn’t a scream, either, but an utterly bizarre noise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Even though she’s a noble lady.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Alright, I’d point it out to her later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loud footsteps were approaching. When he finally came to my seat, His Highness Sazanjill struck my desk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I still spoke while facing forward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness, that scared me. Why did you make such a loud noise from so close up?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You don’t look scared at all?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s not the case. I’m crying in fear on the inside?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, why don’t you show it on your face?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because I’ve been educated as a lady, thus I won’t be unnecessarily emotional.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Listen to what I say!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll return those words as they are.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Just come with me, already!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness, who had run out of patience, strongly pulled my arm. His Highness Sazanjill, who was said to be weaker than his younger brother, was still a man in the end. Even if I had some training, I couldn’t shake him off due to inherently being weaker.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wondered if it was time for me to get angry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as I began to exhale&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;My brother, how unsightly of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield, who was stronger than him, separated us. Naturally, His Highness Sazanjill glared at His Highness Zafield.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s none of your business! Don’t get in the way!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But it is, for you are obstructing our lesson.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t recall having a younger brother this enthusiastic about studying.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm, then frankly, as an older brother, should you be exposing your younger sibling to such an abomination? Couldn’t you at least be a little smarter in persuading your fiancée?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s because Lelouche is&mdash;!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“To blame her&mdash;is that the best thing you can do?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield coldly said that and turned towards the corridor. Lumiere was trying her best to maintain her posture. I had to commend her bravery for remaining there despite having already been half-crying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although, again, that was a waste of bravery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, the dishonesty of His Highness Sazanjill was well-known to everyone. Feeling awkward, His Highness Sazanjill diverted his gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Alright, let’s have our discussion on some other opportunity. I’m sorry for disturbing your precious study time.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a regretful expression, His Highness Sazanjill went back. His wide back looked unprecedentedly lonely… Before I knew it, guilt had crept up on me. Thus, I looked down.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">During lunch break, in the corner of the training ground where the swordsmanship club was practicing, I was training in gym clothes under the supervision of His Highness Zafield.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you very much. I’m still unable to fend him off myself. It seems that I still have a long way to go.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, a lesson on self-defense would be perfect for you. Hey, why don’t you stop practicing swordsmanship and do that instead? I think it’ll be more beneficial.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thanks for the offer, but…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite his sensible words, for him to say such a thing while charging at me, His Highness Zafield must be quite a devil himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is my 10th day of passive training. Today, too, I was made to fall splendidly, and my uniform is stained with mud.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Can you intercept an assassin through self-defense, though?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I stood up at once and brushed the mud off my skirt. As a result, the second prince’s usual playful expression became reluctant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, as lady, not much is expected of you in that regard. If that happens, just run away.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That won’t do. It’d be perfect if I could catch the assassin. If I can’t, then at the very least, the one to flee should be the assassin, not me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I wouldn’t be wearing that uniform often, it shouldn’t matter. Still, I wondered if it was alright to let it get so dirty…</p>
<p class="calibre2">After being advised by His Highness Zafield, I started to wear trousers under my skirt. It was faster than changing clothes. In the Kingdom of Lapisenta, no women wore trousers, so I couldn’t even remove my skirt. Even so, I bought a new one despite knowing I wouldn’t get to wear it much…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I hadn’t really worried about money until then. However, I started feeling concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I contemplated such a thing in the corner of my heart, His Highness’ extended his muscular arm and grabbed mine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It hurt terribly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Tha, that hurts!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Such slender arms, who’re you trying to protect with them?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While frowning, I looked up towards His Highness. He wasn’t laughing. But he wasn’t angry, either. With a slight furrow between his eyebrows, his blue sapphire eyes looked deeper than usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For some reason, I no longer felt the breeze was pleasant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m still a candidate for the crown princess. Being the target of envy and resentment is a daily occurrence for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’d believe that if I didn’t know how smart you are. If your intention is to escape with someone, then that would be the worst-case scenario. Perhaps, you’re thinking that if you’re the only one who dies, then it doesn’t matter? Is that the reason why you want to take measures for ‘repelling’ an opponent in case of an emergency?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">How sharp…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I must had been distracted by his laidback attitude and failed to pay attention to my own remarks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Still, for him to be able to guess that far, remaining calm would be difficult for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, let’s admit it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I brushed away the locks of hair on my shoulder and raised the corners of my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I just want to protect my beloved fiancé at all times.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s just foolish&mdash;!!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">There’s no need to yell at me like that…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Look, everyone’s staring at us…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Also, please let go of me.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Without any concern towards our surrounding, His Highness Zafield grabbed my shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’re kidding, right? He betrayed you&mdash;no, he <em class="calibre3">is </em>betraying you. You do know that, right…? He plans to annul your engagement at the next dance party. Are you going to risk your life for such a man?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness, the way you refer to both your brother and me, isn’t that a bit rude?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had no fan as of the present. Therefore, I hid my mouth with my hands. Even though I performed it in such lady-like manner, I didn’t receive an apology or sarcasm from His Highness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness strengthened his grip on my shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I like Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I also hope to be able to get along fine with my brother-in-law for a long time.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’re fully aware that’s not what I mean.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed. As to the praise I was given earlier, I was no fool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hence why, I gracefully tilted my head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t understand. I’m merely saying what I’m supposed to say as the fiancée of His Highness Sazanjill.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness released me and turned away. He was more trained than His Highness Sazanjill, and should be about the same age. But for some reason, he looked… <em class="calibre3">small.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Is it because of his age?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…You did well on the passive training.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Starting from tomorrow, I’ll teach you how to deal with it. Mainly how to avoid. Assassins basically attempt to kill in one blow. I think that by being able avoid fatal injuries, your chances will expand.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, the bell of preparation for starting work rang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though I tumbled down numerous times, I didn’t feel any pain. Only the part of my arm and the shoulders that he had grabbed stung. There were traces of red fingers on my arm.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">That night, god was acting strange.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Is there something on my face?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Staaaare.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">God kept staring at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I were to be stared at so seriously, I’d be nervous, right…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially when the other party had an extraordinarily good-looking face. I liked to think that after meeting the royal siblings, I was accustomed to beautiful faces. Still, god was exceptionally beautiful. Maybe it was due to the background… regardless, he was beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">God spoke as I turned away.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Are you stupid?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I received that same rant earlier in the day.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I want to say the same, as well. Really, how foolish. Why won’t you focus on your own happiness? That prince’s younger brother is a good man. His brother is unfaithful to you, so why don’t you just switch to him? You may not be able to get married in the end, but if you are able to find true love and are happily taken care of, then what’s the problem? Isn’t that a very happy ending?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What part of that is a happy end?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">But pointing that out would have been foolish. In the end, I only sighed. It was my usual respond.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, god didn’t understand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Well, that’s to be expected of you. It may go against your pride as an aristocrat to be unfaithful. But please give me a reason. Why do you refuse to give yourself a distraction to heal from your wounds? Why don’t you just travel to various places? It shouldn’t be a problem for you to just be honest with your desires and spoil yourself.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m not particularly interested in doing any of that.”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/ncn5Kz8/193688.jpg" width= "345;" height= "470;"></img>

<p class="calibre2">“Do you love the second prince’s older brother that much?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like I said to His Highness Zafield during the day, I respected how serious and hardworking His Highness Sazanjill was. But that didn’t seem to be what the god was asking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, I couldn’t lie to a god&mdash;<em class="calibre3">so let’s just be honest.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The thing that is commonly known as love… I honestly never thought about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“In your mind, there’s no one in particular?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because love had nothing to do with me. Ever since I had been born, my marriage partner had already been decided. It was also common for men to have concubines, as it was with women having various lovers. Not to mention, I was about to be married into the royal family. There was also the issue of succession&mdash;which, of course, was out of the question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Hence, love was unnecessary. I was destined to love only His Highness Sazanjill for the remainder of my life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards such a me, god spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…What a pitiful person.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…I couldn’t understand what he had said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Pitiful? Who?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I merely acted my part as the duke’s daughter, someone who was born to be a princess, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">besides, the one who decided such a fate for me&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;wasn’t it you?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I pretended to be oblivious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Who are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Don’t be angry. I just want you to have a happy ending.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within me, something snapped.<br class="calibre4" />“&mdash;It’s none of your business!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ahh, why isn’t there anything around right now?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Be it a glass, or a fan, it didn’t matter. I felt like throwing stuff at the man who could only talk in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What was wrong with me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, god.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I smiled gracefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even then and in the past&mdash;hadn’t I lived earnestly as a candidate to become duchess and the princess? Did I do anything wrong? Did god have any problems with me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m dying in thirty-six days, what more do you want?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I shut my quivering lips. If I were to speak any longer, I wouldn’t be able to retain my senses. I wouldn’t be able to stand on my own two feet until the end&mdash;that was what I felt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of my distorted vision, I didn’t know what kind of face god was making.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Sooner or later, ‘death’ is a path that everyone must take. Hence, you can do whatever you like.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">His voice was very gentle&mdash;which made me feel even more miserable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;36 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the next night after having that quarrel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, god, I thought I wouldn’t be able to meet you today.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…You didn’t want to see me?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, how unusual, you’re turning away from me?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">If that’s what you’ve decided, then I won’t hold back.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I didn’t say that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Hmm.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">He sneaked a glance at me, before averting his gaze once again. It probably wasn’t my fault.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;35 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The night when I fell down violently during my practice of sidestepping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Hey, are you going to talk to me today?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“It isn’t like I was ignoring you yesterday?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right, but… what are you so upset about?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I’m not upset at all.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">That’s a lie!? He’s definitely upset!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, god refused to drop his stubbornness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you a child?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, god snorted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“A god doesn’t have the concept of age. If you think god is a child, then he is a child. If you think that god is an old man, then he is an old man.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What a quibble.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">That might be true, but isn’t that still mean!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;34 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That night, I made some consecutives appointments with Lumiere for that weekend. She was so happy, she cried.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Hey…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I said, hey.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if god spoke to me, I’d remain silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was payback. I would keep turning away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I kept doing so&mdash;at last, god put his foot down.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“What an attitude! I’ve never ignored you, but now you’re giving me the cold shoulder!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But you only say mean things.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t help but say something about his childish behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre2">God, who paused, straightforwardly asked me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Do you want me to act more concerned about you?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“You’re the one who said that it’s none of my business, didn’t you?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I didn’t say I didn’t like it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Didn’t like what?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I mean, your advice is pretty unnecessary, but I didn’t say I didn’t like your concern.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Wow, what selfishness.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was probably my fault.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, it couldn’t be helped because it felt good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I could turn away once again, god asked me in a very gentle voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Do you like the second prince’s older brother?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He’s a hard-worker. I think that he’s suitable as the future king.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“That’s not what I’m asking. I’m asking if you love him as a man.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I exhaled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Isn’t that kind of thing unnecessary?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wondered if he’d call me pitiful again…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I involuntarily revealed the emptiness I felt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But, if I could experience that feeling…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t say anything beyond that. It couldn’t be helped&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">oh? Wait a minute…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“God, do you remember our initial promise?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Our initial promise? A gamble for your death to be beautiful?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right. It’s still in effect, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">God firmly nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Depending on my death, I could get what I wanted in my next life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had come up with something very good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was able to laugh again, “Fufu…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“What? That smile, it feels ominous.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“God, why are you scared of a lady? Also, how rude.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Giving a casual reply to god, who withdrew a step, my mood steadily rose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was truly looking forward to 31 days from then on!</p>
<p class="calibre2">But before that, I still had something to do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As for this weekend, it’s a fun three-day holiday!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Can such a schedule be called that?”</em></p>
