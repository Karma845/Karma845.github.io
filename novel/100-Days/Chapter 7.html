<h2>Short Story: Special Discount on the Master and Disciple</h2>

<p>Occasionally.</p>

<p>Really just occasionally.</p>

<p>The Master sometimes stays overnight at the &quot;Zohuo Pavilion&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Master, excuse me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't I say you don't have to come over, stupid rabbit?&quot;</p>

<p>I walked to the silent corridor at night, opened the door a little nervously, and what came to me was an indifferent voice.</p>

<p>Deep in the room with only furniture such as a bed and a table, Master... Mr. Hedin was reading a book.</p>

<p>He didn't turn on the magic stone lamp, but relied on the moonlight shining by the window and crossed his long legs.</p>

<p>Looking at his figure and the movement of turning the pages of the book, even though he is also a male, it can't help but be fascinating. He really is like a noble among goblins.</p>

<p>I stood there blankly, and my master looked at me dismissively and said, &quot;If you have nothing to do, leave as soon as possible. Your shameless face is really hurting my emotions.&quot; I felt the zero-second thunder bullet (Carrus Hill) The breath of Germany made my face turn livid at the speed of sound. I entered the room and closed the door within zero seconds. Of course, not a single sound was made.</p>

<p>After a moment of worry as my hands were occupied by the plate, I timidly approached the Master.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh...how many people came today...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Twelve kidnappers and four groups. That's a few today.&quot;</p>

<p>Oops. Miss Haruhime is done. Her level is not high enough.</p>

<p>Faced with the attack rate from different dimensions in the past few days, my tone became unstable and my eyes became dim.</p>

<p>At the same time, I also feel from the bottom of my heart that it is great that Master and the others are able to protect Haruhime-san and Home. Maybe the first-level adventurer (me), ninja (Ms. Ming), and fighting prostitute (Aisha) can handle it alone, but they will definitely not be able to concentrate on dungeon exploration and other activities. There is no doubt that thanks to Master and others, we can live a life that has not changed much from before.</p>

<p>Like today, the Master (occasionally Mr. Hegney, Mr. Fan and others) lives in the &quot;Zahuo Mansion&quot; to protect Miss Haruhime&#9472;&#9472;to be precise, to protect the former top bounty leader (Miss Ryuu). ), including the entire [Hestia Familia]. Needless to say, during the day, the residence and its surroundings were on guard all night.</p>

<p> Fortunately, the original owner of this mansion [Apollo Familia] was a big family, so there were still some empty rooms left in the &quot;Zohuo Mansion&quot;. Although it cannot be compared with F&oacute;lkvangr, Master and the others did not have any inconvenience in staying overnight.</p>

<p>Although the Master completely stated to Kami-sama that he refused to contact him and used an empty room to eliminate the aura, Welf and others were a little confused, &quot;Is there really someone here?&quot; and could not feel the other party's presence. It does not attract our attention in our daily lives at all. No, it has reached a level where it does not even attract our attention.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;This alert status will remain in place for a period of time&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Alfric-san and the others, who were guarding the residence like Master and others, said so.</p>

<p>The public reaction to level upgrading (upgrading)&#9472;it should be said that the reaction is expected to continue for a while, and it seems that this system will be implemented during this period. However, Ms. Seele has been coming to the stronghold (Home) whenever she gets the chance recently, so I also think that the super iron wall protection of the tough warriors (Enheria) will not change...</p>

<p>So, um, this will also happen.</p>

<p>When Master and others stayed at the residence, I would go to the kitchen alone every night and visit him with midnight snacks. This has become my daily routine.</p>

<p>&quot;You kid is really ungrateful!&quot;</p>

<p>In order to avoid hindering my reading, I slowly put the plate on the table - it was the reheated meal made by Miss Ming who was in charge of cooking tonight. The Master looked up from the book for the first time. to me.</p>

<p>I looked back into those coral vermilion eyes and put a hand behind my head, speaking my mind frankly.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for your great care...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you want more abuse and unreasonableness?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>I was speechless.</p>

<p>Indeed, what I experienced was very harsh, harsh, and harsh. If I had to do it again, I would put aside my dignity and even kneel down to apologize and say &quot;please forgive me&quot;.</p>

<p>It's just...now that I know that all this is for Miss Seele, I can't resent or hate her under any circumstances.</p>

<p>There is no tenderness in the severity of the Master. Although he is very, very strict and stern, being too strict can even make people feel scared. However, the incredible thing is that I don't feel &quot;cruel&quot;.</p>

<p>I think that while excluding harshness and the like, I want the growth of &quot;Bell Cronny&quot; to be recognized by this person more than anyone else.</p>

<p>Maybe... I hope he will say &quot;this fool is my apprentice&quot;?</p>

<p>Because only the moment when he was called the &quot;idiot disciple&quot;, like thunder bursting out, could his heart be so shocked.</p>

<p>(However, it&rsquo;s just that I look forward to it, but the Master is different...)</p>

<p>Although the Master who still treats me coldly has no sense of guilt, my service seems to be &quot;irreconcilable&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot; with the words and deeds I have committed in the past.</p>

<p>So he hated my cares so much.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that you don&rsquo;t accept me, it&rsquo;s that you can&rsquo;t forgive yourself.</p>

<p>Miss Xier once told me a story from a long time ago. There is no doubt that this man was once a &quot;king&quot;.</p>

<p>He is a very scary, very smart, very arrogant fairy knight who is not like a &quot;king&quot; and takes great care of others.</p>

<p>This must be what the gods call &quot;tsundere-senpai or boss-like&quot; guy. Just as I was thinking this and staring at him, he said, &quot;What's that look in your kid's face?&quot; It&rsquo;s unpleasant!&rdquo; Then he kicked me. And I could only let out an ugly scream.</p>

<p>He fell to his knees and suffered for a long time.</p>

<p>Master has always refused to eat late-night snacks.</p>

<p>This is the same as usual.</p>

<p>So I stood up and proposed the &quot;compromise plan&quot; I had prepared in advance.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, 'equivalent exchange'...can you give me some guidance and training from time to time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>Master's eyebrows curved into a surprised shape for the first time.</p>

<p>&quot;As long as it's when you have time. I want to exercise in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Just like when dating Transformation (Training) and Battlefield (F&oacute;lkvangr).</p>

<p>I said that with a smile.</p>

<p>Master just stared at me quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, you can't use [magic] only in the mansion...! No, it can't be done?&quot;</p>

<p>I added hastily.</p>

<p>&quot;...You greedy guy.&quot;</p>

<p>The Master, who had been stopping his movements, finally bent the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay. Since you demand that level of price, I accept it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, really!? Thank you Master!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I won't show mercy. You have to be prepared.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;good!&quot;</p>

<p>After I thanked him, I nodded happily.</p>

<p>Suddenly remembering that I would wake up Welf and the others, I hurriedly covered my mouth with both hands, but Master closed his eyes and bent the corners of his mouth, remaining calm, and reached for the plate.</p>

<p>Right in front of me, quietly and elegantly drinking soup.</p>

<p>I was really happy and couldn't help but smile on my face.</p>

<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s to the morning special training with Master, come on!</p>

<p>&#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;Bell...? Why...are you in the atrium with [White Demon Wand (Hilderslev)]...?&quot;</p>

<p>&#9472;Come on, that's what I originally thought, but...</p>

<p>The moment I met the fairy lady holding a wooden sword in the atrium in the early morning, all the joy and warmth I had felt yesterday disappeared, and my whole body became cold to the extreme.</p>

<p>Specifically, it was because of the confrontation with Ms. Liu&rsquo;s sky-blue eyes that had lost light and warmth.</p>

<p>&quot;From now on, this stupid rabbit will be trained by me. It's none of your business [Hayate], get out of here!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Asshole...bastard! There's no way Bell would abandon me and choose you! What you did is too harsh! Bell, Bell's training opponent in the morning should be me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why haven't you noticed that he dislikes your gentle manner, little girl?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ms. Lyu, Lyu!? Master!? Why are we arguing!? Isn't it good for the three of us to train together!?&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Lyu immediately raised her wooden sword, while the Master looked down at her with contempt, his slender chin pointed toward the sky.</p>

<p>The atmosphere between the two of us had reached sub-zero temperatures. I hurriedly tried to mediate, but the icy cold air still did not disappear.</p>

<p>Not long after, the training of the double fairy, which seemed to be in opposition and had no trace of tolerance and compassion, began. I was involved in it and screamed, almost dying.</p>

<p>&quot;It's Bell-kun's fault.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Bell-sama's fault.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Bell's fault&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I, I don't know much about the bond between master and disciple...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A master's love is sometimes more passionate, harsh, and unyielding than a lover or partner, Haruhime-sama...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Bell deserves it!&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Lady Hestia, Lily and Welf who were visiting the atrium sighed, Miss Haruhime was at a loss, Miss Ming looked at me with a discerning look, and Mr. Alfric and others who were guarding the residence looked at me. Being treated as a metabolite, I laughed.</p>

<p>I just wanted Master to eat, but I didn&rsquo;t expect it to be so difficult! ?</p>

<p>I thought that if a first-level adventurer who was also a fairy joined me, I would be able to gain something for Miss Liu, but I didn't expect that I would be so wrong! ?</p>

<p>While my heart screamed, before my consciousness was cut off, I heard the nostalgic motto of my grandfather.</p>

<p>&quot;That guy was raised by me...&quot; Everyone must want to say this. &#12303;</p>

<p>Master's love is very warm and severe... It's really very heavy, Grandpa...</p>

<p>&#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;Bell...two? Three? Three boats? Are you having an affair...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not true&#9472;! Miss Ais&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;...!!&quot;</p>

<p>Someday after that.</p>

<p>After learning about Master and Lyu-san's morning training, I could only continue to defend Miss Ais miserably and loudly towards the pale-faced girl who was beyond despair.</p>

<h2>Short Story: Special Conviction! Atonement! Tomorrow or the accident, no one knows which one will come first!</h2>

<p>&quot;Guwa!?&quot;</p>

<p>Snap! Hestia's angry slap (slap) exploded on the left side of Ciel's face.</p>

<p>&quot;Boohoo&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ufu!?&quot;</p>

<p>Boom! Lily's projectile head (rocket head) directly hit Xi'er's abdomen.</p>

<p>&quot;This, this...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Haruhime-san is really gentle.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally poof! Haruhime patted Seele's forehead with one hand and made a cute sound.</p>

<p>Xi'er closed her eyes tightly, and in her heart, she rubbed her painless forehead against this Renard girl who was desperately seeking revenge, with an expression that was difficult to cope with.</p>

<p>[Hestia Familia] Headquarters (Home) at noon, a room in the [Zohuo Mansion].</p>

<p>Xier visited there and held a &quot;implementation meeting&quot; as an &quot;apology meeting&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu... It was just an apology meeting in name, but I was severely beaten... It turns out that Hestia-sama and your conscience faction are all lies... ugh~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you talking about! I hope you can thank me properly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes! Just treating you like this is already too light!&quot;</p>

<p>The young girl group (loli group) scolded Xier who covered her cheeks and belly with her hands and pretended to cry loudly.</p>

<p>Now, Xi'er is admitting and reflecting on her actions from the &quot;Goddess Festival&quot; to the &quot;Faction War&quot;, and &quot;settling&quot; with all parties. Not only the &quot;Goddess Alliance&quot; headed by Hestia and others, other factions also went there and were being punished in various ways. Specifically, he was forced to be an errand boy for the goddesses, serve free of charge (free entertainment) for the male gods in the tavern, and was currently slapped by Hestia, etc.</p>

<p>The family members (Ota) will never be allowed to accompany them, and only Seer herself can make atonement.</p>

<p>&quot;Although I will no longer engage in corporal punishment, I (servant) will not be as tolerant as Hathor and the others! I (servant) will dump this queen who has dumped a boy (Bell-kun) for the first time in 600 million years. The shame and humiliation suffered by (Freya) was used as a joke in his life to make fun of him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lady Hestia, what a cruel act this is...!&quot;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be hahaha soon! Haruhime showed a trembling expression in front of Hestia and God's Scale, who was about to laugh at the extremely shameful declaration. For the eternal God, this is indeed the ultimate punishment. Lily, who looked like a younger brother next to the main god, also said proudly to Freya, &quot;You really deserve it!&quot;</p>

<p>Xi'er, who had accepted the punishment obediently, now had a look of displeasure on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;...Is that okay, everyone? Maybe I am 'your future' right now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...? W-what?&quot;</p>

<p>Looking at Seele who stood up slowly, Hestia and the others felt a terrible sense of foreboding.</p>

<p>Seele, who has been obediently accepting the punishment so far, will not talk about the others for now. However, it is another matter if the other party is thinking about Bell's &quot;people who share the same position&quot;. The warrior (girl) who failed in love began to seize the opportunity to tell the truth.</p>

<p>&quot;My current fate is the result of a once-in-a-lifetime adventure called &quot;Confession&quot;! It is also an inevitable path for everyone who fell in love with Mr. Bell, or fell in love with him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Well!?&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come to think of it, Lady Hestia, Miss Lily, and Miss Haruhime all couldn't find the courage, and couldn't even confess! I, who died on the battlefield, and all of you who didn't even stand on the battlefield, should really be laughed at. Which one is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;That, that's...!?&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I declare! You, Hestia-sama, are the losers of this era... no, you are the 'heroine losers'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;F-heroine loser&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;!?&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>thunderbolt! Hestia and the others, who were ridiculed for not having the consciousness to fight (the heroine's power), were struck by a violent lightning strike. It seems that the situation has been reversed, but in fact it is just a change of argument. I can only admit who is more &quot;superior&quot; as the love warrior (female protagonist) or the current sequence.</p>

<p>&quot;...Fortunately, Lord Welf took Lord Bell out...&quot;</p>

<p>Xi Er and others who have started the ugly love warrior (female) debate have a distant look on their fate, who have been waiting to see what happens until now.</p>

<p>The title is taken from Henry Slesar's short story &quot;The Countess' Jewel&quot;</p>

<p>I feel like it would be more appropriate to translate it into Unpredictable Things Tomorrow. Why is the title so long?</p>

<h2>Short Story: The great goddess (Iden) declares that this is &quot;Youth (Aoharu)&#9734;&quot;</h2>

<p>&quot;[Ability value] update? Well, this is not something that can be done casually. Maybe I have said it before, combat duty Preferential treatment is given to those who wish to participate in the combat skills discipline, and &quot;God's Favor (Pharna)&quot; is updated as a team. It is scheduled regularly. However, if you want to do it individually, you must apply through a dedicated document, so please be careful. If not If you apply as early as possible, your application will be pushed back to one month later, and this may happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I see... No matter how many gods there are, the number of students is still too astonishing.&quot;</p>

<p>Soon after enrolling in the &quot;School District&quot; (tentative), I spent every day asking Nina questions that I still have. While I thanked her for teaching me various things like a teacher&#9472;&#9472;I was overwhelmed by the amount of information&#9472;&#9472;I just made some notes on the notepad I received.</p>

<p>at this time. A student who was eager to get ahead happened to pass by nearby and accidentally bumped into Nina's back.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nina!&quot;</p>

<p>I quickly walked around to the front of her who was knocked away, and caught her firmly.</p>

<p>The moment she was reassured that she was not injured, Nina's ears gradually turned red as she buried her face in my chest. I also felt ashamed and blushed at the soft body touch. My ears hidden inside the wig were also very hot. I put my hands on Nina's shoulders and hurriedly let go.</p>

<p>&quot;A-are you okay, Nina?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, um... It's okay, but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Um, Miss Nina?&quot;</p>

<p>Nina looked coy and shy, then stared at my head motionlessly.</p>

<p>Moreover, he glanced slightly at the waist area.</p>

<p>Not long after, she suddenly became a little disappointed. What, what happened?</p>

<p>&quot;I, I, because Mr. Leon still has something to call me, should I leave first? Sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>I felt a little embarrassed and left there to hide my shyness.</p>

<p>&quot;Alas~...&quot;</p>

<p>After the rabbi left, Nina sighed unusually.</p>

<p>Rabbi: Derived from the English Rabbit, that is, rabbit</p>

<p>The human girl caught her like that in her field of vision and talked to her.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong, Nina? You're an honor student, and you sigh like you're in love trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Love, love...!? No, Alyssa-senpai!...I think it's different...&quot;</p>

<p>After the &quot;supervisor student&quot; of [Badelban], who was older than her and wore glasses, pointed it out, Nina's face turned red and her voice quickly became deeper. The girl called Alyssa pushed up her glasses and smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;As the president of Mr. Leon's fan club, I know all about the scent of love! Come on, let's talk about it!&quot;</p>

<p>Facing the senior sister who was gradually approaching, Nina couldn't hold on anymore and blushed, and started to speak coyly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well...just now, in places like dungeons, our bodies were quite close to each other...but Rabbi-kun, neither his ears nor his tail reacted at all...&quot;</p>

<p>Rabbi Fremethio is an orc. The orc's emotions and inner activities are easily expressed on the ears and tail.</p>

<p>But as for him, although he was shy on the surface, his ears did not twitch and his tail did not wag. Even the students of the Youth (Aoharu) Club, where the goddess (Iden) serves as an advisor, issued this instruction: &quot;If the beastman you like doesn't even twitch its ears and tail, just give up.&quot;</p>

<p>Although I don&rsquo;t know if this kind of heartbeat is love, but if the boy she cares about is not attracted to her at all, even Nina will feel disappointed. &quot;Am I not attractive?&quot;</p>

<p>He is pretending to be shy, could he be a pervert (playboy) who plays with women's hearts? Nina even had such thoughts.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, that new student. Although he is very serious and has good conduct, he does have an incredible feeling.&quot;</p>

<p>The supervising student put his finger on his chin and added &quot;but&quot;, and then showed a smile on his face like a senior who is teasing a junior.</p>

<p>&quot;That kid must be harder to conquer than Mr. Leon. Although this is just a girl's intuition, that's how it feels!&quot;</p>

<p>Rapi Flemish: Should I say it intentionally or not? Rapi Flemish, in my poor English, it looks like Miss You, Freya misses you?</p>

<h2>Short Story: Enough of the special bonuses, stop it, Royman's stomach (life) has long been destroyed [Hestia Familia] Rank (Rank) B (S).</h2>

<p>This is recorded in the documents issued only among the guild's senior leaders and extremely restricted staff.</p>

<p>Then, as one of these extremely restricted staff, Eina stared at that sentence and gave up thinking for a while.</p>

<p>Guildmaster Royman stared at her standing in the center of the butler's office across the luxurious table with an expression as if he had bitten a bitter insect. He held the stomach medicine bottle tightly in his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me, this is...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's nothing we can do about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's really nothing we can do!&quot;</p>

<p>Faced with Royman whose tone collapsed, Eina shed a ray of sweat.</p>

<p>The guild leader, who was about to grit his teeth at any moment, yelled as if he was losing his temper.</p>

<p>&quot;You want to say that this decision is an exception! Haha, right!? I've never seen a Rank like a child fooling around!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, it's not that far yet...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, haven't we all said there is nothing we can do!! No matter how many times we discuss it within the top management, the result will be the same! If God Freya is a subordinate god, we have to make this judgment...!!&quot;</p>

<p>Loyman, whose tone and emotion were as damaged as ever, roared at Eina, and she couldn't help but sympathize with him until she felt that Loyman was being unreasonable. In the [upgrade] process of the adventurer (Bell)&#9472;&#9472;when the growth model (Model) was proposed, I experienced this kind of attack many times, such a feeling of self-defeat or wanting to go crazy.</p>

<p>The guild leader has also joined the ranks! Smile! But I couldn't laugh at all.</p>

<p>On the surface, no, the official information was B, and he was treated like an S by the guild&rsquo;s senior management. Eina turned her attention to this decision again. Since it was Bell&rsquo;s business, she asked about it.</p>

<p>&quot;...How should the guild's tax be handled?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not a devil, so let's treat that as B! Even though I'm a subordinate god, I can't see a future where God Hestia can control Freya's faction...!&quot;</p>

<p>of course</p>

<p>How is it possible?</p>

<p>&quot;What's going on, that Familia...! It's unheard of...! Even if we put aside the [Freya Familia] in advance, what a weak faction does will not cause serious damage to the city. Shock it...! What do you mean by first-level adventurers joining from the road!?! There is a huge difference in strength between the upper and lower factions...!&quot;</p>

<p>One side is Lv. 5 and Lv. 6. The other party is Lv. 2&rsquo;s supporters and blacksmiths.</p>

<p>Although Royman's words can be understood very well, the following (all members of the group) have reached Lv. 2 time point.</p>

<p>As a [Familiar], it is exceptional. And the so-called support jobs such as supporters, sorcerers, and blacksmiths, not adventurers, have been [upgraded], which quite meets the needs.</p>

<p>In short, it is difficult to deal with and judge. guild.</p>

<p>&quot;How many special cases need to be made...!! I really want stomach medicine...!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>That kind of thing starts with the world's fastest rabbit (record holder), doesn't it?</p>

<p>Eina didn't say that. Watching from afar.</p>

<p>Loiman, who collapsed on the table and clutched the stomach medicine tremblingly, moaned and groaned continuously from the execution room.</p>

<h2> Special Edition Song of Thoughts at Dusk</h2>

<p> &quot;Onii-sama~!? Where are you, nya~~~~~~!!&quot;</p>

<p>It's really annoying.</p>

<p>Allen heard his sister (Ania) looking for him everywhere from downstairs, and he complained in his heart.</p>

<p>Sure enough, you shouldn't lose in the Aar Game. Allen was very upset and thought so at the same time.</p>

<p>&quot;No matter how much I crush these traitorous ants, my mood still cannot calm down...&quot;</p>

<p>After that &quot;Faction War&quot;, she regained her identity as a girl (Xie'er). Until she knew Allen's true meaning, the foolish girl's passion (Passion) was unstoppable. After losing the headquarters (Home), in order to protect Seele, Allen, Heron and others lived next door to the &quot;Plenty Mistress&quot;. Aniya was looking for him who was guarding the tavern.</p>

<p>&quot;I really want to be close to you, nana-sama! I really want to bask in the sun and roll around with you, nana~!&quot;</p>

<p>It's really a pressing situation. Allen was very unhappy about this. Seeing himself like this, the four shitty brothers also laughed at him and said, &quot;&quot;&quot;Brother&#9825;&quot;&quot;&quot;, which made him feel extremely unhappy. The conflict broke out in order to deal with them, and the Black Fairy (Hegney) who tried to mediate shed tears many times. &quot;It will cause trouble for Xi, Miss Xier and the tavern...!&quot; The most infuriating thing is that Muscle Brain (Ota) silently suppressed this scene.</p>

<p>He held the silver gun that he couldn't hold back, clicked his tongue, and moved to the roof of the tavern with light movements.</p>

<p>Opposite the huge city wall, the setting sun is about to disappear.</p>

<p>Seeing the sunset's light dyeing the city red, Allen narrowed his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I really want Onii-sama and I to be like the two of us in the past, nya~~~!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...You and I haven't had a good relationship since childhood, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Aniya flew out of the tavern, crying for her brother who could not be found.</p>

<p>Allen looked down and muttered shyly.</p>

<p>Before being taken in by the goddess, Alan tried to beat Anya several times.</p>

<p>I have tried to abandon my stupid sister many times. Although it was an attempt, it was all true.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is simply ridiculous for me to be playing the &quot;brother-sister game&quot; now.</p>

<p>After the War Game (Aar Game), Alan did not have a good conversation with Aniya. There was no intention to do so. From then on, while serving as a guard, he trained himself in the dungeon, heading towards the black end. For my sister who already has a destination, I am redundant as a chariot. Must be redundant. Otherwise, that fool would become one side of the chariot, supporting the wheels and chasing Eren. To prevent this from happening, Alan decided to get rid of Aniya.</p>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;Although he had already made this decision, the girl (Xie'er) looked at him with a smile and said, &quot;One day I have to be more frank.&quot; This made Allen very angry.</p>

<p>It seemed that everything had been seen through, and Allen became anxious.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, let's sing the song of memories with Onii-sama, nya! Onii-sama, nya is here, nya!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, idiot, stop it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The surrounding area has become a street of death&#9472;&#9472;&quot;Lost lost kittens&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;&#9834;~~~~!!&quot;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472; Meow meow aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Alan was thinking about that, Aniya's Disaster Music Recital began on West Street in front of the pub. Lunova and Chloe, who were only one step away from being able to stop them, screamed in pain, and people and horses passing by on the street fell down one after another. The corners of Allen's eyes twitched, and the cat ears on his head drooped.</p>

<p>The harsh singing echoed throughout.</p>

<p>To the point of being unpleasant. To the point of being unpleasant. Even to the point of being infuriating.</p>

<p>The younger sister had no idea what her older brother was thinking, and sang songs wherever she went.</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Allen turned away.</p>

<p>In order not to be noticed by my idiot sister, I moved to the center of the roof, put the spear on my right shoulder, and sat down.</p>

<p>The eyes covered by bangs must have looked very unhappy.</p>

<p>The slightly raised smile at the corners of his mouth was probably an illusion created by the dusk light.</p>

<p>Just like before, the cat kept his back to his sister's song and listened intently.</p>

<p>Note: The song Ah Meow sings comes from the popular nursery rhyme &quot;Paw Patrol&quot; on the Internet a few years ago.</p>
