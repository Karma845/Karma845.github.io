<p>Presea and Tycoon<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had finished his shooting practice and was walking towards the royal capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Along the way, he passed several carriages carrying large amounts of supplies. He glanced in the direction the carriages were headed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Come to think of it, Sasha's clan... they're building a new headquarters over there, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The clan Sacred was preparing for a fresh start.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Haise remained unchanged.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even after obtaining the title of Heavenly Noble, his daily life hadn't shifted much. He still ate breakfast at that rundown inn, browsed requests at the guild, took on any that seemed interesting, chatted with Mina after completing them, drank with Geist, had a drink alone at Hermine's bar, or occasionally drank with Presea... Having conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, his routine had finally returned to normal.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He had asked Geist to search for the remaining locations of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If any information surfaced, he planned to head out, but for now, there was nothing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yaaawn... It's a bit early, but maybe I'll have a drink at the bar."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise decided to head to Hermine's bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As he arrived at the royal capital's main gate, he spotted Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You... what are you doing here?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I finished a request and was just wandering around. Hey, it's a bit early, but want to grab a drink?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm... sure."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, let's go to Hermine's place."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Presea moved to Haise's side.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thinking it was fine, Haise started walking with Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then... they encountered a rather unusual individual.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? Tycoon?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hm? Oh, Haise. Perfect timing, I need to talk to you. You once read Ancient Script just by looking at the cover of a book I had, right? I want to ask you about that. Oh, I'll pay for the information. Where should we talk? How about my room at the clan?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-wait, calm down. Hold on, hold on... wait."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'm not a dog, you know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're not a dog. But you're wagging your tail. Even though you're part of the group that exiled Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I won't deny that. But still."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait, I said. This isn't the kind of conversation to have in the middle of the street. Sasha, of course, but all the members of Sacred are famous, after all."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Haise said this, Tycoon let out a grumble.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea clung to Haise's arm and said,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let's just ignore him and go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait, where are you going?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just to the bar."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then I'll join you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No, thanks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So, where is it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon was fully intent on following... Reluctantly, Haise and Presea led Tycoon to Hermine's bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh my, you brought a friend today?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No. He's a dog."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don't get it. Haise, what's with this elf?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea and Tycoon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Frankly, they might be the worst match possible.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignored them and sat at the counter. Presea sat to his right, and Tycoon to his left.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hermine, something sweet."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure. The usual?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. And for Haise too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Brother, what about you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Up to you. Now, Haise, let's get straight to it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait, I haven't even ordered yet. Hmm... I'm more in the mood for food than drinks. Master, a sandwich. And something light to drink."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, got it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While Hermine prepared the order, Tycoon pulled out a book from his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was written in Isekai script.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, who had been reading Nobunaga's books, could now understand almost all the characters.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, you. You're part of the team that exiled Haise, right? Why are you acting so chummy with him?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There was no malice in her tone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea knew why Haise had been exiled from Team Sacred. But she deliberately wanted to hear it from Tycoon's mouth, in front of Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hermine placed a cocktail made with squeezed fruit and brandy in front of Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In front of Tycoon, she set a glass of vivid amber brandy on the rocks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Naturally, the two didn't toast.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Exiling Haise was Sasha's kindness. At the time, Haise couldn't fully grasp his abilities. Frankly, he was a liability. He wasn't strong enough to keep up with the ever-growing Sacred. His life was at risk too. But... Sasha knew Haise wouldn't back down if told the truth, so she deliberately pushed him away. She thought if he despaired and gave up, he'd return to his hometown."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon spoke matter-of-factly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise said nothing, reaching for the sandwich that had been served.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But Haise, you didn't give up. That's why Sasha told you about that swamp, hoping it would help you. I'm sure you're tired of hearing this, but it was a complete accident... We never intended to trap you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I know that already. I know you guys... Sasha, didn't mean any harm."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But... Haise had nearly died.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He still hadn't forgiven them for disappearing without an apology.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When he woke up, Sasha was already gone... That much, he still remembered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After finishing his sandwich, he drank the fruit drink served to him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Finally, the main topic!! Tycoon set down his book as if to declare it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Now, let's get to it. Teach me these characters!! Ancient script... I've started to understand some of it, but most of it is still a mystery. Haise, I also want to know how you managed to learn this script. Oh, of course, I'll pay. One gold coin per character. I know you're not the type to deceive me. I'm not worried about you teaching me false characters. So, let's begin."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-wait, hold on. Calm down!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon pressed on relentlessly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly, Haise felt a sense of nostalgia. Back in the day, Tycoon would often push forward like this when something caught his interest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Tycoon's robe was yanked, and he let out a strange noise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is a bar. A place to enjoy food and drinks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea had ordered her 'spirit' to pull Tycoon's collar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon glared at Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is a bar. A place to enjoy drinks, food, and conversation. If you want to drink alone, go over there."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No. I was planning to drink with Haise. You're the one who barged in."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The two were clearly at odds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea had spent only a brief time with Team Sacred, but... she disliked Tycoon and Piasora. Or rather, she hated them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon, too, saw Presea as nothing more than a weird elf.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But it seemed they both saw each other as enemies interfering with their time with Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, let's have some alcohol, not just fruit drinks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait. Alcohol is fine, but reading this ancient text comes first. If I get drunk, I might not be able to make proper judgments."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That doesn't matter."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It does. What's with you? Just drink by yourself."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's my line."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As the two argued from either side, Hermine chuckled, and Haise sighed in exasperation.</p>
