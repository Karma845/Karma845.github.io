<p>Before the Battle<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After Haise left the Heiberg Kingdom with Presea<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha and her group arrived at a mining town.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After greeting the village chief and wrapping up the quest request, they started devising a strategy to take down the Crystal Golem.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They intended to rent an inn, but the mayor generously offered them an unused house instead. It was surprisingly spacious for a mining town and even had a bath—a rarity, as most homes lacked private baths and relied on public bathhouses.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“The mayor told me there’s a hot spring near this mining town of Lystal. The public bathhouse uses hot spring water, and apparently, this house’s bath does too.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“““Hot springs!!”””<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora, Myuane, and Robin shouted in unison.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon, startled, adjusted his skewed glasses and continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“They’ve installed pipes to bring the hot spring water directly here. Since the Dwarf Kingdom is nearby, a lot of dwarves mine ore for smithing in these parts. Their technology in this area is unmatched.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, let’s go to the hot springs!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Of course!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m in!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Are you three even listening to me?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The trio had already lost interest in Tycoon, their minds solely focused on the hot springs. Reynold then pointed out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“The hot spring’s in that room over there. Look, it even has dwarven-style decorations and a noren curtain hanging.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Let’s go, Myuane, Robin, Sasha!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>““Yeah!!””<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“W-Wait, I’ll pass for now. We’re in the middle of a discussion.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Uncharacteristically, Piasora stormed off toward the hot spring without worrying about Sasha. Left behind were Sasha, Cress, Tycoon, and Reynold. Tycoon was astonished.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Piasora left Sasha behind to go to the hot springs…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haha… Reynold, you guys are always like this, huh? We haven’t traveled together for long, but it’s never boring.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll take that as a compliment.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Phew.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha sighed and massaged her shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“For now, let’s call it a day. We’ve located the Crystal Mine, and with the area sealed off, no monsters will appear. We also need to rest and resupply before heading in.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah… I could use some rest.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…The operation should be in about seven days. What do you think, Sasha, Reynold, Cress?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That works for me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Same here.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Agreed. I’ll defer to the pros.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Team Sacred finally relaxed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold clapped a hand on Cress’s shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Cress, this is a big town. Let’s go out drinking for once—I’ll show you how common folk do it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“C-Can we? We’re taking on a quest in seven days, you know?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That’s exactly why we should recharge now. Right, Sasha?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. Go enjoy yourself, Cress. Drinking with Reynold is always fun.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, Tycoon, you’re coming too.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll pass. I want to check out the town’s library first—hey!?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold forcibly wrapped an arm around Tycoon’s shoulder and dragged him away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha, we’re off to bond.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Alright.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“W-Wait! I never agreed to any bonding with you!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This is great! Can’t experience this kind of camaraderie in a castle.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The three men left, leaving Sasha alone. She stretched.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I should…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She glanced toward the hot spring entrance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Come on, Myuane, stop squirming! Scrub scrub~!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Eek! Robin, w-where are you touching… ahh!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[I’ve heard smaller bodies are more sensitive—it’s true, isn’t it?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Y-You!! Just because you’re bigger—take this, this, and this!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Ahh!! Only Sasha’s allowed to touch there!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Bubbles!? Bubbles got in my mouth! Piasora, Myuane, stop—!?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The commotion was loud.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If she went now, she’d probably get caught up in some ridiculous chaos.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Maybe I’ll take a walk.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha sheathed her sword at her waist and stepped out of the house.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha strolled through the mining town alone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“The town’s lively…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Lystal, the mining town.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her initial image was of a place populated by miners and dwarves, bustling with rugged charm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But surprisingly, it had a lot of entertainment districts and eateries.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There were numerous dwarven workshops, weapon and armor shops, and accessory shops selling processed ores. Tool shops and inns came next, followed by countless eateries—about 70% of which seemed to double as taverns. At the town’s center, there was even a tourist information center.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha bought a town map and asked the guide a question.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This is also a tourist destination, then?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes. Many adventurers come from afar to commission weapons and armor from the dwarven craftsmen here. Additionally, as a midpoint to the desert nation of Dizzara, it sees a lot of traffic.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With the map in hand, Sasha wandered aimlessly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Hey, Sasha. When we become adventurers, let’s visit lots of towns and have adventures together.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What came to mind wasn’t her current companions… but Haise’s voice.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Instead of her present comrades’ words, it was the childhood promise with Haise that surfaced first. Sasha chuckled softly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Do I still have lingering feelings…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her thoughts drifted back to that night at the induction ceremony.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[It’s our dream. What’s the point if only you fulfill it? That’d make it just your dream. Don’t use me as an excuse.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Remembering that hurt her chest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was right—so painfully right.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her decision to exile him, rather than face the challenges together and uncover his ability, now felt like arrogance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…It’s already in the past.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She realized Haise would never accept such an apology.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So, instead of taking responsibility for his exile, Sasha resolved to move forward without regret, no matter how their paths had diverged.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Someday, when their paths crossed again, she would apologize sincerely.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No matter what he demanded, she’d accept it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Until then, she would continue fighting, becoming an adventurer who wouldn’t lose to him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Sasha relaxed her grip on the map, noticing she’d unconsciously clenched it, an event in a nearby park caught her attention.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Step right up! Here’s a rare metal excavated from the mines—Kokuyamagan! This stuff’s unbelievably hard! Is there anyone who can scratch it!?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Atop a platform stood a large black stone, the size of a small child.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A man wielding a massive hammer brought it down with a loud clang—but the stone remained unscathed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Break this, and you win a gold coin! Anyone feeling lucky?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll do it!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A young boy stepped forward, sword in hand, flanked by three companions cheering him on. He raised his sword high.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m a [Swordsman]! I’m new to adventuring, but I’m going to build the strongest team ever! Cheer me on!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The crowd roared with applause, their cheers bolstering the boy’s confidence.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Here I go!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He swung his sword with all his might.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Snap.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The blade broke the moment it touched the stone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“M-My Holy Light God Blade!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The clearly ordinary sword had snapped cleanly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Dejected, the boy was pulled offstage by his embarrassed companions.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Better luck next time! Alright, who’s next!?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll give it a try.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha raised her hand and stepped onto the stage.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, well, what a stunning young lady! Next challenger is this beautiful silver-haired girl!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The audience fell silent, captivated by Sasha’s beauty.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She glanced at the boy’s team.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Twelve, maybe thirteen years old… How nostalgic. I remember watching events like these and feeling inspired. I hope they feel the same.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Alright, go ahead!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a sharp breath, Sasha drew her sword.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A blur. A gust of wind. That was all most onlookers perceived.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The stone shattered into pieces.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Only seasoned adventurers noticed that Sasha had slashed the stone 22 times in one second, sheathing her blade seamlessly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The announcer gawked between Sasha and the shattered stone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“H-Huh…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Give the gold coin to those kids. Think of it as an investment in their future.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wait, what?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Goodbye.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The crowd stared dumbfounded as Sasha left the stage.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, I should head back. A soak in the hot springs sounds nice.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a stretch, Sasha walked toward the house they had borrowed.</p>
