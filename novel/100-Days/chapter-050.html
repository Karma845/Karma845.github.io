<p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths - Haise’s Journey 5<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and the Chaos Goblin descended to the lower levels from the residential area.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Below the residential area was like a completely different world.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The path seemed crudely dug by a giant mole, winding and rough.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The ceiling was over 20 meters high, and the width exceeded 30 meters. The walls glowed, making it bright and easy to traverse.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[I’ve told you many times, but from here on, there are no Containers like in the upper levels. You’re probably the first human to ever step into this area.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, that’s fine, but you’re just casually tagging along. And you’re even calling me by name.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise looked at the Chaos Goblin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was taller than Haise, with dark skin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It had no hair—seemingly no body hair at all.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its ears were long, and its bulging eyes gave it a menacing look. It was quite muscular.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though it wore a loincloth, it had scavenged the gear from the Chaos Goblin Haise had defeated earlier, now fully clad in armor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Two swords hung from its waist, a round shield in its right hand, and a spear strapped to its back—a complete full set.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You said you wanted to go to the lower levels, right?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Indeed. It’s the aspiration of our kind. We Chaos Goblins lived in the Residential Levels above. Hunting the beasts above to survive… Occasionally, fools would venture below, but none ever returned.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“And those same kin attacked me, and I killed them…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[That’s right. But don’t worry about it. We have no sense of camaraderie among ourselves.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That’s good to know. You can follow me if you want, but I’ll shoot you without hesitation if you interfere or attack me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise pointed his Desert Eagle at the Chaos Goblin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Chaos Goblin gulped and shook its head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[I-I have no intention of opposing you. I only follow because I believe you can lead me to a new world. Of course, I’ll repay you… I’ll share my knowledge. I know most of the beasts that appear here, including their weaknesses.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Weaknesses? If you know them, why don’t you just kill the beasts yourself?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[I can’t. I have no means of attack.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly, Haise stopped walking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Chaos Goblin stopped as well.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A strange, fishy smell lingered in the air, accompanied by a slithering sound.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[T-This is bad, Haise. The Cleaner is coming!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Cleaner?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At Haise’s question, something appeared at the end of the corridor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was… a giant Lamprey.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A round mouth. A body like a wet worm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its mouth was filled with jagged teeth, designed to latch onto prey, tear flesh, and suck blood.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[It’s a Devil Chandler!! A vicious beast that preys on others, feeding on their flesh and blood!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…It’s not even listed in the bestiary issued by the Adventurer’s Guild. If Tycoon saw this, he’d probably say, ‘Capture it alive!!’ and make a ridiculous demand.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Damn, this is bad!! Its weak point is the heart inside its mouth!! But without an attack metho—]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Clank!!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise materialized a massive rifle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“[Barrett M82 Anti-Material Rifle].”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The moment he pulled the trigger, Haise was pushed back a meter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ugh… that hurt.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Wha—]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A deafening roar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>BOOM!!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>An incredible sound echoed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Chaos Goblin stared in shock at the Devil Chandler, its head blown off as it collapsed to the ground with a heavy thud.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The bullet’s speed and power were so overwhelming that it couldn’t comprehend what had just happened.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise dropped the rifle and clutched his shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Too powerful… This isn’t practical. Anti-material… or rather, anti-usability… Get it? Hahaha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[…]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Forget I said that.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise started walking again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The joke was so bad it made him want to die.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But the Chaos Goblin didn’t care about that. It had made up its mind.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Following Haise was undoubtedly the right choice.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Haise!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What now?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Please, grant me a name.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Chaos Goblin stepped in front of Haise and knelt.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise tilted his head in confusion.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[That is all I desire. Please!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Uh… what?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Give me a name!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For the Chaos Goblin, this was a first.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its life had always been about eating, sleeping, eating, and sleeping.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even though it lived among others of its kind, they were just… there.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No conversations, no desire to talk. Just constant competition over food.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Chaos Goblins were the pinnacle of goblins, with strength and intelligence—but nothing more.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A life of mere existence.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But then Haise came along.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At first, it was just another hunt—kill and eat. But instead, it was almost eaten itself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Chaos Goblin had experienced something new.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This was a strong one.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not a mere struggle for survival, but an existence beyond it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Haise, you… have changed my life. Please, Haise, I beg of you!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Fine, fine… geez, what’s with you?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise pulled out an ancient book.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Closing his eyes, he flipped through its pages and pointed randomly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He opened his eyes and read the text aloud.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[I want to drink chocolate latte. But there’s no cacao in this world, and even if there was, I don’t know how to make chocolate… Ah, chocolate, chocolate latte, chocolate cake… I want it.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise nodded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Alright, your name is Choco Latte.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Choco Latte… I am Choco Latte!! Thank you, Haise!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise started walking again, followed by the Chaos Goblin—now Choco Latte.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Haise. Many more dangerous beasts lie ahead. Be careful.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. And don’t get too close to me. It’s annoying.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Ah, my apologies!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And so, Haise and Choco Latte ventured further into the lower levels.</p>
