<p>Resupply<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haa….”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was enjoying the hot springs alone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora and the others had soaked for too long, diving straight into bed as soon as they got out of the springs, falling asleep instantly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold and his group hadn’t returned yet, likely enjoying a second or third round at the taverns they hadn’t visited in ages.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And so, Sasha was savoring the hot spring on her own.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“The water here is so thick… but that’s what makes it great.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The slightly viscous spring water was a little hot, but it was just right for Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She planned to sip on some cold fruit water and tend to her sword after getting out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When she finally left the spring and headed to the living room...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ohhh—Sasha, looking beautiful as always today… hic.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ugh, no more drinks for me….”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“My glasses… where are my glasses….”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You lot… honestly.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold, Cress, and Tycoon were sprawled out drunk in the entrance hall.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With no other choice, Sasha carried them to their beds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Since awakening as a [Sword Master], her physical abilities had improved enough to make carrying adults as easy as lifting a feather.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She tossed them onto their beds in their rooms and began her sword maintenance in the living room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cleaning off dirt and applying oil—simple tasks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The sword she tended to was her pride and joy, forged from the fang of the Silver Ray Dragon she had once slain as an A-rank adventurer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You’re so diligent, Sasha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Cress. Weren’t you asleep?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I chewed on some medicinal herbs to sober up quickly.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cress, a skilled herbalist and a capable healer, was someone other teams would covet if they lacked support roles.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He sat across from Sasha, watching her work.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Not much fun watching this, is it?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Not at all. Sasha, you… you look truly beautiful wielding a sword.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Eh?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s captivating, really.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“D-Don’t tease me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m not teasing. I mean it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cress smiled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, feeling like he was toying with her, responded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Cress. Aren’t you a prince? Surely you know that noblewomen of the social world are far more beautiful than someone like me. I’m just a commoner without refinement, good for nothing but swinging a sword.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That’s exactly what’s charming about you. Your unadorned, genuine self is beautiful. That’s what I think.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Hmph.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Noticing the sincerity in his praise, Sasha’s cheeks turned slightly red as she looked away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha, you’re planning to form a clan and take on the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, right?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes, that’s the plan.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ll succeed. So… what comes after that?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“After?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“When you clear even one labyrinth, your name will be known across the world. You’ll have countless people wanting to join your clan, and your clan could surpass even the Four Great Clans. You wouldn’t have to fight yourself anymore and could live in comfort. What I want to know is—what’s your plan after you retire as an adventurer?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I haven’t thought that far ahead. I haven’t even formed a clan yet, let alone considered what comes after.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Then… may I reserve a spot in that future?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……What?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cress spoke with a serious expression.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha, when everything is over… will you marry me?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wha—?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The cloth Sasha had been using to polish her sword slipped from her hands.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Take your time to think about it. Tomorrow, years later, after retirement—whenever. Just give it some thought.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“W-Wait, what are you saying all of a sudden?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I prefer women like you, Sasha, who shine with all their might, over those dressed up in the social world. You’re my ideal.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“W-Wait! Don’t joke about this!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m not joking.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His gaze was unwavering.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, caught off guard by his passionate eyes, turned crimson.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was the first time she had ever been confessed to so directly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I-If you spring this on me out of nowhere…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That’s why I’m not rushing you. I just wanted you to know how I feel.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Ugh.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haha, sorry for flustering you. I’ll head to bed now. We’ve got errands tomorrow, right?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Y-Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Good night, Sasha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cress blew a playful kiss and returned to his room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Left alone, Sasha picked up the dropped cloth and let out a sigh.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Cress, is that how you’ve been looking at me? Am I… shining?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Cress’s voice echoed: “Sasha, you shine so brightly. You’re my ideal.”]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“──What?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly recalling old memories, Sasha shook her head vigorously.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next day.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tasked with buying supplies, Sasha and Robin were stocking up on groceries.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their motto was to carry what they could, walk where they could, and do what they could themselves—but exceptions existed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The team had a basic item box with limited capacity, and they were using it to store their purchases this time.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, Sasha, can’t we get a better item box?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin asked while storing dried meat in the box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This one still works fine. No need to waste money.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“But this box has even less capacity than Cress’s personal one! I get it’s your first one and has sentimental value, but still—”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm… I’ll think about it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha remembered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That item box was the first one she and Haise had bought together with their hard-earned money.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The others didn’t know. It was from when they had worked as a pair.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To Sasha, it was a cherished item.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But—Robin’s words made her realize that clinging to the past might inconvenience her team.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, Sasha… did something happen?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“W-What do you mean?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You’re super flustered…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin pulled out a freshly bought apple, slicing it in half with the knife on her hip.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She handed one half to Sasha and took a big bite of her own.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Did someone confess their love to you or something?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Pfft! W-Why would you think that!?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Wait, it’s true? I was joking!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ugh…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha had dug her own grave.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She bit into the apple and turned away—an old habit of hers whenever embarrassed or flustered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“If Piasora hears about this, he might lose it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“D-Don’t tease me… really.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“So? Who was it? Cress?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Pfft! Y-You saw it, didn’t you?!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Nope, just guessed. Sasha, you’re too easy to read.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, yeah, Cress has been staring at you a lot lately.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Eh…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You’re the only one who hasn’t noticed. Even Myuane was like, ‘Oh no, my brother might actually…’”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha, just make sure you don’t regret anything.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“R-Regret…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You’ll understand someday.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Robin finished the rest of her apple.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seven days later, after all preparations were complete.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Sacred team held their final checks at their rented lodgings.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Wearing polished armor commissioned from the armory, Sasha addressed the group.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“We head for the Crystal Mines now. The target is the Crystal Golem. We’ll eliminate any beasts along the way as planned. Reynold, Piasora, Tycoon, Robin—are you ready?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Of course. I haven’t been here long, but I’ll do my part as a Sacred member!” Reynold replied.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m ready too!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Myuane added enthusiastically.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Alright. Then let’s go as usual, team. Reynold, Piasora, Tycoon, Robin—you know the drill.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"""“Understood!”"""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Alright then, Team Sacred… let’s complete this mission!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Sasha and her team began their journey toward the Crystal Mines, unaware of what awaited them there.</p>
