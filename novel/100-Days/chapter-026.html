<p>A Rare Day Off<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh, take a break?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One day, Haise went to the adventurers' guild as usual, searching for requests.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist tapped him on the shoulder from behind and dragged him into the guild master's office.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While sipping the usual delicious tea, the guild master, Geist, suddenly said this:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise. The investigation of the A-rank dungeon seems to be going smoothly."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, yeah. I guess..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'm surprised you managed to survey up to the sixtieth floor in such a short time. On top of that, your reports are detailed and thorough for every single floor."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well... I'm pretty good at writing, I suppose."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, who once served as a mapper in Sacred.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He excelled at analyzing magic beasts and compiling detailed data to support his companions. Even now, as an S-rank adventurer, that ability proved useful, leaving Haise with mixed feelings.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We planned to commission further investigation from other adventurers and consolidate the information before publishing it, but your reports alone were deemed sufficient. Therefore, the 'A-rank dungeon investigation request' is considered complete."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just then, a veteran receptionist knocked and entered the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She placed a magic tool on the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"S-rank adventurer Haise. This is the reward for the dungeon investigation request. Please hand me your adventurer card."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, uh... Geist, is this really over!? But I’ve only done up to sixty..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Only? No, already. It's not good to rush the investigation too far ahead. We'll publish that 'floors beyond the sixtieth are uninvestigated' beforehand. That way, skilled adventurers will gather."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh... Well, then, what about other dungeon investigations?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"None. There are some, but no A-rank or higher dungeons have been discovered."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"There are no subjugation requests either, for now. So take a break for once."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After depositing the reward into his adventurer card, Haise withdrew just a little since his wallet was low.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist added:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Enjoy some good food or just relax. You're only sixteen, you know. There's nothing wrong with enjoying your youth."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-Youth...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re not planning to challenge the Six Forbidden Labyrinths yet, are you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, no. I don’t have enough usable weapons yet. If I challenge it, I’d want to fully decode the ancient manuscripts first."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Indeed... That’s wise. How about going on a date for once? Presea... she's around, isn’t she?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"D-Date!? No way, she's just... clingy and annoying."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hoho."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Stop that face... It's not like that at all."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hahaha. Anyway, Haise, how about going here? You like books, don’t you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist handed Haise a piece of parchment from the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It read, Ancient Book Market Event.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ancient books...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The book town of Roberia in the west hosts an annual ancient book market in the Kingdom of Heiberg. If you’re interested in books, it might be fun to visit."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise took the parchment and left the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey Sasha, let’s take a break already."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Reynold... No, not yet."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You need to stop."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One day, Sasha was in a room of their newly acquired clan home, looking over documents for teams hoping to join the clan.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The team "Sacred" had been reformed into the clan Sacred.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their base was a large, five-story building in a prime location in the capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The spacious garden served as a training ground. Floors one through four housed the members' rooms, and the fifth floor was reserved for Team Sacred. Surprisingly, the basement even had a grand bathhouse.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was in the Clan Master Room, her designated office.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Now, it was filled with mountains of documents she was reviewing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold snatched a stack from her hands.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're too serious for your own good. I get that you want to review applications since the clan was just formed, but it’s still a month away. If you don’t pace yourself, you’ll burn out before it even starts."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Reynold..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Piasora’s working at the church, Robin’s tending to weapons, and Tycoon’s in the library researching clan rules and warnings. Everyone’s on free time today, doing what they like."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But... Piasora and Tycoon are working, aren’t they?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s fine. Tycoon was excited to finally read as much as he wanted."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Come on, let’s go relax."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? Uh... where?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold showed her a piece of parchment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is... an ancient book market?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You like reading too, right? Maybe not as much as Tycoon, but still. It'll be good for you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Reynold... Yeah, thank you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"O-Oh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha smiled, and Reynold scratched his cheek, looking away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise headed to the Old Commercial District of Heiberg’s royal capital, Ryuzen, parchment in hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Old Commercial District.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Unlike the current commercial district, it was the first market built when the Kingdom of Heiberg was founded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The modern district was newly constructed with infrastructure improvements, centralizing merchants in the heart of the capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, the Old Commercial District remained untouched, housing long-standing merchants and stores filled with old, charming goods. Rumor had it that niche enthusiasts had begun opening shops there as well.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had visited a few times before with Tycoon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, what a coincidence."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the entrance to the Old Commercial District, Haise ran into Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Are you following me or something?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Who knows? The spirit I attached to you just tells me where you are."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just kidding."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise frantically brushed at his clothes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea chuckled softly and started walking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re here to look at ancient manuscripts, right? Let’s go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I wanted to come alone."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I won’t get in your way. I like being alone, too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a sigh, Haise started walking toward the Old Commercial District.</p>
