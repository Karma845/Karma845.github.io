<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>So I started running in the early morning before the sun showed its face.</p>

<p>After staying in the dungeon for a long time and experiencing mild jet lag, I was called to the &quot;Principal's Office&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;'Special Internship', thank you for your hard work.&quot;</p>

<p>The top floor of the temple tower. Lord Baldr sat across from the large ash wood table and expressed his condolences, while I showed a regretful expression.</p>

<p>&quot;In the end, my identity was exposed...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I heard about it. But what's incredible is that the 'Third Team' didn't mention the 'First Level Adventurer' who appeared on the 25th floor at all. In this way, I'm afraid even the rumors won't spread.&quot;</p>

<p>I was completely pretending to be stupid, and I was a little hesitant to say this, but when I heard the god in charge of light say this, I couldn't help but smile.</p>

<p>On the 25th floor, after my identity was revealed, the 18th floor and the rock pan of the &quot;Cave Maze&quot; were completely cleared, and the &quot;Third Team&quot; returned to the surface. No one spoke on the road, which seemed to me to be beyond the level of embarrassment, but... no one blamed &quot;Lap&quot; for disguising his identity.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t know how to get along with each other.</p>

<p>They both have this kind of atmosphere.</p>

<p>&quot;After being killed in the dungeon, it turned out to be a 'school trip'... This is a great idea. Is it because I am an adventurer in Orario, or is it because you did it?&quot;</p>

<p>The last person besides us in the principal's office, Teacher Leon, smiled bitterly while reading the report.</p>

<p>I heard that this man was more dedicated than anyone else and rescued many victims. It was Teacher Leon who went to the 18th floor to take us and others back.</p>

<p>&quot;You not only expanded Nina's horizons, you even broadened her vision. Just what I expected.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As the teacher expected?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah. As I expected, you exceeded my expectations.&quot;</p>

<p>My eyes widened. At this moment, Teacher Leon showed an expression I had never seen before. He closed one eye and smiled at me like a mischievous bad boy.</p>

<p>Teacher Leon...does he think highly of me?</p>

<p>Because I became a first-level adventurer? Or is it because I'm known as the fastest rabbit in the world?</p>

<p>I don't know the truth.</p>

<p>But at the end, Teacher Leon said to me:</p>

<p>&quot;Next time, 'I' also want to take an adventure with you. Bell.&quot;</p>

<p>Just like this, it seemed like a &quot;promise&quot; had been made with me.</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of which, did you talk to Nina after that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, well...it was embarrassing after all, so I didn't say it was a big deal...&quot;</p>

<p>When Lord Badr asked this question, I hesitated a little.</p>

<p>But I added &quot;but&quot; and a smile spread across my lips.</p>

<p>&quot;She told me very enthusiastically... 'I want to meet my sister'.&quot;</p>

<p>I looked out the window.</p>

<p>He looked towards the sky that was starting to turn white and the direction of the labyrinth city where the sisters could finally meet again.</p>

<p>Autumn has left and now it is winter.</p>

<p>Perhaps most of the people were still struggling in bed, and the park was deserted. A person walked by here, and Eina, who went to work at the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot;, exhaled a white breath.</p>

<p>Wearing scarves and gloves is now a must.</p>

<p>When the cold subsides and spring comes, can I get along with my important family members like sisters? Just when she was thinking about this kind of thing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;elder sister.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!&quot;</p>

<p>This moment has arrived sooner than imagined.</p>

<p>This park is the shortcut to the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot;. A little research will tell you that many employees use this route to get to work. Nina, who had been waiting for Eina, walked over slowly wearing the uniform of the &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p>Rows of street trees with almost all their leaves lined up on both sides watched over the two half-elves.</p>

<p>The elder and younger sisters stopped in the middle of the road and stared at each other.</p>

<p>&quot;...Eina, sister.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Um.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry. I really don't remember anything.&quot;</p>

<p>The younger sister lowered her eyes and told the truth frankly. However, she immediately met Eina's gaze again and showed a stiff smile.</p>

<p>&quot;So...'first meeting'. I am your sister Nina.&quot;</p>

<p>Just like that, Eina's eyes of the same color as Nina became moist, and a beautiful smile appeared on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;I know you when you were a baby, so, 'Long time no see'. I am your older sister Eina.&quot;</p>

<p>Obviously they are sisters connected by blood, but their reunion started with greetings like strangers.</p>

<p>However, despite their age difference, the two people with very similar faces laughed in unison.</p>

<p>&quot;Sister, I'm sorry for not being able to reply to you. In fact, I have always been very happy. However, I dare not reply to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I've been imitating my sister. I've been chasing after her, and I feel discouraged and miserable.&quot;</p>

<p>Her sister kept listening to her story with a steady smile. Nina beamed and talked about what had happened so far.</p>

<p>I've always been imitating Eina.</p>

<p>I like learning very much, but I'm not as good at it as you are.</p>

<p>Encountered numerous setbacks.</p>

<p>Actually pretty good at sports.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no way she can become &quot;Eina Zul&quot;.</p>

<p>And now, as &quot;Nina Zul&quot;, I have a &quot;dream&quot;.</p>

<p>Over and over again, Nina said the words that she failed to write in her letters and that failed to respond to her.</p>

<p>So many words that no number of sticky notes could fit in poured out from the depths of my heart.</p>

<p>For some reason, drops of liquid accumulated in her eyes, and Eina, who had been watching her, also had tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;So, I discovered a lot of things during the special internship! The people I cherish taught me many important things!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really...you had a wonderful encounter. The person you cherish is a classmate in the 'school district'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's Mr. Bell Crowne!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;---Eh!?&quot;</p>

<p>Then, she dropped a &quot;bomb&quot;.</p>

<p>The time that should have been peaceful was blown to pieces, and Eina let out a frantic cry.</p>

<p>Nina tilted her head, but she really wanted to tell her sister, so her cheeks turned red for a reason other than the cold, and she began to give a passionate speech:</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Bell Crane, no, Bell-senpai is a very powerful adventurer! He has helped us time and time again, making us feel worthy of being a first-level adventurer...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;U-Um, Nina? Could it be that you are against Bell-kun...!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I've decided! Sister, my goal is to join the [Hestia Familia]!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!?&quot;</p>

<p>Nina, who didn't even notice her sister's panic. She was completely immersed in her own world and gave birth to the youth (Aoharu) space with a bright smile and waved her hand.</p>

<p>&quot;So sister! You must help me register as an adventurer in the future! We have made an appointment!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, wait Nina! Please wait a minute!? Bell-kun is longing for the Wallenstein family. I am also that, and this and that, anyway, it is better to change the target to compare...!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to see many sights with that person!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nina&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!?&quot;</p>

<p>After all, my sister's screams of grief were not conveyed. The still clueless sister turned around and ran out.</p>

<p>White breath came out of his mouth, his cheeks dyed red, and he ran along the open and straight street towards the front of the &quot;dream&quot;.</p>

<p>Run towards the other side of &quot;adventure&quot;. There are not only sparkling things there, there must also be suffering and setbacks ahead, but there must be extremely precious treasures buried there.</p>

<p>&quot;Go hard&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!! Become a great adventurer!&quot;</p>

<p>The girl who became the &quot;Dream Chaser&quot; started running.</p>
