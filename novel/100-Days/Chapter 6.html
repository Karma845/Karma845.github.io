<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-15"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 6 &#8211;  Researching the Enemy</h1><p class="calibre2">“Does nothing truly ail you!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Your Highness, aren’t you being rude, right now?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was having such a refreshing morning, but now it was ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every day, His Highness Sazanjill would ambush me, asking if anything was troubling me…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I never realized he was someone with not an ounce of subtlety.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What was more, he lacked consideration as well. He had dragged Lumiere along with him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…As for Lumiere, she was threatening me with her glare.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At such time, my title as the duchess was nothing but a pain because it meant I couldn’t ignore the crown prince.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…You don’t have to concern yourself with me. Thanks to you, I’ve been cherishing every moment of my life.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That doesn’t seem like it&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Who are you to decide that&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I quickly retorted, but then hurriedly shut my mouth. However, it was too late. Due to the apparent anger in my voice, His Highness was stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ahh, it seems that today will also be troublesome…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Aside from me, I also didn’t think it’d be good for His Highness…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see, yes, that’s right, you’re…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Your Highness? Shouldn’t you have figured it out by now? That I was sad because of the rumors?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or, could it be, did he still not realize how his attitude could affect his surroundings?</p>
<p class="calibre2">He shouldn’t be so thoughtless that he couldn’t understand that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Although, as far as I could remember, I never recalled him acting as a proper fiancé.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hence, that was naïve of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, if he were to stare at me with puppy eyes, there was no way I could resist being kind to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…By the way, I have a problem.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">What!? </em>What is it?! You can talk to me!! I’ll help you with anything!!”</p>

<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">You’re too close, too close…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Please don’t suddenly approach me like that.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I meant, even Lumiere is pulling your arm back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, as long as he felt better, I’d rely on him with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’d appreciate if you could introduce me to someone familiar with farm work.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Farm… work?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Recently, my whole family has started farming at home. We do our best to study, but the crops just won’t sprout. So, I’d appreciate if you could introduce me to a specialist.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…But, your family has a gardener, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, of course. But his specialty is growing flowers in the flowerbed. That’s different from creating a field from scratch using hard soil.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Wait, are you trying to make a vegetable garden?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course not&mdash;I want to make a farm. My goal is for my family to be self-sufficient so that we can trade with the people of our territory!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What kind of goal is a duke of the kingdom trying to realize here!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I’m sorry, Your Highness.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Just so you know, my family, the Elcage Family, is a family that will give their everything once they set their mind upon something.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although, my real purpose was so that my family could be independent later once they fell into ruin. That was a secret between the god and I, though.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I furrowed my eyebrows while asking <em class="calibre3">“You can’t?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness frowned, <em class="calibre3">“Gununu…</em>” Then, while staring at Lumiere, “If I recall correctly, in your mother’s birthplace, there’s a person called Baron Aljerk.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Y, yes!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Lumiere, c’mon, now…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It may come off as a surprise, but for her to suddenly raise her voice towards His Highness… that was just uncouth. After school, I’d need to discipline her again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards my gaze, Lumiere’s expression stiffened. However, without noticing it, His Highness resumed his explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The territory governed by Baron Aljerk flourishes through agriculture, and the baron himself does his own research. Can you request the baron’s help? You can use my name.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">At his suggestion, Lumiere stared alternately between me and the prince.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I immediately smirked&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;How clever…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, Lumiere couldn’t turn down His Highness’ request.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">To have the ability to make such an aristocratic judgement, I felt a bit happy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, our conversation quickly spread throughout the entire school.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I heard about it. You grew tired of sword training, so now you’re planning to grow a field.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">During lunch break, when I went to His Highness Zafield for sword practice, he asked me that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, are you going to quit sword training?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why would I?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, he asked if I’d stop. There was no way I’d do that. I stopped swinging and denied it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I didn’t get tired of it? I’ll continue to master the path of the sword until the end.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Until the end, you say… how long do you have in mind?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…At least until the dance party.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh my, did I actually get tired of it?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, I had almost slipped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I swung my sword and made a non-committal reply, my hands felt numb.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;Huh?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I realized it, my sword and the scabbard of His Highness Zafield’s longsword had clashed. Even though it was just at that level, I couldn’t get rid of the numbness in my hands. In fact, keeping hold over my sword was already difficult enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Will I be able to master this in 50 days…?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I suddenly felt depressed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without concerning himself with my grimace, His Highness Zafield continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…The dance party, isn’t that next month? Is something going to happen at that time?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t answer, but his assumption was correct.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’d die that day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apparently, the one who’d kill me was His Highness Sazanjill. To be honest, I’d like to tell him about His Highness’ alleged assassination. But of course, I didn’t have any proof.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">‘It’s god’s providence’&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;Yeah, there’s no way I can say that.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It didn’t matter even if the one who informed me was a saint or a deity. He’d certainly call a doctor under the assumption that I had hit my head somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to that, my only option was to smile and deceive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then&mdash;<em class="calibre3">a noble lady’s smile.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, His Highness Zafield understood that I wasn’t going to talk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, that’s alright. Still, isn’t there something more important than sword practice you should focus on? It seems that on our last break, my older brother went to a clothing store.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your older brother…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I replied with a question… but, in truth, it was unnecessary to ask.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It had been a long-standing tradition for men to give dresses to their loved ones in advance for attending an upcoming party together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At least one month was required to order for a satisfying dress. The more intricate the dress, the more time would be needed, and the better everything would be. While I was cultivating the soil with my parents, my fiancée was giving a dress to another woman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Of course, I hadn’t received any sort of invitation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had already expected that. Still, I my face hung down due to the overt feeling of estrangement. Then, His Highness, who sheathed his sword, gently took my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…If Lelouche is alright with it, would you like a dress from me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The implication behind his words…&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">It’s no good.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite how unreasonable my circumstances were, I was still the fiancée of His Highness Sazanjill. Even if my fiancé was behaving unreasonably, it didn’t mean I should do the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried to brush it off as a joke, but before I could, His Highness Zafield spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“For now, why don’t we look into the kind of dress my brother ordered? He ordered it from a store the royal family doesn’t normally frequent. This is probably their first time receiving such a request. As such, the dress is probably still in temporary sewing.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s… even so…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It might help you prepare yourself. Don’t you want a better dress than them?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield raised the corners of his mouth, hinting, <em class="calibre3">‘It’s a women’s thing.’</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“If you agree to accompany me on the weekends, I’ll not only teach you how to swing a sword, but also how to intercept them. How about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Oh my, is it because of my awkward attempt at deflecting your attack a moment ago?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You managed to not drop your sword, at the very least. As such, it’d be better if I were to teach you how to avoid and deflect it. Besides, that way, I’d have a reason to touch Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Wait, what?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His cute smile, which was full of playfulness, surprised me…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I was caught in his pace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it seemed that he was intent on killing two birds with one stone. Besides, I also wanted to dress up properly until the end. As such, it was important to research the ‘enemy.’</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Will you join me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course, leave it to this Zafield to serve as the escort of Lady Lelouche’s.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield playfully kneeled and kissed the back of my hand which was still holding a sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Cease this kind of behavior and act like a decent prince, already…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, His Highness Zafield lifted his head and showed me a cheeky grin&mdash;I couldn’t help but laugh at that.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;43 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In this case, it’d be better to plant sprouted seed potatoes.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Baron Aljerk, who had a difficult time answering my father’s question, answered with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Baron Aljerk wore a suit, but at a first glance, he looked no different from a commoner. In a nutshell, he was a friendly man. He was in his late thirties, and he was also tall. His short hair was also charming. Compared to my father, his physique was dignified, and his lack of elegance was complemented by his friendliness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As of the present, his expression was as if he was looking at something unreasonable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Basically, I was only accompanying the two as they were having a conversation in the field. Until the end, I would devote myself to preparing my family. After all, I’d soon disappear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The explanation was long. To simplify it, potatoes were a plant that was inherently susceptible to diseases and attracted pests. If we were to plant common, edible, potatoes, pests may spread to the fields. Therefore, there was a kind called ‘sprouted seed potato’ which was thoroughly maintained and specially raised. It was used instead of seeds. In short, we wouldn’t be able to get edible potatoes from mere seeds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, sprouting meant exposing it to sunlight during the day and <em class="calibre3">letting it sprout, </em>as the word said. If we were to do the work in advance, the germination would be completed, and it’d grow beautifully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The easy-to-understand explanation impressed my father who let out a voice of admiration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see… so it isn’t something that’ll just bear fruit overnight. How embarrassing.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s your first time! It’s only natural that you didn’t know! Everyone usually buys potato seeds, too! If you plant large potatoes as they are, it’d be inefficient, so I’d like to cut them. Can you help me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t mind, but… should we cut them here?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh my, father!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Even though you’re in the position of being taught, you already look so promising!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Well, since we’ve brought the seeds anyway, who is anyone to say that we can’t use them immediately?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t see how Baron Aljerk would have any objection regarding such a positive attitude&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;or so I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, in a gentle tone, the baron spoke;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Pardon me, if you cut them in advance, the cut ends will rot. I’d like you to apply wood ash to the cut ends and dry them in the sun for a day before planting. It’s also important to note that if they are too dry, they’ll shrink.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It took two days to travel from the residence of Aljerk family to the residence of Elcage family. Due to the legitimate explanation, father rubbed his chin. There seemed to be no choice but to do it while he was here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How complex… alright then, if you may, please show me how to do the cutting.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you! To tell you the truth, I’ve also brought other kinds of potatoes. This one is called sweet potato. This crop is suitable for beginners. So, if you like, why don’t you try growing it alongside your potatoes?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I appreciate your insight! I’d like you to give me guidance, if you’re alright with that?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Father’s concern was also reasonable. No matter how high our rank was, if the baron kept adhering to us, he might face some troublesome requests later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Baron Aljerk only smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m glad that the duke is interested in agriculture.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, many people look down on agriculture because they deem it as a low-ranking labor.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But, without agriculture, aristocrats wouldn’t be able to eat.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I agree. That’s why, I think agriculture will develop if the duke, who is interested in it, were to spread its importance and goodness.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he spoke, the baron’s eyes became ecstatic.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ah, what a change…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The baron spoke of agriculture as if it was his lover. By the way, he was already middle-aged, but was still single.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, so that’s the reason…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“If you like, could you tell me more? I’d like for you to pass as much of your knowledge as possible during your stay!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course! I’d be extremely glad to do so!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I’m glad… Father and Baron Aljerk are likely to get along.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">If possible, I’d have to ask my father to find the baron a potential suitor, as well. That would strengthen our relationship with Baron Aljerk, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Excited, I clasped my face with both hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This way, even if our house collapses, we’ll be fine!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Y, young lady!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Baron Aljerk immediately turned pale.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I intended for it to come off as some kind of a witty joke. It worked for my father, at least.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Haha, that’s right. If something happens to my house, I’d like to ask the servants of the Aljerk family for help! Your field is of an incomparable size, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Uhh… well, it isn’t about how much manpower you have. However, if you have any problems, do remember this Aljerk.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Alright, I shall remember that!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted that to happen. That was exactly my aim. Having successfully completed the initial goal, I remembered my next promise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, Father. I have an arrangement after this.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Only now do I recall it. That’s right, you may go. Be mindful around His Highness. Be sure to ask him to choose a nice one that he likes.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While it was a day off, that day was busier than usual. I had to visit the castle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only said, <em class="calibre3">“I promised to take look at some dresses with His Highness.” </em>To my father. As a result, he misunderstood. He thought I was referring to my fiancé.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, my partner that day wasn’t Sazanjill, but his younger brother&mdash;Zafield. We would be looking into the dress Sazanjill would be giving to his affair partner.<br class="calibre4" /><br class="calibre4" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">In front of the shopping district, I alighted from the carriage. Since it was close to the aristocratic district, it was alright to go to the store with a horse-drawn carriage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that day, I wouldn’t be entering the store as ‘<em class="calibre3">Lelouche Elcage.’ </em>As such, the carriage was changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, the fiancée of the first prince couldn’t be seen spending her free time openly with the second prince.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I tucked my hair in a hat with a wide brim. Today I shall be Zafield’s playmate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Luna, you have a refreshing appearance.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“To be honest, I just don’t want any insects to approach me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I usually tried not to wear flashy clothes. I had black hair. There were times when pale colors and flashy colors didn’t match, but… the fiancée of the first prince was in a natural position to be scorned. As such, there was no need to unnecessarily provoke others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Elegant and beautiful, without any flair. I didn’t have to dress up beautifully, because that was already enough to silence them&mdash;<em class="calibre3">oh my, how rude of me&mdash;</em>I meant, to get along with them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hence, at such a time, I tried to wear a trendy, bright yellow, dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However… Zafield, who was wearing a stylish vest and middle boots, knelt in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Truly, before the incarnation of the Moon Goddess herself, I’m but an insect.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Could it be, the name itself, <em class="calibre3">Luna, </em>was taken from the Moon Goddess?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zafield was the one who bestowed me with that name. It was for today only.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought he had merely chosen it as a name because it was similar to ‘Lelouche’…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…To think that it had such an unexpected and magnificent origin. I couldn’t help but avert my gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards that, Zafield chuckled. He also calmly dropped a kiss on the back of my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t it perfect?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I wonder?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I could ask, however, Zafield stood up and drew me towards the carriage he was riding.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Jeez.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, it certainly had been a while ever since I had been treated like a woman, even more so with such politeness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;When was the last time Sazanjill had escorted me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t recall.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness Zafield, welcome!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">““Welcome!””</p>
<p class="calibre2">The clerks who were donning black suits all bowed at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The store was located at front of the aristocratic district. It was strategically placed so that even commoners could easily visit. In the first place, the store was intended for the commoners and the those of the middle-class who wanted to appear classy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The blue tile used for part of the outer wall seemed to originate from a foreign country. The gold lamp and unusually-shaped chandelier probably hailed from my mother’s&mdash;the <em class="calibre3">Foreign Beauty’s&mdash;</em>homeland. The textile industry was thriving. Many pieces of foreign furniture were on display in the store. I was truly excited to see what such a fashionable store had to offer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">It isn’t like I’m uninterested in fashion?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, in public places, there were many who still embraced tradition. For those who had a distinctive appearance like me, becoming orthodox was the safest option. Besides, just because a certain style was trendy, it didn’t mean it was beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I looked around the store, His Highness Zafield commented, “It’s an interesting store.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was about to reply, a certain clerk remarked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Pardon the intrusion, but what kind of relationship do you have with this lady?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Right after that, a person who seemed to be the manager immediately bowed down and apologized profusely. Said clerk was scolded. For a store that deals with aristocrats, such out of line behavior should be unthinkable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The manager’s explanation was, it wasn’t every day that said employee got to see a member of the royal family. As the store had suddenly gotten popular one day, their education was still incomplete…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…His Highness Zafield only smiled calmly before dismissing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…This lady, she is the one I want to propose to.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Winking, His Highness Zafield raised a finger to the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">‘Kyaaaaaa!!!’</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Immediately, screams erupted from the clerks. Even the manager, who had just told an employee off, screamed…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…To be honest, I also wanted to do the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;What are you saying!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was so embarrassed, I wanted to run away screaming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Obviously, I couldn’t do that. Thus, I could only conceal my face with both hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After chuckling, His Highness Zafield got to the point.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Before choosing a dress for her, could you show me the dress my brother requested the other day?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The clerk was visibly confused by His Highness Zafield’s request. Normally, one wouldn’t ask to look at someone else’s request.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Unfortunately, the order was for a custom-tailored dress…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry for the odd request, but I don’t want to give her a dress that looks similar to my brother’s. I want to give it my all&mdash;so, please…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards the second prince, who put his hands together in front of his face and pleaded, the clerks stared at each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please keep it confidential.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, we were led into the back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We did it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…’<em class="calibre3">Overdid’, </em>you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After we whispered towards each other, the dress was immediately brought to us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I was stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…The flashy pink, satin, fabric was adorned with pink ribbons. It was doubled with a lace fabric, which while pale, was still pink. The chest part was open. Around the neck, a rose-gold necklace with ribbon motif could be seen. Naturally, the jewel was a pink diamond. …<em class="calibre3">Naturally, </em>the shoes were also covered with pink sequins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I instinctively asked about the flood of pink.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Who’d, what kind of person would wear this…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“She’s a lovely woman with pink hair.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Well. Of. Course.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Who else would it be if not Ms. Lumie!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like me, His Highness Zafield had a lot of question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did my brother truly request this…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Indeed, the one who choose this messy thing is&mdash;<em class="calibre3">ahem. </em>He looks truly happy when he ordered it, because according to him, no women has ever worn anything like this before…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield glanced at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">No, actually…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">For my social debut, His Highness Sazanjill had once invited a designer from the royal castle to make a dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The end result was a dark blue dress made of silk and embroidered with gold. At that time… that was right&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;His Highness Sazanjill mentioned that it’d be nice to have a lot of lace. I recalled choosing an adult-like element for the other aspects. It was well-received at the party, and I also liked it. In fact, I still wore it from time to time while fixing the size…</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was my treasure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The current dress that His Highness Sazanjill had ordered probably differed from what His Highness Zafield had in mind. His gaze said that much. Then, His Highness Zafield gave instruction to stow the dress away, “Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, he was shielding his eyes. It was perfectly understandable, the sight hurt my eyes, too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Luna, you may ask for a dress. Anything other than <em class="calibre3">that </em>color is fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh my, are you truly going to buy one for me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course, like I said, I’d like to propose to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How surprising, do you honestly believe you’ll be able to persuade me with a single dress?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those words might have come off as rude to the clerk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I proceeded to remove my hat. Then, I combed my cascading black hair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then&mdash;a bright red dress.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lulu…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield was probably wary of calling me by my real name. The clerk seemed surprised by my distinctive hair color. After all, wasn’t the <em class="calibre3">beautiful princess, the Foreign Beauty, </em>who had married into the Elcage family, famous among commoners?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I said with a smile&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Nothing too flashy, please. Just a bright red dress made of fine fabric is fine. Please send the invoice to Lelouche Elcage.”<br class="calibre4" /><br class="calibre4" /></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…What were you thinking?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I was merely enjoying my day off to the fullest?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That night, in a pure white world, I was counting off using my fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had brought Baron Aljerk and my father together. I had inquired about the dress that my fiancé, His Highness Sazanjill, was about to secretly give to Lumiere. On top of that, I had also ordered a dress for myself, thanked Baron Alban, helped Lumiere study, and then went home where I enjoyed a meal made by Baron Aljerk and my mother.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, I couldn’t think of a more fulfilling day off!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I sighed in satisfaction. The god sighed again. Was it something to be concerned about?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Shouldn’t you focus on fixing your habit of sighing? If you stay that way, happiness will elude you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Whose fault is that!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, my.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, even if he didn’t exaggerate it like that, I was aware that he was truly bothered about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But when I tried to explain that it was the best way to aim for a beautiful death, the god stared at me and asked&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;Was making the second prince lose face alright?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Is that what he’s concerned about?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">He was completely out of tune with what was natural to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I answered what I was asked&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;I couldn’t bear to let His Highness Zafield to purchase that. Besides, I want to prepare <em class="calibre3">the shroud </em>myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if my fiancé was giving a dress to another woman, I was still his fiancée.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If another man were to give me a dress, then that man could only be my father. However, I couldn’t bear to stain a gift from my father, who was ignorant of what was to come, with blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was looking down, god asked me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“His younger brother, isn’t he in love with you?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Perhaps.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“You don’t hate him, do you?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Indeed.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I were to be asked if I like him as a man… I didn’t know, I hadn’t experienced love. To me, he was like a childhood friend. Of course, I didn’t hate him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">God spoke to me with a serious face.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Wouldn’t dying while being loved by someone else be better?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t respond. I just laughed softly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, god was persistent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Are you truly alright with this?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What do you think of my dress, god?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Actually, I had contemplated asking for a white dress. Even someone like me had a longing, like everyone else. Just once, over my entire lifetime, I wanted to wear a bridal dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;…By any chance, would you fall in love with me in that dress?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“W, why would I!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, dear. So, when god is embarrassed, his face also turns red…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;I was a duke’s daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That night too, I hid my vulnerability behind a smile.</p>
