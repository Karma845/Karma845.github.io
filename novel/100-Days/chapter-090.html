<p>Truth and What Lies Ahead<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The master of Clan Judgment, Chaos's petty crimes were handled in secret.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The crime of intentionally damaging the fence in the Misty Forest, causing adventurers to get hurt. It was also concealed that the one who fell into that trap was the currently renowned S-rank adventurer, Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As a result, Chaos was demoted to D-rank adventurer status, and the clan was disbanded as punishment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was surprised that Judgment, which she had just joined, was disbanded, but she took in all the members and made them part of Clan Sacred.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The official reason for Chaos's demotion was that he had committed a petty crime. Sasha seems to think that her own clumsiness caused her injury, so she doesn’t seem to know much about the crime Chaos committed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So... what about him?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"He left the royal capital. He probably can’t continue his adventurer activities here anymore."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise heard the details from Geist in the Guildmaster's room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sipping his tea, he listened to the news of Chaos being demoted.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha doesn’t know anything, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"There’s no need to worry about such a small fry. Besides, I’ve already dealt with Chaos. During the process, Apollon showed up and started saying things like 'he’s got a nice ass'... well, never mind, I shouldn’t say more."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh... y-yes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Apollon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise decided not to dwell on what the cardinal of the church had done.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist cleared his throat and changed the subject.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Anyway, we’ve installed new fences. From now on, we’ll also be doing regular patrols. Let’s consider this matter closed... Haise, you should be careful too. When you become famous, there will be those who envy you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m a solo adventurer, so it’s not a problem for me. But don’t you think the clan side also has some issues in this case?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This whole mess was something like "a clan that struggled to operate due to members being poached, retaliating against the clan that poached them".<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Well, to be precise, it wasn’t poaching. The teams simply switched sides because they found Clan Sacred more appealing than Clan Judgment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then, out of jealousy, Chaos harassed Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t know much about it, but there are a lot of teams switching to Sasha’s clan, right? Because of that, aren’t there a lot of clans that can’t maintain their operations and end up disbanding?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Well, that’s true."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just from checking, over ten small clans have disbanded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Some teams, instead of disbanding, have chosen to operate under Clan Sacred and take on requests from them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Speaking of which, Presea mentioned something at the bar. She said that in the Yggdra, there are almost no clans. The Yggdrasil is the main focus, and under it, a few large clans operate as subsidiaries, while solo adventurers take on requests from the Adventurer’s Guild. The roles of solo, teams, and clans are clearly defined there."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s true. It’s not just Ivis; the other four great clans are the same. The fact that the four great clans are recognized as massive entities is why almost all other clans fall under their umbrella."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"In Sasha’s case, she hasn’t gained that level of trust yet, which leads to competition over requests and teams leaving..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"There’s nothing we can do about that. Which clan a team belongs to is up to the team’s preference. To operate smoothly like the four great clans, you need experience, time, and trust."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There are quite a few clans that admire Sasha and join Clan Sacred as subsidiaries. But as things stand, there are more clans that are struggling to keep up with Sacred.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the Heiberg Kingdom alone, there are hundreds of clans, big and small, and thousands of teams.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even with so many clans and teams, only about 20 to 30 percent of the daily requests get handled. That’s how many troubles and extermination requests there are in this world.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Geist pulled out a letter from his drawer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise. Aren’t you going to the Graveyard of Ruin yet?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m not going, or rather... I can’t. Something about the big shots in the Holy Cross Adramelech Theocracy not giving permission to enter the Graveyard of Ruin, causing tension with the Heiberg Kingdom."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm. Well, that place is technically a graveyard. For those who worship the gods, it’s not a place they want people to tread on."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Besides, isn’t it normal for requests like that to be issued only after all preparations are done? How can they ask us to 'get information on the Forbidden Six Labyrinths from the Graveyard of Ruin' when the preparations aren’t even ready? It’s frustrating... I’m still stuck in the capital, worried someone might beat me to it. I shouldn’t have even heard about this information."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hahaha, don’t say that. Barbaros probably didn’t expect the negotiations to be this troublesome either."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sigh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"And it’s going to take a while longer. So... why don’t you go ahead?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The envelope Geist handed over had a crest of crossed swords engraved on it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise tilted his head in confusion.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise. Do you know about the adventurer education system?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. The Elite Adventurers, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s right. The Holy Cross Adramelech Theocracy has an academy for training adventurers. The Adramelech Adventurer School, commonly known as AdAd."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Pfft... AdAd? That’s a pretty silly abbreviation."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don’t say that. Anyway, this is a request for a temporary instructor. Every year, the Adventurer’s Guild sends a few S-rank adventurers as temporary instructors."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........................I have a bad feeling about this."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, I’m taking you, Sasha, and Hijiri. The four of us are going."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........................I knew it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, it’s not all bad. Right now, negotiations are underway to enter the Graveyard of Ruin, but the king over there—no, wait, they don’t have a king, do they? It’s the god’s representative, right? Anyway, if we go ahead and do something beneficial for their adventurers, it might improve their impression of us."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But me, as an instructor?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’ll manage."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And so, Haise found himself heading to the Holy Cross Adramelech Theocracy, where the Graveyard of Ruin was located, as a temporary instructor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The adventurer education system.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Holy Cross Adramelech Theocracy has an "academy for training adventurers", where young boys and girls who have awakened their abilities are enrolled to learn the ways of adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They enter at the age of twelve, undergo five years of study and practical experience, and graduate at seventeen.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Graduates are registered as C-rank adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the Heiberg Kingdom, adventurers can obtain their license at the age of twelve, starting at F-rank. They typically join veteran adventurer teams, work their way up from the bottom, and gradually increase their rank. It usually takes four to seven years to reach C-rank. Going to school for five years and graduating as a C-rank is pretty standard.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Graduates of the academy are called Elite Adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In reality, their mastery of abilities, tactics, and combat skills puts them above the average C-rank, and some are even stronger than A-rank adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ve heard about it. Elite Adventurers look down on those who started from the bottom."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold said that while gulping down a large mug of ale.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon, munching on cheese, added.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But Elite Adventurers are strong. Their experience is completely different from adventurers like us who started from the bottom. From the moment they enter the academy, they spend five years honing their abilities and tactics, and they gain a lot of practical experience. They’ve never had to do menial tasks like carrying luggage or preparing meals."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Currently, Team Sacred was having a meal at their usual bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was talking about how Geist had asked her to be a temporary instructor at AdAd.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora, devouring squid legs and gulping down ale, slammed her mug on the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Burp... I can’t accept this!! If Sasha’s going, then I should go too, I should go too... I can’t believe I can’t go with her!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It can’t be helped. This is a request for S-rank adventurers. You guys have work to do in the capital. Once the preparations for the Graveyard of Ruin are ready, we’ll call for you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha said that to comfort Piasora.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Piasora was still sulking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Grrrr... I can’t believe that guy is going with her!! If he tries anything funny with Sasha, I’ll bite his throat out!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Calm down, Piasora. Geist and Hijiri are going too, you know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmph..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Lucky. I wanna go too..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin was munching on dessert fruits.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha sipped her ale, and Reynold spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, man. My promotion to S-rank is confirmed, but I can’t go with you, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Your promotion will probably happen after the Graveyard of Ruin is cleared."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh... well, it can’t be helped."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold shrugged.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha put down her mug and let out a small sigh.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The Holy Cross Adramelech Theocracy... I wonder if I’ll get to meet the Sword Saint, Crossfald."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha’s face turned red as she thought about the swordsman she admired</p>
