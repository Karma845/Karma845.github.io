<p>Chapter 5: My Dream</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm~~~...&quot;</p>

<p>Early in the morning, Nina made a sound of embarrassment.</p>

<p>She was in the sparsely populated study room, looking at the many textbooks and reference books spread out on the desk.</p>

<p>&quot;Guian, Nina.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Milly-senpai.&quot;</p>

<p>A goblin who was three years older than her passed by and spoke to her.</p>

<p>Mililia, who allowed Nina to call her by her pet name, was a member of the &quot;Seventh Team&quot; of [Badelban]. Unlike the &quot;Third Team&quot;, which is known as the worst team in history, it is a high-ranking group in the field of combat skills.</p>

<p>And she, a true elite, takes good care of her half-elf in every aspect.</p>

<p>&quot;It's so rare. Nina, the top student, would sit at the desk and be embarrassed. Could it be that she doesn't understand something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, no. I was just trying to make notes for Lapi-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi? That new student?&quot;</p>

<p>Mililia was surprised, and then Nina said &quot;Yes!&quot; with a smile on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Lapi-kun is amazing! He obviously has no knowledge at all, but he has been working hard to keep up with the progress of the course! He can still keep up with the pace of my study... This is the first time I have met such a person!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This, this is really incredible...&quot;</p>

<p>Nina understands very well that her learning method is &quot;win by quantity&quot;.</p>

<p>That was a &quot;number&quot; that would make even the students of the &quot;school district&quot; who successfully enrolled - those with the &quot;will to learn&quot; cry out. In a sense, it was a fatal &quot;number&quot;. So far, no student has been able to keep up with Nina's learning workload, and some even commented on her as &quot;not very efficient.&quot;</p>

<p>Under this situation, the new student (Lappie)'s even somewhat stupid attitude of desperately trying to keep up with her surprised Nina, which was also new and very touching.</p>

<p>Rather, he sometimes even went to bed later than Nina, got up earlier, and completed more &quot;quantities&quot; than Nina. Mililia knew very well how much Nina studied, so when she heard this, she couldn't help but twitch her cheeks, and seemed to have raised her evaluation of Lapi.</p>

<p>&quot;So now I want to cheer for Lapi-kun. I hope he can keep up with the course content as much as possible, so I thought of making notes for him like this...&quot;</p>

<p>She organized the key points like this and made preview and review notes not once or twice.</p>

<p>Not to boast, but Nina could feel that thanks to the notes she prepared, Lapi managed to stay within the course progress.</p>

<p>In the beginning, it was because Leon asked me to take care of him.</p>

<p>But now that she knew who he was, she felt good about him, so she took the initiative to accompany him.</p>

<p>(To say that we are like ordinary friends, there is something wrong...)</p>

<p>Two gears meshed together, or so it should be said.</p>

<p>Anyway, Nina and Lapi get along quite well.</p>

<p>(Besides... I always feel that he is a bit similar to his father.)</p>

<p>Although his eyes were obscured by his long bangs, his shy smile and eagerness to help others were exactly the same as Nina's beloved father.</p>

<p>Although it was not because of this, Nina, who is kind-hearted and caring, gradually began to spontaneously want to cheer for Lapi.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think of Lapi-kun, Milly-senpai?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is really hard to answer. After all, I haven't had much communication with him, and he has only been in the 'school district' for less than ten days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right! It's only been so long! But he has already united the &quot;Third Team&quot;! Is this the &quot;Third Team&quot;!? It's because I haven't been able to integrate everyone, and I almost ended up alone in the toilet The worst team ever for crying out loud!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-Nina...have you exposed a little too much?&quot;</p>

<p>Iglin would probably never admit it, but now Lapi is the spiritual pillar of the &quot;Third Team&quot;.</p>

<p>Known as the Labyrinth Man, he displays amazing judgment in that underground labyrinth. Even Nina, the squad leader, couldn't help but take his opinion as a reference.</p>

<p>He would never step forward and would stay on the sidelines most of the time, but once Nina and the others encountered a problem, he would definitely contribute his wisdom. Thanks to this, among the many teams, the &quot;Third Team&quot; has now earned enough credits to rank quite high.</p>

<p>Lapi Fleming.</p>

<p>He was truly an incredible character.</p>

<p>Introverted and easily shy and nervous, unable to refuse other people's requests.</p>

<p>But he works hard, is gentle to others, and has firm beliefs.</p>

<p>Nina herself knew very well that when she was describing Lapi, her green jade eyes must be shining.</p>

<p>Mililia looked at Nina like this and suddenly laughed &quot;haha&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems that Nina is very obsessed with that rabbit classmate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I always feel like there's something in my senior sister's words?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's your illusion&#9834;&quot;</p>

<p>After school that day, something happened that proved Nina's assessment to be true.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey~Combat Techniques Department! Please give me some advice!&quot;</p>

<p>After Leon informed various matters, everyone in the Combat Technology Department was about to prepare for special training.</p>

<p>Two boys (humans) from the &quot;Blacksmithing Department&quot; ran into the classroom with a sword.</p>

<p>&quot;We went to [Gobnu Familia] to have a clan experience, but the result was 'failed'! No matter what we do, we can't pass!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's no way I can join the group if this keeps up! It was the same the last time I came back to Hong Kong, and I failed to get selected many times~!&quot;</p>

<p>The burly teenagers put their weapons on the table and almost screamed for help from Nina and the others.</p>

<p>The students in the combat skills department gathered in a circle curiously and began the daily routine of the &quot;school district&quot;, which was to give each other opinions.</p>

<p>&quot;It looks like a very decent 'organ weapon'...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, why don't you say this weapon is very good? I want to use it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmph, I can make a better weapon than this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you bothering Eglin? Shut up, you stupid and weird dwarf!&quot;</p>

<p>In the classroom, which suddenly became noisy, Iglin snorted, picked up his sword, and revealed the &quot;Magic (Light) Blade&quot;, and then someone said &quot;Eh!?&quot; in surprise. It's Lapi.</p>

<p>&quot;W-what is this sword...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's just a 'mechanism weapon'... Ah, by the way. Is this your first time seeing Lapi-kun? I'm the only one in the 'Third Team' using a weapon with a 'mechanism' attached, and I'm not in the dungeon either.&quot; Used it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is an invention of the 'School District' that was born from the two disciplines of alchemy and blacksmithing. After absorbing the user's 'magic', it can greatly increase the range and power.&quot;</p>

<p>Beside Nina, Iglin waved his sword briskly and explained.</p>

<p>The weapon generates a magic light blade about 3C thick, wrapping the sword body as if wearing an armor of light. The power also adds a weight corresponding to the infused magic power to its own basic power.</p>

<p>The &quot;mechanism&quot; he saw for the first time made Lapi dumbfounded.</p>

<p>&quot;Orario's weapons that are not equipped with &quot;mechanisms&quot; are widely circulated. They are definitely valuable! They are also very effective against monsters in dungeons!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, I just can't get recognition... Mr. Gobnuu doesn't talk much and doesn't tell us anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing the sighs of the students from the Blacksmithing Department, the Combat Techniques Department also gave some opinions, but none of them thought that &quot;this is it&quot; was the answer. Just when they were troubled,</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi, do you have anything to say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your mouth is always moving. Just say something! You are my guardian beast, so be confident!&quot;</p>

<p>Next to Lapi who was hesitant to speak, the little human Chris proudly announced this for some reason.</p>

<p>All the eyes in the classroom were focused, and the young man couldn't help but feel a little timid, but in the end, he cautiously said:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that means...this 'mechanism' is probably very easy to break, right...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Hey freshman, I can't just let this go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The strength has also been approved by the teachers. There are still 0 broken &quot;mechanisms&quot; in the special training this year, right?&quot;</p>

<p>After the blacksmithing students retorted indignantly, he timidly said &quot;Oh, no, that's not what I meant...!&quot; and then managed to collect his thoughts and choose his words.</p>

<p>&quot;This 'mechanism' is probably a 'magic stone product' such as a 'magic tool' added to the structure of the weapon, right...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, that's right. Compared with ordinary weapons, the structure is completely different.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, in order to maintain this structure, the 'durability' will be reduced... This idea should be correct, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...If you mean compared with ordinary weapons, that's true. But, is the difference only a tiny bit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I think so too. Even so... but probably, even this slight difference will be scary in the dungeon.&quot;</p>

<p>Unknowingly, the blacksmithing students showed serious expressions, and Lapi faced them and spoke clearly.</p>

<p>&quot;I've heard this saying... In a maze (dungeon), a broken weapon is the same as losing half of your body.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you carry several weapons to explore, the number is limited... Orario's adventurers will definitely feel that 'weapons that can fight for a long time' are more precious.&quot;</p>

<p>Orario's blacksmiths are all very capable, and the performance of their weapons, including their durability, are exceptionally good.</p>

<p>Based on this premise, &quot;Sacrificing durability for the sake of incorporating a mechanism&quot; would be fatal in the labyrinth city. This is what Lapi meant.</p>

<p>The &quot;School District's&quot; &quot;organ weapon&quot; assembly technology is indeed of a high level and can withstand the test of actual combat.</p>

<p>But in the dungeon, &quot;the slightest difference&quot; will become a watershed and will definitely lead to someone's death.</p>

<p>Among the students who shared the feeling of surprise, Nina, whose eyes widened, also noticed this fact.</p>

<p>&quot;Magicians and other people who don't engage in close combat (fighting) very much should be very suitable for the structure of &quot;mechanism&quot;... But because it is &quot;easier to damage than ordinary weapons&quot;, no matter how powerful the weapon is, adventurers It should be difficult to hold in your hand...hmm.&quot;</p>

<p>Like a &quot;person involved&quot; who often hears the true thoughts of adventurers, Lapi summed it up carefully in front of the stunned students.</p>

<p>&quot;...Really? What Orario's adventurers value is not 'instant combat power', but endurance... 'the power to continue fighting'. After all, in a dungeon, continuous fighting is a matter of course!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed, if you drill into a very deep floor, such as during an 'expedition', you won't be able to carry out perfect preparations. 'Mechanism weapons' require more careful adjustment (maintenance) than ordinary weapons...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if we forcefully bring a blacksmith with us, it will be difficult to do anything without special equipment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At least it's difficult to use it as a main weapon! In other words, not only the performance of the weapon must be considered, but also the user's consideration, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Not long after, the students seemed to feel at home again and started a lively discussion again.</p>

<p>Especially the two people from the blacksmithing department said, &quot;Thank you! I feel like I see some hope!&quot; and kept patting Lapi's shoulders with his eyes turning white.</p>

<p>Through the teenager's input, the entire classroom gained a new perspective and was surrounded by rational excitement.</p>

<p>&quot;...Rapi-kun. It will be better if you become more confident in the future and express your opinions boldly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh...N-Nina?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Leon also said that, right? It's important to express your opinions! Thanks to Lapi-kun, we have become a little smarter again! This is amazing!&quot;</p>

<p>This scene made Nina very happy, she came to Lapi and said to him.</p>

<p>The same goes for everyone in the &quot;Third Team&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;If you make a mistake, we will definitely correct you. So don't be afraid of being wrong!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we are, 'School District'...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great, Lapi, you are indeed my guardian beast! You will become smarter and smarter from now on!&quot;</p>

<p>Iglin, Reki, and Chris also said the same thing, and the boy who was stunned at first also said &quot;Yeah, yeah!&quot; and nodded happily.</p>

<p>(Lapijun is really incredible...)</p>

<p>Nina left the classroom and was about to change into the combat uniform used for the special internship. She smiled as she was still excited.</p>

<p>Normally he acts like a younger brother who needs to be taken care of, but occasionally he shows up as a reliable older brother.</p>

<p>This is the charm of Lapi.</p>

<p>Therefore, Nina can't live without him more and more.</p>

<p>Nowadays, she will subconsciously look for him. Once she finds him, her face will light up and she will immediately run to his side.</p>

<p>(I don&rsquo;t even know whether I am Lapijun&rsquo;s older sister or younger sister.)</p>

<p>She examined her actions and smiled wryly.</p>

<p>(&#8230;Obviously I can&rsquo;t even talk to my real sister.)</p>

<p>Then, he will also laugh at himself.</p>

<p>After she left the teaching building with a dull expression, she happened to meet her friends passing by.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina~! Going for an internship?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... um. Betty, are you going to study?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah~! Try your best for the exam one last time~!&quot;</p>

<p>It was a girl from a dog-man, a tanuki, and a cow-woman that Lapi had also seen.</p>

<p>As the &quot;real&quot; exam was approaching, they held textbooks on their chests and looked exhausted to the naked eye.</p>

<p>At this moment, they glanced at each other, made up their minds and asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Nina. Why don't you take the guild exam with us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You worked so hard before, it would be a waste if you didn't go. How about coming back to teach the subject?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...But, I only got a C rating in the guild's mock test...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My grades are even worse~! And five years ago, there was also a Z-rated &quot;Float's Miracle&quot; who was admitted to the guild. Nina will be fine!&quot;</p>

<p>Friends of the dog man, the cow woman, and the tanuki man said one after another.</p>

<p>Nina lowered her eyes, forced a smile, and said apologetically:</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry, everyone. I've given up. And now I'm in the Combat Techniques Department... Let's talk about it later.&quot;</p>

<p>After that she walked away.</p>

<p>Bearing the lonely eyes of her friends behind her, Nina turned into the nearest intersection.</p>

<p>In the deserted alley, she leaned against the wall, desperately resisting the &quot;feelings&quot; entrenched in her heart.</p>

<p>&quot;...Lappi-kun must have thought of a way out...&quot;</p>

<p>The softly spoken words fell to the ground alone.</p>

<p>As a junior student who is more junior than himself, he already has a &quot;goal&quot; or a &quot;dream&quot;.</p>

<p>This fact made her feel helplessly empty and miserable.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>She raised her head and looked at the blue sky, which was so deep that she seemed to be immersed in it.</p>

<p>But the beautiful sky was unwilling to give Nina any answer.</p>

<p>After returning to the &quot;School District&quot; from [Hestia Familia], it can be said that [Team 3] and I had a very smooth day.</p>

<p>Thanks to experiencing the hard work and sense of accomplishment in the dungeon, everyone became more active. They practiced how to cooperate in the &quot;school zone&quot;, and successfully conquered the dungeon during the internship. Now they can safely reach the 14th floor. . Another thing that Teacher Leon asked me about before, that is, Nina's problem, I haven't been able to understand in depth, but now I have decided to devote my energy to the &quot;squad&quot; first, and I am working hard with Iglin and the others.</p>

<p>So, it was the tenth day after the start of life in the &quot;school district&quot; and the early morning of the seventh day after the start of &quot;special internship&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;We must reach the 15th floor today!&quot;</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of the &quot;Third Team&quot; is burning, and they want to go to the deepest floor of the dungeon designated by the &quot;School District&quot;.</p>

<p>No one objected to Eglin's call. Today's &quot;School District&quot; is undergoing a thorough overhaul in a huge shipyard. We gathered in front of the main entrance early in the morning, nodded to each other, and then took steps towards Orario.</p>

<p>As usual, he passed through the southwest gate of the city and went to the guild headquarters to complete the internship procedures.</p>

<p>Nina did not enter the guild headquarters, but stayed outside in the vestibule waiting for us. Now we will not go into details. It's the same today. We're waiting for her to tell us one day, and at the same time we're completing the internship procedures at the window. Miss Eina was also found. She was looking for someone among the &quot;school district&quot; students visiting the hall, but she could not speak to her now. I apologized in my mind and walked towards the guild's large bulletin board.</p>

<p>&quot;Any useful information?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, most of them are commissioned by adventurers.&quot;</p>

<p>Iglin asked, leaning against the backpack I was carrying.</p>

<p>Lapi Fleming is now regarded as a supporter and labyrinth house in the &quot;Third Team&quot; - &quot;a useful think tank although he cannot fight&quot;. To put it more handsomely, he is a counselor like Lily. Of course, I in no way consider myself to be on the same level as Lily.</p>

<p>In short, they seemed to have accepted that I was a labyrinth nerd who was serious about collecting information, so even though I was in a hurry to go to the dungeon, they still gave me time to browse the bulletin board.</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Collecting intelligence cannot be limited to the destination of exploration, but must collect intelligence from at least three levels above and below.</p>

<p>This was the daily homework Lily set for herself. At this time, I also followed her example as a supporter of the &quot;Third Team&quot;, and then I saw some information and tilted my head.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm just concerned about the information about the 'Lone King of the Labyrinth'...&quot;</p>

<p>The floor master of the &quot;middle floor&quot; is &quot;Goliath&quot;. The information about the floor master who was born about two weeks apart makes me feel that something is wrong. The bulletin board said that the next birth would be &quot;in two days&quot;, but...</p>

<p>(The war game is over. I remember the last banquet was held fourteen days ago...)</p>

<p>After that, Mr. Porus and the others went back to the 18th floor.</p>

<p>Due to the geographical factors of the safe floor, most of the &quot;Goliaths&quot; were hunted down by the residents of the Labyrinth Inn Street. Mr. Porus and the others should have dealt with it this time. During the &quot;Faction War&quot;, almost all the [Familiar] came to the ground to wait, so the 'Goliath' born on the 17th floor must have been left there for a while.</p>

<p>Therefore, the last time the floor master was defeated was Mr. Porus fourteen days ago, so the information that says &quot;Goliath was defeated twelve days ago&quot; is very strange.</p>

<p>If the floor master next appears &quot;one day later&quot;, considering the interval between births, it may be an error.</p>

<p>But the number &quot;two days later&quot; is an excellent limit that will make people who explore the &quot;middle level&quot; careless.</p>

<p>&quot;The floor master appeared on the 18th floor. Why do you want to read its information? Our destination is the 15th floor? We can never go to that kind of place again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, even so...&quot;</p>

<p>Just in case - my words did not reach Iglin's ears, he had already left my back. The backs of my companions gradually faded away, and I looked at the large bulletin board again.</p>

<p>(I have also heard that even if the residents of the Labyrinth Inn Street defeated &quot;Goliath&quot;, they would find it troublesome to contact the ground, leading to biased intelligence...)</p>

<p>I thought that &quot;Goliath&quot; was still on the 18th floor, but when I went to attack it, I found out that the residents of the Labyrinth Hotel Street had been defeated three days ago. There seemed to be many such things (deviations). Maybe this time is just a &quot;deviation&quot; - or my thoughts are no exception.</p>

<p>What's more, there seems to be a job like a &quot;liaison officer&quot; who collects rewards from the guild, travels between the 18th floor and the surface, and reports the correct date of the &quot;Goliath&quot; crusade...</p>

<p>(Maybe I made a mistake...just write down this &quot;feeling of disobedience&quot;.)</p>

<p>&quot;ha!&quot;</p>

<p>A group of males sneered as the orc students left the bulletin board.</p>

<p>They are the humans and beasts who serve as &quot;liaisons&quot; this time.</p>

<p>They were also the senior adventurers who had a conflict with the students of the &quot;school district&quot; one day and were disrupted by the first-level adventurer (Bell Crowne). They had nowhere to vent their inner anger.</p>

<p>&quot;Listen to that horrible roar for me and scare the shit out of you.&quot;</p>

<p>The adventurers looked down at the &quot;good boys&quot; wearing red and white battle uniforms walking back and forth in the hall, and laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Ooooooooooooooooo! &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Nina, there's a &quot;Cerber Hound&quot; at the fork in the road!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Reki, Chris, please! Don't let them breathe!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Understood.&quot; &quot;Leave it to me&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p>I, who was carefully searching for enemies behind Nina, issued a warning, and the &quot;Third Team&quot; dispersed smoothly.</p>

<p>The black fairy Reki kept kicking towards the wall or ceiling and jumping around. While disrupting, she launched a strong attack on the black dog group approaching from three directions. After inducing the enemy to reveal their flaws, the little human Chris was almost close to him. The enemy was approaching from the ground, and the two-handed sword that was nearly as long as his height flashed past.</p>

<p>The sound of cutting all the monsters in two was heard. Almost at the same time, Iglin, who stayed in the main battlefield passage, also launched an attack with the support of Nina's magic sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa once,&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;Gah!&quot; ? &#12303;</p>

<p>Swinging the sledgehammer, all three &quot;Crystal Mantises&quot; with crystal bodies were shattered.</p>

<p>The roar of Iglin, who had changed into &quot;Warrior Mode&quot;, still echoed in the &quot;Cave Maze&quot;. At this time, the battle was safely over.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay! It's easy to get to the 15th floor!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pack the loot. Hurry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun, I'm here to help recover the 'demon stone'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, Nina.&quot;</p>

<p>Iglin raised the sledgehammer high with a proud look on his face. Reki and Chris, who were complaining at the side, quickly collected the &quot;dropped items&quot;. Nina inserted the dagger-shaped &quot;Magic Sword&quot; back into her waist. , came and helped me take out the &quot;magic stone&quot; from the monster. The post-war handling was also watertight.</p>

<p>This &quot;Third Team&quot; that once relied solely on their own strength to charge forward was truly remarkable.</p>

<p>After reaching the 15th floor, I had this feeling.</p>

<p>They easily broke through the enemies in the &quot;middle level&quot; known as the &quot;first line of death&quot; and were able to go deeper.</p>

<p>Although they have not yet encountered a large monster like the &quot;Minotaur&quot;, the group combat level of &quot;Team 3&quot; is gradually improving, and now I no longer need to intervene.</p>

<p>It feels like today we will be faster and dive deeper into the dungeon than any other &quot;team&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;I feel like I can do anything now! If this continues, can I go directly to the 18th floor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going? You are alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks to me and everyone, two more 'credits' are enough! Where is the Minotaur!&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s hand feels good too. Having the confidence to not be careless and having high morale is definitely an ideal state. The current &quot;Third Team&quot; may be said to be unrivaled in the &quot;Cave Maze&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun? What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>but.</p>

<p>Other aspects that had nothing to do with the team's status gave me a &quot;catch-in-the-throat&quot; feeling.</p>

<p>(Today's dungeon feels different from usual...or it has a &quot;nasty feeling&quot;...)</p>

<p>To say what it is specifically, I can only answer that it is something. This makes me very anxious.</p>

<p>I looked back and forth, peeping around, even Nina was confused about this, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey!&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Whoa!? You scared me to death!&quot;</p>

<p>The monster's high-pitched cry echoed around.</p>

<p>It was a large group of &quot;evil bats&quot; born from the ceiling that scared Chris to jump.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;Third Team&quot; was relieved to find out that it was the bat monster they had fought on the &quot;upper level&quot;, but the biggest &quot;alarm bell&quot; sounded in my mind.</p>

<p>then.</p>

<p>&quot;Chiaaaaaah! ! &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Chi-chi-chi-chi! &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>Like a tone-deaf chorus, violent &quot;dissonance&quot; was heard throughout the entire floor.</p>

<p>&quot;W-what!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Evil bats', strange sound waves (screams), so many...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it a mass birth!?&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing countless overlapping monster screams, Nina and Reki covered their ears, and Iglin looked around.</p>

<p>The main attack method of the bat monster &quot;Evil Bat&quot; is &quot;strange sound waves&quot; that hinder the opponent's movement.</p>

<p>This unmistakable cry announced that at this moment, groups of dozens or hundreds of bats were being &quot;massively born&quot; in the underground city.</p>

<p>(The true face of the &quot;sense of disobedience&quot; is that not a single &quot;evil bat&quot; has been seen.)</p>

<p>I found the answer.</p>

<p>In the &quot;Cave Maze&quot;, it can be said that there must be &quot;bats&quot; lurking in the dark, but I have never seen them today!</p>

<p>(--Oops!!)</p>

<p>The revelation of the sense of violation directly triggered a &quot;sense of crisis&quot; that was too late.</p>

<p>There was a sound of rock exploding in every direction and everywhere.</p>

<p>The birth of a monster that breaks through the rock.</p>

<p>The dungeon did not breed and release an astonishing number of &quot;evil bats&quot; from the &quot;wall&quot; but from the &quot;ceiling&quot;, and the result was - the 15th floor collapsed as if it had lost its balance.</p>

<p>&quot;Varied!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, uh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh! ?&quot;</p>

<p>Above us, swarms of bats were born, and the hole-ridden ceiling fell off.</p>

<p>What's about to happen is an avalanche of vicious rocks! !</p>

<p>&quot;!!&quot;</p>

<p>All the nerves of a first-level adventurer and all the abilities of Level 5 screamed.</p>

<p>I pushed away Reki and Iglin who were stunned on the spot, hugged the bodies of Nina and Chris respectively with both hands, and jumped out of the impact of the collapse with all my strength.</p>

<p>The entire &quot;Cave Maze&quot; was surrounded by terrifying vibrations, with roars comparable to thunder falling, and terrifying screams emanating from the underground city.</p>

<p>&quot;Lady Hestia&mdash;!?&quot;</p>

<p>I always feel that the central square is a bit noisy.</p>

<p>Just when Hestia, who was working at the potato ball vendor, felt a little noisy, Lily ran over in a panic.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems that the &quot;middle level&quot; of the dungeon has collapsed! The impact has been large, and the students in the &quot;school district&quot; seem to have been affected too...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Collapse!?&quot;</p>

<p>Hestia shouted loudly, forgetting that she was still working, and Lily responded with a trembling voice:</p>

<p>&quot;Right now, the [Ganesha Familia] and [Loki Familia], as well as the 'School District' side, are working hard to remove the rock formations... but it is said that the situation is not optimistic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where's Bell-kun!? Where is that child now!?&quot;</p>

<p>As if confirming the goddess's unpleasant premonition, the family members showed a painful expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Just now, Lyu-sama went to the guild to inquire about the news... He said that the &quot;Third Team&quot; to which Mr. Bell belongs is also conducting special training on the 15th floor...&quot;</p>

<p>She turned her head sharply and stared at the skyscrapers rising into the sky and the direction of the underground city below.</p>

<p>The number of &quot;favors&quot; has not decreased. Bell didn't take any chances.</p>

<p>However, Hestia's pupils couldn't help but sway, and an uncontrollable impulse came over her, causing her to speak:</p>

<p>&quot;You were in trouble on the 15th floor, why are you here again, Bell-kun...!&quot;</p>

<p>What also hit me was a strong &quot;sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! It's blocked here too!&quot;</p>

<p>The anxious voice of Iglin, who was holding a sledgehammer in one hand, echoed around.</p>

<p>A hill of dirt and sand stood in front of us, completely blocking the road. Seeing that even the dwarves known as &quot;Earth People&quot; were helpless, Nina, Reki and Chris lost all color on their faces.</p>

<p>The current location is on the 15th floor of the dungeon.</p>

<p>The &quot;Third Team&quot; finally escaped the deadly rain of rocks without losing a single member, but at the cost of being exposed to another kind of suffering.</p>

<p>In other words, the return route was cut off due to large-scale landslides.</p>

<p>(This roundabout route is useless...)</p>

<p>On the &quot;middle&quot; floor map I bought from the guild, I drew a red</p>

<p>We, or rather all students in the &quot;school district&quot; use the regular routes on the floor when returning, and now all routes are blocked. All the paths that branched out like thin blood vessels were completely destroyed. All the roads from the 15th floor back to the 14th floor were blocked.</p>

<p>There are also areas where the entire terrain has changed due to collapsed rock pans, making it very dangerous to even stay there to observe the situation.</p>

<p>(Probably, there is no escape route back to the ground...)</p>

<p>At least that's the current situation.</p>

<p>It can be said that as long as the adventurers on the ground carrying special equipment do not remove the rock pan, the method of returning it will be hopelessly slim. Although I have become a first-level adventurer, it is not difficult to imagine that even if I use brute force to release a charged cannon and destroy the rock plate, the impact will cause a secondary disaster and worsen the situation.</p>

<p>Without professional knowledge and only destruction, I cannot break this dilemma.</p>

<p>There happened to be teachers from the &quot;school district&quot; on the 15th floor, and they happened to be able to join us.</p>

<p>Placing hope on this kind of &quot;trying luck&quot; should be the most unwise method.</p>

<p>(Maybe besides us, there are other people trapped too. I&rsquo;m worried, and I want to help if I can, but... Nina and the others are very tired, and running around with them in this situation... I can&rsquo;t do it. arrive.)</p>

<p>If we do this, &quot;Team 3&quot; will use all its strength first.</p>

<p>If we want to search for the victims who don't know where they are, we must at least send Nina and the others to a &quot;safe zone&quot; first.</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi, is there no other route!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...There is another very thin road in the southwest, but it is not usable here, and it is probably blocked there. Walking through it will also consume your energy, so I don't recommend going there to confirm the situation...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;why is it like this&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Even if the result was to take away the hope of Nina and the others, I still answered Iglin&rsquo;s question honestly.</p>

<p>I chose to share what&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>

<p>There is no way out. Trapped on all sides. Isolated.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m so unwilling...and I&rsquo;m really sorry for them.)</p>

<p>If only I could have noticed the dissonance of the &quot;evil bat&quot; earlier.</p>

<p>If they could have sensed the signs of the &quot;abnormal situation&quot;, Nina and the others would not have suffered like this.</p>

<p>Sure enough, I was far from qualified.</p>

<p>If it were Miss Aisi, Miss Liu, Mr. Finn or Master, they would be able to detect the dangerous aura as quickly as possible and guide the team to safety. I felt painfully that even though he had become a first-level adventurer, Bell Crane was still an inexperienced &quot;novice&quot;.</p>

<p>Must be more cautious. Must be more diligent. The nerves must be ground sharper. To protect yourself and your companions.</p>

<p>I deeply regretted and reflected in my heart, and then switched my thinking, just then.</p>

<p>Among the team dominated by dull silence, Reki spoke:</p>

<p>&quot;Squad leader (Nina)...what should I do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh&#8230;&#8230;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The policy has been decided.&quot;</p>

<p>What is the goal of the team?</p>

<p>Reki pointedly and even cruelly made a request to the captain who managed the army.</p>

<p>Nina held her breath, unable to answer.</p>

<p>&quot;...If you think about it carefully, there are two ways. Stay on the regular route and wait for rescue on the ground...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or what Lapi said, put your hope on the line and find another route. As for me, well, I think it's better to wait for rescue! I'm not just saying that because I hate taking action and then feel desperate, huh!&quot;</p>

<p>Eglin and Chris prompted her with the options available. Chris also opened up about his inner thoughts.</p>

<p>Nina looked over at me with her breath and lips quivering.</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun... How much water, food... and props are there...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...If everyone uses them separately, the food should not last half a day. As for props, four recovery potions, three mental recovery potions, and two advanced recovery potions...&quot;</p>

<p>In order for everyone to see, I poured out all the contents of my backpack and placed them on the ground.</p>

<p>The spare weapons include two short swords, which can be used by Reki or Chris.</p>

<p>Eglin and the others also displayed the props they had prepared.</p>

<p>Immediately confirming everyone's equipment, Nina's judgment of the situation was correct. He is worthy of being an honors student and can be given full marks. Because of this, it felt like he was strangling himself.</p>

<p>Confirming possession of items is equivalent to turning lifespan into a number.</p>

<p>If you lose your cool, you will always be played by cold numbers. I've had this experience too.</p>

<p>As for my current feeling, &quot;The situation is much better than it was then&quot;, probably because I have experienced &quot;deep&quot; death row.</p>

<p>I pushed aside the unhelpful reference to the status quo, put the prop back in my backpack, and peered at Nina.</p>

<p>Sweating is severe. Breathing becomes shallower. It's definitely stressful.</p>

<p>Her companions all looked over, and she had to make a major decision that would affect the fate of the team.</p>

<p>Seeing this figure, I&mdash;even though I knew it was out of place, I saw in her the shadow of her &quot;former self&quot; from six months ago.</p>

<p>(Did Lily feel the same way at that time...)</p>

<p>My companion (Welf) was injured, and I was very confused. I kept moving blindly and sweating a lot.</p>

<p>In that desperate situation, the supporter who was supposed to be weaker than anyone else was calmer than anyone else.</p>

<p>Lily is not here now.</p>

<p>So this time, it was my turn to help Nina and the others after being helped by Lily.</p>

<p>&quot;Calm down first.&quot;</p>

<p>I followed Lily's words at that time.</p>

<p>Everyone came back to their senses, shook their shoulders, and all looked at me. I walked to Nina first.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina, can you take a breath?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh&#8230;&#8230;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Try taking a deep breath and exhaling it slowly? Hiss-ha-his-ha-...like this?&quot;</p>

<p>I took an exaggerated deep breath, said with a smile, then thought for a moment, and then held Nina's little finger.</p>

<p>This is the magic spell that Ms. Liu used on me when I was in the &quot;deep state&quot;.</p>

<p>Her hands shook for a moment, then relaxed.</p>

<p>Nina's eyes met mine, entangled tightly, and she quietly inhaled and exhaled, again and again, to stabilize her breathing.</p>

<p>I also approached Iglin and stretched out my hand. He said, &quot;I don't need it!&quot; and waved away my hand with an expression as if he was about to stick out his tongue at any time. Reki also hid her hands behind her waist and said &quot;skip&quot;.</p>

<p>Chris said, &quot;I want it!&quot; and stretched out his hands, so I said, &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; and took them.</p>

<p>Although the atmosphere became a little strange, it was much better than before. Everyone relaxed.</p>

<p>&quot;As for the team's policy, besides the two just now, there should be one more.&quot;</p>

<p>After I said this, Nina and the others gradually showed surprised expressions.</p>

<p>There was no smell of monsters around. There will be an attack if you don't need to be prepared for the time being.</p>

<p>So I didn't worry, I still thought about Lily's words and made that suggestion.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, the hope of returning to the upper floors is very slim. Therefore, you can go to the lower floors...and take refuge on the 18th floor.&quot;</p>

<p>The too strong impact left Nina and the others speechless.</p>

<p>&quot;The 18th floor is a safe floor where monsters will not appear. There is also an inn street for adventurers. As long as you get there, your life can be guaranteed first.&quot;</p>

<p>Naturally, everyone in the team raised fierce objections and questions.</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi, wait a minute! This is the 15th floor, right? I have to cross three floors, even a super powerful me will be exhausted!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is a 'vertical hole' here. There are many deep pits in the 'middle floor'. If you find them and jump into them, you can move to the floor below in one go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Floor Master...what should I do? Freak, lair, 17th floor...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If the information on the guild's bulletin board today is correct...then there should be two days of buffer time before the birth interval.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;L-Lapi-kun, do you have a map...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, everything up to the 18th floor is ready.&quot;</p>

<p>Chris's words, Reki's questions, and Nina's confirmations were all answered smoothly.</p>

<p>Perhaps recalling the contents of the bulletin board I had been checking at the guild headquarters, Iglin asked with a dull look on his face:</p>

<p>&quot;I-I said you, did you know it would turn out like this...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew it a long time ago, so it doesn't count. However, I did think about being prepared just in case. ...The most powerful supporter I know is this kind of person.&quot;</p>

<p>I answered his question with a wry smile, and at the same time stood and spread out the maps of the 16th and 17th floors.</p>

<p>For us adventurers, Lily always carries a full backpack and is always prepared seriously.</p>

<p>When it was decided that I would be the supporter of the &quot;Third Team&quot;, I used Lily as a reference.</p>

<p>That's all it really is.</p>

<p>So I puffed up my chest and proudly boasted about this most powerful supporter.</p>

<p>Eglin and the others held their breath, while I looked at Nina.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina, it doesn't matter what you choose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh&#8230;&#8230;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The 'Third Team' is very strong. So no matter which path we choose, we will definitely be able to return to the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>I said with a smile, and then Nina opened her green jade pupils wide.</p>

<p>I just pushed a little, and the choice itself was left to Nina and &quot;Team 3&quot;.</p>

<p>I always feel like it&rsquo;s not up to me to make the choice now.</p>

<p>That's not the job of &quot;Rapi&quot;.</p>

<p>What it means to be here. Not as the leader of the [Familia], not as a first-level adventurer, but as the meaning of standing here as [Lappy Fleman].</p>

<p>I never consider myself to be the one who can guide others.</p>

<p>However, after becoming Level 5, I probably won&rsquo;t be able to run just for myself like I did before.</p>

<p>The &quot;vision&quot; that Ms. Liu mentioned.</p>

<p>Share and spread.</p>

<p>In other words, spread the light of hope.</p>

<p>Do Lord Hermes, Lord Baldr and Teacher Leon want to use the &quot;school district&quot; to teach me this?</p>

<p>Now, I feel like this.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Her long tawny hair swayed. The same goes for the strand of emerald hair that represents the noble bloodline.</p>

<p>Nina, who held the staff tightly with both hands like a hug, raised her head powerfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's move forward.&quot;</p>

<p>Eglin and the others looked surprised, while I smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;I feel that if we stop moving forward...then we won't be 'Team 3 (us)'!&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing this declaration, Iglin and Chris also smiled this time.</p>

<p>The same must have happened to Reki who held up her cheek under the mask.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay! Let's go to the 18th floor! Let's impress those who look down on us! Let's restore the reputation of being the 'worst team in history'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My heroic deeds will become more colorful! And Iglin, the stigma is not redeemed, but returned!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Chris, it's so rare to complain...it will definitely go smoothly after that.&quot;</p>

<p>Iglin and the others still had individual reactions, but their wills were all directed towards the same goal, which made Nina smile. She looked over and I nodded in response.</p>

<p>The goal is to move forward.</p>

<p>The &quot;Third Team&quot; started heading towards the 18th floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, this is serious... I heard from the guy who came back that you can't go down after the 15th floor...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Adventurers who are accustomed to exploring will head towards the 18th floor... and the kids in the 'School District' must be the same. Because, because we forged information about the floor owner, many people will suffer...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-it's none of our business! I just wanted to scare them. Who knew something like this would happen!&quot;</p>

<p>Leon's ears caught the adventurers' conversation, but it was meaningless now, so he ignored it and just stared at the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; standing in front.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't expect that students would be trapped in the dungeon under such conditions.&quot;</p>

<p>An earth-shaking noise surrounded the central square. Adventurers from various [Family] families and teachers from the [School District] were running around. Among them, this man's upper body was wrapped in a piece of silver armor.</p>

<p>Carrying a &quot;big long sword&quot; on his back.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, he did not serve as the surveillance officer of the dungeon today. Leon sighed at this bad timing and walked towards the giant chalk tower.</p>

<p>&quot;This is Aoharu too~... I really can't say that now. Please Leon, the children still have to sing about their youth. Please save them~!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The situation is not optimistic. I can't say anything to comfort you. But I will do my best, Lord Eden.&quot;</p>

<p>The absolutely strong man swore an oath like a &quot;knight&quot;, and the goddess who used her whole body to plead gave him a trusting smile and told him the now confirmed information:</p>

<p>&quot;Among the students, those who are still in the dungeon are the 'Seventh Team' of [Badelban] and the 'Third Team'. The former is an elite unit, so it shouldn't matter, but I'm worried about the latter, which is the 'Third Team'. &quot;The worst team ever&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Iden is not the god of &quot;battle&quot;, nor is she the goddess of &quot;destiny&quot;.</p>

<p>Sensing her obviously uneasy thoughts - and this &quot;unfounded worry&quot;, Leon smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;I can speak for myself on this matter. Don't worry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p>

<p>In order to be able to gallop like a horse at a speed that surpasses everyone in an instant, his powerful feet gathered strength and declared this:</p>

<p>&quot;'Team 3' also has 'Hero's Egg (him)'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Get out of my way ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot;</p>

<p>The large monster &quot;Tusk Liger&quot; blocked the front, and Iglin's sledgehammer met it head on.</p>

<p>The &quot;One-Horned Rabbit&quot; that appeared next was dealt with by the Black Fairy's two-handed swords, and the &quot;Dungeon Worm&quot; that rushed out from the perforated ground was dealt with by the two-handed swords of the little human. The two of them released sharp blade strikes and slashed again and again. Fly enemies.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, everybody!!&quot;</p>

<p>Facing this scene, Nina used the &quot;Devil Sword&quot; to release the wind slash and immediately used the reply magic.</p>

<p>Supported by the defenders, the three forwards came to life.</p>

<p>Now Nina also assumes the responsibility of conductor, and her judgment is very accurate. Under the condition that neither physical nor mental energy could be wasted, she accurately saw through the critical line, activated magic, and continuously supported Iglin and the frontline personnel. After that painful experience on the 12th floor, she was even equipped with a &quot;Magic Sword&quot;. Not to mention her role as a healer, her quality as a squad leader is also rapidly improving.</p>

<p>(After falling from the vertical hole to the 16th floor, the pressure on the monsters has increased! Now the central defender (Leqi) has also stepped forward to act as a vanguard, and there is no backup!!)</p>

<p>Because of this, Nina has clearly realized that this is a critical moment and a &quot;dilemma&quot;.</p>

<p>They had already exceeded the maze exploration time set before setting off from the &quot;school area&quot;. The &quot;Third Team&quot; keeps updating the record for the number of consecutive battles. It can be said that they are constantly challenging the limits, experiencing the &quot;baptism of the dungeon&quot; like many advanced adventurers have experienced.</p>

<p>Decreased ability to sustain combat (stamina). Physical strength can be healed with magic, so it's not a problem, but continuous fighting overloads the brain, causing concentration disorders. Just one failure will lead to the collapse of the battle line. This extreme state slowly reduces the students' leeway, like carefully peeling off the skin of a fruit. If we add the relentless wave of monsters at this time, it will become a &quot;hard battle&quot; that has never been experienced in the &quot;School District&quot;.</p>

<p> Iglin's injured forehead, Reki's brown upper arms exposed due to the torn sleeves, and Chris's neck where the enemy's blood was splashed, all had streaks of sweat dripping down their faces. Nina is even more serious. Having used magic the most, her mental strength was greatly squeezed, and large beads of sweat slipped from her skin several times.</p>

<p>If it hadn't been for the perfect timing of Lapi following behind her to replenish her with a mental recovery potion, she would have fallen into mental exhaustion by now.</p>

<p>(We are moving forward, even if we are walking on a tightrope! Lapijun is also helping us. As long as we survive here, we will definitely overcome it! Then we will rest again, and then we can reach the 18th floor!!)</p>

<p>Lapi is using the poisonous moth's poison bag and other self-prepared props to provide support. Including him, the entire &quot;Third Team&quot; has been able to unite to fight. Now this squad is showing great strength.</p>

<p>(So &#8203;&#8203;please, please keep going like this...!)</p>

<p>Enemies ahead can be dealt with.</p>

<p>For enemies in the front, you can rely on the three vanguards and your own support to get through.</p>

<p>If it's one direction, it can be dealt with.</p>

<p>So please keep it like this and nothing else happens.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;As if mocking Nina&rsquo;s prayer, the labyrinth summoned the death scythe.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina, back there!!&quot;</p>

<p>Chris, who was fighting in the vanguard, turned around sharply.</p>

<p>The little human rarely lost his composure and shouted out that name.</p>

<p>&quot;It's the Minotaur!!&quot;</p>

<p>A terrifying roar hit her back, causing Nina's breathing to stop for a moment.</p>

<p>She finally turned around, and three fierce bulls burst into her green jade pupils.</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!&quot; ! &#12303;</p>

<p>It let out a roar that almost forced it to stop, but the large monsters &quot;Minotaurs&quot; that it encountered for the first time launched an attack with fierce momentum.</p>

<p>Nina stretched out the &quot;Magic Sword&quot; mixed with fear.</p>

<p>Then came the end.</p>

<p>The green blade, which had exceeded the limit of use, was full of cracks and shattered with a snap.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Nina couldn't move. Chris and the others also lost their words.</p>

<p>It was the worst &quot;pincer attack&quot; as if it had been planned in advance.</p>

<p>Eglin and the others tried their best just to deal with the monster group in front of them. To rescue means to lose one's life.</p>

<p>Therefore, the initial prey for the bulls will be the supporters in the last row.</p>

<p>A powerless orc boy without the strength to fight.</p>

<p>&quot;ah---&quot;</p>

<p>Desperation opened its mouth.</p>

<p>Maze roared with laughter.</p>

<p>When Iglin, Reki, and Chris faced &quot;frustration&quot;, they were about to give in. At this time, Nina shouted out heartbreakingly:</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;Run, Lapi-kun!!&quot;</p>

<p>The boy's answer to the cry was,</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Pulling your hands out of the straps of your backpack.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll figure it out.&quot;</p>

<p>The large backpack fell to the ground with a thud.</p>

<p>The young man pulled out two spare daggers with flowing hands.</p>

<p>Then it turned into a gust of wind.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>In the time compressed to the limit, Nina saw it.</p>

<p>Just before engaging the enemy, the moment before the &quot;Minotaur&quot; aimed at its prey and swung its steel arm.</p>

<p>The boy's figure became blurry.</p>

<p>In an instant, he appeared in the arms of the fierce bull with an illusion-like teleportation, and his right hand turned into a silver flash.</p>

<p>Boom! ! With a sound, an incredible impact occurred.</p>

<p>A piercing sound like a &quot;cannon&quot; came from the center of the &quot;Minotaur&quot;'s chest, and then exploded.</p>

<p>The shadow didn't stop.</p>

<p>He increased his speed, powerful enough to cast down a shower of flying black ash.</p>

<p>Having lost his partner, the second person who was frozen on the spot was approached by him. This time, at the moment when he was about to pass by, his left hand flashed with silver light.</p>

<p>A hole was opened in the chest, the dagger penetrated, and it exploded again.</p>

<p>&quot;Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much! ? &#12303;</p>

<p>The last one let out a threatening cry, raised the stone ax in his hand high, and swung it down.</p>

<p>The ground exploded and dust flew. But the execution rabbit was no longer there.</p>

<p>He took a life-threatening evasive action, passed through with the ax and reached the position behind him, ending everything.</p>

<p>The &quot;Minotaur&quot;, whose &quot;demon stone&quot; was pierced by the attack from behind, turned into a large amount of dust and disappeared before he could understand his fate.</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p>In the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>It was so fleeting that I couldn't even tell whether it was an overwhelming situation.</p>

<p>I couldn't even see how powerful it was.</p>

<p>Maze, who was laughing loudly, seemed to have closed his mouth and said nothing.</p>

<p>The same goes for Nina, Eglin and others, as well as other monsters. Fragments of the murmur fell from the half-elf's lips. The black elf girl was the first to recover and hurriedly hacked to death the remaining monsters.</p>

<p>This time, the battle is finally over.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha...haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, Iglin shouted loudly and ran to the bunny boy's side.</p>

<p>&quot;W-what was that just now!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh... I tried the one-hit kill targeting the &quot;Magic Stone&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Movement, Level 1, completely different...!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well...well...it's been [upgraded] recently...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why didn't you tell us!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so, so sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>Reki and Chris also joined in, and the three of them questioned Lapi. He - he should have kept his hand in order not to reveal his identity, but due to the [Bullfighting Instinct (Skill)], his full power increased explosively, and he showed more power than imagined. The young man who was exposed to the execution scene that was several times more powerful&mdash;he kept laughing and apologizing.</p>

<p>Nina, who was stunned on the spot, also came to her senses. She ran over and began to palpate Lapi's body as if she wanted to hug him.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay, Lapi-kun!? Are you injured!? Are you really okay!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I'm okay, Nina? Don't, don't worry about me, just rest first!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Reply and then move forward! The monster attack has been interrupted, now is a good opportunity!&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing Lapi's call, the &quot;Third Team&quot; showed an expression of complete inability to let go, but now it was an emergency. What the boy said was very correct, and fatigue had weakened their judgment, so Nina and the others stopped pursuing it and hurriedly took a short rest.</p>

<p>Use the props and set off immediately after recovering.</p>

<p>Chris, who was gradually establishing his abilities and status as a scout, took the lead, moving forward cautiously and as quickly as possible. Fortunately, they discovered the &quot;vertical cave&quot; immediately, and the &quot;Third Team&quot; reached the 17th floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Although many things are unacceptable, but...this way we can reach the 18th floor! Since Lappi can also fight, we no longer have to worry about the future!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And monsters are rarely encountered! The goddesses of fate must be smiling on us!&quot;</p>

<p>The most important thing is that Lapi's unexpected activity ignited the &quot;Third Team&quot;.</p>

<p>In a difficult situation, this turn of events brought a tailwind and boosted morale. The two or three monsters they encountered sporadically were also chopped down by them without stopping. They continued to move forward and came to the &quot;big passage&quot; known as the central road on the 17th floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Lap, the road!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...After that, just walk along the road. If you continue like this, you can reach the depths of the 17th floor.&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing Reki's voice asking for directions (navigation), Rapi spread out the map with both hands and told him succinctly.</p>

<p>The faces of everyone in the &quot;Third Team&quot; gradually became filled with hope, and Nina held onto the long staff tightly.</p>

<p>&quot;It can be done...! This way it can be done!&quot;</p>

<p>(Well, that will work. Even so...)</p>

<p>Listening to Nina's voice, I looked around.</p>

<p>It is very wide horizontally and high overhead, as if there is an endless passage. This road was huge enough for a giant to pass through, and finally not even the shadow of the monster could be seen.</p>

<p>so quiet.</p>

<p>Too quiet.</p>

<p>Even assuming that the dungeon prioritized repairing the terrain due to the massive collapse that swept through the area on the 15th floor, and therefore did not breed new monsters, the place was dominated by silence that penetrated both ears.</p>

<p>And I know what this &quot;silence&quot; is.</p>

<p>&quot;...?&quot;</p>

<p>Nina and the others also noticed this unnatural situation.</p>

<p>As they ran, they peeked around uneasily. Nina, Iglin, Reki, and Chris all looked behind them.</p>

<p>But I, who was at the end of the line, still nodded, conveying the meaning of &quot;I can only move forward.&quot;</p>

<p>Dominated by strong suspense, I still looked ahead again and made the sound of footsteps.</p>

<p>It's not like monsters can't appear. But it didn't come out.</p>

<p>It was almost as if he was looking forward to something - or fearing the birth of something.</p>

<p>(S-sure enough... the information on the guild bulletin board is...)</p>

<p>The strong &quot;sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu&quot; caused bursts of pain near the back of the head.</p>

<p>I frowned, but still moved forward with the &quot;Third Team&quot;.</p>

<p>Since there were no other sounds, Nina and the others' breathing was extremely clear. The stone was kicked by the shoe and flew up with a sound, and was absorbed by the thin darkness of silence.</p>

<p>The cold gradually eroded all the members of the ignorant team.</p>

<p>Chris, who was leading the charge, seemed unable to bear the uneasy atmosphere and increased his running speed. Nina and the others also cooperated and accelerated forward. Just like the new adventurer who passed here half a year ago, he convinced himself that as long as the silence did not disappear, it would still be too late.</p>

<p>then.</p>

<p>&quot;!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is the 'Sighing Jade'...!&quot;</p>

<p>We arrived at the huge lobby.</p>

<p>The walls and ceiling were both made of huge rocks with twisted shapes. Only the left wall had a completely different structure. The scenery here made Reki and Iglin speechless. For adventurers, that beautiful wall with no uneven surface is the &quot;Sigh&quot; itself.</p>

<p>&quot;Chris, don't stop! Keep going&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>When I told the team alone, it was as if I vowed to defeat us this time.</p>

<p>Snap it.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>It rang.</p>

<p>That voice.</p>

<p>Nina and others suddenly looked to the side.</p>

<p>On the giant wall, a huge crack traced a lightning-like trajectory from top to bottom.</p>

<p>&quot;--start running!&quot;</p>

<p>As if driven by my shouting, Nina and the others started running together.</p>

<p>We moved through the halls with furious momentum. But the &quot;sound of birth&quot; played by the cruel rift is faster than us.</p>

<p>Plop, plop, the cracking sound is getting faster and faster. The sound that hit the eardrums took away all the color from the faces of Nina and others. The cracking sound that seemed like gasping, groaning, and sighing finally turned into a roar like an angry wave, and finally turned into a sound of destruction.</p>

<p>The next moment.</p>

<p>With an even more violent breaking sound, that thing was born.</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!&quot; ! &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;The Lone King of the Labyrinth&quot;&mdash;&mdash;Goliath! !</p>

<p>The newly born but overly big baby let out a deafening roar as soon as he saw the livid-faced students under his eyes.</p>

<p>&#12302;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! ! &#12303;</p>

<p>While shouting, the giant also started running.</p>

<p>Every time the legs as thick as giant trees fell down, the ground would crack, the ground would ring, and everything would be shaken.</p>

<p>&quot;H-hurry up ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?&quot;</p>

<p>Iglin exploded with screams mixed with mournful screams.</p>

<p>Nina and the others gathered the last strength from their sweaty bodies and ran as fast as they could.</p>

<p>The fierce pursuit of &quot;Goliath&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;death act&quot; I experienced for the first time more than six months ago is happening again! !</p>

<p>- However, only the brain is very calm.</p>

<p>Follow normal practices and focus on escaping. Never fight back. The safety of the third squad (team) is the highest priority.</p>

<p>Even if I don't need to hide my identity now, I still have no choice but to avoid the floor master under the current situation. Even though my level is higher than the opponent's, the battle with normal monsters is different from the main battle on the floor. Anything can go wrong. And if I choose to stay at the rear here, it would be meaningless if the &quot;Third Team&quot; without me is in danger again in the front. Risks must be completely eliminated. Now is not the time to &quot;take risks.&quot;</p>

<p>I was in the back row, accurately measuring the distance between the giant staring here and us, constantly calculating the rapidly shortening buffer time to survive.</p>

<p>run. run. run.</p>

<p>Nina and the others really risked their lives to escape the tremendous pressure and murderous intent that was approaching them.</p>

<p>Fatigue, thinking, and fear were all thrown aside, and he ran towards the exit in front of his sight.</p>

<p>But at this moment, a small human was tripped by the sound of the ground and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Aww!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Chris!?&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Chris's face twitched with fear.</p>

<p>The faces of Nina and others were filled with despair.</p>

<p>And I took off my backpack without hesitation.</p>

<p>&quot;ah!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, let's go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;!!&quot;</p>

<p>From the position at the end of the line, I picked up the small body while maintaining the current speed.</p>

<p>I picked up Chris and shouted to Nina and the others who stopped for a moment.</p>

<p>The &quot;Third Team&quot; turned forward again in half surprise, exerting all their strength.</p>

<p>I hugged Chris, who was flushed and clinging to me, and kicked toward the rocky ground as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, run, run ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Iglin's scream was drowned out by the huge volume of the giant. At the same time, I, who was at the end, had to make a cruel judgment.</p>

<p>--That's too late.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;The stop just now was too fatal.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;Before jumping into the communication channel, Goliath's attack will explode.</p>

<p>Both hands are occupied. Sniper (Fire Volt) is no longer available. It &#96;s my mistake.</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch, ouch&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>A strong wind blew from behind. There was the sound of giant arms being raised high. The blow that will shatter everything is coming.</p>

<p>Nina, Iglin, and Reki could no longer look back, and their desperate gasps reached their ears.</p>

<p>Chris couldn't seem to take it anymore. He closed his eyes hard and tightened his grip on my combat suit.</p>

<p>So I took advantage of this momentary gap that no one would notice and rang the &quot;bell&quot;.</p>

<p>A second of energy accumulation.</p>

<p>Pure white light particles are attached to the right foot.</p>

<p>Before the hammer of destruction swung down from far overhead and killed us, I stepped on it with my right foot.</p>

<p>&quot;Fly!!&quot;</p>

<p>An explosion occurs.</p>

<p>After smashing the ground and gaining super acceleration, I turned into a &quot;cannonball&quot; and filled up the distance that Nina and the others ran as hard as they could, but it was not enough to reach the communication channel.</p>

<p>The moment I bumped into Iglin's back, knocking Nina and the others away - a destructive blow exploded right behind me.</p>

<p>&quot;Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong! ! &#12303;</p>

<p>The aftermath of the destruction and the even violent wind pressure knocked us away, causing us to rush into the communication channel at the deepest part of the hall.</p>

<p>We were blown away.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really want to recall the experience of violent collision in the narrow cave, but it is exactly the same now as it was then.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!? Lapi&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p>I held Chris, who was screaming like a girl, tightly in my arms. The world turned twice or three times. Nina, Iglin, and Reki also flew over first and then rolled around. At the same time, we continued to move deeper into the cave. go ahead.</p>

<p>Withstanding the impact from all angles, I managed to maintain my consciousness this time, and then rolled down the gentle slope with a chaotic momentum, and finally&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Uh-huh&mdash;&mdash;!?&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Sigh&mdash;&mdash;! ! one time.</p>

<p>The &quot;Third Team&quot; was launched from the exit of the communication channel like a shotgun, and then fell to the ground.</p>

<p>After enduring the impact of the fall, we cut the ground again and finally stopped.</p>

<p>Nina was lying on her back with tears in her eyes. Iglin was lying on the ground, hugging and kissing the earth. Reki's mask was blown away by the impact, exposing her pitiful appearance, and she was in a trance.</p>

<p>Finally, after being beaten the hardest, I closed one eye tightly and endured the pain in my back, and let go of the hug.</p>

<p>The little human, who was even more petite than Lily, rolled her eyes and fainted.</p>

<p>(...It must be &quot;daytime&quot;.)</p>

<p>I squinted my eyes to look at the &quot;light&quot; shining above my head, and judged the time zone of the floor.</p>

<p>As if being pulled to my feet, I recognized the green trees in front of me and the crystal chrysanthemums blooming on the distant ceiling, and whispered:</p>

<p>&quot;Maze Paradise...&quot;</p>

<p>By the time the &quot;Third Team&quot;, which was lying motionless on the ground, began to stagger and move, it was already ten minutes after I had finished distributing the final reply potion.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean we can't stay here!?&quot;</p>

<p>The roar of Iglin in his &quot;gentleman state&quot; echoed in this street of wood and crystal.</p>

<p>Although he was a student, he was still a dwarf with a rough face, but the other party, the hotel street guy with an eyepatch on his left eye, was still not afraid of his aggressive attitude.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me, which hotel would let guests who can't afford the accommodation stay? Ahhh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This accommodation fee is too exaggerated! What's the deal with half a million francs!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all, Rivera is a high-end hotel. This is a paradise. The cheap hotels on the ground are simply not good enough. If you don't want to, just go back to me, young men of the 'School District'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gu...!?&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Porus dug his ears with his little fingers and treated Eglin casually, making his veins bulge with anger. Behind him, Reki and Chris were making noises like &quot;Porphy-por!&quot; while keeping the sledgehammer in hand. I secretly smiled bitterly as I carried the sledgehammer behind me.</p>

<p>The &quot;Third Team&quot; was paralyzed and was in a daze for a long time, unable to move for a while. After dragging our tired pace, we finally walked from the communication passage in the south of the floor to the west of the floor, built on the lake and cliff. &quot;Rivera Street&quot;, it's almost time for &quot;night&quot; to fall.</p>

<p> The phosphorescence emitted by the chrysanthemums on the ceiling began to weaken, and the surroundings were gradually surrounded by darkness. At this time, the &quot;Third Team&quot;, who were in dilapidated body and mind, wanted to stay, but this was the result. It seems that Mr. Porus - or all the residents of &quot;Riviera Street&quot; hate the students of the &quot;School District&quot;. Not taken seriously at all.</p>

<p>Even if you take it seriously, the price will be too high.</p>

<p>&quot;If you give me your weapons, as well as the armor and clothes you are wearing, I can let you stay for one night, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...! What a joke! We have to go back from the dungeon after this! We can't give you weapons or armor!&quot;</p>

<p>Iglin yelled back with spittle, turning his back to Mr. Porus.</p>

<p>Nina and the others also looked embarrassed and looked for other hotels with a glimmer of hope.</p>

<p>The baptism of the lawless... is a bit too cruel. Especially in this situation.</p>

<p>After confirming that &quot;Team 3&quot; could no longer see me, I moved my face closer to Porus-san who was starting to maintain the weapon.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Mr. Porus.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah? Don't call me by my name casually, you brat from the 'School District'. I, my lord, don't care about those of you who are inexperienced in the world - uh&quot;</p>

<p>I lifted my bangs covering my eyes with my right hand and interrupted him.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm talking about you, [White Rabbit Swiftfoot]!? What are you doing? Why are you dressed like this!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sh&mdash;! It would be bad if it was exposed...! Don't let Nina and the others hear...!&quot;</p>

<p>I lowered my voice and begged, and then Mr. Porus, who rolled his eyes, showed a sly smile.</p>

<p>He took me to the inside of the counter, inside the store.</p>

<p>&quot;You're forced to deal with trouble again, aren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a problem...it's just a reason.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since I have to protect the little ghosts, it's a bit more troublesome than a normal adventurer's request.&quot;</p>

<p>The broad palm patted my shoulder, making my wry smile deepen.</p>

<p>If only he could be so generous with Nina and the others...</p>

<p>&quot;Then what? Is something wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I'll pay for it later. Can we stay the night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh my. Even though I just said that to that brat, in fact, everywhere is full. You also came here to take refuge because of the collapse, right? The guys who came up above and those who came back from exploring below, As a result, all the guys who couldn&rsquo;t go back lived here, and now there are no vacancies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That's it...that's it... This does make sense.</p>

<p>Seeing the miserable situation on the 15th floor, I vaguely realized that since the route back to the surface was blocked, the adventurers could only take refuge on the 18th floor.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, can you sell me some camping equipment? After we find a safe place, we will find a way...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that's no problem. I owe you a lot of favors after all. I'll give you a good discount!&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing Mr. Porus's fingers forming a circle, I thought, 'After all, it's probably just a 'little' discount.' I couldn't help but smile. At the same time, I also asked about another thing that I was very concerned about.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Porus, what's going on with the 'Goliath' born on the 17th floor? There should be others escaping here. I think it would be better to attack them...&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Should I say you are kind-hearted or something, you are really diligent. But don't worry over there. You can no longer hear the ground or other sounds on the 17th floor. You must have fallen. I heard Molder who escaped in said that it seemed The guys from the 'school district' had a fight with it...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Mr. Molder is here too?&quot;</p>

<p>It took a long time to arrive at &quot;Rivera Street&quot; - sending the exhausted &quot;Third Team&quot; to this &quot;safe zone&quot; - so I couldn't take the time to return to the 17th floor, but I heard Mr. Molder's words. Finally, I felt relieved for the time being. We were probably the first to reach the 18th floor, so we must have been passed by Mr. Molder and the others on the way to &quot;Riviera Street&quot;. After all, we did not take the shortest route heading straight towards the lake on the west side. Instead, we went to the prairie area in the center of the floor first, choosing a safe route.</p>

<p>I originally wanted to leave Nina and the others under the care of Mr. Porus and fight on my own...</p>

<p>&quot;The more important thing now is that Goliath made a big fuss and blocked the communication channel. Although I asked my brothers to dig, the entire cave collapsed. It will take a lot of time to open it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That means...you have to stay on the 18th floor for a while, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right. If you want to camp, I recommend you go below Rivera and around the lake. After all, monsters go to the big forest where there is food, so you don't have to worry too much about being attacked. Save time when you want to find food. You can also camp in the forest like those guys from the [Loki Familia]...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahaha...sell me the ingredients as well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, it's settled! Of course, as long as you're here, it doesn't matter where we camp!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Porus was still happily slapping me on the back, and I gave him a wry smile before buying camping equipment and ingredients. He didn't ask me to write a note from [Dependent Family], probably because he believed that I would definitely pay.</p>

<p>After he got into the warehouse to get something... Just when I was thinking, 'I should go, after all,' I looked up at the ceiling, and my thoughts flew to the floor above,</p>

<p>&quot;You really are often involved in commotions, Bell Cronny. &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow!?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a sudden sound in the void, which made me startled.</p>

<p>By the way, could the voice just now be...</p>

<p>&quot;...Is it Mr. Fellowes? Is it 'transparent' now...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhh. I followed the instructions of my master (Uranus) to see how things were going. After all, the scale of this abnormal situation is not small. Then I saw a student who looked like the fastest rabbit in the world, and then I came here. &#12303;</p>

<p>Mr. Fellowes, who became &quot;transparent&quot; with the help of magic items, seemed to be right in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. Fellowes is probably very good at concealment, but I couldn't even detect the aura.</p>

<p>Maybe I was a little too relaxed after arriving in the safe zone (Riviera).</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, how did Mr. Fellowes get here? The roads after the 15th floor should be blocked...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just walk through the man-made maze. &#12303;</p>

<p>Ah...I forgot about it.</p>

<p>However, since Mr. Fellowes is here with the &quot;key&quot;, he can use the artificial maze...</p>

<p>&quot;...Can I ask you about the current situation in detail?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Most of the people trapped in the cave maze were rescued by Leon and the others. I also knocked out some of the adventurers, and now they are placed in a man-made maze for protection. As for the students, the other students have been identified as safe and you are the last group. So, you don't have to try any harder, Bear Cronney. &#12303;</p>

<p>Mr. Fellows saw through that I was thinking about returning to the dungeon and told me not to worry. I couldn't help but sigh, speechless.</p>

<p>&quot;As long as the communication channel between the 17th and 18th floors is opened, all routes in the dungeon will be restored. Until then, just relax in this paradise. If it were just you, I could send you back to the ground, but I really can't let ignorant school district students into the man-made maze. Somewhat sorry. &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it doesn't matter. Thank you very much, Mr. Fellowes.&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I finished thanking him, Mr. Porus said &quot;I've been waiting for a long time!&quot; and came back.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I take my leave,&quot; Mr. Fellows said in a low voice. At the same time, his breath gradually faded away. I also collected various camping equipment and left the store.</p>

<p>Relaxing in a paradise, right...</p>

<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s meet up with Nina and the others first.</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun, is it really okay...? Prepare such complete camping equipment...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry. I had a good discussion with them and they gave it to us.&quot;</p>

<p>Following Mr. Porus's advice, I set up two simple tents by the lake - I also camped on the last &quot;expedition&quot;, so I set them up smoothly - I smiled at Nina who looked worried, Muddle through.</p>

<p>The top of the head was completely dark, and the crystals dotted everywhere shone instead of the stars.</p>

<p>Just as I was taking a break looking at the dreamy &quot;night view&quot; of the dungeon, Nina lowered her head and looked at her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;If that's the case, then that's good... We always receive help from Lapi-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>Nina looked a little frustrated. I felt like she had seen through my lies and felt uneasy inside. At this moment,</p>

<p>&quot;Nina~! Lapi~! My super delicious camping food is ready~~~~!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a voice from Chris, who was in charge of cooking.</p>

<p>Although I felt sorry for Nina, I happily walked towards the bonfire.</p>

<p>The camping spot we chose is located on the north side of the lake, on the edge of a crescent-shaped lake. The tent was located on the dividing line between the lake shore and the grassland, and the bonfire was placed on the lake shore, where Chris, Iglin and Rei Qi were waiting.</p>

<p>&quot;But...you are really awesome, Lapi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, what's wrong? Why do you say that suddenly?&quot;</p>

<p>For dinner, we made a simple rice dish (risotto) and warm egg drop soup using the ingredients Mr. Porus gave us, plus lumps of dry food. During the meal, Iglin said to me seriously said.</p>

<p>We were sitting in a circle around the campfire, and for some reason everyone was looking at me.</p>

<p>&quot;We are used to camping during field surveys and combat missions, but... you are not only skilled in your techniques, but you also obtained supplies from those annoying adventurers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's amazing...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have any negotiation skills!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh...please keep asking, something like that?&quot;</p>

<p>Reki nodded, and Chris leaned out curiously. I worried about how to get through it for a while, but what I finally said was still a far-fetched excuse. Iglin said speechlessly, &quot;What the hell is this?&quot;, while Chris laughed and said, &quot;It looks like Lapi!&quot;.</p>

<p>After everyone had finished eating, as if they had entered the main topic, Iglin asked:</p>

<p>&quot;You said before that you wanted to be an adventurer, right? Have you decided on your future?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, why do you ask?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm very curious. Although it's very irritating, it's true. You are obviously a supporter, but you are so powerful...so I really want to know.&quot;</p>

<p>I was a little surprised. He looked at me with direct eyes, which made me not sure how to answer.</p>

<p>I didn't expect that Eglin would ask me such a thing...</p>

<p>This should be regarded as his recognition that I am a real member of the team.</p>

<p>But... rather than wanting to be one, I am actually an adventurer now... If there is such a premise as &quot;if I am a student&quot;, then the answer should be [Hestia Familia], but I can't reveal my identity... Therefore, after struggling for a long time, I expressed my second wish to join the group. The name of the faction.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, [Loki Familia], right...?&quot;</p>

<p>I seemed to feel Nina&rsquo;s ears snapping. Iglin didn&rsquo;t notice at all and continued:</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, after all, I want to be an adventurer. Although I heard that the competition rate there is very high, I think Lappi should be able to be selected. If he is not selected, it means that [Loki Familia] is blind. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;T-Thank you...?&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't expect him to praise me so much, and I felt a little hot on my face.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what about Iglin? Have you decided on your way out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to be a blacksmith.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!? Aren't you from the &quot;Combat Techniques Department&quot;!?&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing me making a crazy sound, Iglin began to tell with some pride:</p>

<p>&quot;The best blacksmith in the lower world is called Chun Cobrand. The most senior blacksmith seems to have said this. 'If you can't drill into the deep depths to test the performance of weapons, how can it be done?' So I am also learning blacksmithing technology at the same time. From the perspective of the user, we aim to be the most advanced blacksmith!&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Chun, you have to speak responsibly...!</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm...then, where is Reki?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am an assassin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;okokokok!?&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't know how to respond, so I asked someone else, and her answer made me don't know what expression to show!</p>

<p>&quot;I've been waiting for...the royal family. The black side. One day, I will destroy the white, very powerful royal family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, I have no plans, I'm familiar with it. I want power, alone. But I can't win the dungeon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Compared to one person, many people are stronger, of course. I discovered it. So...thank you, Lapi, everyone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Reki...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, I...want to train soldiers.&quot;</p>

<p>If we believe in the translation intuition developed through the communication with Mr. Hegni, then Reki probably belongs to a tribe that hopes that the royal family of the black fairies will regain power. In order to defeat the white fairies who have an overwhelming numerical advantage, Reki is becoming an assassin. Those who work hard.</p>

<p>Although it is not known how she entered the &quot;school district&quot; to study, during this special internship, she who had longed to fight alone learned how fragile it is to fight alone.</p>

<p>So she wants to become an instructor and train soldiers... She probably wants to convey this meaning.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to be a knight of the empire! This corrupt country has long lost the name of Gormark and the glory of Ulster. It only cares about dominating the colonies, and I want to change it from the inside!&quot;</p>

<p>Although he hadn't asked yet, Chris said confidently, and his goal was the most reliable or ambitious. Although it was a bit rude, it surprised me.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to take back the name of the Knights, which symbolizes the glory of the family! I want to do something more powerful than the [Brave]!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;B-More powerful than Mr. Finn? This is really...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No problem! Anyway, I became Lv. 2 as a small human, ah!! But, if the [Brave] insists on inviting me, I can join the [Loki Familia]! That's okay too Together with Lapi, you will always be my guardian beast from now on!&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't help but smile when I saw Chris looking exactly the same as when we first met him, with his eyes closed and his head held high.</p>

<p>Finally, everyone looked at her.</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of which, I never asked. Nina, what is your goal?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Nina looked down at the unfinished soup on hand and said nothing.</p>

<p>After a while, she raised her head and smiled a little lonely.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I don't have any goals...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Silence fell among the team.</p>

<p>She was the only one among us who looked like a lost child.</p>

<p>Exactly ten minutes.</p>

<p>Eglin and I kept watch until ten minutes ago, then changed shifts and took a nap.</p>

<p>Compared with the five minutes of rest in the &quot;deep&quot;, the ten minutes in the stable 18th floor can be said to be quite luxurious. My thinking is very clear, as if the turbid water flowing in my mind has turned into a clear stream. The body is not that tired at all. I understand that Level 5 is like this.</p>

<p>In order not to wake up the snoring Iglin, I quietly slipped out of the tent... I saw a petite back in front of the campfire, and a girl was sitting there.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun...? The sentry shift has just changed, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't sleep a little bit. ...Where's Chris?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In our tent. He kept blinking and seemed sleepy, so we let him go to sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>There are two tents, separated for men and women... Forget it, Chris should be fine.</p>

<p>She turned around, her long brown hair swaying, and looked towards the lake in front.</p>

<p>After getting Nina's consent, I sat down next to her at a distance.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina...what happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It felt like you just...had no energy.&quot;</p>

<p>Nina said nothing. When she was in the &quot;School District&quot;, she was so cheerful and treated everyone as gently as the sun, but now she is as quiet, cold, and cold as the lake she has been looking at.</p>

<p>&quot;If you have any troubles... I hope you can tell me. After all, Nina has always been helping me.&quot;</p>

<p>I took courage and decided to get involved. Wanted to repay her kindness. This was also conveyed to me.</p>

<p>Nina, who was motionless, suddenly lowered her head.</p>

<p>She buried her face between her knees, and then slowly raised her gaze, one of her emerald-colored bangs swaying.</p>

<p>&quot;I...can't find the 'dream'.&quot;</p>

<p>Eh? I turned my head, and Nina was still looking ahead, smiling.</p>

<p>It was a very ethereal smile, as if it would disappear at any time.</p>

<p>&quot;I think people who come to school in the 'School District' actually have some kind of 'uneasiness'. They don't know what they can become, and they can't see their future... But when faced with such students, the 'School District' will show Come up with all kinds of &lsquo;dreams&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&quot;dream&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. The scenery, culture, work, knowledge, and research of many countries... show us what the world is like. Then students will find goals like 'I want to do this!' and leave here one after another.&quot;</p>

<p>The word &quot;dream&quot; that she heard many times lingered in her ears, and Nina said softly:</p>

<p>&quot;So... people who come in to study aimlessly will have a hard time.&quot;</p>

<p>The smile that appeared on Nina's face at this time seemed to be mocking herself.</p>

<p>&quot;I actually have a sister.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The person from the guild headquarters?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Her name is Eina, and she is my proud sister.&quot;</p>

<p>I know.</p>

<p>But now I'm going to pretend I don't know.</p>

<p>&quot;That's not right...she should be the sister that everyone is proud of.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, Nina's smile really took on a shadow this time.</p>

<p>&quot;When I started to remember, my sister had already entered the &quot;school district&quot;. I didn't know what she looked like, and I had never heard her voice. So, the time I met her at the guild was my &quot;first meeting&quot; .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I know that my sister is very powerful. People on the street say a lot of things. My sister is very smart, my sister is very good. Whenever I hear this, I always feel as if I am praising myself, and I am very proud. My father and mother are also... they They should all feel that Sister Eina is the daughter they are proud of.&quot;</p>

<p>Did she notice the look on her face now?</p>

<p>Does she have the courage to peek into the water where her face is reflected?</p>

<p>&quot;Our mother is very weak. For her mother and her father who worked hard, my sister went to the &quot;school district&quot;. In order to find a good job. My sister may not have a &quot;dream&quot;, but she has a clear &quot;goal&quot; &#12303;.&#12303;</p>

<p>And I have no such thing - she said.</p>

<p>&quot;I came to the &quot;School District&quot; because my sister was like this. Since my sister did this, it would be great if I followed the same path... It was with this simple thought that I accepted the &quot;School District&quot; exam. .&rdquo;</p>

<p>My eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>He was just walking along the path that Miss Eina had walked.</p>

<p>Nina is saying this.</p>

<p>&quot;I came here with such superficial thoughts, entered the &quot;school district&quot;, and lived procrastinating until now...I regret it now.&quot;</p>

<p>The word 'regret' that Nina said struck me.</p>

<p>So Nina, who loves learning and works hard, feels that life in the &quot;school district&quot; is painful?</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know what the first course I studied is, Lapi-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Sorry, I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's 'synthetic theology'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!!&quot;</p>

<p>It dawned on me.</p>

<p>It was time to decide on the &quot;study course&quot;, and Nina tactfully stopped me from choosing the subject.</p>

<p>&quot;My sister passed that exam, and everyone was praising her. So I gave it a try. I thought I could do it too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I was wrong. There is no such thing. You can't learn it at all. I can't learn to read the [Sacred Text] like my sister.&quot;</p>

<p>Nina seemed to be cutting into her body, as if she was still experiencing the pain, and kept revealing her past.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t recommend this course very much...</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;It is said that the passing rate is less than 10%... and there are even fewer people who can actually decipher the [sacred text].</p>

<p>The advice given to me at that time was not the story I heard, but Nina&rsquo;s own experience.</p>

<p>&quot;I also took part in the guild's mock exam. At that time, I wanted to catch up with my sister. However, no matter how hard I studied, I couldn't get a high grade. I simply couldn't catch up with my sister. So, I Just like the time of &lsquo;Integrated Theology&rsquo;, I ran away again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My sister is very good. After graduating from the &quot;school district&quot;, many people still remember her. She is the same as my hometown. So I have been imitating my sister and moving along the same path... but I have not been able to get the same results. As a result, compared to people like me, my sister is much more powerful.&quot;</p>

<p>Her eyes gradually took on the breath of spring.</p>

<p>As if to resist the thoughts and words that could no longer be stopped, tears continued to accumulate in his swaying green eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I have done all the things my sister did when she was a child. That's why I kept chasing her. I thought it would be easier. But... it's not like that at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been imitating my sister. I can't decide anything by myself... I'm really worthless.&quot;</p>

<p>&#8230;&#8230;wrong.</p>

<p>Probably, Nina misunderstood something.</p>

<p>If Lord Baldr and the other gods of the &quot;school district&quot; were to conduct interviews, listen to the thoughts of those who wish to enroll, confirm whether there are any &quot;lies&quot; in them, and see whether they are qualified.</p>

<p>Then, the reason why Nina was able to enter the &quot;school district&quot; must be...</p>

<p>&quot;Also, I was originally in the 'education department'... and then I was transferred to the 'combat skills department'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It happened that... it was Teacher Leon who happened to see me studying &quot;Magic&quot; and spoke to me... He said, &quot;Take this staff and try to chant it.&quot; So I manifested &quot;Magic&quot; &rsquo;. The same goes for sports. I&rsquo;m better at it than I thought. &#8230; Then, many people praised me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;Then you transferred to the &quot;Combat Techniques Department&quot;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... I heard that my sister is not good at sports... so I jumped into it. It's not because of a 'dream' or a 'hobby', but just to keep my place, so I keep practicing martial arts.&quot;</p>

<p>Probably, this is Nina's biggest &quot;guilt&quot;.</p>

<p>She does not have a &quot;goal&quot; like Miss Eina, nor does she have a &quot;dream&quot; like Eglin and the others. She has been staying in the &quot;Combat Techniques Department&quot; just to &quot;escape&quot;. She is more ashamed of herself than anyone else.</p>

<p>Everything is to maintain proof of one's existence (self-identity).</p>

<p>So whenever we talk about &quot;a way out,&quot; she must feel like she is the only one standing still.</p>

<p>&quot;I could write a reply to the letter my sister sent to the 'school district' at first, but... after many things happened, I couldn't write it anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The self that always imitates my sister is too ugly, and the self that tries my best to protect myself (Nina) by doing things that my sister cannot do... makes me helplessly disgusted...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't help but write anything to respond to the words written by my gentle sister...!&quot;</p>

<p>A whimper finally escaped her lips.</p>

<p>Countless transparent droplets overflowed from the bottom of his eyes, dripped down his cheeks, and landed on his too-slender legs.</p>

<p>She buried her face between her knees, her shoulders shaking, her fingers digging into her arms.</p>

<p>After she let out what she had endured until now, she was not a top student but just an ordinary girl who kept crying.</p>

<p>I couldn't form any words.</p>

<p>He couldn't lean over and hug her shoulders, or wipe away her tears.</p>

<p>I don't have a sister. No sister either. There is only one grandfather in the family.</p>

<p>I couldn't even understand her troubles and pain, and naturally I couldn't feel sympathy or pity.</p>

<p>but--</p>

<p>&quot;ah&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>I took off my shirt and put my old combat uniform over her shoulders.</p>

<p>The lake is shaking. There was literally a breeze blowing. The temperature also seems to be cooler.</p>

<p>Therefore, we can't let her catch the cold anymore.</p>

<p>Slightly, I really only moved a little closer and sat next to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina... Even if Nina really hates herself...&quot;</p>

<p>I think about every day I have spent studying in the &quot;school district&quot; so far.</p>

<p>He spoke his &quot;straightforward thoughts&quot; without any modification.</p>

<p>&quot;Also remember one thing. Thanks to Nina, I can live such a happy life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks to Nina, I know the 'joy of learning'. Thanks to you... I have found a new 'goal'.&quot;</p>

<p>Never looking to the side, I sat cross-legged on the ground, staring at the lake, constantly conveying my feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;During this internship, Eglin and the others also received a lot of help from Nina.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just like your sister...Nina, who was able to treat others with kindness, saved many people.&quot;</p>

<p>As if stars descended from the sky, the shining light fell down.</p>

<p>Crystal fragments fell from the ceiling of the floor, causing ripples on the lake surface to spread outward.</p>

<p>There are small ripples, layer after layer, never ending.</p>

<p>Like beautiful tears.</p>

<p>Nina lowered her head again, breathing tremblingly... slowly raised her head and looked over.</p>

<p>A small, but very noticeable smile broke out on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun...you really know how to make girls cry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Feel sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay...it's just a little unexpected.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Feel sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, why are you apologizing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I don't know, but I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No need to apologize. I'm... very happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;Thank you, Lapijun.</p>

<p>A smile broke out on Nina's tear-stained face, causing me to close my mouth tightly.</p>

<p>Keep your eyes looking forward. His face was red with heat.</p>

<p>Nina also noticed my appearance and laughed so hard that her shoulders shook.</p>

<p>She moved a little to the side.</p>

<p>I also moved away slightly, trying to keep my distance.</p>

<p>But her fingers reached out and grabbed me. So I had to accept my fate.</p>

<p>His face was still red with shyness. I lent her my top, and now I only have a vest on my upper body, but my body is unusually hot.</p>

<p>I really hope that the goddess (Eden) will come over and do something. I thought about this stupid thing, and the two of them kept looking at the lake that shone with blue light.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm thinking.&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Nina wove words in a different voice than before.</p>

<p>&quot;It's such a blessing to find someone who does what you want to do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh&#8230;&#8230;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, a lot of annoying things will happen, and the things you like sometimes become painful. But, everyone must be like this.&quot;</p>

<p>I turned my head and looked at Nina's profile.</p>

<p>She no longer looked at the lake, but raised her head and stared at the crystal sea that replaced the starry sky.</p>

<p>&quot;Walking forward casually, having to make decisions casually, making choices casually... People who walk straight ahead are more handsome than walking on such an aimless road. Compared with people like me, Lapi You guys are much more powerful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps this is just a dabbler (half-elf) without a 'dream' pretending to understand.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl who could not become a dream chaser looked up at the false sky and smiled a little.</p>

<p>&quot;Even so, I still think people who have 'dreams' are very happy...and very attractive.&quot;</p>

<p>To me, she seemed a little sad...or, rather, a little empty.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>I also looked up to the top of my head, squinting my eyes and staring at the false and beautiful crystal sky.</p>

<p>Early the next morning.</p>

<p>The blue crystal attached to the ceiling began to glow faintly, and began to turn white like the morning on the ground. Nina started to feel sleepy and fell asleep with her head on my lap. I also kept watch alone.</p>

<p>To keep the campfire going and keep her body from getting cold.</p>

<p>&quot;...Aoharu&mdash;&#9733;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Aoharu&mdash;&#9734;&quot;</p>

<p>Reki came out of the tent, and as soon as she approached us, she spoke Eden-sama expressionlessly.</p>

<p>I also looked into the distance and tentatively responded to her greeting.</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, Reki. If you could go on a little 'adventure' later, would Reki want to go?&quot;</p>

<p>Rei Qi didn't know why I asked. She tilted her head slightly, but still adjusted the position of the mask and nodded slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Maze Paradise... is rare... fresh... I want to see it... with everyone.&quot;</p>

<p>I smiled and said thank you to her.</p>

<p>Being careful not to wake Nina up, I left her in the care of Reki and walked towards &quot;Riviera Street&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;You're really a good person.&quot;</p>

<p>After roughly listening to my &quot;request&quot;, Mr. Porus said half speechlessly.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know if that's possible...?&quot;</p>

<p>While smiling bitterly, I slightly raised my eyes to request. Upon seeing this, the leader of Rivera curved his lips into a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway, the communication channel on the floor won't be open today. I have nothing to do all day long, so I'll just stay with you! I've said it many times before, but I still owe you a lot of favors that I haven't repaid yet!&quot;</p>

<p>As he spoke, Mr. Porus put his thick arms around my neck and made a circle with his fingers.</p>

<p>&quot;But you still have to collect the money that's due! I'll do a good job as an adventurer. &quot;Guards&quot; you guys are fine!&quot;</p>

<p>I put my hand on the thick arm that was holding my neck tightly and expressed my gratitude.</p>

<p>After returning to the ground, work hard to make money and pay for it yourself.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Study Trip&quot;!?&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>After I came back from the hotel street, I told them about this, and Nina and the others immediately showed surprised expressions.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. It's rare to be on the 18th floor. Why don't you go check out the floors below?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can understand your feelings, but... if you go further down, the maze will be different from before!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is said that although a team came to the 18th floor due to an accident, no students have ever gone to explore lower down! Mum!? In other words, this is a good opportunity for me to make an unprecedented step!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to take risks, as I said before...but is it dangerous?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, Lapi-kun. We tried our best just to come here...&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone's response was generally against it.</p>

<p>But I feel like Chris or Reki, where the feeling of 'I want to go and have a look if it's safe' accounts for a lot of it. so&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>&quot;I went to Rivera Street, and then I heard that a group of high-level adventurers were going down there. They said that if we were willing to help, they could take us there...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, you think, if you can bring some loot back, you might be able to get 'credits'...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>After hearing my explanation, Nina, Chris, Iglin and Reki all suddenly understood.</p>

<p>Even I thought, 'This statement is really nonsense-'.</p>

<p>If I let Miss Eina know, I'm afraid she will give me a severe scolding.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I also felt like it would be safe.</p>

<p>Normally, no matter how big the level difference is, the floors you first see are dangerous, but I am convinced that if you have second-level adventurers like Mr. Porus who are used to exploring to protect you, you can go to deeper floors.</p>

<p>If the first-level adventurer (me) also provides full support, Nina and the others may be able to see the &quot;unknown scenery&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey&mdash;&mdash;! Let's come&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The adventurers seem to be setting off...what should we do?&quot;</p>

<p>The senior adventurers walked towards the camping site waving their hands, at least twenty of them.</p>

<p>Seeing this scene, the &quot;Third Team&quot; looked at each other, and after worrying for a long time, decided to go together.</p>

<p>&quot;This, this weapon... is so powerful! I have been using it so hard since just now... but there is not even a curl of the blade!&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing the residents of Rivera steadily dealing with the large monster &quot;Mammoth Yugong&quot;, Iglin, holding a sledgehammer in one hand, exclaimed. He was particularly concerned about the weapons of the adventurers.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't underestimate Orario's weapons. Compared with the high-end weapons developed by your &quot;school district&quot;, mine is much stronger!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is durability more important than sharpness? No, the power is also quite amazing...!&quot;</p>

<p>Iglin observed the orcs' weapons over and over again, and then began to &quot;study&quot; hard.</p>

<p>As someone who aspires to be a blacksmith, he probably can't turn a blind eye.</p>

<p>Not only him, but Chris and Reki were also observing the adventurers' items and fighting styles, and kept talking.</p>

<p>&quot;This reply medicine is much more effective than the one distributed by the [Reconciling Discipline]! Although it tastes very unpleasant!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute...what was that just now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It just ignites the flames accumulated by the monster. It all depends on how you use the weapons and props.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot; of the adventurer, who is sometimes looked down upon as a lawless person, amazes the three of them.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Porus hates students, it is still an adventurer's request, so he did not mess around. Instead, he surrounded the &quot;Third Team&quot; in the middle and implemented the policy of protection. I wasn't going to say it was a sightseeing carriage, but it seems pretty good so far.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Lapi-kun! What is that!? There is a mushroom bigger than a house!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems to be a poisonous mushroom. I heard that if the abnormal resistance (ability) is high enough, it can also be eaten...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you eat it!?&quot;</p>

<p>Nina is the same, every time she sees a new scene in the dungeon, she screams loudly.</p>

<p>The only dungeon information that can be learned in the &quot;School District&quot; class is the &quot;Cave Maze&quot;. For Nina now, the &quot;unknown world of the dungeon&quot; must be filled with mysterious and interesting things.</p>

<p>Even a single dungeon crawl involves many professions and many people.</p>

<p>Even if it is a maze of scenery, there are countless mysteries and various fantasies sleeping in it.</p>

<p>I want them to know this.</p>

<p>This may be a bit arrogant and just my willfulness, but I hope that Iglin, the others, and Nina will be interested in this.</p>

<p>The &quot;study trip&quot; that Teacher Leon told me must be like this.</p>

<p>This kind of opportunity may bring about some kind of &quot;goal&quot; or &quot;dream&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Nina. Nina said yesterday that you have been imitating your sister without any 'goal'...but I don't think so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p>This is the 24th floor.</p>

<p>Since it was the deepest part of the middle level, Reki and the others were obviously nervous. At this time, I was walking down the slightly blue cave and said this to Nina who was following behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Probably, Nina... wants to be someone other than her sister (Miss Eina).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!&quot;</p>

<p>As I walked forward, I heard a breathless breath behind me.</p>

<p>Nina must have been compared to Miss Eina since she was little.</p>

<p>I am often compared to an excellent sister whose appearance and voice I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>People are very sensitive when they are young, sometimes more sensitive than adults think.</p>

<p>Even if the adults don't mean it, the young Nina, who is smarter than other children, may sensitively feel that she is being &quot;compared&quot; and feel the pressure unconsciously.</p>

<p>I don't think you have any ill intentions. But everything was compared, so Nina didn't even notice that she became uneasy. She was so anxious that her parents couldn't express her words, and then went to the &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p>However, Nina probably had a misunderstanding at this time.</p>

<p>Seriously, she thinks it's her own bad habit of not having &quot;dreams&quot; that causes her to keep walking the same path as her sister (Miss Eina) - but in fact, she must want everyone to see that she is better than her sister (Miss Eina). Ms. Ina) is a more powerful self, and she wants to be recognized by everyone, so she works hard.</p>

<p>The competitiveness, envy, and longing for her sister (Miss Eina).</p>

<p>Tasting failures and setbacks again and again, Nina did not give up.</p>

<p>&quot;So, there's no need to hate yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>She believes that as long as she leaves higher scores or better achievements than her sister (Miss Eina), others will say that &quot;Nina&quot; is great instead of &quot;Eina&quot;.</p>

<p>She must have wanted to shout out 'I am Nina Zur'.</p>

<p>&quot;Hold your chest high and admit it proudly. What you're good at is what you're good at. After all, Nina is as powerful a girl as Eina-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ah---&quot;</p>

<p>We were almost at the end of the cave, and I turned back to look at her. Nina stood there blankly.</p>

<p>She remained motionless, and the &quot;Third Team&quot; also stopped. Mr. Porus and the others who were walking in front turned around in surprise.</p>

<p>I extended my hand, inviting her who couldn't take a step from there.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's go? It's precisely because you (Nina) thought that you were always escaping, but you have been working hard until now, that you are here.&quot;</p>

<p>After a while.</p>

<p>After she thought about it, she carefully and slowly stretched out her hand. I took it and led her to the front of the cave.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>What appeared in the field of vision was the largest waterfall in the underground city - the giant blue waterfall.</p>

<p>&quot;It's so fierce eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's so awesome ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...It's incredible.&quot;</p>

<p>Eglin, Chris, and Reki all gave themselves up to the excitement.</p>

<p>Nina was the same, her eyes were wide open and she was robbed of time by this spectacular scenery.</p>

<p>The blue emerald-colored waterfall runs through the floors as if it is covering the whole world. The endless water droplets cause diffuse reflections on numerous crystals, as if nurturing the mythical ocean scene.</p>

<p>Blue, dotted everywhere, sparkling.</p>

<p>Beautiful, cruel, and majestic.</p>

<p>A new world appeared in the distant underground - the Mysterious City of Water.</p>

<p>&quot;Amazing&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>After being distracted by the waterfall, they stopped for a long time, and even after moving to the maze part, Nina and the others were still admiring it.</p>

<p>Different from the 18th floor, it looks like a group of blue crystals cut from the sea. The eternal water where the white water snakes and sister-like mermaids swam, the watery corals and the pale blue cherry blossoms became fragments of fantasy, which shocked them deeply and made their hearts beat violently. Everything within reach has the light of &quot;unknown&quot;, which touches the hearts of the students.</p>

<p>The second-level adventurers who protect them are also impeccable. The battle process based on &quot;experience&quot; will repel the monsters before it turns into a melee. What's more, this time is not &quot;exploration&quot; with the goal of magic stones or monster treasures (dropped items), but &quot;study&quot; with the goal of seeing different scenery. So we chose the shortest route and kept moving forward, peering into a different world. Fortunately, we encountered very few monsters on the way, so we reached the &quot;Waterfall Pond&quot; on the 25th floor surprisingly quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;so beautiful&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>The huge blue waterfall looking down from the upper floor in front of the communication passage is very spectacular, but if you look up at the waterfall from the waterfall pool, it is simply wonderful.</p>

<p>Even the &quot;School District&quot; who has traveled around the world has never seen such a scene.</p>

<p>Nina seems to know the answer to why dungeons, which are often associated with death, are so attractive to adventurers.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina, how are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun...this is...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a reward, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh&#8230;&#8230;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Nina, and Iglin's reward for their hard work so far.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy who usually acts like a younger brother covered his eyes with his bangs and smiled like an older brother.</p>

<p>&quot;You have put in all kinds of hard work to the point of tears, and found something you are good at...but you still say you can't find your 'dream', so this is the little gift we prepared for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is precisely because Nina joined the &quot;Third Team&quot; and became stronger that the world (we) can put it into your hands.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the proof of &quot;growth&quot;.</p>

<p>Even if you do not achieve &quot;success&quot; and continue to fail, it is precisely because you have become stronger that we can bring you to the new world (here), the rabbit boy who serves as the guide said.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina. I can't condescendingly tell you what will become a 'dream' and what will become a 'goal'. But I think...if a person encounters something that can be 'moved', then he will be rewarded. Already.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;move&#8230;&#8230;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. When I feel excited, happy, my chest feels tight, and I feel like crying... I can raise my head and think, 'Let's try harder'.&quot;</p>

<p>It's like looking back on your own experiences and carefully digesting each story, weaving the words.</p>

<p>&quot;It would be great if this reward can give Nina some courage...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun...&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, the boy showed an awkward smile.</p>

<p>Even with his hair blocking his eyes, you can see how awkward this smile is and a little embarrassing.</p>

<p>Nina felt a little upset in her chest. It was so sad last night, but now it's so warm.</p>

<p>Her lips were a little unruly, so she put her right hand on her chest and held it tightly.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;Oh! You guys are in luck! It's the 'Blue Dragon'!&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment, Porus, who was peering along the waterfall pool at the large waterfall flowing in a staircase shape, shouted loudly.</p>

<p>Nina and the others who turned around also saw for a moment that far below, in front of the 26th floor, there was &quot;something long and thin&quot; swimming in the air, climbing upwards.</p>

<p>&quot;Hide!&quot; Porus gave the instruction. The confused Iglin and the others, as well as the adventurers who ran in a hurry, followed the order and walked around to the shadow of the crystal group that sat here like a rock.</p>

<p>Not long after, they saw the &quot;dragon&quot; climbing to the waterfall pool on the 25th floor, and then rising upwards. Both Nina and Lapi were speechless.</p>

<p>&quot;That's...the aurora!?&quot;</p>

<p>A slender body that could be called a &quot;long dragon&quot;. The total length is about 10M.</p>

<p>It has smooth blue and white scales, and its long fins flap slowly like wings, swimming in the air as if it were in the sea.</p>

<p>The most eye-catching thing is the &quot;folds of light&quot; produced after this &quot;dragon&quot; flies by, shining red, green-white, and blue-purple.</p>

<p>&quot;'Blue Dragon'...! A rare species from the 'lower level'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right. Its nickname is Aurora Dragon. Its rarity is similar to that of the 'Jewel Beast', and it is a dragon that is rarely seen.&quot;</p>

<p>Although Lapi knew something about it, this might be his first time meeting him. He couldn't hide the surprise on his face. Porus, who was also hiding in the shadow of the crystal group, raised his lips.</p>

<p>Not to mention Nina and Iglin, even the other senior adventurers looked at him intently.</p>

<p>The aurora traces a trajectory that seems to run side by side with the majestic blue waterfall. Its brilliance even makes people think that this is the most beautiful scene in the world. Countless water droplets intertwined with aurora fragments, looking like playful elves.</p>

<p>&quot;The aurora in the underground space (dungeon) is incredible...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems that the dragon excretes &quot;magic power&quot; like feces from its tail (butt). That thing reflects the crystal light (light) of this floor, which makes it look so beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Explanation, it's terrible...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But as expected, it's still so mesmerizingly beautiful!&quot;</p>

<p>Next to the dazed Iglin, the senior orc adventurer explained, causing Reki to feel depressed for a moment. Finally, Chris's face lit up and he deftly let out a low-pitched cheer.</p>

<p>The slender body seems to have escaped gravity, floating in the air. This appearance is also very similar to the rare species &quot;Urpool Emperor Maiyu&quot; on the 27th floor, but its elegance cannot be compared. The round eyes are very clear, and they continuously produce auroras that illuminate adventurers and students.</p>

<p>(&quot;Touched&quot; moment...)</p>

<p>Nina, who had been looking up at her head, put her hands on her chest.</p>

<p>The combination of the high heartbeat and Lapi's words just now created an indescribable heat.</p>

<p>Nina still didn't know what answer she was about to get in her heart, but she just engraved this beautiful scenery in her eyes that seemed to be out of this world.</p>

<p>&#12302;&mdash;&mdash;Gurg! &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, uh-oh!? It's a monster, so dangerous!&quot;</p>

<p>at this time.</p>

<p>Behind Iglin and the others, who were looking forward in fascination, a &quot;Blue Crab&quot; quietly approached and pounced on them.</p>

<p>Iglin, who noticed it at the critical moment, turned around hurriedly and swung down the sledgehammer in his hand.</p>

<p>The monster was hit to the ground, but its hard shell was still not completely shattered, so it hit it again, and then another.</p>

<p>Boom! Boom! ! The sound of explosions resounded all around.</p>

<p>The cancer finally stopped moving.</p>

<p>And a tick, turning to the dragon's eye below.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;ah.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>The moment he clearly captured the adventurers and students hiding in the shadows, his round and transparent eyes turned into a sharp and red attack color, and his jaws with countless fangs opened with a snap.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Oops!!&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>The first ones to escape from the shadows were adventurers like Porus.</p>

<p>The next person to take action was Lapi, who was stunned for a moment. He pushed Nina and her &quot;third team&quot; away from the crystal group, who were speechless and stunned.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, the dazzling &quot;Aurora Vortex&quot; was released from the dragon's mouth.</p>

<p>&#12302;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! ! &#12303;</p>

<p>The auroral radiation is so dazzling that it seems to burn out your eyeballs.</p>

<p>The vortex of light released with violent momentum swallowed up the crystal group where Nina and the others were standing a second ago, causing the crystal to begin to corrode bit by bit.</p>

<p>&quot;Varied!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The crystal fell after it rotted!? H-Hot wire!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! That's the magical &quot;breath&quot;!! The light emitted by the dragon is a collection of &quot;abnormal conditions&quot; including poison and paralysis!&quot;</p>

<p>Iglin and Chris were shocked, and Porus, still running away, answered them while spitting.</p>

<p>The extremely charming aurora, its cruel true face is &quot;photo erosion&quot; that causes prey to rot and collapse due to several symptoms.</p>

<p>Like the floor master &quot;Anphispina&quot; who can breathe red mist, having a special breath is also a characteristic of the monsters that inhabit this &quot;Water City&quot;.</p>

<p>Nina and the others were speechless when they saw the beautiful and mysterious poison brought by the dungeon.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot; ! &#12303;</p>

<p>The &quot;Blue Dragon&quot; floats in the distant sky and can do whatever it wants.</p>

<p>It continuously releases its breath from the top of its head at a distance of at least 20 meters, leisurely aiming at the fleeing prey and attacking.</p>

<p>Not to mention the crystals that rotted and fell, even the water surface turned the color of Ruan people, and smoke with a peculiar smell began to rise.</p>

<p>&quot;E-escape! You will be targeted and attacked at the waterfall! Escape into the maze&mdash;&mdash;!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!! Just deal with it right here!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!?&quot;</p>

<p>Lapi, who was hiding from the light vortex, called out, but Porus immediately dismissed it.</p>

<p>&quot;That dragon's body is very slender! Unlike the floor master (Anphispina), it can get through no matter how thin the road is and chase us!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's scary to be attacked by breath attacks one after another in a narrow maze! It's actually much better to fight here!&quot;</p>

<p>Porus and the residents of Hotel Street first pointed out that Lappi, who had no knowledge and no combat experience, was too ignorant, and then they all gave a thumbs up.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;So I'll leave it to you from now on!&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!? No, aren't we going to fight together!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;No, we didn't bring any bows or magic swords.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is not within the scope of the adventurer's commission! So you can figure it out on your own, client!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;why is it like this-!?&quot;</p>

<p>Porus and the others abandoned him in an even admirable manner, and then cleverly hid in a safe area at the entrance of the Labyrinth Department, causing Lapi to let out an unexpected cry.</p>

<p>During this period of time, the Aurora Breath was still falling, forcing Lapi to kick the ground continuously.</p>

<p>(It has no intention of coming down from the sky at all...! Jumping up on the wall is too random. It really feels like it can only be done with &quot;magic&quot;...!)</p>

<p>Porus's judgment was correct. The &quot;Blue Dragon&quot; is staying at such a high place, and it is definitely impossible to cut it directly. If you want to defeat it, you can only use long-distance attacks such as bows and arrows or &quot;magic&quot;.</p>

<p>From the perspective of Porus and the others who knew Lapi's &quot;true face&quot;, it can be said that it is a very legitimate request to quickly use Yan Lei (Fire) to fire (Volt).</p>

<p>(However, you can&rsquo;t reveal your identity in front of Nina and the others...!)</p>

<p>The contract with Badr and the others flashed through his mind, which made Lapi hesitate a little, but he immediately put it aside.</p>

<p>Then he stretched out his right arm and pointed the muzzle at Changlong.</p>

<p>&quot;Burn, [burn it all, the karma of foreign law]!&quot;</p>

<p>He wanted to struggle for a while, so he chanted a false spell and shot the flaming spear.</p>

<p>However, the crimson flame thunder failed to catch the writhing long body and flew through the air.</p>

<p>(...!! It moves faster than songbirds and half-human birds!)</p>

<p>Even if they are fired continuously, they will be dodged one by one.</p>

<p>Originally, the enemy was the &quot;dragon species&quot; known as the strongest race of monsters. The potential ability and flying ability are not comparable to those of winged species on the same floor.</p>

<p>The most critical thing is that the distance between the two is a range that Bell is not good at.</p>

<p>So far, even in dungeons, [Fire Volt] has been used to suppress enemies at &quot;close range&quot; during chaotic battles, and at most it is only at &quot;middle range&quot;. &quot;Long distance&quot; is what Bell is least good at. If you can still move flexibly in the distant sky, the difficulty will be greatly increased.</p>

<p>Using &quot;quick attack magic&quot; to replace &quot;ultra-precision sniping&quot; like Hedin's was a bit too difficult, at least for Bell, who was not a pure magician or a magic swordsman.</p>

<p>To find the problem at such a time&mdash;&mdash;! !</p>

<p>He scolded himself in his heart, and at this moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;!? Eglin!&quot;</p>

<p>The deadly aurora is closing in on the dwarves who have fled too late.</p>

<p>Lappi kicked the crystal bank to pieces, pushed his companion's giant body away - and that was it.</p>

<p>His own body failed to escape the huge effect area and was swallowed up by &quot;Light Erosion&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Gu&mdash;&mdash;!?&quot;</p>

<p>He crossed his arms in front of him, defensively.</p>

<p>The dagger in his hand collapsed instantly.</p>

<p>His eyes widened and he wanted to leave immediately, but this time it turned out that the shore was gradually decaying.</p>

<p>(&#8230;!? The ground becomes like a swamp!)</p>

<p>Having captured its prey, the Aurora, which had increased its power, looked down at Lapi and his surroundings at an astonishing speed.</p>

<p>Lapi, who was unable to take off his feet smoothly and even his feet were gradually sinking, frowned.</p>

<p>(The body can still resist...! The key is equipment...!)</p>

<p>The body of the first-level adventurer has a high level of &quot;abnormal resistance (ability)&quot; and can withstand &quot;light erosion&quot;, making the dragons irritated. Just the skin crackling and feeling numb. However, the other dagger and even the combat uniform on his body were gradually rotting away as if they were being eaten by insects.</p>

<p>I didn't expect that I would get into a hard fight at the &quot;lower level&quot;.</p>

<p>Sure enough, no matter how the level increases, the dungeon and &quot;unknown&quot; will still pose a threat to the adventurers (Bell).</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun!?&quot;</p>

<p>At the same time, Nina screamed at the figure (Rapi) who was swallowed deep into the light vortex and could not see the specific situation.</p>

<p>Iglin's face was pale as he sat on the ground. Reki and Chris were all pale. Nina next to them wanted to run over without hesitation, but was grabbed by a thick hand on her upper arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, don't go there! White Rabbit...it doesn't matter what you call that brat Lappi!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter! Let me go, please let me go!&quot;</p>

<p>Porus and others stopped Nina and protected Iglin and others.</p>

<p>The lawless man did not give up on the adventurer's mission of &quot;protecting students&quot; and tried to hold down the girl who was making a fuss.</p>

<p>Porus and the others saw it.</p>

<p>The purpose of being a &quot;first level adventurer&quot;. That is the &quot;battle of endurance&quot;.</p>

<p>But Nina didn't see through it. Of course. Nina didn't know the &quot;first-level adventurer&quot; that Porus and the others recognized.</p>

<p>The only person she knew was the white boy with a gentle heart who brought her here, who was like both a younger brother and an older brother.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;[Lype of the Wind (Ballad), Cradle of Flowers]&quot;</p>

<p>So, she sang it.</p>

<p>&quot;...!! You, you guy! What do you want to do!?&quot;</p>

<p>The surprised Porus and the others were left behind, and she sang the song of nobility bestowed upon herself.</p>

<p>&quot;[The magnificence of the past, the majesty of the past. The pure white city that protects the mother, atop thousands of flower hills]&quot;</p>

<p>In order to refine her magic power, she closed her eyes, and what appeared on her eyelids was the origin of a half-elf.</p>

<p>There is no city wall, but there is a majestic plateau, with countless small flowers swaying, pure white petals flying in the sky, and a girl's hometown filled with pure air.</p>

<p>After leaving, she missed her hometown many times amidst countless setbacks, but lamented how she could go back when she had accomplished nothing so far. The tears of homesickness that wetted her pillow made her reveal this Nina's stain, which was also the origin.</p>

<p>&quot;[Flowers, bloom. Bloom for me (the seed) that cannot sprout. Light, sing. Sing to illuminate the noble traveler.]&quot;</p>

<p>The girl who cannot describe her own future envies and looks forward to the people who pursue their dreams (travelers), and wants to at least pray for them and their future.</p>

<p>Follow the noble blood flowing through your body and be willing to dedicate yourself to others.</p>

<p>The dream that cannot be found, the crazy thoughts that cannot be realized by oneself are given to others, the expectations that are unconsciously entrusted to others, the girl's simple wish, the song of a fairy whose heart is so kind that it seems stupid.</p>

<p>&quot;[Blue, ascend. White, purify. Eliminate the miasma, and bring the flower crown here.]&quot;</p>

<p>In this way, she kept doing this kind of superficial and stupid devotion, and then she met him.</p>

<p>The young man she met said that her trajectory so far, who could not become a dream chaser (traveler), was by no means superficial or stupid, but rather very powerful.</p>

<p>(I gained a lot from Lapijun!)</p>

<p>The boy said that he helped him. not like this. Quite the opposite.</p>

<p>Nina is the one who has always been helped by him.</p>

<p>(I haven&rsquo;t repaid Lapijun with anything yet!)</p>

<p>So Nina thought that she would always help the boy from now on.</p>

<p>It's like being next to that young man. Teach him more things and learn a lot from him.</p>

<p>This is what I (Nina) want now.</p>

<p>&quot;Ooooooh!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nina?!&quot;</p>

<p>Feeling the rising magic power&mdash;worrying about an explosion of magic power&mdash;Porus hurriedly let go of Nina's arm.</p>

<p>The noble girl raised her long staff, never looking so majestic, which surprised Chris.</p>

<p>The next moment, Nina started running.</p>

<p>&quot;[Thousands of flowers bloom, the second spiritual peak&mdash;&mdash;]&quot;</p>

<p>Following the behavior of &quot;parallel chanting&quot; that she had just learned, she ran towards the aurora that was still eating away at the boy.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to help him&quot;, with this only thought in mind, I started my &quot;adventure&quot;.</p>

<p>Moments before rushing into the light vortex, Nina shouted the last verse.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;[My name is Alf]!!&quot;</p>

<p>A strand of emerald hair glowed with &quot;magic&quot;, releasing this &quot;magic&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;[Laguire Sanctuary]!!&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;white flower field&quot; blew away the ominous aurora.</p>

<p>In front of Changlong's astonished gaze, she protected the equally stunned young man behind her back, creating a field of light with pure white feathers or pure white petals flying.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, what is that!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Purification Magic'! It's Nina's barrier that can break everything!&quot;</p>

<p>Porus was shocked, and Chris and the others leaned out.</p>

<p>&#12304;Laguire Sanctuary&#12305;.</p>

<p>A rare magic possessed by healer Nina.</p>

<p>As Chris and the others called out, its ability is to &quot;purify all kinds of anomalies.&quot;</p>

<p>A medium-sized barrier that can generate &quot;Fairy Sanctuary&quot; - not to mention &quot;abnormal conditions&quot; such as poison and paralysis, but also can block or cure curses and spiritual attacks.</p>

<p>The girl missed her beloved mother who was bedridden due to illness, and kept praying that one day she would be able to cure her. Under the strong influence of this inner scene, the pure white garden that replaced Wang Sen was born.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina...!&quot;</p>

<p>Surprised, Lapi's body has fully recovered.</p>

<p>Not to mention detoxification, the light of purification even granted &quot;continuous healing&quot; to everyone in the field, carefully cleaning away the filth. Even &quot;Light Eclipse&quot;, whose potential ability is much higher than that of her &quot;Blue Dragon&quot;, is no exception.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh-huh-huh...!!&quot;</p>

<p>My knees kept shaking. The released aurora threatens Pure White's territory, trying to break through Nina's protection.</p>

<p>However, she cannot lose. I don&rsquo;t think I will lose either. At this moment, Nina's mood was so high because of her mission for the first time in her life. She is embracing a &quot;goal&quot;. This is the thought of &quot;protecting the one you cherish to the end&quot;.</p>

<p>Seeing the pure white garden that never flinched, Changlong finally lost his patience.</p>

<p>It stopped its aurora breath and quickly landed downwards, intending to bite the opponent directly with its fangs.</p>

<p>Nina's eyes opened wide. [Laguire Sanctuary] is not a &quot;barrier&quot; and cannot prevent direct attacks and magic.</p>

<p>Just when the green eyes were about to close tightly,</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you&mdash;Nina.&quot;</p>

<p>Slender arms supported Nina's back as she fell backward.</p>

<p>The half-elf girl completed the &quot;endurance contest&quot; he initiated for him. He thanked her and came to the front on her own. What was pulled out from his waist was the &quot;jet black dagger&quot; he carried close to his body.</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!&quot; ! &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Um!!&quot;</p>

<p>The moment the fang came to his eyes, the boy swung it with a fierce slash to deflect it, defended himself, and then climbed up the dragon's body in front of Nina's wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>Aurora rose quickly again, but he did not let go. He grabbed the fins and rose to a high altitude.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>This image deeply impressed Nina's eyes.</p>

<p>It depicts the terrifying yet beautiful aurora, and the figure of a boy rising with a dragon in a space of waterfalls and crystals.</p>

<p>This dreamy, mysterious, &quot;adventure scene&quot; that was almost like a heroic tale shocked her heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina. We cannot give you an answer to your dilemma. &#12303;</p>

<p>Leon had said this to her before.</p>

<p>At his wits' end, he was cornered by the environment of the &quot;school district&quot; and when he was recommended to transfer to the &quot;Combat Techniques Course&quot;, Leon's words were &quot;Always ask yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>Leon and Baldur would never say &quot;do this&quot; or &quot;aim for that&quot;. If she said that, Nina would be able to stifle her feelings, blindly put in her efforts, and act according to instructions.</p>

<p>But the instructors of the &quot;school district&quot; will not turn Nina into a &quot;doll.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I have to give you some advice - Nina, if that moment comes, just follow your heart. &#12303;</p>

<p>He just said this to her as if he was praying for her to meet him one day.</p>

<p>&quot;When your heart is shaking uncontrollably - that's the moment when you encounter your dream.&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>The &quot;dream&quot; ignited the majestic &quot;fire&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;[Fire Volt]!&quot;</p>

<p>After being thrown away by the twisting dragon, Lapi came to the top of his head and fired the crimson flame into the dark dagger.</p>

<p>Then the bell rang.</p>

<p>The sound converged along with the white light particles, and the God's Blade was put on a huge flame armor.</p>

<p>The rising heat made the dragon feel timid, and he opened his cannon to release the last aurora.</p>

<p>Four seconds of charge.</p>

<p>The &quot;Adventurer&quot; fell along the gravity, met the dragon's breath released from zero distance, and then swung the blow.</p>

<p>&quot;Holy Fire Heroic Slash!!&quot;</p>

<p>Red cut.</p>

<p>&#12302;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! ? &#12303;</p>

<p>The restrained Holy Fire Slash engulfed the Aurora and wiped the dragon out of sight on the other side of the explosion.</p>

<p>The flames and shock waves caused Nina and the others to subconsciously close their eyes as they looked up.</p>

<p>The floor shook, and even the giant blue waterfall let out a shuddering roar.</p>

<p>The black ashes turned into rain and fell one after another.</p>

<p>When the dragon's body turned into countless ash powder - boom! of.</p>

<p>Seeing the boy landing smoothly on the bank of the waterfall, Nina shook her shoulders and ran to his side.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay!&quot; Porus, Iglin and the others also came forward with half cheers.</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nina... doesn't matter, right?&quot;</p>

<p>The boy wiped his face and his clothes became tattered, but he was still caring about others. Nina should have been angry at him.</p>

<p>But only now, she chose to listen to the throbbing in her chest that wouldn't stop.</p>

<p>Look at this smile.</p>

<p>Feel this tenderness.</p>

<p>Thinking about this &quot;dream&quot;.</p>

<p>Nina's heart was indeed shaking uncontrollably, so she spoke out:</p>

<p>&quot;I want to be an adventurer.&quot;</p>

<p>In front of the surprised young man, she shouted:</p>

<p>&quot;I want to be by your side and see different scenery!&quot;</p>

<p>It just came out like this.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Eh?&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Not only Lapi, but also the &quot;Third Team&quot; and Porus were stunned for a moment, staring at the half-elf girl.</p>

<p>However, the girl noticed what had just been said and her face turned red - this did not happen.</p>

<p>The equipment, clothes, and magic items were all in tatters due to the dragon's aurora. There was a swish above the boy's head.</p>

<p>The wig slipped.</p>

<p>&quot;ah.&quot;</p>
