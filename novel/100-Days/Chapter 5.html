<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-22"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 5 &#8211; Isn’t Misunderstanding Wrong?</h1><p class="calibre2">Afterwards, I went to see Baron Alban again and thanked him for the help.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I amiably entered the carriage with his cautious daughter. The sadder I felt, the more enjoyable it felt to go to school. Also, Lumiere was such a good friend. She had read the book I recommended overnight. I was happy to hear her answers to my questions about the contents of the book.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I got off the carriage in front of the school gate, there was a person enthusiastically waiting for her. Paying no heed to the coachman, he went straight to her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lord Sazanjill!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, my. It was an embrace. An embrace had taken place. From the start of the morning, they are passionate with one another, I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how I looked at it, that was a hug, right? They were casually displaying their intimacy in public… I felt like a speck of dust. No, I was a speck of dust to them, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted to pass off as air and pass by them unnoticed&mdash;unfortunately, my gaze met with the other party.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As such, I had no choice but to smile and bow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Sazanjill gently separated himself from Lumiere and greeted me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouch.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good morning to you, Your Highness.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Good morning. Have you been with Lady Lumiere since morning?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, my, Ms. Lumiere, why are you staring at me so tearfully? I won’t bite, you know.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I smiled bitterly and responded to His Highness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, I stayed at her place last night. It seems that her health has improved… Afterwards, I recommended some books to her. Being able to discuss them on our commuting to the academy was entertaining.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…‘entertaining,’ you say.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Your Highness, why are you staring at me so begrudgingly?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Is he annoyed at being left out?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…That couldn’t be. His expression was too intense for merely that to be the cause.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I’ll ask you once again, is there nothing wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“None. Thanks to you, every day has been fulfilling.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…That’s good. Let’s go, Lumiere.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“O, okay!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Prompted by His Highness, Lumiere hurriedly followed him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing off his serious, unfriendly, back, I exhaled a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Yesterday, His Highness had inquired of me;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Is something wrong?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Were I to answer, <em class="calibre3">“I’m saddened by your affair,” </em>would he be troubled?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Being honest, that was my only one problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Truly, what a sinful lord you are.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre4" />“This morning’s romantic play, I saw it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…<em class="calibre3">’Play’?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Had such a love-hate drama occurred?</p>
<p class="calibre2">That day, I was having lunch with His Highness’ younger brother&mdash;His Highness Zafield, who oversaw my sword practice. While leaning on against the wall of the flowerbed, he smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Weren’t you having a problem with my older brother? As always, nothing is going well.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Certainly, we haven’t talked a lot these days.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was the one who declined the offer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I answered so, I got reprimanded&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;The tip of your sword is shaking!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“C’mon, concentrate. Even if they are just practice swings, you’re wielding an actual weapon. You’ll get hurt.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">But you’re the one who talked to me. How unreasonable.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, what he said was understandable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zafield had suggested I use a wooden sword to avoid getting injured.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The problem was… I didn’t have time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if it was a bit unreasonable, wouldn’t it better for me to get accustomed to the real thing?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I stopped swinging and complained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, don’t talk to me about unnecessary things! You’re distracting me!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“When the time comes, will you know what kind of obstacles will come flying at you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…That’s true.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;I had undeniably acted immaturely. A distraction of that level was enough to interrupt my focus.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, when he saw how unconvinced I was, Zafield stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Lelouche, why don’t you file a formal complaint against my brother?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…A complaint?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zafield came straight up to me. His eyes were sapphire blue, the same as my unreachable fiancée’s. Those eyes, which were bluer than the sky, were looking at me seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Things don’t have to stay this way forever. You deserve better. You can talk to your father. If it’s difficult, I can talk to him in your stead if need. Above all, he hates unreasonableness, so I don’t think it’ll go badly for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I’m not forcing myself or anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s a lie.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I told the truth, Zafield dismissed my words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though it was the truth&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;it was the truth, but I felt that he was also dismissing my efforts in educating Lumiere and taking up the sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Certainly, getting someone to understand without bringing up the god’s revelation and my life expectancy would be difficult to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I held the sword once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I can think for myself. If you don’t like it, I’ll ask someone else to train me. You don’t have to waste your time on me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t get angry. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m not angry.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I started swinging my sword. Zafield, who desperately put his hands together, looked a bit comical. I was secretly amused by his reaction.<br class="calibre4" /><br class="calibre4" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m back.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Later, I went home after spending some time with Lumiere. As expected, I returned late that day. Since it was already dark, it should be time for dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as I went through the front door, my mother, with a depressed look, jumped at me. My mother was a tall woman with lavishly adorned black hair. Even though she should be entering her forties, she looked youthful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed that the former ‘<em class="calibre3">Foreign Beauty’ </em>was touted as the ‘<em class="calibre3">Beauty Witch’&mdash;</em>probably because of her uncommon black hair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That mother was currently clinging and crying to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche… I’m glad, you came back!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have. Did Baron Alban contact you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Last night, I convinced the baron through waterworks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I managed to convince him, I honestly believed he’d secretly inform my family. Then, once my father officially complained, I’d have no choice but to return home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His beloved daughter, Lumiere, seemed to lack that common sense. But I didn’t think the baron himself wasn’t aware of that. On top of that, he must had been thinking of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I had found someone I could trust.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Resolving myself, I assured my mother.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry for having worried you. I was staying at Baron Alban’s house with Rufus. Please don’t blame the baron. I forced him to not contact you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is that so…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My mother, who had a snotty nose, was terribly young. She looked like Lumiere. When I thought that… I became even more baffled about Sazanjill’s feelings. My mother and father had always been close with each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My father fell in love with my mother, who was a ‘Foreign Beauty’, and desperately pursued her. Furthermore, while my mother was the third daughter, it was still an affair with the duke of a foreign kingdom. My father’s old friend, the king, couldn’t help but be amazed at how my father smashed through all those dozens of high walls with passion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, the present king took off his hat. He made my mother’s kingdom look good by naming her the ‘Beautiful Princess of the Foreign Kingdom.’ Thanks to that, the couple were successfully married and were now the legendary flirtatious couple.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was the reason I was engaged to Prince Sazanjill…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Really, with that kind of king around, I couldn’t get careless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I thought about that, I kept patting my mother on the back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What about Rufus…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Time to slowly exhale.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t have time to dilly-dally. There was still a lot of work left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What I was going to do now&mdash;it’d be more difficult than merely dealing with Rufus.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I spoke to her with a serious expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have to report to father about that.”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">When my father struck the table, the tableware on top of it rattled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Rufus left&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, I truly apologize for doing something utterly selfish.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had assisted my little brother in running away from home…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…In fact, I was the one who urged him to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless of anything, what I did was bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I put down my cutlery and bowed my head. My father, who sat across from me, let out a great sigh. Next to him, my mother was weeping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, their reactions were to be expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I straightforwardly told them that it was what Rufus wanted, and that I had also entrusted him to the most credible artist. I had decided that it’d be better than keeping him here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, my father asked me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Why didn’t you talk to us even once?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Wouldn’t you have just turn it down?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">…That’s&mdash;</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My father wavered. While wiping his sweaty scalp with a handkerchief, he sighed, “<em class="calibre3">Haa…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">If you wipe it roughly like that, your head will become even glossier…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, my father, who tucked the handkerchief within his breast pocket, didn’t seem to mind in the slightest. Then, he put his hands together on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What are you going to do about the next successor? Is Lelouche planning to take over?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, as it is, it’ll be proven more beneficial for me to marry into the royal family.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Kingdom of Lapisenta, the successor of the family didn’t have to be male. Of course, most of the heads were male. But, some of the emerging aristocrat families these days were inherited by girls. In houses that focused on women’s commerce, there were cases where women had succeeded the family. Just like male heads, female heads also had a penchant for business.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Elcage Family was a traditional aristocratic family. Its descendants were in charge of governing the academic territory near the royal capital. As long as they weren’t some knightly duties, it wasn’t like a woman weren’t up to the task, but…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I was unsuitable to be the next successor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Needless to say, for someone with only had a few dozens of days remaining in that world to succeed the family would be outrageous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Aside from the latter, my father also wasn’t a fool who didn’t know the obligations of the family head. It was quite a complicated role, one that Rufus wasn’t suited for.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If so, should we adopt someone? It isn’t an impossible thing to do, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">For a long time, the Elcage Family hadn’t been given the rank of ‘Duke’. My uncle had a cousin, while my aunt had three brothers. If I recalled correctly, the third son was unmarried. Father’s direct lineage was good… but we were facing the possibility of ruin. As such, I wanted my father to understand. I wouldn’t do anything that would cause him to go bald with worries.</p>

<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As I apologized in my heart, I made a proposition to my father.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why don’t you create a new existence that you can love in Rufus’ stead?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, dear!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn’t always a good idea to substitute love for something else. It depended on the timing and situation. However, since both father and mother took good care of their health, I was sure it was a good proposal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">But why is my mother bright red?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“B, but, we’re already old… my husband, what do you think?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right… recently, my legs have been weakening…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Certainly, neither my father nor mother could be considered young. Since they were in mid-forties, they might have physical problems that no teenager like me had.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Regardless, one mustn’t succumb to hesitation!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, how about training!? Recently, I’ve begun training myself! After all, it’s good to sweat!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh dear, my father seems stubborn…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As I thought, I wanted my father, a gentleman, to actively work on it…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Then, I’d have no choice but to begin!</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll also look for medicines that are good for nourishment. May I order them next time?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, why do you insist on pursuing this matter…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Shouldn’t it be obvious!? Let’s do our best together! If we work together, I’m sure we’ll succeed!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">““T-together?!””</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two were astonished by my determination.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Hmm… am I acting out of the character?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, I had never been so adamant with them before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Nevertheless, it wasn’t like I had time to persuade them slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Is it no good?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I never thought I’d use it against my parents, but&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">I moistened both of my eyes, and stared intently at them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…After gulping, the two of them finally relented.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well… if Lelouche insists that much… I should try my best?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, well, my, Lelouche! How you have matured!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">‘My, my!’&mdash;</em>while saying so, my mother kept hitting my father’s shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed that the two of them had become closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Also, under the table, it had become rather fussy&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">what are they doing?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, my strategy seemed to have progressed smoothly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, let’s do our best starting from tomorrow!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I smiled wholeheartedly while the two of them still seemed reluctant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">***</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“You’re a truly sinful person, do you know that?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, my, is this about His Highness?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“No, it’s about your cruelty in general.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, I’m a villainess, aren’t I?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Truth to be told, I was reluctant to accept it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, since the person who said it was a god, there might be some semblance of truth…</p>
<p class="calibre2">In my dream, the god was as harsh as always.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">No matter how good-looking you are, you won’t be popular like this, y’know?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I proceeded to ask him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Was god also a god in his previous life?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“What do you mean?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I wonder if since it’s god, he’d be popular.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…<em class="calibre3">Popular?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the first place, the concept of being ‘popular’ was a modern thing. Therefore, given the noble characteristic of god, it might be reasonable for him to become confused.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, the answer he reached as he touched his chin was surprisingly sincere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Unfortunately, I don’t have much memory of being favored by the opposite sex. It isn’t something I prefer to talk about. …I, don’t recall having a comfortable life. Unlike what most think, my previous life was nothing remarkable.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I see, I’m sorry for my uncouth question.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“No, you don’t have to apologize, what I’m saying is&mdash;”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">God suddenly stopped talking. When I stared at him, he averted his gaze. While hiding his mouth with one hand, he started mumbling.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I see, so that’s how it is… but, for real?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, my.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">For even a god to use the slang, ‘<em class="calibre3">for real’…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In that case, should I start speaking informally as well?</p>
<p class="calibre2">But my parents would become even more suspicious of me…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I was already aware of my life expectancy, I didn’t want to give them even more sad memories.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, I didn’t want to spend the remainder of my life being cared for.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;</em>if I could, I wanted everyone’s memories of me to be a happy one, ones where I was smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“What’s the matter? Why did you suddenly laugh?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…So, at times like this, you refrained from reading one’s mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Didn’t you tell me not to?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, my, is he being considerate? How kind…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I also wondered what I was struggling with. In the end, I decided to not bother.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I just thought that I’d do my best tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I think that as it is, you’re doing fine.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I beg to differ.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That night, in the pure white world, I laughed.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;63 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, let’s start with these rag!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">From early morning, I was dubiously stared at by my parents.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I wonder why?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Yesterday, didn’t we agreed to this?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Or, could it be, they don’t know what I’m referring to!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Rags are tools for immediate cleansing, these thick pieces of cloth are then immersed in a bucket of water!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Honestly, it would be quicker to just show them how to do it. I crawled on all fours down the hall with a rag while staring intently at the floor. It was to the point that I could identify each grain in the wood. After I had reached the end of the corridor, I moved a little and turned around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While wiping the pleasant sweat, I looked at them with a light smile&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Let’s do it together!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Uh, Lelouche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is it, father?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What’s wrong?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">My mother seemed about to faint. My father supported her by her shoulders. As I tilted my head, my father spoke slowly, as if mincing his words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Why do we have to clean?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Eh? For the time being, we should focus on training your legs.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I said yesterday, it was for training. That said, it actually had other purposes as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I simply wanted them to attain enough vitality so they could live together even after our family fell into ruin. As such, to improve their housework ability, I was going to make them clean for the time being. Afterwards, I planned for the cooks to teach them how to make breakfast. During the day, I’d teach them how to do chores…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Then, from the evening, I’d help them prepare supper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We’d do everything together, starting from cleaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once they gotten used to it, it would be time to advance to my main goal&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Oh, I’m sorry! I forgot to mention the other day, but I’ve made some arrangements! It seems that both seeds and fertilized will arrive within next week!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">““Seeds!?””</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s why, until then, I’d like for the three of us to clean together so we can build up our physical strength! Oh, I’ve also had the maids do the sweeping and cleaning in advance. But starting from the day after tomorrow, we’ll start doing the cleaning ourselves!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“B, but why…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“See, if we clean with these rags, won’t we be repeatedly crouching down and standing? It’s just right for training our legs! Sweeping is also a training of insight, because we’ll be looking for dust! It’s a necessary endeavor! The act of getting rid of dust will surely help in the fields. It’s important to be able to identify even the smallest of changes.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wondered what was wrong with them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though I was so enthusiastic, the two showed complicated expressions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt kind of embarrassed but… <em class="calibre3">could it be?!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Is it because I’m dressed as beautifully as usual?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was wearing my usual indoor garments, though…</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was actually difficult to wipe the floor, but I had grown quite used to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let’s do our best together!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I took my parents’ hands and smiled, they finally nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, I understand…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, everything would be confusing at first. But I was sure, soon they’d start having fun! They were my parents after all!</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;50 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My assumption was correct.</p>
<p class="calibre2">About my father, in particular. After all, he was the same man who managed to win the hand of the ‘Foreign Beauty’, and even managed to make the king acquiesce. Once he became immersed in something, he’d see it through.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, what do you think about the soil?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Wow, as expected of father! It has become much softer!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A field was created in the corner of the mansion. With a towel wrapped around his neck, my father wiped his shiny, sweaty, head. He was also holding a hoe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though he looked tired, my father still managed to laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Haha, at first, I was surprised. It’s fun moving your body with the entire family. It’s also nice being around the maids and the gardeners these days… Now, if only Rufus were here…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;That was right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our family consisted of four, including Rufus. There were no days when I didn’t miss him. Regardless, as long as it didn’t spell the demise of my parents, or my little brother living in isolation for the rest of his life&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;I smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I’m sure we’ll be able to meet Rufus once he has completed his studies. At that time, I want my mother to cook the vegetables grown by father. I want him to taste it by all means!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s a great idea! Although, what if we just send it to him? I can’t send him any money due to his master’s pride, but homegrown vegetables should be okay, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That sounds like a plan!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was indeed a loophole. As expected of my father! The vegetables would surely improve his diet. The gift was humble, and in a good way. It surely wouldn’t cause him any discomfort. Like I said, while our first homegrown vegetables might not be the best, they would still be appropriate as a gift.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…However, would it possible to see it through to that stage?</p>
