<p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths - Sasha's Journey 3<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As the name suggests, it's a "salt lake."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A lake large enough to engulf an entire country, frozen solid by the frigid climate of Frizd.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It is said to have been ruins originally, with treasures piled at the bottom of the lake.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, once you enter, you can never leave.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The lake is said to be frozen to the bottom. Though whether that's true, who knows..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the entrance, Tycoon speaks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Great Salt Lake's entrance has an old wall and a weathered gate.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Unlike Delmadrome's Great Labyrinth, this place is unmanaged. Entering and exiting is unrestricted. Indeed, there are other footprints here besides Sasha and her team.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Looks like someone went in ahead of us."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wh-what? Aren't we going in? We'll fall behind!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Fool. This is the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. Rushing in recklessly is a death sentence. Besides... I don't know what kind of team they are, but I doubt anyone other than us can conquer this."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora pulls her knitted woolen cap tightly over her head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The cold is harsh, reddening everyone's cheeks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha speaks to the accompanying A-rank team.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"From here on, only we will proceed. There's no telling how long it will take to clear."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, just as we planned, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's right. If we don't return in six months—180 days—assume the team has perished. Clan operations have been entrusted to Ibis-sama."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Let's hope it doesn't come to that."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha shakes hands with the A-rank team's leader, and the team departs.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha addresses her remaining members.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Everyone, stay alert. Beyond this point is unlike any dungeon we've faced before. The Forbidden Six Labyrinths... an unexplored dungeon no one has ever conquered. Stay vigilant for beasts and traps."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""""Understood!""""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Everyone adopts the face of an adventurer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And so, Sasha and her team set off for the bottom of the lake.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The first underground level.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The surroundings are covered in ice, but the ground beneath their feet is well-constructed and not slippery.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon, unable to hide his excitement, speaks up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Amazing...!! This is the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. Look at these walls. They're frozen, but they resemble murals... Hmm, I can't decipher them. What could this be?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Flowers, maybe?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Possibly... but I suspect this is a building. Could this structure, submerged in the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans, have turned into a dungeon? Or did the lake form around the building? Hmm, I want to study this."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, you can do that after we return."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Called by Reynold, Tycoon reluctantly steps away from the wall.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The walls sparkle for some reason, reflecting light off the ice like lanterns. Piasora extinguishes her lamp and stores it in her item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We won't need light here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. And it's... spacious. If enemies show up, we can fight freely."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The path is wide enough for ten people to stand in a row.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The high ceiling suggests it was made for large creatures to pass through.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But the road itself is quite annoying.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Curved paths, uphill climbs, steep slopes, ramps... Ugh!! What is with this road!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora complains.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And no wonder. The path they walk is wide but full of winding curves and uphill climbs. They've walked a decent distance downward, but there's no end in sight.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then Tycoon comments.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Something's odd. Most dungeons have branching paths or traps to confuse you, but there's none of that here. It's just endless curves and climbs..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This may only be the beginning, but it's already a pain."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold shrugs, and Sasha chuckles.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then Robin speaks up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What about Haise's side? The Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome is a desert, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"He sets off earlier than we did. Knowing Haise, He’s probably midway through by now."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Or perhaps... they're dead already?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Piasora laughs, Sasha flicks her forehead.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ouch!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't be disrespectful. As fellow adventurers, wish for his survival and success, not his death."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...It's almost noon. Let's take a break."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At Sasha's suggestion, they decide to rest midway through a curved path.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They set out chairs and tables from the item box and lay out skewers purchased from a stall.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, the time-freezing item box is so convenient. The meat's still piping hot."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Indeed, it is. Very handy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon agrees with Piasora's words.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold, surveying the surroundings, speaks to Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Sasha. We've walked quite a bit. Why don't we stop here for today? Judging by our hunger, it’s late afternoon. Our sense of time is muddled, but it’s best not to disrupt our rhythm. Let’s rest for eight hours before moving on."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...You're right. Alright, after eating, we'll take turns resting."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That day, Team Sacred began their challenge of the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus started their 150-day-long dungeon life.</p>
