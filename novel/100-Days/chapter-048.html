<p>Forbidden Sixth Labyrinths - Haise’s Journey 5<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise sits on the roof of a car, playing with a handgun.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sitting in front of him is a Chaos Goblin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Pointing the gun at it, Haise speaks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, spill what you know. If I think you're lying or stalling, I'll shoot without mercy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Ah, a-alright...]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Chaos Goblin's arm is wrapped in bandages.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had tossed them to it, and the goblin wrapped them itself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There was no grudge for killing his comrades. Only fear of death remained.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[This is the Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome... or so humans call it. But that's not the truth... This place was once the land of demons. It's what demons call Isekai.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Isekai..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Yes. Long ago, before there were beasts like us or humans with abilities like yours, this land was inhabited by others. They had a highly advanced civilization and lived in peace.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh... Tycoon would love to hear this."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[But long ago... everything was destroyed by a phenomenon called Tsunami. This land was buried in sand, creating a unique ecosystem that attracted demons. The demons studied the civilization of this place, trying to recreate it in their own world. That's why demonic civilization surpasses humans'.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Interesting. So... how do you clear this place?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Th-this is the 601st underground floor. If you descend about 100 more levels, you'll find a town called Theme Park, where demons used to live. It holds treasures left behind by them. Beyond that, there's nothing.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just 100 more...!! That's good news."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Yes. But... the floors below here are hell. Even someone like me, who has lived here for a long time, won't go down there. The beasts below are on a completely different level—massively powerful monsters lurk there.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmmm..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise checks his Desert Eagle magazine and racks the slide.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"One question. I killed your comrades. Do you hold a grudge?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[I don't. They were comrades by name only; we shared the same species, that's all. Do you humans mourn strangers' deaths? Would you shed tears for someone who happened to be nearby when they died?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[We just happened to gather here because we smelled humans. This place is comfortable to live in, after all.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see. Alright, got it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stands up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He then speaks to the Chaos Goblin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thanks for the intel. You can go now."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[...What about you?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'm heading for the lower floors. With just 100 more, I can make it in 50... no, 30 days."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Y-you're serious!?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Conquering this place is my goal."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[...]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise pulls out a bottle of liquor and hands it to the Chaos Goblin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Money's useless for you, so here's a token of thanks. It's surface liquor—tastes great."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[...]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"See ya."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Haise heads for the lower floors.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Chaos Goblin calls out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[W-wait!! F-fine... I-I'll come with you. I know this place well enough to help.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No, thanks. I prefer going solo."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[P-please, wait!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise walks toward the lower floors.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Chaos Goblin falls into step beside him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Wait. Let me come with you.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why? I killed your kind."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Don't worry about that. Besides... I'm interested in you. Let me join you. If I betray you, you can kill me.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Please. Heh... maybe, just maybe, I can make it lower than this floor. I want to aim for a floor without my kind.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Weird guy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignores the Chaos Goblin and keeps walking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They soon find a passage leading downward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Wait. Your name, tell me your name.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Haise. Nice name. Let's go, then.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...You really are a weird guy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And so, the Chaos Goblin ended up accompanying Haise.</p>
