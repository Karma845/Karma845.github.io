<p><p>Extra chaptet thanks to a Ko-fi Supporter</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>S-Rank Adventurer's Guidance 1<br><br><br><br>The break was over, and Haise and the others arrived at Adramelech Adventurer School, commonly known as. After greetings, classes were finally set to begin today.<br><br>Haise, Geist, Sasha, Mina, Presea, and Hijiri—the six of them—were doing final checks in the adventurer-only waiting room inside the academy.<br><br>"First, today's lectures will be handled by me, Mina, Sasha, and Presea. The practical training will be handled by Haise and Hijiri. You two over there… especially Hijiri, don’t go overboard."<br><br>"As long as I don’t kill them, right?"<br><br>"...Haise, if it comes to it, knock Hijiri out."<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>"Hey, you’re making me sound like some troublemaker!"<br><br>"You are a troublemaker."<br><br>"Hey, Haise!! Don’t look down on me like that! I know how to hold back!!"<br><br>Hijiri puffed out her cheeks and jabbed Haise with her elbow.<br><br>Geist sighed and spoke to Haise.<br><br>"Haise, I’ve told you many times…"<br><br>"I know. During practicals, fight in a way that draws out the students’ potential, right?"<br><br>"Yeah. Just so you know, healers are on standby. Be careful."<br><br>"Got it."<br><br>"Heeey, hehehe… I’m kinda getting excited now."<br><br>Hijiri clapped her fists together and grinned while doing warm-ups.<br><br>Haise also checked the magazine of his Desert Eagle and racked the slide.<br><br>He confirmed the rubber bullets for riot suppression and holstered them at his waist.<br><br>"Alright, class is about to start. Everyone, move out."<br><br>""Yes!!""<br><br>"Yes!!"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>"All right!!"<br><br>Haise and Sasha responded crisply in unison, followed belatedly by Mina, Presea, and Hijiri in that order.<br><br>◇◇◇◇◇<br><br>Sasha headed to the classroom with Presea in her usual adventurer gear.<br><br>"You’re in full gear even though it’s a lecture, huh?"<br><br>"Says you."<br><br>"True. But I keep my weapons in my Item Box. You’ve got yours hanging at your waist."<br><br>"Well… just feels right."<br><br>"I see."<br><br>As usual, she was somewhat cold—or rather, that was just Presea being herself.<br><br>Sasha seemed used to it by now.<br><br>Presea asked Sasha:<br><br>"Think you can handle teaching?"<br><br>"Dunno. I’m not exactly scholarly, so I can’t do deep lectures. Besides, they told me to focus more on sharing experiences—like the monsters I’ve fought and the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. Apparently, adventurers’ stories are educational for students."<br><br>"Huh… guess I won’t have much to do, then."<br><br>"Maybe. But just having you there is reassuring. I’m… kinda nervous about being an instructor."<br><br>"Really? Then I’ll give you a little charm."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>Presea stopped and took Sasha’s hand.<br><br>She brought it close to her lips and whispered something under her breath.<br><br>"P-Presea?"<br><br>Then, she lightly kissed Sasha’s hand, traced her palm with a finger, and finally closed Sasha’s fingers over it, squeezing tightly.<br><br>"There, all done."<br><br>"W-What was that?"<br><br>"An elven incantation to ease tension. I wrote ‘confidence’ on your palm and sealed it by squeezing so it’d spread through your body. Feel it working?"<br><br>"...Uh…"<br><br>Honestly, her heart was pounding too much to tell.<br><br>Even though they were the same gender, having a beauty like Presea kiss her hand and grip it tightly sent a different kind of flutter through her. Sasha couldn’t stop the racing in her chest.<br><br>"M-Maybe…?"<br><br>"Good. Let’s go, then."<br><br>"Y-Yeah."<br><br>Presea walked off like nothing happened, and Sasha hurried after her.<br><br>◇◇◇◇◇<br><br>Haise and Hijiri arrived at the academy’s training grounds.<br><br>This was where students trained and held mock battles. Right now, about twenty aspiring adventurers stood in formation, listening to their teacher explain today’s mock battle and their opponents—Haise and Hijiri.<br><br>"Now, one of your opponents is S-Rank adventurer Heracles Hijiri. As you all know, she’s a martial artist from the western nation of Uron. For those of you specializing in hand-to-hand combat, experiencing her strength firsthand will surely help you grow!"<br><br>The praise was effusive.<br><br>Glancing at Hijiri, Haise saw her puffing out her chest and crossing her arms for some reason.<br><br>"And the other is none other than S-Rank adventurer Dark Stalker Haise! He’s the strongest solo adventurer, having conquered the Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome—one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths—all by himself. Everyone, just challenging him is a rare opportunity. Focus not on winning or losing, but on learning everything you can from him."<br><br>More excessive praise.<br><br>Feeling awkward, Haise looked up at the sky.<br><br>"Heheh. You nervous or somethin’?"<br><br>"Not nervous, just… never been introduced like that before. It’s weird."<br><br>"Huh. So you’re human after all… didn’t expect that."<br><br>Hijiri sounded surprised.<br><br>Then, the teacher called Haise and Hijiri forward. With a "Please say a few words," Hijiri thrust out her fist dramatically.<br><br>"Anyone who’s got confidence, step up!! I’ll smash that confidence to pieces!!"<br><br>"Don’t smash it… do you even get the point of this?"<br><br>"Sh-Shut up! I’m just sayin’ I’ll crush ’em for real!!"<br><br>The students giggled. Haise regretted reflexively correcting her.<br><br>The teacher urged, "Now, Haise," so he reluctantly spoke up.<br><br>"Uh…"<br><br>He scanned the students.<br><br>About 60% boys, 40% girls. All wore white-based uniforms, many carrying swords, staves, axes, hammers, or other weapons.<br><br>Then he noticed—Miko, with her wooden greatsword strapped to her back, breathing heavily and nodding vigorously at him.<br><br>Haise spoke.<br><br>"Anyway, since I took the job, I’ll train you seriously… so, uh, let’s do our best."<br><br>He bowed slightly.<br><br>Hijiri elbowed him.<br><br>"What was that? You’re blushing and acting all childish!"<br><br>"Shut up. Better than you."<br><br>"Excuse me?! At least I’m not all awkward like you!!"<br><br>"I’m not awkward. Stop making stuff up."<br><br>"You wanna say that again?!"<br><br>"Th-Thank you all!! Now, uh… let’s split into groups and begin the mock battles!"<br><br>And so, the S-Rank adventurers’ guidance at AdAd began.</p></p>
