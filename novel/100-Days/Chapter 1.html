<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 1 &#8211; Let’s Make a Bet With God</h1><p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“You’ll die in a hundred days.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I fell down the stairs at the academy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It happened right after I passed somebody. I was certain whoever that was had pushed me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Or, am I mistaken?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, I slipped and fell down the stairs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immediately after that, in a pure white world, I received a message from god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Forgive me. The truth is, by informing you, I’m already going against convention. You were supposed to die without knowing anything. I’m sorry for giving you needless fear.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">God was a truly brilliant, truly beautiful young man. He was slender and graceful. His long, white, hair flowed down over a shoulder. Bright skin. White formal wear. Only his eyes were golden. Appearing like a devout priest, the young man looked exactly like the depiction of god in the ‘Nameless Sunset’&mdash;the last painting of a famous artist, Andre-Oscar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards the young man possessing divine beauty, I posed a question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Why did you tell me, then?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…It </em>ma.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What does that have to do with anything?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I just thought that you’re very… pitiful.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Is that so?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Is he sympathizing with me?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Now, what should I do?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Certainly, it was befitting of a god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless, for him to pity a person he had only met once&mdash;it <em class="calibre3">certainly </em>was arrogant of him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“To put it simply&mdash;did you know that you’ll be forsaken by your fiancé, the crown prince?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Yes.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was aware that my fiancé, the crown prince&mdash;Sazanjill Lukino Lapisenta, was having an affair. It was a well-known fact for everyone in the academy. The other party was none other than a baroness, Lumiere Alban. Their relationship, <em class="calibre3">of course, </em>went beyond mere friendship.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see, so, how am I going to die?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“For now, you’re going to die at the hands of your own fiancée. He’s attempting to shield his beloved woman from a frenzied lady, one convicted of many crimes…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh dear. It seems that everyone will end up believing I’m planning to assassinate Ms. Lumiere.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Honestly, I was anticipating that outcome. If I were to be humiliated in public&mdash;which I doubted was going to happen&mdash;I expected to be slapped. But… in a hundred days from now, I recalled that the king would be holding a dance party.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">No way…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Even if that guy is blinded by love, is he going to annul our engagement in public!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Involuntarily, I showed a bitter smile.<br class="calibre4" /><em class="calibre3">This is no laughing matter.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s as if I’m the villain.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“You’re not wrong. Should I refer to you as the villainess?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh my, that has a nice ring to it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards such a wonderful title, I clapped my hands in adoration. With a serious expression, god continued the dark story.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Afterwards, your family, the Elcage Family, will have their title stripped on suspicions of treason. As a result, they’ll be sold as slaves. In addition, your fiancé, who will abandoned you, is murdered immediately. Even if he doesn’t die, he’ll end up paralyzed or in a coma.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What&mdash;!? He’s seriously being targeted by assassins&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…What a magnificent development, where should I begin to retort?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Kingdom of Lapisenta, since roughly about one hundred years ago, human trafficking had been openly carried out. Thus, in the aftermath of my family’s enslavement, His Highness Sazanjill was to meet his demise at the hands of an assassin…</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What happened to his escorts?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I laughed reflexively.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I understand if you find it difficult to believe&mdash;…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, it’s not that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards the god, who narrowed his eyes, I immediately shook my head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m feeling miserable for myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t even bother to mention it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But… I had put in some effort to become a worthy duchess and a suitable princess. I had polished myself and lacked neither manners nor knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything was for the sake of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be a role model for the people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be more astonishing than anyone else.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had lived an upright life&mdash;a life where I respected good, laws, and order.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the last 16 years, I had endured a lot of things. I didn’t even have the luxury to amuse myself. As a matter of fact, I had also never experienced what it was like to fall in love.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…However, it turned out that my fate was to meet with an untimely demise. It was to the point that even God found me pitiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was enough of a reason for me to laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, it wasn’t like I couldn’t make use of the light that shone in the darkness of the impending future&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Could it be, the reason you’re telling me this is so that I can avoid this outcome?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">To my question, the god nodded slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“To an extent&mdash;for death is inevitable. In this world, there is cause and effect. Humans can’t escape the cause and effect, as much as they can’t escape death. The process up to that point can be changed, but as for your death, no matter how hard you try…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is that so? Then, why are you even bothering informing me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The god didn’t answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…What kind of person&mdash;!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, he was a god. An arrogant one, at that. He was basically saying that I’d still end up dying, but if I did my best, my death might not be gruesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Does he want me to make a fool out of myself?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“If so, god&mdash;if I can show you a beautiful death, won’t you reward me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Reward…?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The astounded face of the god was so cute, I couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Anything is fine, as long as you reward me. Anyway, I never expected a mighty figure like you to be so dumbstruck…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was his first time losing his composure, too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I’d die in a hundred days. After receiving such a revelation, I should rightfully be shocked. However, it was just too much of a hassle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, god chuckled a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Alright, if you succeed, in your next life, I will grant your wishes.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, it’s a promise!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I extended my little finger. A pinky promise&mdash;it was a kind of children’s deception, originating from the Orient. It was said that if people tied their little fingers together, their promises would be granted. If they weren’t, a disaster would befall those who broke the promise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once again, god was surprised. But he soon entwined his finger around mine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My surroundings immediately became engulfed in light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus I, Lelouche Elcage, had returned to my world&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;to die a most beautiful death in a hundred days.</p>
