<p><br /></p>
<p>Clan Sacred<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The newly established Clan Sacred, led by the S-rank adventurer Brunhilde, Sasha, began with 18 teams, consisting of three teams each from ranks A to F.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The selection was based on interviews, considering past missions and success rates, with Tycoon at the forefront of the screening process.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the inaugural ceremony, adventurers based in the royal capital came to observe.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Haise sat on the first floor of a run-down inn, sipping weak tea made by the innkeeper as he read an ancient manuscript.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…………”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to the inauguration?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The innkeeper’s voice made Haise glance sideways.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The innkeeper spoke without looking at Haise, engrossed in his newspaper. Haise could have ignored him, but he decided to respond for a change of pace.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s got nothing to do with me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Is that so.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The newspaper’s headline read, ‘S-rank Adventurer Sasha Forms Clan. Ceremony Today’.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Understanding a sentence from the manuscript, Haise moved his right hand thoughtfully.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see… A new weapon… This isn’t something to be used carelessly.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The weapons of ‘Isekai’. Which could only be used after deciphering specific pages of ancient manuscripts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had steadily increased his arsenal by analyzing these while tackling dungeons.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Interestingly, after becoming an S-rank adventurer, the number of usable weapons surged.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise felt stronger than ever.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Finishing his tea, he stood up to test his new weapon outside.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Thanks for the tea.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He left a few silver coins on the counter and exited the inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Haise stepped into the castle town, many adventurers headed toward Clan Sacred’s headquarters.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Avoiding the crowd, Haise chose a different route, drawing attention despite himself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, it’s S-rank adventurer Haise!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I heard he and Sasha are like oil and water.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Of course, he’s skipping the ceremony.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Dark Stalker… so cool…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ignoring the chatter, Haise made his way toward the Adventurer’s Guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside, the receptionists chatted idly, the guild unusually devoid of adventurers—a first for Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though he’d only come to test his weapon, he decided to check for any extermination requests while he was there.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Oh… An A-rank magical beast. Iron Metal Goblin extermination?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Iron Metal Goblin—a highly intelligent goblin that scavenges and arms itself with gear taken from slain adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Being ranked A, it must have killed many adventurers and acquired top-grade equipment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise took the request slip to a rookie receptionist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Here, I’ll take this.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Oh, yes! …Wait, Haise?!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hm?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to the ceremony?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No point in going.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Oh, really? I thought you’d go to offer encouragement—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You idiot!!” Thwack!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The rookie was smacked on the head by a veteran receptionist and looked teary-eyed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even Haise was startled by the suddenness, but the veteran smiled brightly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Apologies. Here’s your request slip. It’s been processed. Please be careful.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Haise glanced at the rookie, she glared at her senior with tearful eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Haise left the guild, he overheard their exchange.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Why’d you hit me, senpai?!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[You fool! Always saying unnecessary things!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[But it’s true! Haise and Sasha were close friends, weren’t they? If they just reconciled—]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[That’s exactly what you should not meddle in!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise chuckled softly and started walking, request slip in hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In Clan Sacred, the F-rank adventurer team Thousand had just been assigned their room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their leader, a newly 14-year-old boy named Roland, felt overwhelmed as he stood before Sasha, her smile almost blinding. His heart pounded so loudly it was deafening.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha’s lips moved, saying something, but Roland couldn’t hear it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His childhood friend and teammate, Kua, nudged him with her elbow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Y-yes!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hehe… I look forward to working with you all.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes, a-achoo!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Overcome with nerves, Roland sneezed while bowing, creating an odd scene.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their tank, Mad, and the archer girl, Tena, looked away awkwardly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha patted Roland on the shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Take this—it’s the emblem of Clan Sacred.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She pinned a badge with a wing-shaped insignia to Roland’s chest, then did the same for Kua, Mad, and Tena.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The sweet fragrance surrounding Sasha made Roland feel faint.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She smiled warmly and addressed them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Now that you’re part of our clan, it won’t just be about taking requests—I’ll train you rigorously. I expect great things from you all.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""""Yes, ma’am!!""""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The four bowed in unison.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The room assigned to Clan Sacred’s F-rank adventurer team Thousand wasn’t very spacious.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It had a small table with four chairs for meetings, a workstation for equipment maintenance, a shelf for documents, and a sofa for resting.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Being F-rank adventurers, they had no high expectations, but having their own room was exciting enough.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Our… our very own room!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Come on, Roland! What was that earlier at the inauguration?!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I-It couldn’t be helped. I was nervous!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Kua scolded Roland, which wasn’t surprising.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After all, the team Thousand, formed just three months ago, had joined the Clan Sacred led by the famed S-rank adventurer Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Feeling nervous was only natural.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mad, their 15-year-old, stoic tank, nodded slowly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…I was nervous too.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With his eyes squinting even thinner and his mouth firmly set, Mad appeared deep in thought.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I was nervous too! Hey, Kua, wasn’t Sasha absolutely stunning?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their archer, Tena, a curious 14-year-old girl, chimed in enthusiastically.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Kua nodded in agreement.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“She’s incredible. I’d love to be an adventurer as cool as her someday.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You, Kua? Really?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What’s that supposed to mean, Roland?!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“J-just kidding!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Roland flinched under Kua’s glare.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tena then changed the topic.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“So, Roland, what’s the plan for today? We’ve got missions starting tomorrow.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm… Oh, I know! Let’s head to the guild. We should let them know we’re part of Clan Sacred now!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You just want to brag, don’t you? Not that I don’t get it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…A walk to the guild might be nice.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“All right, let’s go together.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, the team set off for the Adventurer’s Guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The guild was quieter than usual, with most adventurers taking the day off after the ceremony.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Many requests were still available, leaving Roland and his team a bit disappointed—they had hoped to show off their new affiliation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Instead, they decided to at least introduce themselves to a rookie receptionist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Excuse me, miss.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Oh, Roland! Congratulations on joining Clan Sacred!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Eheh… Well, thank you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wow, that’s amazing! I really admire you all!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Eheh… Ow!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Roland winced as Kua stepped on his foot. Her glare clearly said, “Stop acting so smug!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As they talked, someone entered the guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A boy, no older than 16, clad in a jet-black coat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Despite his age, the atmosphere around him was overwhelming—a presence shaped by countless battles and near-death experiences.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The boy approached the counter, where a veteran receptionist greeted him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“The mission is complete. Here’s the equipment taken from the goblin. I made sure to recover as much as possible. Return it to their families or comrades.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Understood. Are you sure? The equipment is legally yours.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I don’t need it. Here’s the goblin I killed.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From his item box, the boy—Haise—produced the severed head of a goblin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"""""Eek!!"""""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Roland’s team, along with the rookie receptionist, gasped in unison.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Noticing their reaction, Haise casually returned the head to his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Not the best thing to pull out in a public space, huh.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He glanced briefly at the Sacred emblem on Roland’s chest, his expression unreadable.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll need to verify the materials, so please follow me to the disassembly room.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Got it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Without a word to Roland’s group, Haise walked away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Watching his retreating figure, Roland muttered,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That’s… Haise. The S-rank adventurer.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Th-that was terrifying…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“He brought out… a severed head…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…It gave me chills.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Strangely, though, Roland didn’t find Haise frightening—just mysterious.</p>
