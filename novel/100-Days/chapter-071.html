<p>Heracles 2<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri, who had been led to the clan's reception room, sat on the sofa with her legs spread wide and her arms crossed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Upon hearing, she was the same age as Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In contrast to Sasha, who sat with her legs tightly closed and her posture perfectly straight.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Currently, Sasha and Hijiri sat facing each other on the sofa. Behind Sasha stood Reynold, while Robin and Tycoon stood by the door, having just returned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri was munching on a cookie from the tea set.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha spoke in a calm voice.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Are you requesting the clan 'Sacred,' S-rank adventurer Heracles Hijiri?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're so stiff—loosen up a bit when you talk. You're the same age as me, but you seem so tense."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Get to the point."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They wouldn't get along.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha realized this instantly and decided to hear her out quickly and send her on her way.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After all, Hijiri had barged into the clan and used violence on their members. Even if they were to subdue her, they could justify it, and the fact that they had brought her to the reception room, served her tea, and listened to her was already an extraordinary act of kindness.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri placed the request form on the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'm requesting the clan Sacred"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha picked up the request form and checked it... then her eyes widened.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A subjugation request. The target is... S-rank adventurer, Heracles Hijiri? Are you seriously requesting a subjugation against yourself!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's right. If I don't, I can't fight strong opponents."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"And the reward is 5,000 gold coins...!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's all my wealth. I earned it from subjugation requests and dungeon conquests. Though I've spent quite a bit on food."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What is this girl?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha thought as she looked at Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I aim to be the strongest adventurer. I heard there's an adventurer and a team in the Heiberg Kingdom who conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, so I ran all the way here. I picked a fight with some guy named Haise, but he ran away, so I came to you next."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Even if the whole clan comes at me, can you defeat me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri clapped her fists together and thrust them toward Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She smiled brightly, looking utterly delighted.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha chuckled and said,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Out of the question."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No sane person would accept such a request. Making yourself the target and having adventurers subjugate you? What's the point of that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Of course, it's to become the strongest adventurer. Being the strongest means being stronger than anyone else. Stronger than magical beasts, stronger than S-rank adventurers."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly, Haise crossed Sasha's mind.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The image of an adventurer who continued to fight alone, striving to become stronger. She also remembered herself, who had allowed that to happen.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Surely, Hijiri was different from Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her sparkling eyes purely sought 'the strongest.' Unlike Haise, who sought 'the strength to fight alone.'<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Our clan cannot accept this request. Once you're done here, please leave."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...You're so boring."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Like I said earlier, you're way too tense. I've visited a few clans, but you're the most boring of them all. Why are you even an adventurer?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, whatever. I heard your team cleared the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, so I had high hopes, but fighting you doesn't seem worth it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri stood up, took the request form, and headed for the door.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let me give you some advice. If you keep running the clan like this, you'll definitely turn into a dictator. You'll kick out anyone who doesn't listen to you, take out your frustrations on others, and pretend to care while pushing your own selfish opinions. People who lack composure all end up the same. See ya."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri left the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha grabbed a glass of water with trembling hands but ended up crushing it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"H-hey, Sasha..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………A dictator, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It felt as if Hijiri had seen right through her—the her who had exiled Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A few days later.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had completed a subjugation request and reported to the adventurer's guild. He then headed to the dismantling site to have the slain magical beast appraised.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Until new information about the Forbidden Six Labyrinths came in, he continued his usual adventurer work.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Damon, the top of the dismantling site and a former adventurer, spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Haise... aren't you gonna challenge that adventurer Hijiri or whatever?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Not this again... I'm so sick of it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Damon laughed, "Hahaha," and tapped the arm of the S-rank magical beast Kilrakamakiri that Haise had hunted.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Kilrakamakiri was a giant insect-type magical beast with scythe-like arms. Its head had been blown to pieces by Haise's anti-material rifle, leaving it in an instant death state.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Damon was in a good mood, as it was rare for Haise to bring in a beast in such good condition.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"She's quite the topic of conversation. About fifty adventurers have challenged Hijiri in the past few days, and all of them were defeated in under ten seconds. Some were even S-rank. What's more surprising is that Hijiri hasn't even used her abilities."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"'Huh'...? You're not interested?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nope. Damon, hurry up with the appraisal. I'm starving."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, alright. It's a hot topic in the guild too, you know? Hijiri's personality might be something else, but she's a real looker. Some idiots with ulterior motives got their groins crushed and were rendered incapacitated."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Scary..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hahaha. Hey, Haise, wanna grab a bite? This thing's only good for its scythes and core, so the rest is just waste."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure. It's been a while since I ate with you, Damon."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise continued his adventurer work, with Hijiri completely out of his mind.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>About twenty days had passed since Hijiri arrived in Heiberg Kingdom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah... so boring."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After soundly defeating the 76th adventurer, there were no more challengers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It seemed the rumors had spread.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>S-rank adventurer Hijiri's strength was the real deal. There was no chance of winning one-on-one. Even teams lost... If they kept losing, it would tarnish their reputation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the end, it came down to this:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>'S-rank adventurer Haise and S-rank adventurer Sasha will take down the arrogant S-rank adventurer Hijiri.'<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It didn't take long for this narrative to spread.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The adventurers of Heiberg Kingdom believed that either Haise or Sasha would defeat Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Furthermore, the question of who was stronger—Haise or Sasha—became a topic of discussion.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Won't you come soon, adventurer Haise... Hehe, I can't wait to fight."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise let out a deep sigh in the tavern district.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haaah..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Rough day, huh, Haise?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist... please do something about this."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had been invited by Geist to the tavern.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was fed up with the rumors.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"People are arguing about who's stronger, me or Sasha, or who'll take down Hijiri... There's even nonsense about me having both of them under my thumb..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Those rumors don't bother you, do they?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"There's a limit, you know... By the way, what's she up to?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh, who?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Hijiri."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"She's staying at the inn the guild recommended. Seems like she's bored lately with no challengers... Probably waiting for you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha's as busy as ever. She's preparing to host a party to conquer the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. I was invited too. What about you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I got an invitation at the inn."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see. Sasha wants to keep it low-key, but the others won't let her."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Haise... why not take on Hijiri's challenge?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That girl's just awkward. She's got too much power... You could help her blow off some steam."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Why don't you do it, Geist?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Can't. I'm no match for her now."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Seriously...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just think about it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Alright."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise said this and grabbed a skewer from the plate that had just been brought out.</p>
