<p>Piasora’s Memory<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>About ten days had passed since the celebration party for conquering the Forbidden Six Labyrinths.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was alone. He was in a plain about half a day's walk from the Heiburg Kingdom, all by himself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Around Haise were specially crafted targets made by carving rocks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Phew...───Hyaaah!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise held Desert Eagles in both hands, firing rapidly. The bullets hit the center of the targets about twenty meters away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He threw the Desert Eagles aside and fired a shotgun at a nearby target.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After emptying the shells, he tossed it away and unleashed a barrage with an M4 rifle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Facing a target about thirty meters away, he fired an RPG-7.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A massive explosion erupted. Haise then aimed an anti-materiel rifle, spotting an apple placed on a rock about a kilometer away through the scope. He pulled the trigger.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The apple shattered into pieces, and Haise finally exhaled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Hmm, I'm getting rusty."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Today, Haise had come alone for shooting practice without taking any requests.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He had already confirmed no one was around. It would be bad if he accidentally hit someone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stored all his guns, took out a chair and table from his item box, and sat down.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While drinking water, he placed a single Desert Eagle on the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ability, [Weapon Master]..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ability.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise's ability was [Weapon Master], allowing him to use weapons from Isekai.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Flipping through an ancient text on the table, he found a passage by Nobunaga, an Isekai person and the author.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Abilities evolve. Whether it's through use or triggered by some event, I don't know. But... I believe abilities respond to the state of one's heart and evolve. Probably, very few ability users can evolve their abilities. To my knowledge, only four: Ibis, Balgan, Maryabel, and Crossfald. I've named the evolution of abilities Awakening. Heh, pretty cool, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was convinced.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha has probably Awaken her ability too... Her aura used to be silver, but now it's gold. And... me too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The 'weapon' that surpassed weapons, used in the Infinire Labyrinth of Delmadrome.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Bunker Buster.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That might have been the trigger, as Haise could now use more weapons.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Of course, he couldn't use them recklessly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But... I'm grateful. There are still four Forbidden Six Labyrinths left. I'll need more power."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A demon man had said the six labyrinths were originally seven, with two in the demon realm and five in the human world.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One of the two in the demon realm had been conquered, and the other was heavily guarded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Of the five in the human world, Haise and Sasha had conquered two.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The Frenzied Magnetic Forest, The Aerial Fortress Drena de Stal, and The Divine Garden of Legend... Ugh, just the names give no information. I'll have to gather info bit by bit and find them."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To not lose to Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As he was about to say it, Haise swallowed his words and downed his water in one go.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was on a vast plot of land on the outskirts of the royal capital with Tycoon and Piasora.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So this will be the new headquarters for the clan...!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hehe... Sasha and I's new home...!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was a blank slate of land.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But wagons carrying materials were coming and going from the capital, and craftsmen had started processing wood and stone. Several merchants had already come to scout, asking Sasha for permission to set up shops here.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"They're quite eager, aren't they? Nothing's even built yet."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But... we should check out the merchants who approached us first. It's only been a few days since we announced that Clan 'Sacred' would establish its new base here. They must have anticipated this place would develop quickly... Top-tier merchants don't waste time. They must be quite skilled to act so decisively."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon had already started negotiations with the merchants.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In his mind, he was mapping out the clan's headquarters and the locations of the team dormitories planned for the surrounding area. Tycoon was also leading the planning for shops and inns.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Sasha spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"By the way, Piasora. Why did you come along? This was supposed to be just me and Tycoon scouting."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I wanted to talk about my request."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, that."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Well, I'll go greet the architects and designers."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon left.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Incidentally, Tycoon now had free access to the royal library. Sasha had 'requested' it, and he was granted permission.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora looked straight at Sasha and said.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, I... love you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........Ah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But we're both women... I know this love can't be fulfilled, and my feelings may never reach you. But... I can't give up."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is my 'request,' Sasha... Just once is enough. Even just for one night... Please love me as if I were your lifelong partner."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Marriage between women was rare among humans.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But in some regions inhabited by elves, there were places where women could marry each other.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her feelings were unwavering and sincere.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora's origins were unknown.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was an orphan from the moment she became aware, living in a small orphanage in the capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora was intelligent and beautiful. When it was discovered she had an ability, it was decided she would go to a monastery instead of the orphanage, and she went without hesitation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But... that monastery was the worst.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, how cute. So cute."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The priest in charge of Piasora's education was───...like a bipedal pig.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At that time, Piasora developed a dislike for men.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This priest was the worst.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He touched her, brought his face close, and breathed his foul breath on her. He forced her to eat with him and made her take care of him... For ten-year-old Piasora, every day was torture.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, one day...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You damn pig!! Stop breathing that stinky breath on me!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-w-what!? Who do you think you are!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hah... You don't know me? The Saintess!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A saintess with the [Saint] ability appeared.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora───...fell in love for the first time.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Soon after, Piasora was transferred to the saintess's care.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Listen, men are smelly creatures. Don't let them look down on you, Piasora."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haha, good girl───...cough, cough!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"S-Saintess!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The saintess... didn't have much time left.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She taught Piasora many things.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Be strong. Don't lose to men. Women can be strong too. It's okay for women to love women.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Women can... love women?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah... If you don't like men, don't force yourself. It's okay for women to love women. I..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Saintess?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hah... I'm not fit to be a saintess."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A year after meeting the saintess... she passed away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Piasora, who was found to have the same ability, was appointed as the new Saintess.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora carried the saintess's teachings in her heart and continued her work at the church.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Healing people, encouraging them, going on pilgrimages───...until one day, at fourteen, she finally met her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Excuse me, Saintess... My childhood friend is injured. I need your help."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was a beautiful silver-haired girl.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora was captivated by her flowing silver hair.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After meeting Sasha, Piasora left the church and became an adventurer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She overcame the strong opposition from those around her with these words:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Shut up!! I've found my... destined partner!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her way of speaking was just like the former saintess, they said.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The church gave up on Piasora and began searching for the next 'Saintess.'<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Are you really okay with that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'm a woman. I can't be with you. I consider you an important comrade... Can you really be satisfied with just a moment of 'love'?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora was silent.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But... she couldn't hold back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora was a woman who loved women more than men.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even if it was Sasha, she couldn't sever these feelings.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ahem. Well, what I mean is, I said I'd grant any request, but... ah, loving you isn't quite it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...giggle"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"P-Piasora?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I must have confused you... Then, let's do this!! Today, we'll take a bath together, get a massage together, and sleep together!! That's my 'request'!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"O-oh. Well... I guess that's fine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Of course, I'll wash and massage you. And you'll wash and massage me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"........U-uh, sure."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For now───...this was enough.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Whether Piasora's feelings would reach Sasha or not, she didn't know.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But... she could keep trying.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora clung to Sasha's arm, showing her affection to the fullest.</p>
