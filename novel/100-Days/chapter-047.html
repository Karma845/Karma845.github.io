<p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths - Sasha's Journey 4<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seventy days had passed since Sasha and her team entered the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At first, the group was lively, but fatigue had gradually taken its toll.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Especially on Piasora.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haa…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They had spent dozens of days traversing similar paths.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Winding, long, horizontal or vertical corridors, fighting appearing beasts, taking breaks, and walking again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This repetitive cycle had lasted seventy days now.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even Piasora no longer had the energy to engage with Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In contrast, Tycoon seemed invigorated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This place lacks levels. It’s just an endless downward path. Where the beasts emerge from or where they live… they seem to have their own ecosystem. Fascinating.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He pulled out the parchment from his item box and continued taking notes as he walked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sketching unfamiliar beasts, jotting down theories—he already had enough notes to fill a book, but Tycoon showed no signs of weariness.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin, while less energetic than before, was still livelier than Piasora.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, don’t you think it’s about time for a break?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s probably midday by now.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha stopped and instructed her team to prepare for a rest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seeing the unusually silent Piasora, Reynold leaned in to whisper to Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, Sasha. Piasora’s stress level is off the charts. I have a suggestion.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hm? What is it?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Whisper whisper”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...I see. That’s a good idea. Let’s do it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll get things ready after we eat.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold enthusiastically began preparing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After lunch, they walked a bit further and began setting up camp.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold, who would usually pitch the tents, instead worked on a spot slightly away from the group, setting up poles and frames for hanging sheets as a screen.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon tilted his head in curiosity.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Reynold, what’s this?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Just help me out.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What’s with the sudden orders? Hmm? Oh, this is…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“The wise one’s magic. I’m counting on you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...I see.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While the women prepared dinner, the two men continued their setup.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After the meal, Piasora, still largely silent, started to head back to the tent.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Sasha stopped her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wait, Piasora. I have a proposal for everyone. Let’s take tomorrow off and spend the whole day resting here.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m in favor.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Me too. I’d like some time to gather my thoughts.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Same here~... I want to sleep like a log for a whole day.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Me as well. Honestly, I’ve had enough…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was decided they’d take the next day as a break.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Reynold spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Alright, I have a gift for the ladies. Follow me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He led them to the area screened by sheets.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There, three barrels stood.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Each barrel was filled with warm water, perfect for a soak.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s a bath. Soak in the hot water and relax your bodies. Just wiping down doesn’t relieve fatigue. Tycoon and I will keep watch, so the three of you can take your time.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...I didn’t know you had it in you to be so considerate.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora looked at Reynold in surprise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He replied awkwardly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah… this barrel bath idea was actually Haise’s. He came up with it for long missions where you might want a bath. Never got to use it back then, though… But I remembered the concept.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...Haise did?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora looked conflicted.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, hearing this for the first time, was surprised.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise thought of it?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. Back then, the item box’s capacity was too small. Carrying barrels just for baths would’ve been a waste, right? This time, we used empty barrels and filled them with Tycoon’s magic, so no problem. Anyway, the water will cool, so hurry up and get in.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold stepped away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Let’s get in!! Having a barrel bath to ourselves feels so luxurious.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin quickly stripped down, poured warm water over herself, washed her face, and plunged into the barrel.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ahhh… This feels soooo good…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She melted into the warmth.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora followed, sinking into the water with a similarly blissful expression.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha joined them, savoring the soothing heat that enveloped her whole body.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ahhh… This is heavenly. Annoyingly, I have to thank Haise for this.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah… Honestly, if he had told us about this back then…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ehh? Sasha, you’d probably have said, ‘That’s unnecessary.’”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“R-Robin, I wouldn’t say that.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You would. Totally would.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The three women enjoyed the barrel baths, chatting and laughing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Even now, it’s all about Haise, huh…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though he kept his distance, their voices reached Reynold.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>None of the talk included him or Tycoon, leaving Reynold feeling a bit lonely.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tycoon, organizing his parchments, spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…As I thought, this dungeon…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hm? Hey, Tycoon, what is it?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Nothing much. Just a few hypotheses about the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“The murals, the corridors, the beasts… None of them resemble anything found outside. This dungeon’s structure is completely different from usual ones, and its level of civilization is far advanced… It’s more accurate to call it an ‘unknown civilization.’”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Unknown civilization?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. Like the strange weapon Haise uses—something incomprehensible.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wait… Are we really exploring a place like that?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s just speculation. Haha, this could turn into fascinating research.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, glad you’re having fun.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ten days later, Sasha and her team emerged from the corridor, arriving at a completely new landscape.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just as Tycoon had predicted, an “unknown civilization” awaited them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Sacred Team’s dungeon exploration had finally reached its halfway point.</p>
