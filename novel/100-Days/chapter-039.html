<p>Challenge<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist summoned Haise to the guild master's room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise downed the tea served to him in one gulp. Pouring a refill, Geist spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You've received a personal request. It's from Ibis, the master of the Yggdrasil clan."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A personal request? The leader of one of the Four Great Clans, asking for me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"She must have heard about you from the recent Stampede battle. So, what will you do? As an S-rank adventurer, you don't have to accept it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're assuming I won't take it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, you seem about ready to leave for something else anyway..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had been preparing for a journey while taking on a subjugation quest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His destination: Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome in the desert nation of Dizara, located to the south.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise invested all his earnings from the Stampede battle into purchasing a new item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This high-end box, capable of halting time and spacious enough to hold a small town, was the most expensive in the world.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside, he stored a vast amount of camping gear and provisions.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The supplies included enough food for two years and camping tools for 200 people, to prepare for any unforeseen equipment failure.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His older item box also held reserves of food, water, and medicine.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With these supplies, Haise could handle an outbreak in a mid-sized town single-handedly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was a stockpile worthy of someone about to challenge one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths—a step toward realizing his dream.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I've mastered over fifty weapons and honed a trump card. I can wield all the weapons through my training. Now, as long as I don't make any mistakes, I can conquer the Forbidden Six Labyrinths."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...You're really going, then?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. I'll clear the labyrinth and become the strongest adventurer."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"All on your own?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There was no hesitation in his reply.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This was the earnest resolve of a boy who had been betrayed by his comrades, abandoned, and risen to power on his own.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist could say no more.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Understood. I'll decline the request for you. Haise, you're certain about this?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Very well."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist nodded, folding the request from Ibis carefully.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What?! He refused it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis, lounging on a sofa in the Yggdrasil Clan's office, groaned as she looked at the 'Declined' request form Geist himself brought.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist explained.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"An S-rank adventurer doesn't usually decline an S-rank request, but... As peers, they're not obligated to accept even a direct request."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh... I was looking forward to seeing Haise after so long."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis folded the paper and tossed it into the trash.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist placed a parchment on Sasha's desk, who was busy at work.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You have a personal request too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You can refuse it if you'd like. I'll handle it if you do."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"....?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Sasha checked the parchment, she was stunned to see the requester’s name—Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After reading the details, her expression stiffened.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's the situation. What will you do?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ll accept."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Understood. I'll process it for you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist pulled out a stamp from his pocket and marked the request as 'Accepted.'<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ibis, still lying on the sofa, tilted her head in curiosity.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm? Something amusing happening?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh... just the complexities of youth."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist chuckled, while Ibis, puzzled, remained sprawled on the sofa.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After breakfast, Haise placed extra gold coins on the inn’s counter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Extend for over a month. I’m heading south. Keep the room as is, and just make sure it gets cleaned."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Got it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The innkeeper, reading a newspaper, put the coins in the jar under the counter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Haise stepped outside, Presea was there waiting.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re heading south, to the Forbidden Six Labyrinths."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As he started walking, Presea followed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise glanced at her briefly, realizing she was determined to come along.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He sighed and spoke while walking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re planning to tag along, aren’t you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Of course."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Hah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Walking side by side through the castle town, Haise continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The destination is Dizara, to the south."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"As an S-rank adventurer, I can apply for access to Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome. But you, as a B-rank, won’t get in even with an application. Well... knowing you, you’d claim to be my partner or sneak in to follow me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Who knows?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t do partners. I’m challenging the labyrinth alone."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry, but this is where we part ways."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the southern gate of Heiberg Kingdom, Sasha stood waiting.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha? Why are you here—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before Presea could finish her question, Sasha struck her neck with a sharp hand motion, knocking her unconscious.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She gently caught Presea as she collapsed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Task complete. Get your reward from the guild."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Haise resumed his steps.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From behind, Sasha called out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Our team, 'Sacred,' will soon head west to tackle the Great Salt Lake of Diloromanz. You may face the Forbidden Six Labyrinth first, but... I won’t lose."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stopped and turned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha gently placed Presea against a nearby tree and approached Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You have your path, and I have mine. You aim to be the strongest adventurer, and I aim for the best team. Together, let’s conquer our challenges."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, can I ask one thing?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Will we ever go back to being childhood friends?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Impossible. I’m no longer the Haise who followed you. I’m Haise the adventurer, and you’re Sasha the adventurer."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re right. But... I want to keep some connection."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha grasped Haise's arm and gave it a light tug.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, as Haise slightly leaned, she kissed his cheek.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise. I guess I don’t want to sever ties with you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The next time we meet, let’s both be adventurers who’ve conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha turned away, carrying Presea, and left.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her ears were flushed red, though Haise figured it was his imagination.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He watched her until she disappeared, then turned forward and walked on,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>lightly brushing his cheek.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A connection, huh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He thought of Sasha, his childhood friend, and chuckled softly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yes, he too... had once been in love with her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Turning once more, he whispered,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"See you, Sasha. Someday..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Half a year later...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise vanished entirely from Heiberg Kingdom.</p>
