<p>Peace<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One month had passed since the Stampede battle... Heiberg Kingdom was finally regaining its everyday life.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seventy thousand magical beasts. Defeating them wasn't the end.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The disposal of their corpses was the most arduous task, but when the King of Heiberg declared, "You may do as you please with the magical beasts' materials," adventurers from other countries flocked in, recovering 80% of the remains.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This left the people of Heiberg speechless.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They had been reluctant to send aid but swarmed the carcasses like vultures when the opportunity arose... Nonetheless, the swift cleanup of the remains was appreciated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The kingdom awarded Sasha, who had been the most instrumental, a fortune.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was more money than one could spend in a lifetime, all of which was allocated to clan operations and rewards for her team members.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Similarly, Haise also received a significant sum. In Haise's case, everything was saved on his adventurer's card.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Although he could now afford a base in the heart of the capital, he remained at his run-down inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Today, as usual, Haise was having breakfast and sipping weak tea at the shabby inn. The only difference was the newspaper in his hands.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The newspaper headline read, "Clan Sacred Nears Joining the Four Great Clans. The Emergence of the Five Great Clans?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise sipped his tea, placed the cup down, and set aside the newspaper.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Standing up, he placed a gold coin on the reception counter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Extend my stay for another month. Breakfast, tea, and newspapers included."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure thing."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The innkeeper dropped the gold coin into the jar at his feet.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Nothing had changed. Even after the Stampede battle, the innkeeper's blunt demeanor remained constant.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But this was the daily life Haise desired.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sudden cheerful service would only feel out of place. The status quo was comforting.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Leaving the inn, he stretched with a big yawn... and Presea popped into view.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good morning."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ignoring her, he started walking, but she followed him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Walking side by side with her was gradually becoming a part of his daily life.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Did you see the newspaper?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha's clan is about to join the Four Great Clans. She was thrilled, saying, 'Even the Divine Tree Ibis-sama has started supporting us'."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"... Are you close with Sasha?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes, close enough to have meals together."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After the Stampede battle, Haise had been startled when Sasha and Presea barged in together. Though he had sent them away then, it was a mystery when they had become friends.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Are you okay with this?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"With what?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Skipping the commendation ceremony, of course."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Heiberg Kingdom had held a ceremony to honor the adventurers who saved the nation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Haise, tired of dealing with formalities, had skipped it, citing injuries as an excuse.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Concerned, the ever-diligent Sasha had come back to the inn to check on him, but he sent her away, finding it bothersome.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I told them, 'Haise just skipped it'."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You... Stop saying unnecessary things."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"They asked, so I answered. Besides, it's the truth."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise arrived at the Adventurers' Guild and stepped inside.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was a good time of day; no one stood before the quest board.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Slaying quests?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. What about you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Herb gathering. The Stampede battle exhausted the medicinal supplies, so the entire capital is facing a shortage."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise took a parchment from the board and approached the reception desk.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea, holding a herb-gathering request, also headed to the counter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright! Huh? Haise-san... You have two here? And one isn't slaying but herb gathering?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just process it without commenting, will you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, okay."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise looked a little awkward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea, at a counter three spots away, overheard everything.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...... Hehe."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Gruff but kind-hearted.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea had truly fallen for Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm, hmm. You've got a good face now, Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Th-thank you very much."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was facing Ibis, the Clan Master of Yggdrasil.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This morning, Ibis had arrived without any guards, catching everyone off guard.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Surprised, Sasha had guided him to a guest room to hear him out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise and you—you youngsters are so fascinating. Just looking at your faces, I can tell... You're like a fruit, shedding its sweetness and starting to ripen. Still plenty of room to grow... Hahaha, truly delightful."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, um..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's enough. Right, I'll bring you up at the next Four Wise Ones Conference."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'll propose adding you to our ranks. Our council of elders could use some youthful energy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, Ibis-sama?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We'll hold the meeting... Hmm, right here. Sasha, the Four Wise Ones are a bunch of stubborn old fogies aside from me. Prepare some good tea and sweets and wait."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I-Ibis-sama!? Um, I... I'm having trouble keeping up with this. Are you saying I'll be...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I've said it many times now. We'll add you to our council."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In other words, it was an entry into the Four Great Clans.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha swallowed hard.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Someday, you might even clear the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. In our youth, we came close, but..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haha, that's a great expression. Seeing you and Haise reminds me of Nobunaga..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, never mind. Now then, it's been ages since I was last in the capital. I should buy plenty of souvenirs. I left without permission, so the headquarters must be in chaos by now. Wahaha!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eh!? W-wait, are you sure you can just leave!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No problem. Come now, Sasha, let's go have some fun!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait, uh, huh? Me too!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Of course. Take off that stiff armor and dress more like a proper lady for once."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Pushed forward insistently, Sasha ended up heading into town with Ibis.</p>
