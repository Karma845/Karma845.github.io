<p>S-Rank Adventurer's Guidance 2<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Unarmed students were assigned to Hijiri, while weapon-wielding students were placed under Haise's instruction.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The unarmed group was mostly male. But the boys who underestimated the petite girl their age were stunned when she caught their full-powered punches with one hand and remarked, "Hey, not bad."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri wasn’t using her [Metal Master] ability as she sparred with the students.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You leave too many openings. I get that you rely on power, but if I can stop you, you won’t stand a chance against magical beasts. Increase your combos and move more precisely!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yes!! Th-thanks!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good response!! Next!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She flashed a bright smile at the student, and the boy turned beet red, shrinking into himself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her appearance was that of an absurdly beautiful girl. Most boys their age probably didn’t have much experience being smiled at by a girl like her. Surprisingly, Hijiri’s guidance was meticulous—enough to shock even Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Haise was...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Cheeeeeriaaaaaaaah!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Whoa."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Dodging the axe-wielding boy’s wild swings, Haise deflected a near-hit by firing a rubber bullet at the side of the axe to alter its trajectory.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This boy had the [Axeman] ability. Relying on it could make anyone somewhat strong.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But only somewhat. Abilities weren’t omnipotent.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After a few minutes of sparring, Haise shot the boy’s fingers with a rubber bullet, forcing him to drop his weapon. Then, he pressed his Desert Eagle against the boy’s forehead.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, that’s enough. First, stop screaming. I get that you’re hyping yourself up, but it’s just tiring you out. Also, you rely too much on your ability. You’ve got a good build—start by training your body more."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yes..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The boy picked up his axe and retreated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next opponent was—Miko, gripping a wooden greatsword.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise-san, please go easy on me!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, yeah... That sword, it’s wooden?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. It’s a bokken made from Kaka wood."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Kaka wood—a lightweight timber used for firewood and sheds. Cheap and sturdy, it was popular among commoners for building simple storage huts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miko’s ability was [Paladin]... On paper, it was a blessed ability.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Here I go!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise swapped magazines and racked the slide.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miko raised her wooden sword and charged straight at him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The power of [Paladin] improved greatsword handling. And there was one more thing...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...So you still can’t wield a shield?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A shield.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Paladins were balanced—greatsword in one hand, shield in the other.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Miko’s small frame could barely manage the wooden greatsword.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haaaaaah!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Swinging the greatsword with both hands, she slashed at him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But even a sharp blade meant nothing without speed. It was clear her physique didn’t match her ability.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What a waste—Haise thought, dodging a few strikes before shooting the sword from her hands.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, that’s enough."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh... I didn’t stand a chance."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise-san?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, no..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise hesitated, unsure what to say.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Frankly, she wasn’t cut out to be an adventurer. While everyone else fought with proper weapons, she brought a wooden sword. Not that she could help it—Miko couldn’t wield steel.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miko nodded. "Ah, I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I get it. My body can’t fully utilize the [Paladin] ability. A [Paladin] who can’t even wield a greatsword or shield is..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise struggled for words.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before he could respond, Miko bowed and walked away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Feeling guilty, Haise shifted his focus to the next opponent.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist’s lesson was incredibly straightforward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Simply put, having an ability doesn’t make you omnipotent. Even if your ability is [Swordsman], picking up a sword will only make you slightly better than an amateur. Abilities only become usable through continuous training and refinement... According to one researcher, abilities have levels."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A student raised their hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist had said, "Ask questions anytime, no restrictions." So they did—and he answered every one patiently.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But levels are considered theoretical..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"True, some say that. But personally, I believe it. There’s a theory that reaching a certain level awakens further potential."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist knew.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For example, Sasha’s battle aura.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Through relentless training with her [Sword Master] ability, Sasha’s aura awakened—first silver, then gold during the Stampede battle. Geist believed mental growth and combat experience triggered it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"There’s no definitive answer. Believe what you will."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Assistant Miina nodded eagerly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Geist continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Now then... Let’s hear from an active guild employee about guild operations."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yes, sir!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Caught off guard, Miina began speaking nervously.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"—...And that’s how we fought and defeated Shoggoth in the deepest part of the Forbidden Six Labyrinth."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha recounted her battle against Shoggoth Noire Ooze—omitting the demonkin, per confidentiality. Geist had said sharing combat experience was fine, so long as details were vague.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The students listened intently... but there was a slight problem.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Um, question! How do I join your clan?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Form a team, build a reputation, then apply."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Too many personal, off-topic questions.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At first, she thought they were mocking her. But... no. They were genuinely interested.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not just her—Presea too. Many boys stared at them with dreamy eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea remained expressionless. Sasha sighed quietly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Any questions about me will be addressed later."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha made up her mind.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>During the afternoon mock battles, she’d drill these boys properly.</p>
