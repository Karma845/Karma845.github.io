<p>Heracles 3<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After parting ways with Geist, Haise was walking back to his inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then... on his way back, he noticed Hijiri emerging from a nearby diner, patting her stomach with a satisfied look.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her ponytail swayed as she stretched and said, "Phew~ I'm stuffed!" before noticing Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignored her and started walking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As expected, Hijiri followed him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't ignore me. So, are you finally ready to fight?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Not rea..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[───Why don’t you let off some steam with her?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......Hmph."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, you're hesitating. Hehe, I’ve heard all sorts of rumors, you know? I’m so bored with no challengers left. Even the reward for defeating me has dropped from 5,000 gold coins to 4,900."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Did you spend the reward money?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, what can I do? I said 5,000 gold coins included living expenses."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait... you spent 100 gold coins in such a short time?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yep. The food in the royal capital is just too good."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri grinned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, she grabbed Haise’s arm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, wanna fight? If you win, you can do whatever you want with me. Well, not that I have any experience with that... but, you know, people say I’m a 'beauty' and that I have a 'great body.'"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If you’re embarrassed, don’t say stuff like that."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh, shut up!! Anyway───... hey, wanna grab a drink? I’m actually pretty fond of alcohol."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For a moment, Haise was intrigued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri aimed to be the strongest. He was a little curious about her reasons.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They headed to Hermine’s bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, welcome. Hehe... you’ve brought a different girl today."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eh, really? Hmm."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don’t get the wrong idea. And Hermine, please don’t say things that could cause misunderstandings..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hehe, my apologies."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hermine smiled enchantingly as Haise and Hijiri took their seats at the counter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A welcome drink was served—sweet apple juice for both.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri cheerfully raised her glass toward Haise, but Haise downed his in one gulp.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmph, you could’ve at least toasted."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I have a question for you. Why do you aim to be the strongest?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, Master, got anything spicy? I want something fizzy for the alcohol!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri wasn’t listening.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise didn’t order anything specific. Hermine’s skill lay in her ability to serve food and drinks that perfectly matched Haise’s mood without him saying a word.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Today, perhaps sensing he’d had a bit to drink, she brought him a low-alcohol cocktail.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So, my reason for aiming to be the strongest? Well, it’s because I’m strong."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Hijiri spoke, a small plate embedded with a magic stone was placed in front of her. Hermine lightly touched it with her finger, and the stone turned red, heating up... a simple hot plate.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A small pot was placed on top, filled with red vegetables, spices, and plenty of meat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As the pot heated, a delicious aroma wafted through the air.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wow, that smells amazing!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s a hot pot dish created by the dwarves. Red chili, red pepper, and oak meat. Once it simmers, it becomes incredibly spicy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Mmm, perfect. I’m definitely coming here again."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, thank you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hermine chuckled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While the pot simmered, Hijiri continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I was a foundling."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You know? The western country of Uron is by the sea, known for its martial arts. I was abandoned in front of the dojo of the Wing School—the weakest and most rundown school in the country... a martial arts school founded by my grandmother."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Wing School?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yep. The concept was 'Women can clench their fists too!' Haha, my grandma was really popular when she was young, and she had a lot of men chasing after her. She went through a lot, so she learned various martial arts to protect herself and created her own style. But people mocked her for being a female founder, and she couldn’t find any disciples or successors... She was popular when she was young, but after turning forty, no one came around anymore. She stayed single her whole life."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So, I was raised as her successor. Man... those were hellish days. Even with my ability, she didn’t go easy on me. She trained me relentlessly, drilling techniques into me. But she always looked so happy, and I enjoyed it too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"My grandma always said, 'It’s okay for women to clench their fists. It’s okay for a woman to surpass men. It’s okay for a woman to be the strongest.' Being the strongest was her dream, and hearing that, it became my dream too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"On the day I registered as an adventurer, my grandma told me, 'If someone picks a fight, don’t back down. If you start a fight, don’t run away no matter what happens.' And then she said, 'I have nothing left to teach you. Do your best.' After hearing that, I went out for my usual training, and when I came back... she was dead. Sitting in her chair, smiling as if she was satisfied, like she had nothing left to teach me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I want to show her. My grandma’s techniques and my abilities. That I won’t lose to any beast or any opponent. That’s why I fight. To aim for the strongest."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, I think it’s ready."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri started eating from the pot, then exclaimed, "H-hot!? Water, water!!" and gulped down a glass of water.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise sipped his cocktail and thought.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The strongest, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was completely different from him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A straightforward, dazzling kind of strength.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, hot hot... So, that’s my reason. Convinced?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So, what do you say? Will you fight me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise set down his glass and looked at Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She had already finished the pot. She turned her whole body toward Haise, wearing a fearless smile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"In the Haiburg Kingdom, you’re the strongest. I had some expectations for that Sasha girl, but she’s no good."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You met Sasha?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yep. She seemed so tense, like she’d burst if you poked her. She’s the type to self-destruct if left alone. Not interested."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Anyway, forget about her."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Fine, I’ll fight you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri’s face lit up with a smile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But only if you fight and defeat Sasha first."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let me tell you something. Sasha is strong... If you underestimate her, you’ll lose."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri tilted her head in confusion.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise turned forward and ordered another cocktail.</p>
