<p>Commencement of Clan Activities<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So, what are the benefits of belonging to a clan?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>First, clans can accept requests directly, bypassing the Adventurer’s Guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When requests go through the guild, 40% of the rewards are paid to the guild, and the remaining 60% goes to the adventurers. The reward listed on the request form is already reduced by the guild’s mediation fee.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, if a clan accepts a request directly, all the rewards belong to the clan.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The clan keeps 20% of the reward, with the rest distributed to the teams within the clan.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha is a famous figure. The number of requests brought in is expected to increase substantially.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When a clan gains renown, both the number of requests and their rewards grow exponentially.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Additionally, the guild sometimes introduces requests that it cannot handle to clans.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In such cases, no mediation fees are deducted, and the entire reward goes to the clan.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Furthermore, materials obtained from extermination requests also belong entirely to the clan.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While many clans hire the guild’s dismantling service, considering the fees and costs, most opt to hire a dismantling professional and build their dismantling facility within their clan grounds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Clan Sacred has a dismantling shed on its premises. While no dismantlers are employed yet, they plan to recruit once the clan’s operations stabilize. (Incidentally, applications from dismantlers have already been submitted.)<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Sacred team’s operations changed after forming the clan.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The number of times they operated as a team decreased.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One member often accompanied adventurers on requests, and their free time was spent training rookies on the premises—resulting in a hectic schedule.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, in particular, was swamped with training and paperwork. Although Tycoon assisted, it still wasn’t enough.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One month after Clan Sacred’s establishment, they hired dismantlers and clerical staff.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This reduced Sasha’s burden, increasing the frequency of training sessions and request acceptances.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A month and a half after its founding…<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Clan Sacred quickly rose to become one of the top five clans in the Heiberg Kingdom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>‘Clan Sacred’s Momentum Unstoppable! The Era of Four Great Clans May Soon Become Five!’ Haise sipped his weak tea as he glanced at the newspaper headline being read by the innkeeper.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Finishing his tea, he placed a few gold coins on the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Extend my stay for another month. Breakfast and tea included.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Sure.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The innkeeper glanced briefly at Haise, speaking without lowering the paper.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise left the inn and headed for the Adventurer’s Guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the guild, which had quieted after the morning rush, the members of Team Thousand, now ranked D, were present.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“All right, team, today’s request is to gather Kuchinashi Grass. There are rumors of elite goblins in the area. Let’s check our gear before heading out.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Got it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Understood.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Okay!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Roland’s command was met with firm nods from the other three.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The four who once screamed at the sight of a goblin’s severed head were no more. They had grown, ascending the ranks as adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As they passed Haise, they bowed their heads respectfully.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, watching the request board,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise, may I have a word?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Whoa… Geist, please don’t sneak up on me like that.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ha! Sorry about that. But this is important.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…I’ve got a bad feeling.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They moved to the Guild Master’s office, where Geist sat across from Haise on the sofa.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Listen calmly… There are signs of a stampede.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That A-rank dungeon you investigated previously… People have been disappearing there, and the guild has decided to seal it off.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“S-sealed off? But there weren’t any particularly strong monsters there.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“We’re not sure. For unknown reasons, B-rated or higher monsters have been multiplying and flooding the upper floors. It’s likely a stampede is imminent.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No way…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Its location suggests the stampede might head toward the capital.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before he realized it, Haise had leaned forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What’s the cause?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s unclear. Monsters appeared so suddenly that there was no time to investigate. But… this is just my personal opinion—Sasha’s defeat of that demon might be related.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“A demon…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise, a stampede is inevitable. When it happens… we’ll need your strength.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Of course. I’ll protect everyone.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Good. We’ll hold a strategy meeting in a few days. Clans based in the capital and S-rank adventurers will be summoned. The Heiberg royal family is aware of the situation, but keep this confidential until the meeting. Understood?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Uh…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I haven’t told Sasha yet. She’s exhausted from establishing the clan. I want her to focus on the clan until the meeting.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Understood.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stood, followed by Geist, who opened the door.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise, do you have experience with stampedes?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…No.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Not surprising. The last stampede occurred thirty years ago when a C-rank dungeon collapsed.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“A C-rank…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist gripped the doorknob tightly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crack—a small fissure appeared.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Back then, three towns and seven villages around the Heiberg Kingdom were wiped out.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“!? That was a… C-rank dungeon?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes. The violence of sheer ‘numbers’ overwhelms everything. If an A-rank dungeon stampede occurs… Heiberg’s forces alone may not be able to protect the capital.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise swallowed hard.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He imagined the capital overrun by monsters,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>its people trampled underfoot.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The guild, the clan home, restaurants, inns—everything destroyed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise, be ready.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Understood.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise left the guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He no longer felt like accepting a request.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Outside the guild, Presea was waiting.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise, are you taking a request?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Nothing.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You’re acting strange.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ignoring her, Haise began walking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea naturally fell into step beside him, and Haise didn’t push her away.</p>
