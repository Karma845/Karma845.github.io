<p>Stampede Battle 4<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise retreated to the frontmost line.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The wording was odd, but as he moved back to the frontline squad, he shouted to everyone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Here they come!! Everyone, get ready!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise sheathed his shotgun at his waist, gripped a grenade launcher in his right hand, and an assault rifle in his left, carried an RPG-7 Rocket Launcher on his back, and strapped three Desert Eagles to his belt.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A concerned voice called out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise!! Are you hurt?!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Shaking off Reynold, she rushed to Haise’s side, peering into his face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, startled, reflexively leaned back, then quickly composed his expression.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I-I'm fine!! Just get ready; they’re coming!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“R-Right. Let’s go, Reynold!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From the rear, magic and arrows flew.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The beasts seemed to be losing momentum, tripping over fallen bodies or maneuvering awkwardly to avoid them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It appeared that about ten thousand had been reduced by the barrage of spells.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The frontline squad gripped their weapons, raising fierce battle cries.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Frontline squad!! Your turn is coming—let’s count on you!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>An eagle circling above screamed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Adventurers stationed at the frontline placed their hands on the ground in unison.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“[Barrier Deployment]!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They manipulated the earth to erect barriers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The beasts charged at the earthen walls deployed by the barrier-users.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hold strong, everyone!! Now then—let’s show my son what a fighting mother can do!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The first to leap forward wasn’t Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was second. Leading the charge was Battle Mother, Mamacha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In her hands was a Great Battle Axe over five meters in diameter and three meters wide.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Despite being about Haise’s height, Mamacha carried the axe with one hand and sprinted with unmatched agility.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Rrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Mamacha roared, her body began to grow giant.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Through her Gigantification ability, Mamacha grew over ten meters tall.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She swung the massive axe effortlessly with one hand, mowing down over fifty beasts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Alright, alright!! Let’s wrap this up before dinner—move it, people!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“"Yes, Mama!!"”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The adventurers of Mamacha’s clan sprang into action.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The barriers shattered, and beasts poured through.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly, the whip of S-rank adventurer Jonathan extended hundreds of meters, entangling over thirty beasts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, baby… let’s dance!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The whip vibrated, making the beasts explode.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Using his [Vibration] ability and the five-hundred-meter-long [Thousand Whip], Jonathan launched his attack.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The S-rank adventurer Love and Love, Jonathan spoke to his clan.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Love, baby, love. Show the cuties how it’s done!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“"Yes, Love!!"”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jonathan’s clan charged into the fray.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Next, the clan led by S-rank adventurer Chaos began to move.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Heh, not bad. But… my clan’s taking the most kills.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Chaos’s gaze shifted to Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For a sixteen-year-old, her physique was impressive. Ample chest, slender waist—she was exactly his type.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He imagined her fierce expression melting in bed, which thrilled him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Grinning, Chaos grabbed throwing knives from his belt and hurled them at the beasts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“With the gold we earn, I’ll indulge in the finest women. Do it, boys!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“"You got it, boss!!"”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The knives moved autonomously, piercing the beasts’ vital points and returning to Chaos.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Using his [Venom] ability, which secreted a toxic fluid, Chaos controlled the trajectory of the poisoned blades to kill the beasts. His gaze fell on the purple knife at his waist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“There’s still a chance. Isn’t there… Sasha?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha wrapped herself in Battle Aura and imbued it into her sword, slicing through beasts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold blocked a beast approaching from behind her. The moment he parried, an arrow struck the beast’s head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Recognizing it as Robin’s arrow, Reynold gave a thumbs-up in thanks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha!! You okay?!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah!! Don’t overdo it yourself!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Got it!! Damn it, though—there are so many of them!! Too many beasts are breaking through the barrier!! Even with S-rank adventurers, we might not hold!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold was right.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The beasts slain so far barely exceeded twenty thousand—less than half.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The injured were piling up, and the healers stationed in the rear were overwhelmed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Fight, heal, return to the front, get injured, retreat—it was an endless cycle until the beasts were eradicated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It would likely take all day.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yet, less than an hour had passed. Even S-rank adventurers were human—they couldn’t keep this pace forever.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Sasha kept fighting.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“We just have to keep fighting, fight and slay the beasts—"Sasha!!"─!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A goblin appeared behind Sasha, knocking her down and trying to strip her armor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Damn it, let go!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Damn it, Sasha!! Ah, crap!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>An ogre blocked Reynold’s way.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He raised his shield to defend himself, unable to help Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Goblins swarmed Sasha, tearing off her armor and ripping her clothes, on the verge of violating her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Stop… Stop it… STOP IT!!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Gyaa, gyagyaa?!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly, the goblins were sent flying.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, clad in jet-black attire, kicked them away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He fired his Desert Eagle, killing the goblins with precise headshots.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The goblins shifted their focus to Haise, but he blasted them at close range with a shotgun, sending their innards scattering.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The rest were mowed down with an assault rifle, finally ending the threat to Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha!! Are you hurt?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise… ugh, aah!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha threw herself into Haise’s arms.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Surprised for a moment, Haise gently embraced her, patting her head with awkward kindness.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The gesture soothed Sasha’s heart… but then Haise pulled away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha. There are still too many of them. Go fix your gear and come back.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“W-What?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah, uh, here.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise took off his coat and draped it over Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That’s when Sasha realized—her clothes were torn, leaving her upper body almost bare.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her large, ample chest was exposed right before Haise. Blushing furiously, she accepted the coat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise looked at Sasha directly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“This fight is far from over. We need your strength. Go get yourself together and return. I’ll hold the line until then.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Our dream doesn’t end here. Let’s finish this battle and move on.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Yeah!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Reynold, take Sasha!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Got it!! Damn it… there’s barely a chance, is there?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold muttered something, but Haise didn’t hear.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He twirled the Desert Eagles in his hands, aimed, and opened fire.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha retrieved her armor and sprinted toward the rear, where Piasora waited.</p>
