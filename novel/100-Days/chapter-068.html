<p>Geist's Fist<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry, Haise. For dragging you along on an old man's stroll."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No, it's fine..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One day.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was invited by Geist and came to the southern forest on the outskirts of the royal capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As usual, when he went to the guild, Geist said, "Care to join me for a bit?" so he thought it was just a walk... but somehow, they ended up in a forest full of dangerous magical beasts, fully equipped.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Um, Geist-san. This forest... it's my first time here, but isn't this a danger zone?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Indeed. Actually, a new dungeon was discovered here. I thought about leaving the investigation to a younger team, but I've been lacking exercise lately. So I took it on myself."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You took it on yourself...? But Geist-san, didn't you retire?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Officially, yes. But I haven't returned my adventurer card. Besides the one for guild masters, here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist showed his S-rank adventurer card.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise saw Geist in full equipment for the first time in a while.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's been a while since I've seen you in full gear, Geist-san."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Has it? Oh, there she is. Hey!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And... the person Geist called out to was none other than Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Both Haise and Sasha were surprised.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist-san, um... why is Haise here? The request was to investigate the dungeon that appeared in this forest, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, that's part of it. But... I also wanted to see how my disciples have grown after all this time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""…………""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Sasha exchanged glances.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>These two were Geist's last disciples.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise asked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Are you alone?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. It was a direct request from Geist-san... with the condition that I come alone. I thought it might be something important, so I accepted without question..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hahaha. Well then, let's go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist walked past Haise and Sasha and started moving.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Age 59. His weapon is his fist, and he is known as the strongest hand-to-hand combatant with the abilities of a Fighting Master. His alias is 'Combat'... though he doesn't look it, being a gentle elderly man.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With Geist leading, Haise and Sasha walked side by side.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Feels nostalgic."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""Huh？""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I used to take you two through danger zones like this often."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Those times were terrifying."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I agree."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist laughed, "Hahaha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then, they arrived.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A dungeon in the forest, resembling ancient ruins. It looked like an altar made by some tribe, with stairs leading underground.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well then, Haise, Sasha. How about some real combat training for the first time in a while?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""Yes！！""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The two instinctively replied to Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They couldn't help but recall their days as disciples and exchanged glances. Then, Sasha laughed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Pfft... Haha, you're still stuck in the disciple mindset, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I'm going ahead."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, wait!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise went in first, followed by Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist smiled nostalgically and took up the rear.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As they descended the stairs───they found themselves in a vast space.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A semicircular dome, with a giant bull-like monster in the center of the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm. A Minocentaur... extermination rank B. Seems like this is a floor-clearing type dungeon."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Floor-clearing type dungeons.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Unlike mazelike dungeons, these have a dungeon boss on each floor, and you can proceed to the next floor by defeating it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Dungeons of this type are generally close to the lowest floor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Currently, the maximum number of floors in a floor-clearing dungeon is twenty.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well then, Haise, Sasha. Who's going?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""Well...""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Both spoke at the same time. Then, they looked at each other.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seeing this, Geist laughed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then, I'll go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""Huh？""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist casually approached the Minocentaur.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Minocentaur stood up and let out a roar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[BUOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A monster with axes in both hands, the upper body of a bull, and the lower body of a horse.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A formidable foe with the agility of a horse and the strength of a bull.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise drew his Desert Eagle, and Sasha unsheathed her sword. But... Geist stopped them with a hand gesture.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No need to interfere. Well then, let's get some exercise after so long."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist cracked his neck and gently extended his right hand forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Sasha shivered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's amazing..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. His stance is flawless..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[BUOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Minocentaur raised its front legs to intimidate and charged at Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist's right hand swayed slightly, and he bent his body just a little, bringing his left hand to his chest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There was no show of strength or flashiness.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If he wanted to, he could probably crush it with brute force.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Geist didn't do that.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As the Minocentaur charged, Geist lightly jumped───and slipped into its chest, placing his right hand on its chest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"[Underworld Fist]"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His right hand lightly pressed against the chest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, the force rippled through the Minocentaur's body, causing its back to expand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"[Splintered to Dust]"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then───Boom!! Its back exploded, and its innards were blown out backward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist landed without a sound. The Minocentaur was instantly killed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm... I'm still a bit rusty."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""...Where？""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist opened and closed his right hand, looking slightly dissatisfied.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Sasha were left in awe of Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After reaching the tenth floor, Geist nodded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is enough for today. Let's head back."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? But we're only at the tenth floor..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's fine. Investigating too much would take the fun out of it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is that how it works?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Speaking of which, you've only been taking extermination requests, haven't you? You hardly ever take investigation requests."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha pouted a little. But Haise ignored her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist wiped his fist with a handkerchief. In the end, Geist had defeated every monster up to this point by himself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist-san. You're really strong... I was amazed."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hahaha. I've been stuck doing desk work lately, so I've gotten a bit rusty. But I think I'm getting back into shape."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Um, why did you bring me and Haise along? Haise is one thing, but you even used your authority as the guild master to get me here..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha is a clan master, but she's still an adventurer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even as a clan master, if the guild master gives a direct order, she has to comply unless there's a very good reason not to.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist replied.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's nothing major. I just wanted to see you and Haise walking side by side again after so long."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Like the old days... well, that's probably impossible now. But... I can still see it. You and Haise walking side by side, weapons in hand, fighting goblins like it was just yesterday..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist-san..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haha... well, just an old man's ramblings. Let's head back."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""…………""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist started walking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After exiting the dungeon, Haise said to Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, remember? What we used to do after training outside?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Yeah, I remember. Geist-san used to take us to a restaurant, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Hey, why don't we go there again? It's been a while."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Is that okay?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, just this once. It's not like Geist-san is here, but... it's nostalgic, you know?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Heh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha smiled and took Geist's arm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist-san, I'm hungry. Haise said he'd treat us, so why don't we eat at 'that place' for old times' sake?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait, what? I never said I'd treat you!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You were the one who brought it up, right? Hmph, a man should take responsibility for his words."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh... Sasha, you've gotten way too mean."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh, I'll take that as a compliment."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Heh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise walked beside Geist, glaring at Sasha in protest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Sasha, using Geist's arm as a shield, giggled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This kind of thing happened often in the past.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even if their paths diverged, they were still the same at heart.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Sasha. Geist's last two disciples, for just this moment, acted like children again, bringing a smile to Geist's face.</p>
