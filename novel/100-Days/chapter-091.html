<p>To the Holy Cross Adramelech Theocracy<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Now, are you ready?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>""Yes""<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yep"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ooh!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haaaii!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Responding to Geist's confirmation were Haise, Sasha, Presea, Hijiri, and Mina.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their destination is the 'Holy Cross Adramelech Theocracy' to the north. They are heading there as temporary instructors for the adventurer training academy, Adramelech Adventurer School.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, Haise seems somewhat reluctant as he speaks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Um, Geist-san?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What is it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I get Sasha and Hijiri, but... why are Presea and Mina coming?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yes, for some reason, the two of them were also joining.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Mina grabs Haise's arm and says:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ufufu. That's because~..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I was hired as an assistant for Sasha and Hijiri. It’s tough to handle the classes alone, you know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Mina is my assistant. I have lectures on the adventurer guild too, so having a guild staff member like Mina will be helpful."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ahhh!? I was gonna say that!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise pulls his arm away from Mina and replies with a sigh.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...How long will it take to reach the Holy Cross Adramelech Theocracy?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"About fifteen days by carriage. We’ll pass through several towns along the way."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Um"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was about to ask if he could go ahead alone. But Geist smiles, placing a hand on Haise's shoulder with a light pat... For some reason, it felt like a weight of several dozen kilograms had been placed on him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, let’s head out in the guild carriage. Everyone, get in."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Boarding the adventurer guild’s carriage, Haise and the others set off toward the north.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Kuhaa~"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, don’t lean on me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The carriage is a large, covered one, pulled by two horses, making the interior spacious.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, Hijiri, who fell asleep shortly after departure, began using Haise's shoulder as a pillow, sleeping soundly. Haise pushes Hijiri away and lays her down on a cushion to sleep.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sitting across from each other, Sasha is seated in front.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When their eyes meet, Sasha speaks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Um, want to come over here?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No, I’m fine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It had been years since Haise last rode in the same carriage as Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea is floating several water droplets on her fingertip, shaping them into small fish and birds, amusing herself by making them float around. Mina watches in awe.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wow, that’s amazing!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just killing time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, hey, Presea, can you make other things too?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure. Any requests?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then make a goblin!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Well, alright."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea and Mina are getting along well.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise steps out of the carriage and sits next to Geist, who is holding the reins.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Phew..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What’s wrong, tired already?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No... just feeling a bit uncomfortable."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh, endure it for fifteen days. Besides, we’ll be staying in towns along the way, not just camping."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haah... Um, Geist-san. What exactly do we do as temporary instructors? I’d like to know properly."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You and Sasha will handle mock combat training for adventurers and lectures on the Forbidden Six Labyrinths."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Mock combat?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Fighting using abilities. Don’t let your guard down, though. There have been cases where even S-rank adventurers were defeated. Even though they’re still trainees, they’re at least as strong as B-rank adventurers."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haah... Well, I’ll make sure not to kill them."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I’m a bit worried, though."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don’t worry. For example..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise pulls out an M60 Revolver and fires at a nearby tree.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bang! A light sound echoes, and a black lump hits the tree, falling off.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"These are rubber bullets for riot control. They hurt but won’t kill. For mock battles, I’ll use non-lethal ammunition like this, so don’t worry."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see. That’s quite convenient."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I think so too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise spins the revolver on his finger.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That day, they decided to camp.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The camping gear is prepared in each of their item boxes, so they set up the tents in a friendly manner... or so it should have been.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Except for Mina, the adventurers quickly set up their own tents. Haise, in particular, has the largest capacity item box in the royal capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise speaks to Geist loud enough for everyone to hear.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What about meals? Should we prepare something...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm, well, the guild’s item box has some ingredients prepared, but..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist glances at the female members.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Um, cooking is, uh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I prefer eating out."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Meat, let’s grill meat!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, I’m not good at cooking."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist sighs and turns to Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, can I ask you to handle it? Of course, I’ll pay."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure. I kinda expected this."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise takes out a cooking table and utensils from his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He also takes out stones for a stove, firewood, and asks Geist to prepare the rest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He boils water, cuts ingredients, seasons them, grills the meat, lightly toasts bread, and sandwiches cheese and vegetables.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The result is sandwiches and soup.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Done. Geist-san, is this okay?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Perfect. Haha, you’ve improved, Haise. You’re quite skilled now."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, I kinda like cooking... Hey, what’s with you guys?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, Presea, Hijiri, and Mina are all staring at Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina nods enthusiastically and grabs Haise’s arm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A man who can cook is so cool!! Ufufu, maybe I’ll become your wife, Haise-san~?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If you’re not eating, I’ll take it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I-I’m eating!! Muuu, Haise-san, you’re so uninterested in me!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They start eating immediately.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha takes a bite of the sandwich and smiles.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Mmm, delicious... as expected of Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Thanks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...You’re really good at cooking."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Seconds!! Mmm~ I might want to eat Haise’s cooking every day."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Here, have some soup too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, I want seconds too!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Here, have some of mine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Haha, you’re such a caretaker, Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"G-Geist-san... give me a break."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Geist said, Haise is indeed a caretaker.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On the first day, they decided to take turns keeping watch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By drawing lots, the first shift went to Haise and Hijiri, followed by Sasha and Presea, and finally Geist. Mina, being a non-combatant, was excluded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Grabbing a soot-covered pot warming by the fire, Haise pours some into a cup and hands it to Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, thanks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sitting across from Hijiri, she suddenly moves next to him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Haise. What do we do as temporary instructors?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Same question as me... You’ll probably just have to fight the students at AdAd."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That sounds awesome!! Oh, but they’re kids, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"They’re kids, but... they’re our age. Plus, they’ve been using their abilities since they were twelve and have plenty of combat experience, so don’t treat them like ordinary adventurers, Geist said."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Really? Well, whatever. After that, it’s the Graveyard of Ruin, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...You’re going too?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Of course. Where there’s strong people, I’ll be there!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, keep it down."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri giggles while drinking her tea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Phew~... Hey, Haise. When I get stronger, I’ll fight Sasha and win completely this time... then next, I’ll fight you... okay?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure. If you win."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Mmm..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thud. Hijiri rests her head on Haise’s shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even after sleeping so much in the carriage, she’s still sleepy... Haise is amazed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Hijiri seems comfortable.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Tch."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reluctantly, Haise decides to let Hijiri sleep for just five minutes, staying still and silent.</p>
