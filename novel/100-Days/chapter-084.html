<p>Sasha's Walk<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A few days after the party that conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths had disbanded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha read a letter that had arrived from the royal family, folded it neatly, and placed it in her desk drawer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The contents were a map related to the Aerial Fortress Drena de Stal. It was information about the Graveyard of Ruin mentioned on that map.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha had immediately requested an audience with the king after conquering the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, asking if there was any information about the remaining labyrinths. She hadn’t expected to receive a clue about the next labyrinth so soon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But now was the growth period for her clan. She had already been away for over half a year, and work had piled up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She had hired more staff to handle the workload, and the clan's new headquarters, currently under construction in the outskirts of the royal capital, was nearing completion.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even with the new information, she couldn’t just leave immediately.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then───…… the king had said this:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[If you plan to challenge the Graveyard of Ruin, take Haise with you. That place is, in a way, more dangerous than the Forbidden Six Labyrinths.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She had heard rumors about it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Graveyard of Ruin. One of the most difficult dungeons known, excluding the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. A place where high-ranking magical beasts of SS rank and above roam freely, attacking without respite.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was also called the Graveyard of Magical Beasts. It was said that the souls of all deceased magical beasts gather there.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha let out a small sigh and stretched.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m no good. Maybe I’ve been a little too tense…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Today was a workday, but tomorrow was a day off.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She didn’t have time to rest, but her comrades had told her to "take a break no matter what," and even her clan members had said, "Sasha, you’re working too much. If you keep working, the rest of us can’t rest either." So, Sasha had decided to take a break.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She lightly massaged her forehead and reached for the pile of documents.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next day.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For the first time in a while, Sasha changed into casual clothes and headed to the royal capital without her sword.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At first, she thought, "I don’t have time to rest," but once she decided to take a break, Sasha was determined to make the most of it. For today, she would walk through the town not as an adventurer, but as a seventeen-year-old girl.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her only belongings were a bag with her wallet.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Dressed in a long skirt and simple shirt chosen by Piasola, she strolled leisurely through the royal capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Maybe I’ll go to the old bookstore…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The town around the castle was bustling with life.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Adventurers passing by, merchants riding in carriages, burly men carrying large wooden crates.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The royal capital looked quite different when viewed through the eyes of an adventurer compared to when seen through the eyes of someone enjoying a day off.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"First, breakfast───… huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"My, my."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What a coincidence.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She must be in casual clothes too, as she wasn’t carrying her bow or wearing any equipment.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She tilted her head and spoke to Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"How rare to see you in casual clothes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Today’s a day off. It’s rare to see you in casual clothes too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. I’m on a date with Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wha…!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just kidding. Hehe, when Haise is involved, you really act like a normal girl. I got to see a good side of you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-well… teasing people isn’t nice, you know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry about that. Hmm… as an apology, I’ll treat you to breakfast. How about that café over there?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea started walking before waiting for an answer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha hurriedly followed her to the small café Presea had chosen.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was still early in the morning, and only a few customers were inside. Presea sat at a window seat for two and ordered, "Two morning sets, please." Sasha finally took her seat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You seem familiar with this place."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is where I usually have breakfast."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is that so… yeah, it’s a nice little café."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Right."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, the morning sets arrived.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Toast, bacon and eggs, salad, and soup. It was a simple breakfast set, but it was filled with Sasha’s favorite things, and she couldn’t help but smile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The two began eating right away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"By the way, what are your plans for today?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I was thinking of going to the old bookstore. What about you, Presea?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Same here. On my days off, I usually go to the old bookstore or the herb garden."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Herb garden?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. There’s a farm on the outskirts, and I’ve rented a corner of it. I grow medicinal herbs and tea leaves there."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m an elf, after all. I’m good with plants. Plus, my sister sends me seeds and herbs. They’re all things that can be turned into medicine if grown properly."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Are you jealous? By the way, what are your hobbies?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"H-hobbies? Uh… reading, training."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Somehow, Sasha felt embarrassed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When asked about her hobbies, all she could come up with was reading and training. It didn’t sound like the hobbies of a seventeen-year-old girl.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Looking out the window, she saw girls her age wearing pretty accessories and hats, out on dates with boys.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Do you want to go out with Haise?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh!? W-why does Haise keep coming up!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Or maybe Reynold? Tycoon? Or perhaps Prince Cress?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-what are you trying to say…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don’t you have someone you like? I want to have Haise’s child, though."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-w-what!? A c-child!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just kidding."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha turned bright red and gulped down the water on the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Still too early for you, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I-I’m not a child!! I’m seventeen, a proper adult!! How old are you, anyway!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Seventeen. Hehe, we’re the same age."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"~~~~!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though Sasha was invincible in battle, it seemed she was no match for Presea when it came to banter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Presea asked, "Want to come to the herb garden with me?" Sasha decided to tag along.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The old bookstore was nice, but she felt like she wanted a "new hobby," and thought visiting the herb garden might be a good start.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After walking a short distance from the west gate of Hybelk Kingdom, they came across a farm surrounded by iron fences.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea showed her permit at the entrance, and the gate opened to let them in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Pretty strict security…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s because this area is prone to magical beast appearances. The iron fences are for protection, and there are adventurers on guard too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───…Oh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Once inside, the scent of flowers and herbs filled the air.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha wasn’t familiar with flowers, but she could tell the smell was sweet and pleasant.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As they walked, Presea explained.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is a farm where they grow flowers, vegetables, and herbs. Over there is the tree area."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"They grow trees too?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. Some of them bear fruit."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"And here’s my plot."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was a plot of land surrounded by wooden fences.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha didn’t understand much of it, but there were sheets covering some areas and structures made of iron rods and transparent cloth that looked like little houses.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The plot itself was quite large.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I-isn’t this too big…? It’s even larger than the training grounds at the Sacred clan’s home. If you’re managing this all by yourself, how do you even have time to be an adventurer…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Not really. I manage it using my abilities."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea pointed her hand toward the plot.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"[Water]."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A large orb of water appeared in front of Presea, floating above the plot.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Presea snapped her fingers, the orb sprayed water like a shower.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see… so you’re using your abilities instead of manual labor."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Having abilities that are useful outside of combat is a big help."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She also commanded earth spirits to pull out weeds and wind spirits to spread fertilizer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea picked a few herbs and placed them in a small bottle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Here, this is for you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eh…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The bottle contained freshly picked red herbs.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is a red tea leaf unique to Yggdra. You can brew it as is without drying it, but drying it adds depth to the flavor. Try experimenting with it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A-are you sure?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. It’s a thank-you for coming with me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea smiled warmly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha hugged the bottle to her chest and said,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Th-thank you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re welcome. Oh… I’m getting hungry. Shall we go get lunch?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure. I’ll treat you. I know a good yakiniku place."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Well, alright."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hearing "yakiniku," Presea muttered, "That’s so like you, Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At night, Sasha returned to her room and brewed the tea leaves Presea had given her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As she poured the tea into a cup, it filled with a red liquid. The aroma was sweet, and when she tasted it, it was indeed sweet.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…It’s delicious."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What would it taste like if it were dried?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Come to think of it, Tycoon was quite knowledgeable about tea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thinking about such things, Sasha enjoyed her nighttime tea alone.</p>
