<p>Heading East<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Everlasting Moon Flower.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A rare medicinal herb, one of the key ingredients in elixirs, is found only atop the sacred peak of Mount Gagazia.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, who had been commissioned by the royal family of Heiberg, was preparing in his shabby inn room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The adjacent room, where Haise stayed, housed his travel supplies.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sleeping bag, tent, ancient manuscripts, clothes, cooking gear, utensils, spices… Food? Guess I’ll buy some in town.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It had been a while since his last long journey, and it was his first time heading east.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The region was home to the forest nation of Yggdrasil, where Mount Gagazia was under the management of Yggdrasil’s royal family.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With the letter of introduction from the Heiberg Kingdom, both entry and the investigation were permitted.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise packed all his belongings into a storage ring, known as an item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Truly convenient.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Magic Tools.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Some, infused with magical properties, could be purchased for mere copper coins, while others, like Haise’s item box, cost thousands of gold.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His item box was top-tier, capable of halting time for its contents.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even boiling water stored inside would remain hot and bubbling a year later.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“….”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Back when he was part of Sasha’s team, affording an expensive item box like this was unthinkable.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And even if he could, buying one would have instantly rendered his role as the team’s porter redundant.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Alright, all set. Time to shop, stop by the guild, and then head out.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stepped out of the room and spoke to the middle-aged man reading a newspaper at the front desk.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll be away for a while, but keep the room as is. Here’s an extra month’s payment.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He handed over gold for two rooms.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The man glanced sharply at Haise before pocketing the coins with a small nod.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Thanks.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though quiet, the man’s words reached Haise clearly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Saying nothing more, Haise left the inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…I’ll take a hundred of those skewers.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“A hundred!? R-right away! Just wait a bit!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was shopping in a street filled with eateries in the castle town.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His focus was on food supplies. He bought water by the barrel and stored freshly grilled skewers into his item box the moment they were ready.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The shopkeeper, recognizing the time-freezing nature of Haise’s item box and his status as an S-rank adventurer with money to spare, grilled with extra care.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though Haise ordered a hundred, the shopkeeper grilled one hundred and ten.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Here, ten extra! Come back again!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Thanks.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Leaving a gold coin, Haise walked away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The shopkeeper bowed profusely.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though there should have been change, Haise couldn’t be bothered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Since awakening his abilities and hunting high-level magical beasts, money was no longer a concern.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Once, he had been overjoyed at the thought of upgrading his bronze sword to an iron one.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Now, after going solo and tackling powerful beasts, wealth had lost its allure.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Next, bread… some fruit and vegetables, too.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He continued shopping, placing items into his item box as he went.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Once done, he made his way to the adventurers' guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the reception desk, a nervous junior receptionist greeted him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Um, um, the guild master is in a meeting with Sasha right now.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Got it. I’ll wait.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Y-yes, sir!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With time to spare, Haise checked the quest board.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Oh, a B-rank extermination quest. Crimson Kong… Wait, it’s in the west? Wrong direction…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While scanning the quests, a pleasant aroma wafted by.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Glancing to his side, he noticed someone standing there.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Nothing.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was a slender girl.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She had short, emerald-green hair, and her delicate shirt, breastplate, mini-skirt, and sandals revealed long, elegant legs.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But her ears stood out the most—they were long. She was an elf.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A decorated bow rested on her back, with a quiver at her waist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though Haise hadn’t been staring, the girl remarked,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Is an elf such a rare sight for you?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, yeah. Elves are native to the forest nation of Yggdrasil in the east. You don’t see them much here in the central Heiberg Kingdom.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“True. I just arrived today.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Today?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve traveled west and finally made it to the central region. I’m an adventurer, by the way.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She pulled an adventurer card from inside her breastplate. It displayed a B-rank.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“B-rank, huh? Any party members?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“None. I’m fine on my own.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“….”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Adventurers typically worked in teams to overcome individual limitations.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yet, Haise saw something familiar in her independent demeanor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What about you?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Me? I’m solo.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see. By the way, I showed you mine…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Oh, right.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Adventurer cards served as ID, and it was customary to show yours if the other party did.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise retrieved his card from his item box and showed it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“S-rank adventurer.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The girl appeared slightly surprised but quickly masked her expression.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Unusual. An S-rank adventurer with no team.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ve heard that before. Not so much these days.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A brief silence fell. After about thirty seconds, the girl spoke again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Are you taking on a quest?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. A royal commission. Heading east… but that’s as much as I can say.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“East? You’re heading east?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah. That’s all I can say.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Understood.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was surprisingly easy to talk to.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But that was all.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise! The guild master is free now!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Don’t call the guild master like he’s an object!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ouch! That hurt!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The junior receptionist was scolded with a smack.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Raising a hand lightly, Haise said, “Later.”, and left.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…East.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The girl murmured softly, watching Haise’s back as he walked away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The guild master’s office was on the third floor of the guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise climbed the stairs, arriving just as Sasha and her party exited.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“….”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“….”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their eyes met.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha’s gaze no longer wavered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Kept you waiting.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No matter. Is this about the royal commission?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Indeed! Too bad for you; if you wanted to bring me along, it’s too late now!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Myuane, the second princess, puffed her chest—though it was a flat plain.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignored her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then her brother, Cress, stepped forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Forgive my sister’s rudeness. I’m Cress. A pleasure to meet you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Yes, Your Highness.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Drop the formalities. Just call me Cress. We’re all adventurers now.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Understood.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Let’s get going! Right, Sasha?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Agreed.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Piasora clung to Sasha with a playful voice, Sasha turned to Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well then, Haise. We’ll take our leave.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You’re heading east, right? Be careful.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I will.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha seemed like a different person from their party days—stronger and resolved.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For some reason, Haise found this version of her appealing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Perhaps her newfound strength made her easier to respect.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He recalled their past, where her vulnerability had made her cling to him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her previous neediness… that wasn’t the Sasha he wanted to see.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Why are you staring?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Uh, nothing.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Anyway, take care.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Without another word, Haise knocked and entered the guild master’s office.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"At least knock, will you? Honestly..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry about that, Geist."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…You're going, then?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. I'm heading to the eastern Yggdra Kingdom to collect the Everlasting Moon Flower from the summit of Mount Gagazia."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…The average monster rank on Mount Gagazia is B to SS. It's said an SS+ rank dragon-type beast, the Green Elephant Dragon, resides at the summit. Neither Yggdra Kingdom adventurers nor the Yggdrasil clan—one of the Big Four—dare approach it. Be careful."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Understood. Thank you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Also… take this."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist handed him a letter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's a letter of introduction. Please give it to Yggdrasil's clan master, Ibis. They might offer some help."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Geist, are you acquainted with the masters of the Four Great Clans?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Forty years as an adventurer gets you some connections."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stored the letter in his item box and downed the tea Geist had served in one gulp.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, I'm off."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Take care out there."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I will."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Haise. Your 'ability' is certainly strong. But you're not invincible… don’t let it get to your head."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…I know. I won't."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a slight bow, Haise left the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Exiting the capital's east gate, Haise began his journey eastward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He strolled leisurely, contemplating his next move: catch a carriage or ride a magic vehicle from the next town. With no deadline for the mission, he intended to take his time.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yawning, he conjured a handgun in his right hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A black, L-shaped metal object.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To the untrained eye, it didn’t look like a weapon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Desert Eagle. A weapon from another world, described in an ancient manuscript.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The manuscript in Haise's possession was left by an otherworlder, a human from a world not of this one—a fact only Haise knew.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Who's there?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He aimed the Desert Eagle behind him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No one was there, yet Haise, his senses sharpened by awakening his 'ability', felt a presence.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Awakening often enhances the body or grants unique powers. Sasha’s visible aura was one such power gained as a [Sword Master].<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No response came.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise fired slightly away from where he sensed the presence.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bang! The Desert Eagle expelled its casing, and the bullet was embedded in the ground.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Next one will hit."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…I surrender."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From nowhere, the girl he met at the Adventurer’s Guild emerged, calm and unshaken.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…It's you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sharp of you to notice."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why were you tailing me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I have a request."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Find someone else. I only take subjugation quests."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I need access to Mount Gagazia. Just let me stay behind you until then."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"How do you even know about… Tch. I work alone. No companions."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m not your companion. I’ll stay behind you. At the mountain, let me walk beside you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"For elixir ingredients."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The Everlasting Moon Flower?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her expression remained unchanged. No fear, no tension, even in Haise’s presence.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If I die on the way, leave me. I’ll just follow you. Let me stay near only at the mountain."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ll pay you. You can do whatever you want with me along the way. How’s that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Lowering his gun, it dissipated into smoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignored the girl and started walking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Presea."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"My name is Presea."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"And you're Haise. Not that you need to respond; I’m just talking to myself."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea, as she introduced herself, followed Haise, keeping a strict thirty-meter distance.</p>
