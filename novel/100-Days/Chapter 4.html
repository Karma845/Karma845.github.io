<p>Chapter 4: Study, Review, Try, Move Forward</p>

<p>&quot;The production volume of the hardest metal in the 'School District' this year has increased by 40% compared to last year! This is a huge gain!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lord Royman's plan suddenly became a reality!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Although the 'School District' side is reluctant, the contract signed at the time of establishment is still valid! They can't oppose us!&quot;</p>

<p>The spirited voices called discussion came and went.</p>

<p>Green eyes stared blankly at the faces of the &quot;guild officers&quot; that could be said to be filled with joy.</p>

<p>(It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I stay here...)</p>

<p>The chair under her was so luxurious that she was even a little restless. After sitting down again, Eina seemed to shrink into a ball and thought so.</p>

<p>This is the &quot;second floor&quot; of the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot;.</p>

<p>In the spacious &quot;decision room&quot;, the guild leader Royman and other &quot;high-level officials&quot; are here.</p>

<p>&quot;...Excuse me, squad leader Remmel? Why was a low-level employee like me called to the &quot;second floor&quot;? I am not qualified to be compared with the squad leaders and the &quot;senior&quot; cadres...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have trained first-level adventurers in a short period of time. Isn't this achievement enough to make you a candidate for a cadre?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What... class, class monitor~&quot;</p>

<p>She asked the person sitting next to her quietly, causing the usually stern orc boss to laugh softly. Eina couldn't help but make an embarrassed sound like the adventurer she was responsible for.</p>

<p>In the huge &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot; that boasts a majestic appearance like a pantheon, the word &quot;second floor&quot; has a special meaning.</p>

<p>Guild employees like Eina usually handle business on the first floor of the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot;.</p>

<p>Access to the second floor and above is prohibited except for &quot;high-rise&quot; personnel and the squad leader who supervises the staff on the first floor. Although he would go up there sometimes, that was only when Royman and the others called him.</p>

<p>A strict boundary is drawn between the first and second floors of the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot;, highlighting the class differences.</p>

<p>At least, this is not a place where a receptionist can step into at will.</p>

<p>&quot;For the city (Orario), this meeting is a point of disagreement that has a huge impact. Therefore, it is necessary to have someone who is close to the adventurers and has a similar position to be present. What's more, this matter is also related to the &quot;school district&quot; . &rdquo;</p>

<p>The orc boss Remmel looked at the meeting that was still under discussion and continued at a volume that could only be heard by Eina next to him:</p>

<p>&quot;You are a graduate of the 'School District'. You are the perfect person to provide reference.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In other words, my colleague (Micia) is also from the 'school district'...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not Flotte. She might mess up the whole meeting.&quot;</p>

<p>Eina retorted unwillingly, but this was blocked by his slightly exaggerated statement.</p>

<p>The cat-leg chair creaked softly, which seemed to reflect Eina's heart.</p>

<p>(I did have permission to sit here, but... the guild leader just glared at me, feeling like he was saying &quot;Don't talk too much&quot;...)</p>

<p>Eina, who was already feeling tired, looked over.</p>

<p>There were ten people sitting on one side of the long table made of ebony wood, and Royman was sitting on the top seat. He looked happy and was about to speak.</p>

<p>&quot;This won't be a problem. We can finally start implementing it! This 'shaft plan' that connects the surface to the depths of the underground city!&quot;</p>

<p>Aina watched this lively meeting and browsed the information at hand again.</p>

<p>It says, build a shaft in the dungeon and put in a large elevator.</p>

<p>It is a &quot;shortcut&quot; prepared for adventurers.</p>

<p>&quot;Once this 'Shaft Plan' is completed, the exploration efficiency of the adventurers will be greatly increased. It will especially provide a great benefit to the 'Expedition' conducted by the [Loki Familia]. It will not only help collect valuable labyrinth resources, but also It can greatly promote the growth of Finn and others!&quot;</p>

<p>What the extremely excited Royman said was true.</p>

<p>Dungeon exploration, especially the &quot;expedition&quot; conducted by advanced adventurers, must start from the first floor. Reaching the target floor requires time, effort, and the most important expense (cost).</p>

<p>For example, if you want to explore the 51st floor, you must first use up some supplies to reach the 50th floor. The large army will become exhausted and unable to exert its full strength. Even the largest faction in the city (Loki Familia) cannot The same thing can happen. For any [Familiar], the current [Expedition] is a huge gamble. Even an 'abnormal situation' will affect whether the result is success or failure. It can be said to be very inefficient.</p>

<p>But if this plan can be realized, adventurers can save this step and don't need to put in as much energy as they do now.</p>

<p>The more efficient exploration by adventurers also means that they can bring more benefits to the labyrinth city.</p>

<p>From super super high-risk gambling (high risk and high reward) to efficient gambling (low risk and high reward).</p>

<p>For Royman and his senior executives who run the city, this issue must be passed.</p>

<p>&quot;The material of the 'Huge Shaft' is all the hardest metal (Oliha Gang) obtained from the 'School District' Alchemy! It is not mixed with any impurities such as super-hard metal (Adamantine)! This way you don't have to worry about being Monsters will destroy it! As long as you avoid the area where the floor master will appear when building it, it will be absolutely foolproof!&quot;</p>

<p>At this time, it was the &quot;School District&quot; who took the stage.</p>

<p>The technical knowledge of the &quot;Alchemy Department&quot; of the &quot;School District&quot; - the &quot;Alchemy Mechanism&quot; that refines the hardest metals and other rare metals is at the highest level in the world. During the journey around the world, resources and talents were gathered on this giant ship. After repeated technological innovations, its status in refining precious metals could no longer be shaken. Even the famous hardest refined metal, the hardest metal (Oliha Gang), can maintain a certain production volume every year. Naturally, the output is number one in the world, which is why Orario maintains its huge investment in the &quot;School District&quot;.</p>

<p>Without the hardest metal provided by the &quot;School District&quot;, it would be impossible to complete the &quot;huge shaft&quot; that is protected from the destruction of the dungeon.</p>

<p>And with the &quot;school district&quot; returning to Hong Kong this time, the stock of the hardest metal has reached the total demand calculated by the guild.</p>

<p>&quot;If this plan succeeds, it will be a great achievement comparable to the 'Tower of Babel'! If it promotes the growth of adventurers, then Orario's sad wish can be realized! Everyone, a new era is coming!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>The atmosphere in the decision-making room was extremely lively.</p>

<p>Cadres even had visions of the huge wealth and unprecedented fame they had imagined in their minds.</p>

<p>Royman's proposition can be recognized in some respects.</p>

<p>After hearing this plan, a certain number of high-level adventurers may also express understanding.</p>

<p>But even so, it's still very disturbing to talk about it on paper.</p>

<p>Eina glanced to the side. Remmel said nothing, as if it had nothing to do with him.</p>

<p>Eina interpreted this as 'you can do whatever you want'.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, from now on, it will be deemed that you agree to the plan&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm very sorry. Can you state your opinion?&quot;</p>

<p>As a result, Eina still couldn't hold it back and mustered up the courage to raise her hand.</p>

<p>Royman, whose momentum was thwarted, looked at her with confusion and suspicion that she was in the way.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong, Zul?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The shaft plan gives adventurers more options to take shortcuts. It is indeed very attractive and a very epoch-making idea. But I still think, do we need to think more about safety issues?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why go around in such a big circle. What do you want to say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...So far, the dungeon has killed many adventurers. The &quot;lower level&quot; and &quot;deep level&quot; are also the source of abnormal situations that even high-level adventurers cannot completely deal with. The dungeon, the &quot;lower level&quot; and the &quot;deep level&quot; are combined with It&rsquo;s directly connected to the surface, so it&rsquo;s still scary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Relying on the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; as the &quot;lid of the labyrinth&quot; and the &quot;prayer&quot; of the city's founder god (Uranus), people managed and operated the dungeon. This is the main premise.</p>

<p>Even if the hardest metal shaft - the indestructible &quot;giant pillar&quot; - is prepared, if something goes wrong and the shaft is occupied, the &quot;worst case scenario&quot; may happen.</p>

<p>Building a shaft comes with the risk of monsters flowing back to the surface.</p>

<p>&quot;Also, if a 'foreign object' is inserted into the dungeon, it is likely to cause some kind of dangerous situation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have discussed these many times before! And we came to the conclusion that there is no problem! We have also asked the god Uranus who offers &quot;prayer&quot; for instructions! And you may not know, we already have something that will not lead to dungeons A rampaging man-made maze (example)!&quot;</p>

<p>Even within the guild, this information is controlled, so Eina at the grassroots level has no way of knowing it, but in fact, the discovery of the man-made labyrinth (Knossos) is equivalent to pushing the &quot;Shaft Plan&quot;.</p>

<p>The top management thought this way: There is such a huge man-made maze connecting each floor and adjacent to it, but the underground city is silent. Then even if another &quot;man-made object&quot; is inserted, there will be no accident - the most important thing is that with the cooperation of the [Gobnu Familia], almost all the hardest metal doors scattered in the man-made maze have been removed. Plan for use on shafts. It can be said that after taking into account the large amount of money that will be obtained from the artificial maze, this plan can be greatly advanced&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>(I don&rsquo;t know what the man-made maze the guild leader is talking about is, but...)</p>

<p>Through the incident about the &quot;Armed Monster&quot; and the rumor among adventurers that &quot;there is a man-made maze (something) that directly connects &quot;Daedalus Street&quot; and the dungeon, Eina vaguely sensed the truth, and she Frowning, he found another entry point to express his own opinions.</p>

<p>&quot;Another thing to worry about is that after building a shaft, adventurers will no longer have the opportunity to travel between floors. Creating a shortcut may lead to a situation that takes away their exploration experience...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just limit the use of the shaft according to the level of the [Familiar]! Separate the 'expedition' from the mandatory mission and the normal exploration, and there won't be any problem! To put it to the extreme, we should provide support The only thing that has happened since the days of the God (Zeus) and the Goddess (Hera) is the deepest level of update, which is the floors after the 71st floor!&quot;</p>

<p>Royman is indeed accustomed to verbal disputes. And unlike Eina, who was participating for the first time today, they must have discussed it many times. In response to her concerns, Royman responded gracefully and fluidly.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, we won't open the shaft to the 'lower level' and 'deep level' all at once! First the 'upper level', then the 'middle level', and then the 18th floor 'Maze Paradise'! We will proceed step by step with extreme caution and observe the entire process!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The guarding of the shaft and elevators is planned to be handed over to the [Ganesha Familia]! This will make the surface security weak, so it is necessary to select the [Family] as the new military police as soon as possible! Zul, you must also continue Cultivate adventurers and expand urban combat power!&quot;</p>

<p>From the moment he planned to build a shaft in the maze, the word &quot;extreme caution&quot; had nothing to do with it, and he also changed the subject.</p>

<p>Eina looked at him silently. Royman probably understood what those green jade eyes were thinking, and saw that his face was red with anger. In the end, Eina was not a guild employee, Instead, she expressed her opinion as a &quot;graduate of the school district&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;The information states that all the hardest metals must be obtained and construction begins immediately. The hardest refined metals will also be used to strengthen the armor of the supership (Hlinhorne). It is the property and pride of the &quot;school district&quot; ...Although the guild has invested funds, I think that unreasonable robbery will definitely lead to opposition from the &quot;school district&quot; side. Especially sensitive students&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!! Shut up, Zul! This plan is the biggest undertaking of this century! You, who appeared here for the first time today with a shameless face, have no right to interfere!&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed that Royman finally lost his patience and no longer tried to persuade Aina, but roared loudly.</p>

<p>In the end, even other people said to her, &quot;If you are a new member, please don't interrupt!&quot; Eina remained silent, and Remmel beside her sighed, seemingly feeling helpless about the unchanged shaft plan. At the same time, it seemed like an apology to Eina.</p>

<p>&quot;What's more, this is also the will of God Ouranos! There is no chance that this matter will be invalidated!!&quot;</p>

<p>exactly.</p>

<p>That's the biggest problem.</p>

<p>In the final analysis, no matter how many things and problems that grassroots member Eina points out that should be done, this shaft plan cannot be stopped since it has the most powerful backing of &quot;the guild leader has given permission&quot;.</p>

<p>(If all the omniscient gods agree, then maybe this is really my worry, and there is actually no problem. However, if a huge shaft (nail) is driven in, will the underground city really not respond at all?)</p>

<p>Eina could not let go of her uneasiness. The dungeon took away and devoured many adventurers that Eina was responsible for. To her, it was such a terrifying symbol.</p>

<p>No matter what - the shaft is definitely going to be built now.</p>

<p>Royman looked at Eina with a proud look on his face. At this time, the parchment was stamped with the seal of the resolution. Then the cadres shook hands and cheers came and went.</p>

<p>Is it the road to wealth and glory, or a trap to Hades?</p>

<p>Now that it has been a thousand years since Orario was founded, it has decided to move to the next stage (stage).</p>

<p>(Why did Lord Ouranos allow this plan...)</p>

<p>&quot;Is it really okay, Ouranos? Agree with the silo plan. &#12303;</p>

<p>There was a voice in the &quot;eye crystal&quot; of the crystal placed on my elbow.</p>

<p>The underground altar of the guild headquarters, &quot;Prayer Room&quot;.</p>

<p>The capable subordinate (Feros) who was on the phone sent an advice that seemed like an admonishment and asked Uranus who was sitting on the throne of God.</p>

<p>&quot;This incident will definitely make Royman more arrogant. What's more, it will also lead to suspicion and dissatisfaction from all sides. The school district will definitely object. &#12303;</p>

<p>Fellowes said as if he had foreseen the future, with a hint of 'It's really not like you' in his voice. Coincidentally, Eina was also thinking about the same thing in the decision room at the same time.</p>

<p>Ouranos replied in his usual emotionless voice:</p>

<p>&quot;Compared with possible obstacles... I choose to be prepared to face the 'trial' waiting ahead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;There are no means too many.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hearing what you, the god, say makes me even more worried. &#12303;</p>

<p>Really, a sigh came from deep within the crystal.</p>

<p>And even though he said so, Fellowes did not delve deeper. Although I didn't approve of this matter, I felt as if I had received an oracle. Fellowes chose to believe his master's words, and only the sound of doing things leaked out from the depths of the crystal.</p>

<p>&quot;How are you doing there?&quot;</p>

<p>Hear Uranus's question.</p>

<p>Like a child who got a toy, Fellowes raised his voice a little higher.</p>

<p>&quot;It's pretty good. Thanks to the man-made maze, I obtained an unexpectedly large 'Magic Workshop'. This way, the 'research' from long ago can make progress.&quot;</p>

<p>Southeast of the city quite far away from the guild's underground altar.</p>

<p>In the man-made maze located underground in &quot;Daedalus Street&quot;, Feros is working hard to install equipment.</p>

<p>&quot;After all, my 'research' can only be carried out in a spacious environment. Thank you for giving Royman a strict order to seal off this entire floor, and then handed it over to me, Ouranos.&quot;</p>

<p>The maze that once tortured Belle and Penny has now completely changed.</p>

<p>There is only one magic stone lamp here, and the light illuminates the dim hall.</p>

<p>A large number of books were piled up on a hill beside the wall. On a pillar-like perch, a white owl was resting on top.</p>

<p>A magic meter utilizing the technology of the magic country, as well as a large number of flasks.</p>

<p>There are also cylinders (measuring cylinders) filled with various mysterious solutions.</p>

<p>Like a suspicious experimental facility, it is a scene that can be described as a &quot;magician's residence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hehehe, we need to remodel it again. As a magician, I am really excited...!&quot;</p>

<p>Taking the heretic incident as an opportunity, the man-made labyrinth was completely suppressed and is now under the management of the &quot;Guild&quot;.</p>

<p>To be precise, it was in the hands of Ouranos. The old god gave it to the former &quot;sage&quot;.</p>

<p>The man-made labyrinth was once a breeding ground for &quot;evil&quot;, and the benefits it could bring were countless.</p>

<p>First, it went deep into the depth and scale of the &quot;middle level&quot; of the dungeon. There are also hidden facilities that exist to develop magic items such as the &quot;whip&quot; used by the trainer (Gira). For Fellowes, all this is very useful, equivalent to acquiring huge assets.</p>

<p>The thousand-year history of this famous craftsman connected to the dungeon makes it perfect both as a &quot;secret base&quot; and a &quot;resource facility.&quot; After that, Feros decided to build magic production equipment to produce a source of automatically generated herbs and elixirs. He even planned to ask Asfi to join him later to help him with his research. [Almighty One]'s vacation has not yet ended, but he is already about to be assigned to work long overtime hours.</p>

<p>&quot;I have never had such a huge &quot;Magic Workshop&quot; before in my lifetime. Even that hateful hometown has no place like this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are still alive now. &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, now even the flesh and skin are gone, what else is there to say. He is already half dead.&quot;</p>

<p>Even the intense self-deprecation that I normally wouldn&rsquo;t express can now be said with a smile. Although he is now reduced to a skeleton, the nature of the &quot;Sage&quot; as a crazy magician in the past has still been greatly touched.</p>

<p>The man-made maze no longer serves as the second entrance and exit of the dungeon, but gradually becomes a &quot;big stronghold&quot; dedicated to Feros.</p>

<p>&quot;Where's the generation?&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Knowledge and theories are all stored in my head...in my soul. In terms of equipment, as long as we use the elven spells that are still in the man-made maze, we should be able to make up for most of them. Let's see, the finished product will not be better than the magic power ( The things in the underground palace of Altina are bad.&quot;</p>

<p>Fellows planned to put everything into what he was about to do.</p>

<p>Even the labyrinth magic technology left by the dark faction clan was used by him. If Hayate (Ryu) were here, he would probably look disgusted.</p>

<p>&quot;The 'School District' is also back. The materials that were entrusted to Leon before... the ancient dragon yellow, the star silver at the bottom of the world, and the scorched earth crystal of the Foolish Fire (Elbis)... After completing these, all the conditions are met It&rsquo;s all together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It's all thanks to the &quot;school district&quot;, Fellowes said, and his black clothes swayed.</p>

<p>For Ferros and others, the super-giant ships that travel all over the netherworld can be said to be transport ships that carry large amounts of resources, and are an &quot;important factor.&quot;</p>

<p>That's right.</p>

<p>Everything is for the sake of &quot;saving the world&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;...The generation itself is already underway.&quot;</p>

<p>Fellowes moved his steps and stopped in front of a certain piece of equipment.</p>

<p>They were extra-large flasks, filled with solution poured from various cylinders&mdash;five of them.</p>

<p>In the flask, the &quot;gem&quot; that glows red is floating in it with a strange light.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you catch up?&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;There is nothing we can do in a short period of time. However, we will definitely finish it before the black dragon's crusade... no, before the 'promised time'.&quot;</p>

<p>After all, the gears of the times have begun to turn&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The mutter of the magician in black disappeared into the depths of darkness.</p>

<p>The second day of studying in the &quot;school district&quot; (temporarily).</p>

<p>It seems that the student dormitory on the residential floor has not yet prepared a vacant room, so I slept in Teacher Leon's staff room for one night. Today, student life will finally begin.</p>

<p>That's right, I'm officially going to class.</p>

<p>After meeting Nina in front of the &quot;Temple Tower&quot; in the center of the academy floor, we walked towards the teaching building.</p>

<p>The first class I want to listen to is &quot;Ancient History&quot;&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone&mdash;&mdash;!! Are you enjoying your youth&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;yeah----------------------! &#12303;&#12303;&#12303;</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;This is how it should be, but for some reason, the magic stone lamp (light) in the classroom was turned off, and a beam of light illuminated the podium, on which stood an astonishingly beautiful blonde goddess. very energetic.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep your mind and body young at all times! Take your lessons seriously, let's Aoharu&#9734;&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;&#12302;&#12302;Aoharu&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! ! &#12303;&#12303;&#12303;</p>

<p>As the beautiful goddess blinked one eye, the students' shouts reached their climax.</p>

<p>Already sitting in my seat, I looked at the girl beside me with a serious look on her face, her head lowered.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not like that...! Occasionally, gods come and take away the opportunity to attend class...! Teacher Adler is more ordinary! Why is it the goddess of youth (Eden)...!&quot;</p>

<p>When I couldn't help but call her by my honorific title, Nina covered her face with her hands, and even the tips of her ears turned red. Although it looks a little pitiful, it is so cute.</p>

<p>A goddess with long flowing hair, Eden-sama seems to be loved by many students, and her innocent and youthful behavior attracts everyone to imitate her. At the end, Eden-sama, who stirred up the atmosphere in the room, said, &quot;Then let's start the class&mdash;&quot; and immediately turned on the lights and started teaching in a very normal way. Is it necessary to heat up the atmosphere first?</p>

<p>&quot;Some time before the Age of Gods, great famines occurred frequently in the northeastern part of the continent. What is the indirect cause of this situation! Who should I ask to answer~. Then... I believe you will prepare well for Aoharu&#9734;, freshman little Lapi, You answer this question!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!? Uh...!?&quot;</p>

<p>(Lapijun, &quot;The Question of Visiting the Dragon.&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;Visiting, visiting the dragon question!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The answer is correct~. I hope you can answer it yourself next time!&quot;</p>

<p>I stood up in confusion, and Nina lowered her voice to help me, but Lord Eden, who laughed like a child, saw through everything. The other students also chuckled, and I sat down with a red face, sharing a wry smile with Nina.</p>

<p>The content of the course is difficult.</p>

<p>The goddess tiptoed and wrote on the blackboard. Not used to copying blackboard writing, it took a lot of effort for me to write it down in my notebook. Lady Eden often stood in the perspective of a god and asked us why the residents of the lower world left behind History can deviate from facts told by an omniscient deity. Nina and the others were actively asking questions and digesting the content of the course, while I racked my brains to barely keep up with them.</p>

<p>&quot;Today, I will explain based on the field survey data collected by people from the &quot;Combat Techniques Department&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>One class ends, and after a short break, the next class begins immediately.</p>

<p>The subject is &quot;The Theory of Final Confrontation&quot; that Mr. Leon also recommended. At this time, the dwarf wearing a monocle, Mr. Adler, finally appeared. The teacher operated the magic projector jointly developed by the &quot;Alchemy Discipline&quot; of the &quot;School District&quot; and the Magic Power to project various images in the dark classroom. Image.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The images that flew into the eye were many burned villages and destroyed goblin villages.</p>

<p>Collapsed towns and countless refugees.</p>

<p>&quot;As you all know, in recent years, powerful monsters have been coming to the &quot;Dragon Valley&quot; one after another. These dragon species slipped through the barrier set up by the &quot;School District&quot; and are still wreaking havoc today. If anyone here wants to study in Europe in the future, Lali life, then I hope you will not forget the tragedy of the world that is happening somewhere now&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>I ignored half of the teacher's words. I stared at those miserable scenes and asked Nina beside me:</p>

<p>&quot;...Has Nina seen such a scene before coming to Port Town (here)?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... I've seen it before. Many people are crying, but there is nothing they can do. It's very painful.&quot;</p>

<p>She said, narrowing her eyes sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;After entering the 'School District', I knew for the first time...this is the world today.&quot;</p>

<p>me too.</p>

<p>Before I was recommended to take this course by Teacher Leon, and before I came to the &quot;school district&quot;, I had no idea about the specific situation of the outside world. After coming to Orario, just surviving as an adventurer has made me exhausted, and now, for the first time, I have touched the current &quot;reality of the lower world.&quot;</p>

<p>In the classroom where the story is closely related to us, the dwarf teacher solemnly declared at the end.</p>

<p>He said - the world is hungry for heroes.</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun, are you ready?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-wait a minute!&quot;</p>

<p>While I was changing clothes in the empty dressing room, Nina's voice came from the other side of the door, so I hurriedly replied.</p>

<p>I put on the pants with rabbit tails prepared by Lord Balder and Lord Hermes, adjusted my bangs several times, and made sure that there was nothing wrong with the wig with ears, and then I opened the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow! The battle suit suits you very well!&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing my figure, Nina clasped her hands together and smiled.</p>

<p>Tops and pants with red and white as the main colors. The material is thin, light, and soft, and its performance as &quot;armor&quot; is not inferior to that of an adventurer's battle suit. This is the combat uniform issued to students of the &quot;Combat Techniques Department&quot;.</p>

<p>Even the leather sheath for the dagger was thoughtfully prepared. This was probably the work of Lord Hermes. I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile bitterly. By the way, in order to hide my identity, I didn&rsquo;t bring most of the things with me. &quot;The Dagger&quot; has always been kept in the school bag.</p>

<p>Nina is also wearing a red and white combat uniform, which is different from the boy's style I wear. The lower body is a skirt. The weapon on his back is a long staff. It looks like Nina is the defender.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way...what's Nina's level?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me? I'm Level 2.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;L, Level 2...!!&quot;</p>

<p>Although it has not been confirmed yet, I was a little shocked, or frightened, when I heard that Miss Eina's family had the power of a high-level adventurer. In short, I had a strange feeling.</p>

<p>I was so surprised that I almost leaned back, and Nina, who looked incredulous, walked through the road equipped with magic stone lamps and arrived under the blue sky.</p>

<p>In front of you is a wide terracotta-colored plaza shaped like a brick (cinder track), and white auditoriums tightly surrounding it.</p>

<p>This is an arena built of white diamond located in the corner of the academy floor.</p>

<p>&quot;We're all here. Then the 'comprehensive battle' will begin now.&quot;</p>

<p>The students in combat uniforms gathered around Teacher Leon, who was wearing his usual teacher uniform.</p>

<p>This is also a genuine course, and it seems to be called a &quot;practical course&quot;.</p>

<p>Different from studying cultural subjects while lying on a desk, to put it bluntly, it involves physical training.</p>

<p>The &quot;optional compulsory subjects&quot; for &quot;Combat Skills Subject&quot; students are to complete at least three &quot;practical&quot; subjects within one year. On Nina's recommendation, I chose &quot;Sword Skills&quot;, &quot;Fighting Skills&quot;, and this &quot;Comprehensive Combat&quot;.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, this course is not about specialized technical instruction, but about learning comprehensive combat methods.</p>

<p>&quot;Since the &quot;Special Internship&quot; is approaching, today I ask you to recall your original intention of dealing with monsters. Afterwards, you will be divided into &quot;teams&quot; and review your tactics. Don't slack off.&quot;</p>

<p>Teacher Leon talked about the course content to everyone, and I was still very nervous.</p>

<p>Students of all races gathered here, and they all experienced the same [upgrade] as Nina... exuding an aura of high strength. There is no doubt that if they form a [familial clan], they can probably squeeze into the city's backbone faction. Valve&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Teacher, can you speak-?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong, Kate?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This opportunity is rare, I want to see Xinshengjun's strength!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;--Eh!?&quot;</p>

<p>When I was still thinking about this kind of thing, someone suddenly mentioned me, which made my shoulders shake suddenly.</p>

<p>Immediately there were voices like &quot;I want to know too&mdash;!&quot; &quot;You should be a little confident to come to the &quot;Combat Techniques Course&quot; at this time, right?&quot; &quot;I'm really interested&quot; and the like came one after another!</p>

<p>My eyes hidden under my bangs opened wide. At this time, only Nina stopped everyone.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute! You said you want to see his strength, what do you want him to do? If you want Lapi-kun to do something dangerous, I won't agree!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are all in the &quot;Combat Techniques Department&quot;, how can there be anything that is not dangerous?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all, he looks so weak. I can understand that you are worried about him, but you shouldn't protect him so much, right, Nina?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just, even if it's like this...!&quot;</p>

<p>Both boys and girls pointed out the proper posture of the &quot;Combat Techniques Subject&quot;, leaving Nina at a loss for words. The term &quot;overprotective&quot; hit the nail on the head, probably because Nina had seen my shame again and again, so she became unnecessarily worried. I remember she said she couldn't leave me alone.</p>

<p>But what to do. I don&rsquo;t know what they want me to do, but since my identity can&rsquo;t be revealed, it&rsquo;s best to avoid it if you can&#8230;!</p>

<p>&quot;I remember, he is Level 1, right. If we had a simulated battle, Nina would be verbose again...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Newsborn, can't you use &quot;magic&quot;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? Ah, I'm here!&quot;</p>

<p>At this moment, I heard someone asking, so I hurriedly responded.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment, Teacher Leon also interjected.</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi, you just received the 'favor' from Lord Badr, so you shouldn't have manifested the 'magic' yet, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? I appeared...&quot;</p>

<p>I was a little confused, but I answered him truthfully.</p>

<p>As a result, Teacher Leon showed a bit of a headache with a wry smile on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;So you have 'magic'!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, why didn't you tell me earlier! As long as you show us, we will know how strong you are!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you can use [Magic], even Level 1 can be used as a defender!&quot;</p>

<p>(&#8230;&#8230;ah!?)</p>

<p>Seeing the students' instant emotional reactions, I reacted belatedly.</p>

<p>The so-called &quot;magic&quot; is supposed to be a sure-kill method. Its importance and eye-catching degree account for a large proportion in [Ability Value]. Whether you have useful &quot;Magic&quot; will obviously affect your popularity in the team.</p>

<p>Nina looked at me, looking very surprised. The students who were joking just now also showed great curiosity. So much so that now I can no longer avoid being tested by them!</p>

<p>Teacher Leon said that just now, it turned out that he was helping me and wanted to brush off the topic of &quot;magic&quot;!</p>

<p>&quot;Hmph, it's obviously a human being... What is the attribute of the magic that appears? What kind of magic is it?&quot;</p>

<p>Beside me, who was panicking, a dwarf named Eglin raised his bangs and stepped forward, shaking his tight battle suit.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, ah, that... is, is fire...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's attack magic. I'll prepare the barrier, and you can just fire it to your heart's content.&quot;</p>

<p>Now that things have happened, the atmosphere in the field is no longer one where I can say &quot;I lied&quot;, or rather I should not be allowed to say that. My cheeks twitched, and after I answered softly, the corner of Eglin's mouth tilted, He showed a provocative smile.</p>

<p>He distanced himself, stopped near the center of the field, then faced me again, hands outstretched.</p>

<p>After chanting the short article, a wall of earth-colored light rose up!</p>

<p>&quot;Here it comes&mdash;&mdash;!! Iglin's specialty, [Rock Wall]!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I feel like this time it will be a big upset!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That guy really doesn't have a long memory...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey freshmen, hurry up!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eglin is stronger than the barrier, don't worry! Be serious!&quot;</p>

<p>Boys and girls all pushed me, and I was attacked from all sides.</p>

<p>Forced to take a step forward, I shed a lot of sweat and looked down at my palms.</p>

<p>They said they wanted to take action, but...</p>

<p>&quot;Uh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, [Hero's Wish] activates!&quot; Start charging! Boom-boom-boom-boom-! Maximum charge completed! Go ahead aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!! Fire volts oooh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh! ! &#12303;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&rdquo; ? Defeated&mdash;! &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Iglin was beaten away&mdash;! &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;That kind of power is like that of a first-level adventurer!&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;That's the power of a first-level adventurer!&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;&#12303;That guy is an illegal intruder (Bell Crowne)! ! &#12303;&#12303;&#12303;</p>

<p>.........No, no, no, no! ? Absolutely not! !</p>

<p>If he really takes action, he will definitely explode (out) in every sense of the word!</p>

<p>In order not to expose your identity, you can only lower the power as much as possible!</p>

<p>I stretched out my trembling arms and aimed at Iglin-san who opened the barrier.</p>

<p>In short, he must not be injured, and his magic and mental power must be greatly suppressed...!</p>

<p>&quot;Hey&mdash;, chant quickly! Do you want to use it&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Eh, chanting?&quot;</p>

<p>Too much indolence caused complaints to fly over. When I heard this sentence, I made a crazy sound.</p>

<p>Right, right. &quot;Magic&quot; usually requires &quot;spells&quot;!</p>

<p>If I directly use the non-singing magic (Fire Volt), I will definitely be suspected!</p>

<p>Faced with a new crisis, my brain threatened to overheat. Nina looked at me anxiously, but I no longer had the intention to care. The tension, wavering and burden made my vision spin.</p>

<p>Faced with this situation that was beyond my ability to think and process, I shed a lot of sweat in the first few seconds. Then, after trying my best to come up with the &quot;false chant&quot;, what I said out of my mouth was,</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;[Burn, burn it all, your karma of foreign law!]&quot;</p>

<p>A chant borrowed from a companion (Welf) in an extremely superficial way.</p>

<p>And this became the reason for my failure.</p>

<p>I desperately searched for a spell that matched the flames. In order to suppress the power, I desperately tried to infuse the minimum amount of mental power, so I easily lost control of the magic power.</p>

<p>(ah---)</p>

<p>This is the feeling of a fierce horse (magic) that has no reins and is suddenly in high spirits, looking for a place to vent.</p>

<p>Feeling the feeling I experienced for the first time, I realized my &quot;big failure&quot; and recalled my elder brother's face like a revolving door.</p>

<p>(This is what Welf often lets others experience&mdash;&mdash;)</p>

<p>The next moment, boom&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! ! of.</p>

<p>&quot;Aha!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Magic, magic bursts!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;real or fake!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun!?&quot;</p>

<p>Eglin-san who opened the barrier, the other students (audience), and Nina all screamed and screamed at the explosion light and shock wave.</p>

<p>A violent explosion occurred, and after the rising smoke dissipated... I lay on my back in a large shape on the ground and was scorched black, looking at the blue sky with my eyes.</p>

<p>(...Have I really become a first-level adventurer...)</p>

<p>Although there is no chanting magic, but she did something stupid like a magic burst, Nina hurriedly ran here, and after experiencing this unheard of failure, I thought from the bottom of my heart: I really want to be a part of this sky, just like this disappear.</p>

<p>So, on this day, the mysterious new student (Lapi Fleming) was too nervous and caused an explosion of magic power, so he got the shameful title (label) of &quot;the great amateur (bottom)&quot;...</p>

<p>&quot;Then, Lapi will join the 'Third Team' of [Badelban].&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you kidding me!!&quot;</p>

<p>As a layman, I was also disliked by my future teammates.</p>

<p>After being burned, I accepted Nina's healing magic. Before I could do anything else, the &quot;comprehensive battle&quot; was almost over. At this time, after hearing Teacher Leon's announcement, about three demihumans launched a violent attack. of protest.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do I have to form a 'team' with such a layman, teacher! We didn't even fight just now. Just a test shot caused an explosion of magic power. You know, even the one holding back is stronger than him!&quot;</p>

<p>The one with the most excited voice was the dwarf who even forgot to lift up his bangs, Mr. Iglin.</p>

<p>Yes, you are absolutely right...</p>

<p>&quot;We are already a group of four... burdensome. We don't need... emergency food or human shields...&quot;</p>

<p>The one muttering in a low voice was the black elf girl whose lower half of the face was covered by a mask that looked like armor.</p>

<p>By the way, what she said was terrifying! ?</p>

<p>&quot;Ah~! It's here again, the test of the gods! The goddess of my clan (Fianna) is jealous of my strength and is inflicting suffering on me!&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, there is a little human boy who is about the same height as Lily...isn't it a girl? No, it's probably a boy. He closed his eyes, smiled and declared quite confidently.</p>

<p>I was simply regarded as suffering...</p>

<p>&quot;Really, is it true, Teacher Leon? Lapi-kun is going to join our 'team'...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah. This may increase the burden on your captain, but I hope you can rely on Lapi more. He should be able to help you, Nina.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, after the treatment, Nina stood up with a surprised expression.</p>

<p>&quot;I was shocked... But I kind of understand. Teacher Leon had planned this from the beginning, so he asked me to take Lapi-kun around the school.&quot;</p>

<p>I also have this feeling.</p>

<p>This is probably what Teacher Leon and Lord Balder think. only&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>&quot;...Uh, I'm sorry Nina. This 'team' everyone is talking about is...&quot;</p>

<p>I can probably guess that it should refer to the units that form a combat team.</p>

<p>&quot;The 'Combat Skills Discipline' stipulates that when conducting field investigations or combat missions outside the campus, you must form a group of four people. Sometimes the number of people is not so perfect, so there will be a group of five people...&quot;</p>

<p>There are as many &quot;classes&quot; as there are Lord Gods in the &quot;school district&quot;, and the &quot;teams&quot; are subdivided from there. The reason for forming a team in the same [class] is said to be to facilitate updating [ability values] on a 'squad' basis.</p>

<p>Judging from the education system, the &quot;team&quot; will repeat the process of someone leaving the team and then adding members again and again, but after all, the members are selected by the gods and teachers, so the team members seem to be quite complementary to each other, but...</p>

<p>&quot;...I might cause trouble for you in the future. I'm sorry, Nina...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How can it be trouble? There is no such thing? Lapi-kun and I are in the same team, so I feel relieved. If you join another 'team', I will probably be worried about you all the time.&quot;</p>

<p>Nina shook one of her long emerald brown hair and laughed. I couldn't help but smile bitterly when I saw it.</p>

<p>She is really considerate. This kind of place is exactly the same as Miss Eina.</p>

<p>&quot;only&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Nina looked away with some trouble, and I also looked over.</p>

<p>In front of her eyes were classmates Eglin and other team members who were still clinging to Teacher Leon.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, worst party ever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you don't get 'credits' anymore, you're going to drop out of school, right~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't call us that! Damn it!&quot;</p>

<p>The big bell in the central tower rang the end of get out of class bell, and the male and female students who were about to leave the arena walked past the members of the &quot;Third Team&quot; and laughed at them.</p>

<p>The words &quot;worst team ever&quot; made me blink blankly. I glanced to the side and saw that Nina also had a depressed expression.</p>

<p>(Did a lot of things happen to this team... &quot;Third Team&quot;...?)</p>

<p>While I was thinking this, Iglin-san, who couldn't change his decision, strode up to me and pointed with his thick finger.</p>

<p>&quot;Be my luggage carrier (supporter)!!&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, I have no objection...</p>

<p>&quot;Three-story extra-large confectionery (waffles)&quot;, among the three floors it is called, the residential floor is located on the second floor.</p>

<p>Sandwiched between the control level and the academy level is a wide space without any obstructions, with several large pillars - also used as lifting devices - supporting the ceiling. It was difficult for sunlight to shine in, and instead there were more than one large magic stone lamp installed on the ceiling. The light will be adjusted synchronously with the change of morning and evening time, so in my opinion, this place is very similar to the safe floor on the 18th floor. Of course, what is unfolding before our eyes now is not the nature of the underground city, but an architectural forest made of stone and metal.</p>

<p>Unlike the academy floor, which has a circular structure like Orario's starting from the central temple tower, the residential floor used for teachers and students has a mesh structure.</p>

<p>Numerous student dormitories and faculty dormitories are arranged at strictly equal intervals. What's interesting is that the appearance of each student dormitory is different in some details, and occasionally you will see artistic or strange-shaped buildings.</p>

<p>The empty room prepared for me is located in the &quot;Third Student Dormitory&quot;, and the &quot;Third Team&quot; also uses the lounge of this dormitory when they hold meetings.</p>

<p>&quot;Introduce yourself? Is it still necessary now? I am Iglin.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the people gathered together at Nina's painstaking call, Iglin-san said in a self-deprecating tone.</p>

<p>Classmate Eglin is shorter than me, about 150C, which fits the impression of a dwarf with a shorter body and legs. Although he was dressed like a noble man, with a rose on his chest, there were strong muscles everywhere on his body.</p>

<p>He shook his brown hair, which was lighter than Nina's, and his unhappy expression was clearly evident.</p>

<p>&quot;Reki...the black fairy...&quot;</p>

<p>The one who doesn&rsquo;t take off her mask indoors is the black fairy Reki-san.</p>

<p>Brown skin, red hair, height around 160C. Seems a little taller than Nina.</p>

<p>She is taciturn and has little mood swings. She is still wearing her uniform and skirt, but she is hugging her legs on the chair and reading a book that looks like a Bible. This makes it difficult for me to look at her. I tried desperately to dissipate the heat on my face, but my impression of her was that she was a weirdo with a unique way of speaking.</p>

<p>&quot;Finally, it's me! Christia Alvia! Just call me Chris! The Sleeping Lion who has not yet been known to the world! [Ability Value] is...Lv. 2!&quot;</p>

<p>He introduced his little human boy cheerfully... No, it's a girl... No, it must be a boy. After all, he is wearing a boy's uniform. Due to his race, he is the smallest in the team. With his aqua hair elegantly tied up, the little human has a tendency to belittle himself, but he is very confident.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, Level 2!? It's obviously a small human race!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, not bad, not bad, such a reaction! I am the genius who surpasses the [Brave]! A superstar that the 'School District' is proud of! Uh-huh!&quot;</p>

<p>The same level as Lily who crossed the &quot;Expedition&quot;! ?</p>

<p>Although it is not a good thing to say, the small humans are not very powerful, so they are called the weakest race.</p>

<p>It is true that there are first-level adventurers such as Mr. Finn and Mr. Alfric, but among the adventurers, the number of small humans who have experienced [upgrade] is overwhelmingly small. Even though this was the case, he reached Level 2 in the outside world where mazes (dungeons) did not exist... I don't know whether it was because the &quot;school district&quot; was very powerful or because Chris-san was very talented. By the way, all members of the &quot;Third Team&quot;, including Eglin-san and Reki-san, are Level 2.</p>

<p>Seeing how surprised I was, classmate Chris closed his eyes with his fists on his hips, his face sparkling, and he puffed up his chest.</p>

<p>&quot;None of this matters, layman! Don't do anything unnecessary during your special internship! Just follow the half-elf over there!&quot;</p>

<p>As if she was used to it, Iglin ignored Chris and warned me again and again in an angry voice. Hearing what he said, Nina's slender eyebrows raised.</p>

<p>&quot;Iglin, don't treat Lapi-kun as a hindrance, okay? We are already in the same team, and we are all partners. We must live in harmony...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of companion! Isn't he just a nuisance? Who can bear it if he blows himself up in the dungeon without permission!&quot;</p>

<p>Although I'm sorry for Nina, I can't refute it at all...</p>

<p>This is really messed up. Just when I was so downcast, Reki-san, who had been reading as if it was nothing to do with her, whispered:</p>

<p>&quot;Building a good relationship and so on, until now... Our cooperation (formation), shit...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, that's why we have to discuss...! And don't use weird words, Reki!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, don't worry! The direction I'm heading is the road! Don't be afraid, just follow me!&quot;</p>

<p>Nina, who was blushing, reminded Reki to pay attention to her wording, while Chris kept talking to himself with an attitude of going his own way.</p>

<p>...What's going on? This feeling of everyone doing their own thing.</p>

<p>Even looking at it from the side, I feel like they don&rsquo;t get along well with each other...</p>

<p>&quot;Um...someone called us the worst team in history before. What does that mean?&quot;</p>

<p>I made up my mind and asked, and as a result, the atmosphere around Nina, Iglin-san, and even Reki-san became heavier. The only one who has not changed at all is Chris, who is still shining brightly.</p>

<p>As if bitten by a bitter insect, classmate Iglin said:</p>

<p>&quot;That's what it means! No matter in [Badel Class] or in [Combat Techniques Subject], our grades are last! It's all because these guys are holding me back...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The team has not been disbanded, it is difficult to understand... Also, you are the one holding us back...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, stop arguing! Come on, look at the aura of light I radiate! kira~!&quot;</p>

<p>.........Although I am not qualified to say this, does it really matter?</p>

<p>Seeing that Iglin and the others were insisting on their own opinions and refused to give in, I silently watched Nina's expression.</p>

<p>So, I sighed deeply when I saw this kind and kind girl for the first time.</p>

<p>Time flies when student life begins.</p>

<p>With Nina's help, I barely kept up with the cultural courses.</p>

<p>In the dormitory, I would preview and review with Nina before dinner in the morning. I would have classes during the day, and I would preview and review with Nina in the evening.</p>

<p>I was not as smart as other students, and I had no clue, so I had to rely on quantity.</p>

<p>Only getting up early has become a habit after experiencing early morning exercise with Miss Ais and the baptism of fighting in the wilderness. I went to bed later than anyone else and got up earlier than anyone else. Even when I was sleeping, I was tormented by nightmares and thinking about studying. I really didn't expect that the strong resilience of a first-level adventurer, which is enough to stay awake, would be fully utilized in a place like this. Faced with Nina who took the initiative to accompany me to study on my own, I really felt that I had nothing to repay.</p>

<p>However, rather than studying, I am more worried about the relationship with the &quot;Third Team&quot;.</p>

<p>In the &quot;Practice&quot; class, although we talked to Eglin-san and the others again and again, in the end we were unable to confirm our cooperation.</p>

<p>No matter how many times Nina called, they told her to practice on their own and ignored her completely. Teacher Leon was just watching us from a distance.</p>

<p>So, the fourth day of student life.</p>

<p>The day of the &quot;Special Internship&quot; finally arrived.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!! That's amazing&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!! I didn't expect everyone in Orario to welcome me so much!&quot;</p>

<p>The moment he passed through the southwest gate of Orario, classmate Chris's first words were this.</p>

<p>Both the &quot;School District&quot; and Labyrinth City gave permission. As soon as the students stepped inside the tall city wall, they were surrounded by a large number of flower petals. The sound heard in the distance must be a welcome performance. The city seemed to be holding an unseasonable celebration, welcoming students with bright futures.</p>

<p>.........What is this?</p>

<p>&quot;Wow! Orario is so gorgeous! This is my first time here, it's so amazing! Lapi-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right...&quot;</p>

<p>Wearing a red and white combat uniform, I smiled dryly and responded to her helplessly. When Nina saw this, she called out &quot;Rapi-kun?&quot; and tilted her head in confusion.</p>

<p>When I first visited Orario, I kept shouting that it was so awesome, but Orario at that time was more like an adventurer's town, or it wasn't as gorgeous as it is now... At least it won't be as lively as a celebration for several days in a row like now.</p>

<p>A beautifully decorated pastry shop with special nougat and honey on display.</p>

<p>A coffee shop with rare books.</p>

<p>Contrary to my memory, today&rsquo;s Southwest Main Street is full of shops that are of interest to students. Just glancing at the fork in the road, you will find an elegant path ahead, which even made me think in fear, &quot;Is this really Orario?&quot;</p>

<p>Not to mention the [Family], it is said that the Labyrinth City itself also wants outstanding talents from the [School District]... In other words, is this to leave a good impression on the students as much as possible?</p>

<p>(There are already students buying things...perhaps you want to target students for business or something?)</p>

<p>If Lily were here, she could tell me a lot of things...</p>

<p>&quot;Here we go again, you guys from the 'School District'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It feels like there will be a storm in the dungeon this year.&quot;</p>

<p>...and overheard the conversation of the adventurers who were watching from a distance.</p>

<p>Nina and the others looked around excitedly, looking around with interest, but I felt quite uneasy beside me.</p>

<p>&quot;When conducting 'Special Internship', students must go to the 'Guild Headquarters' to complete the procedures... Lapi-kun, can I ask you to go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? It's ok...where's Nina?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I... have something to do. I forgot to prepare some props. So I wanted to go to Orario's store first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then let me go too! We must let the guild get to know the future hero! Okay, let's go, Lapi!&quot;</p>

<p>Nina was unusually vague, which I found strange, but Iglin-san and the others also wanted to visit the weapon shop and item shop, so the team was divided into two groups. The place to meet again was decided in front of the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot;.</p>

<p>I went to the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot;, also worried about not exposing my identity - especially not to meet anyone I knew, so I completed the procedures at the guild's reception window and applied for an &quot;Internship Permit&quot;. By the way, it was Ms. Missia who handled the business, but she didn't realize it was me at all. Instead, she smiled and said, &quot;Come on, juniors~&quot; to cheer us up.</p>

<p>Nothing happened along the way. After reuniting smoothly, we entered the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot;.</p>

<p>Walking down the long underground stairs leading to the maze, the &quot;Special Internship&quot; finally began.</p>

<p>When diving into a dungeon, there are many moments where you feel that the atmosphere here is &quot;different&quot; from the surface.</p>

<p>In the process of exploring the dungeon again and again, people will gradually get used to it and this feeling will gradually become weaker, but this is not the case for most students who see the dungeon for the first time.</p>

<p>No matter how good you are, the feeling of &quot;unknown&quot; will still cause tension, causing you to frequently look back at the empty road and maintain a high level of vigilance, fearing that monsters will be born from the walls at any time. I watched as other students behaved this way and once again strapped on their large backpacks.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't do anything unnecessary, layman! Just pick up the loot!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I understand...&quot;</p>

<p>On the first floor of the dungeon, there is a large passage called the &quot;Starting Road&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;Third Team&quot; didn't take the other teams seriously at all and strode forward. Among them, Eglin-san's orders turned into spikes and pierced deeply into my body. Ever since the magic explosion, I have always been a little weak when facing Iglin-san.</p>

<p>(Only Nina was a little nervous, the other three were as usual. Speaking of three people walking in front side by side, it was really an incredible formation...)</p>

<p>I am at the end of the team, and Nina is at center back, so we can still be considered T-shaped...</p>

<p>The &quot;Third Team&quot; is obviously different from other students who are cautious. I always feel no tension. I don&rsquo;t know if he is being brave or just being careless. If I had to say it, it would be &quot;very natural&quot;. Although we still don't know how they will fight, in a sense, this non-nervous state may be the strength of &quot;Team 3&quot;.</p>

<p>(Teacher Leon said he wanted me to point out the direction for the &quot;Third Team&quot;, but...)</p>

<p>Of course, I wanted to respond to his expectations. But can I do this while hiding my identity?</p>

<p>In front of his sight, there was Mr. Iglin with a sledgehammer on his back.</p>

<p>Reki-san, a dual swordsman with two daggers stuck at her waist.</p>

<p>The weapon is a two-handed sword about the same length as his height, and Chris-san is still swinging it in the air.</p>

<p>Nina, holding a long staff, seems to be the healer.</p>

<p>Even regardless of level, having a healer on the first floor of the dungeon is already extremely powerful.</p>

<p>Nothing can go wrong. I think so&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>Maybe, I was the most nervous person as I was observing the status of the team from behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Gob!&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>After passing through the large passage and turning several corners.</p>

<p>The monster finally appeared. The first thing that came up was the &quot;Goblin&quot; and &quot;Kobold&quot; groups!</p>

<p>Encountering the enemy for the first time in the dungeon, the team entered a battle-ready state, when classmate Iglin walked up.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep an eye on it, layman! See my rational fighting style!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes! Please!&quot;</p>

<p>As if to demonstrate to me, Iglin-san reached for the weapon behind his back.</p>

<p>Then, the moment he grasped the sledgehammer - a sudden change occurred in him.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Watch me fuck you to death!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eeeeeeeeeee&mdash;&mdash;!?&quot;</p>

<p>He threw away the tone and words he had used so far and let out a war cry that echoed around, making me and the monsters cry out in surprise.</p>

<p>The dwarf charged alone, his bulging muscles stretched out his combat uniform, and he waved his sledgehammer wantonly. The &quot;Goblins&quot; and &quot;Kobolds&quot; were blown away and crushed, making miserable screams, but he didn't seem to give up, swinging the big hammer down, down, down! !</p>

<p>No, where has the rational way of fighting gone! ?</p>

<p>&quot;Then, what is that!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As soon as Iglin picks up the hammer, he will transform into a different character...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;real or fake!?&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing Nina say this as if she had a headache, I couldn't help but yell.</p>

<p>He can now be said to have the demeanor of a dwarf more than anyone else, but what happened to his gentleman-like behavior so far! ?</p>

<p>&quot;That's good, Iglin! But the real brave is me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm on it too.&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, as if stimulated by Eglin, Chris and Reki also started to move.</p>

<p>After that, the scene was very tragic.</p>

<p>&quot;Ohhhhhhhh...!?&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at the miserable scenes unfolding in front of me from my position as a supporter, and made a sound like a squashed frog.</p>

<p>&quot;Eeglin, don't rush too far! Reki and Chris don't go forward either!&quot;</p>

<p>The squad leader (Nina) at the rear of the team issued a series of instructions.</p>

<p>But no one listened!</p>

<p>Mr. Eglin rushed into the &quot;Killer Ant&quot; group alone. Mr. Reki jumped over his head as if he was looking for a new hunting spot. Even Mr. Chris said &quot;I will open the way!!&quot;, as if they were competing. Just like that, he still rushed forward.</p>

<p>Something is very wrong with &quot;Defender 1&quot; and &quot;Frontguard 3&quot;, and the queue is so long that the instructions cannot be conveyed. This is a lie! ?</p>

<p>And except for Nina, everyone else is an avant-garde attacker! ?</p>

<p>This is not a group battle, but a solo battle x4!</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, this is really your first time on this floor...in the dungeon, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's the first time... But even in the dungeon, it still turned out like this...&quot;</p>

<p>I hurriedly corrected myself, but Nina looked very disappointed, as if what she was seeing was not the first time.</p>

<p>We are now on the 7th floor of the dungeon.</p>

<p>It was my first time to challenge the dungeon, but I walked through seven floors in one day!</p>

<p>Maybe it's because this is the &quot;upper floor&quot; and everyone is Level 2, but in just half a day, the floor was updated seven times in a row... It's so scary, so scary! ? Facing the floor I saw for the first time was so scary! !</p>

<p>Seeing this behavior that a seasoned adventurer would never do, I almost fainted with fear.</p>

<p>&quot;The same goes for field surveys and combat missions so far. Everyone rushes forward alone, but because they are all very strong, they always manage to complete the mission... Then various problems will arise. I originally hoped If it were called the harshest dungeon in the world, everyone might unite, but...&quot;</p>

<p>I hope this statement and her blank side face truly show how much thought Nina has put into so far and how many methods she has tried.</p>

<p>I stared at her who was tired of sighing now, and after a while, I looked forward again.</p>

<p>&quot;Get out of my way, goblins and little humans! Be careful I crush you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dwarf, so annoying...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You two, don't be afraid! I will defeat all enemies!&quot;</p>

<p>The three of them left us behind and rushed forward a long way, their voices echoing faintly in the maze.</p>

<p>Even the &quot;Magic Stone&quot; was not dealt with, and the monster's corpses rolled everywhere. I stood blankly in the middle of the road, and Nina and I fell into confusion.</p>

<p>&quot;You ask why you don't cooperate? Of course it's because these barbarians are in the way!&quot;</p>

<p>The night after returning from the dungeon.</p>

<p>After that, other adventurers and students blamed us for obstructing the passage, so Nina and I apologized together and turned to dealing with the monster corpses (or rather we were doing this all day today). At this time, we were finally in the student dormitory on the residential floor. I caught Iglin-san and the others.</p>

<p>We borrowed a corner of the cafeteria and listened to the team members in house clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;Always getting into my attack range and not letting me wield this ancestral hammer to my heart's content!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Barbarian, it's all you who's in the way... You're so big, even monsters can't be chopped down properly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm a very powerful little human, so I have to be the first to rush in!&quot;</p>

<p>...It&rsquo;s a little unfair to say that they don&rsquo;t have the ability to cooperate, but Iglin-san and the others still insist on their own opinions, which makes me feel a headache.</p>

<p>Although they will still abide by the rules of the &quot;school district&quot; and go into the dungeon as a &quot;team&quot;, that's all. When encountering monsters, they will fight on their own.</p>

<p>Trust and credit. And considerate.</p>

<p>As a team that puts its back to its teammates, this is fatally lacking.</p>

<p>(&#8230;Maybe it&rsquo;s a little extreme&#8230;)</p>

<p>Although the method is a bit strange, it also makes me feel that Lily and Welf are really powerful.</p>

<p>Among adventurers, conflicts within the team are common.</p>

<p>Everyone has a personality, opinions, and policies.</p>

<p>How to reach an agreement and improve the level of cooperation is an eternal issue for adventurers and supporters. Only now do I realize how lucky [Hestia Familia] is at this point.</p>

<p>&quot;Because of you, I don't even have time to study! You layman! Write a report for me and hand it in!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, Eglin!&quot;</p>

<p>He forced the paper over, surprising me, and even good-natured Nina couldn't help but get angry.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Eaglelin didn't care at all.</p>

<p>&quot;All this guy can do is pick up 'magic stones' and 'dropped items'! If anything, it's thanks to our kindness that he can get 'credits'! Then at least he can have a starting point in this regard!&quot;</p>

<p>Rather, he should be grateful for being assigned to this team. Hearing his tone as if he was about to say this, I immediately felt discouraged and couldn't say a word. After all, I really didn&rsquo;t do anything like being a teammate.</p>

<p>In the end, Nina didn't have time to stop Eglin, and he left the cafeteria directly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm...done. Submit, help me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't finished it yet! So Nina, I have to ask you to write a report for me again, please do everything!&quot;</p>

<p>Reki-san placed her report on top of the paper that was forced onto me, while Chris-san used the &quot;Doge Seat&quot; she learned from somewhere and held on to Nina. Nina, who planned to chase after Reki-san, was stopped by Chris-san, and her shoulders dropped in frustration.</p>

<p>Worst team ever.</p>

<p>For an adventurer, this level is quite cute, but...after understanding the origin of the name, I couldn't help but think: the future is really difficult.</p>

<p>&quot;Teacher Leon, excuse me... ah, Lord Badr?&quot;</p>

<p>I finally finished writing my report, and it was almost time to go to bed.</p>

<p>I told Nina, who wanted to come with me, that it didn't matter. I visited Teacher Leon's teacher's room alone, but I saw an unexpected divine object, and my eyes widened.</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't seen you for three days, Lapi. How are you? How is life in the 'school district'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well...it's hard to get used to a new life.&quot;</p>

<p>Sitting opposite Teacher Leon, drinking tea - or are you waiting for me to come? &mdash;&mdash;Lord Baldr asked in a calm voice, and I smiled bitterly and spoke the truth.</p>

<p>&quot;Although it is very hard...but at the same time, I encounter all new things, which makes me very excited.&quot;</p>

<p>This is also true.</p>

<p>Although learning is tiring, I know the joy of turning the unknown into the known.</p>

<p>This is especially true if it's something I'm interested in. Communicate with knowledgeable teachers, discover and take note of new fighting methods, facilities such as the large library and arena, etc., the &quot;School District&quot; has created a fulfilling environment where as long as you are willing, you can polish yourself to your heart's content. The &quot;return to the original intention&quot; that I talked about with Eina-san, this place couldn't be more suitable.</p>

<p>The fight for lunch in the limited canteen is also very exciting. Different from the life in the [Family], this place is fresh and full of excitement.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Eden-sama, maybe &quot;This is exactly aoharu&#9734;&quot;.</p>

<p>After I confessed like this, Lord Baldr closed his eyes and said &quot;Really&quot; with a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Teacher Leon. This is the report...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Lapi. I will take a closer look later. Remember to tell Iglin and ask him to come to me early tomorrow morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Exposed...</p>

<p>Teacher Leon just glanced at it and saw that the report was written by me. Feelings like embarrassment came over me, so I had to answer &quot;Okay...&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Today is your first time going to the dungeon. How about the 'Third Team'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh... It feels really, really full of personality, right?&quot;</p>

<p>After hearing Teacher Leon's question, I tried to answer him carefully, and then Lord Balder put his finger to his mouth, laughing so hard that his shoulders shook slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;...Teacher Leon, Lord Balder. Why did you put me in Nina's team?&quot;</p>

<p>I asked a question that has always been on my mind. immediately,</p>

<p>&quot;Because if they continue to conduct 'special training' like this, they will all be wiped out.&quot;</p>

<p>Teacher Leon said very simply.</p>

<p>It surprised me to say this without any metaphor.</p>

<p>&quot;Except for Nina, the other members of the 'Third Team' were originally in other teams, but they would cause problems no matter which 'Team' they were in, so after changing again and again, they were gathered together like this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Have you been treated as a problem child?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At least that's the case with the students. From my perspective as teachers, they have commendable merits, but overall, they still lack a sense of cooperation.&quot;</p>

<p>It's really too unique.</p>

<p>Lord Bader and Teacher Leon said alternately.</p>

<p>I feel the same way. It is true that Eglin-san and the others did not cooperate with each other at all, but on the other hand, they broke through the dungeon several times relying only on their &quot;individual power&quot;.</p>

<p>Among the Familia who are also at Level 2, the strength of each of them is also very amazing.</p>

<p>However...even if you have such &quot;individual power&quot;, you will lose your life sooner or later in the dungeon. Just like what happened to other high-level adventurers.</p>

<p>&quot;If I or other teachers accompany me to explore, it will become a special treatment. This will not be beneficial to Iglin and the others. Moreover, at this time, there are really not enough manpower.&quot;</p>

<p>In special internships, most teachers are placed inside the maze.</p>

<p>But after all, the underground city is so big that teachers can only be arranged on regular roads at most.</p>

<p>Even if it is to deal with abnormal situations that may happen to students, personnel cannot be allowed to go to too far away places. This is the real situation.</p>

<p>In addition, the students of the &quot;School District&quot; are considered to be elites, so they are said to be entangled by adventurers who are hostile to them, and the number of disputes is increasing...</p>

<p>&quot;Even if the &quot;Third Squad&quot; is disbanded and dispersed to other units, they will still cause problems. I want to reduce the risk of spreading the commotion in the dungeon as much as possible. But just as I am thinking about how to solve it When...you came to the &quot;School District&quot;, Lapi. No, a first-level adventurer (Bell Cronny).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When Hermes wanted you to enroll in school, there was actually a 'condition in exchange'. I will provide you with experience in the 'school district', and the condition is that the 'Third Team' will be handed over to your care.&quot;</p>

<p>Teacher Leon's words made me open my eyes, and then Lord Baldr's &quot;revealing the truth&quot; made me accept the current situation.</p>

<p>This time I came to the &quot;school district&quot; to attend school. I didn't pay any money or anything else, I just enjoyed the benefits unilaterally. I always felt very embarrassed, but after knowing that this condition existed, I felt a little more relaxed.</p>

<p>In other words, this is an adventurer's request.</p>

<p>I have already received the reward, that is, studying in the &quot;school district&quot;, and what I have to do is respond to Lord Badr's expectations.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you feel? Can you guarantee the safety of 'Team 3'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes. If there is danger, I will use my true strength and not let anyone die.&quot;</p>

<p>Don't worry about this.</p>

<p>So I assert this.</p>

<p>Within the scope of the &quot;middle level&quot;, I will definitely be able to protect them.</p>

<p>Hearing my calm answer, Teacher Leon narrowed his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry for always counting on you, but can I ask you one more favor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's going on?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not only Eglin and the others, but Nina is also harboring something that can be called a 'problem'.&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing these unexpected words, I was quite shocked.</p>

<p>Nina, who is kind and well-liked, and who helps me so enthusiastically, also has some kind of &quot;trouble&quot;...?</p>

<p>&quot;If possible, I hope you can help her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Can I ask Nina what's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On this point, I hope you can ask her about her troubles as a 'super friend' instead of telling you myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing him say that, I understood.</p>

<p>Teacher Leon and the others did not ignore Nina's problem, but decided that letting &quot;someone in the same position&quot; guide her was the best way.</p>

<p>&quot;She is in a sensitive period now. Coupled with Nina's own 'confusion', if I wait for 'adults' to take action rashly, she may lose a lot of things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you, who both know what it means to be strong and what it means to be weak, and have the same perspective, should be a perfect fit... That's what I thought of when Hermes talked about you.&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Badr took over from Teacher Leon and continued.</p>

<p>&quot;So I discussed it with Leon. I thought that as a student or an adventurer, you should be able to guide her forward.&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing the words of the god, I felt a little embarrassed and scratched my head.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m that amazing of a human being. But I also don&rsquo;t want to be too humble and say I can&rsquo;t do it and say no.</p>

<p>Nina has been helping me, so I want to return the favor.</p>

<p>Only in this way. Since they are &quot;school friends&quot;, then that alone is enough.</p>

<p>&quot;...Understood. I will do my best.&quot;</p>

<p>Thank you, Teacher Leon said, thank you very much, Lord Badr expressed his gratitude.</p>

<p>I felt a little itchy in my heart and laughed together with the two of them.</p>

<p>&quot;Theoretically, you can try a 'study trip', and it can also be used as a break... But after all, the education system of the 'school district' itself seems to be conducting a study trip (this) all the time. So it is difficult to say whether it will happen. Effect.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Study trip'...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a small trip with students as the main body, expanding their knowledge and gaining experience in different environments.&quot;</p>

<p>While we were chatting, bedtime in the dormitory was approaching. There are student representatives in the [Classes] of the [School District] such as [Supervisors] - if you are a [Family], they are candidate cadres. If you violate the rules, you will be taken down by them.</p>

<p>It's almost time to say goodbye, before the dormitory leaders like them are angry.</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi, can I ask you one last question?&quot;</p>

<p>The moment before leaving the teacher's room, Teacher Leon said behind me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you think &lsquo;Team 3&rsquo; will stop?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned around.</p>

<p>Recalling the &quot;credit conditions&quot; set for each level, I answered him:</p>

<p>&quot;I think it's the 12th floor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;hateful!?&quot;</p>

<p>The anxious voice of classmate Iglin was swallowed up by the screams of the group of &quot;little monsters&quot;.</p>

<p>This is the 12th floor of the underground city shrouded in white mist.</p>

<p>The &quot;Third Team&quot; who had reached the deepest level of the &quot;Upper Floor&quot; was forced to fight hard for an unknown number of times.</p>

<p>&quot;Quickly defeat that 'dragon'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't help it...I'm already tired.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even though I am super powerful, I am still outnumbered! I'm so sorry, everyone!&quot;</p>

<p>Surrounded by a large group of &quot;little monsters&quot;, in front of the eyes of Eglin and his classmates, floating in the depths of the thick fog, was a &quot;little dragon&quot; that was over 4 meters long.</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!&quot; ! &#12303;</p>

<p>The rare &quot;Baby Dragon&quot; on the upper level let out a roar, shocking the &quot;Third Team&quot; together with the sea of &#8203;&#8203;prairie, making the &quot;Third Team&quot; tremble.</p>

<p>The long tail wrapped in strong dragon scales swung around, sweeping down the &quot;Maze Weaponry&quot; - several thick dead trees, and even the wailing &quot;little demon&quot; was involved. The three men in the vanguard barely jumped back to avoid the sweep, but their movements were obviously not sharp enough.</p>

<p>&quot;[Holy flowers sway, their breath is white. Thousands of flowers sing in unison, a pure hill.] - [Holy Dharma]!&quot;</p>

<p>Pure white petals&mdash;no, white magic pieces riding on the wind wrapped around Avant-garde's body.</p>

<p>This is Nina's healing magic.</p>

<p>She set up a long staff at the rear guard position and managed to maintain support for the three of them, but it was only a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p>Thanks to the magic that restored their physical strength, Iglin and the others barely escaped the dragon's pursuit, but they still had a look of deep exhaustion on their faces.</p>

<p>&quot;...Nina, retreat. This battle has already...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Um!&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing what I, who was standing by as a supporter, said, Nina showed a painful expression for a moment, but immediately switched to the face of the squad leader.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, retreat! Retreat to the south hall we just discussed! Hurry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What!? Stop joking, I haven't...!&quot;</p>

<p>The dwarf immediately roared and wanted to retort, but he never finished.</p>

<p>Iglin-san, who fought with all his strength and fought in the vanguard for the longest time, knows best.</p>

<p>If we continue fighting, something might go wrong.</p>

<p>For example, another army (monsters) appeared deep in this hall&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Porpoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao...! &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow! It's the &quot;orc&quot; group! How ugly! I really don&rsquo;t want to fight them! &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;...Strategic retreat. There is no other way.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing the four &quot;Orcs&quot; crowding in like four walls, Chris and Reki both started to run away.</p>

<p>Classmate Iglin also cursed &quot;Damn it!&quot; and followed behind.</p>

<p>(It would be nice if there was a &quot;magic&quot;.)</p>

<p>The little demon and the orc chased after him, followed by a dragon.</p>

<p>I peered around and calculated the distance to both sides. In order to eliminate the one in ten thousand possibility, I rummaged through my backpack while running.</p>

<p>Then he left Nina and ran side by side with Reki-san who was following behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Reki-kun! Can you prepare [magic]!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...There is not enough time for chanting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll prepare the trap! So it's at the third dead tree in front! Is that okay?&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing me running side by side, smiling cowardly, and &quot;that&quot; clutched in my gloves, the black elf girl said softly:</p>

<p>&quot;...Just listen to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he immediately accelerated and rushed forward.</p>

<p>As I asked, I stopped at the third dead tree ahead, knelt down on one knee, and started chanting a spell.</p>

<p>After confirming this, I glanced at the chasing group of monsters, and then threw out &quot;that&quot;... &quot;Purple Moth's Poison Bag&quot; in my gloves.</p>

<p>This is an item I bought in the store before rushing to the dungeon. Lily often used this kind of pouch when exploring the &quot;upper level&quot;. What flew out from it at this time was naturally &quot;Poison Scale Powder&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Cough, cough!&quot; ? &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; ? &#12303;</p>

<p>The monsters, centered on the little demon, all suffered from &quot;poisoning&quot; symptoms, and their progress slowed down.</p>

<p>This alone can't stop this large group of monsters from chasing, but the agreed time has been completed.</p>

<p>&quot;[Dark Thunder]!...It's over.&quot;</p>

<p>Reki-san, who deployed the magic circle and pressed one hand to the ground, started running again.</p>

<p>I also ran as fast as I could&mdash;disguising myself as Level 1 with all my strength&mdash;to avoid the dead tree and chased after Nina and the others.</p>

<p>Not long after, when the &quot;orcs&quot; kicked the little demons away and chased after them in large strides,</p>

<p>&quot;[Black Explosion (Boom)].&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!&quot; ? &#12303;</p>

<p>Reki-san read out the explosion command and activated the &quot;Land Mine Magic&quot;. The &quot;Third Team&quot; finally succeeded in throwing away the monsters.</p>

<p>&quot;Asshole!&quot;</p>

<p>Eglin-san slammed the helmet he was wearing onto the ground.</p>

<p>The sound of impact echoed clearly in the quiet hall. However, no one blamed him.</p>

<p>Because everyone, including Nina, was out of breath.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this the fourth time!? In the end, we failed to defeat that dragon again...!&quot;</p>

<p>It is now the fourth day since the &quot;Special Internship&quot; began.</p>

<p>The &quot;Third Team&quot; has launched a total of three attacks on the 11th and 12th floors, but still failed to defeat the dragon designated as a &quot;credit condition&quot; by the &quot;school district&quot;. Only by submitting the &quot;dropped items&quot; of monsters designated as &quot;credits&quot; can you go to the next floor.</p>

<p>The &quot;Third Team&quot;'s rapid advance to the 7th floor on the first day has now completely stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;Except for the amateurs over there, we are all Level 2! According to the guild's information, shouldn't that kind of dragon be easily eliminated?&quot;</p>

<p>Although he has retreated, he cannot completely release his fighting posture. Therefore, holding a sledgehammer in one hand, he was still the &quot;excited Eglin-san&quot; and cursed &quot;Damn it!&quot;, and his anxiety was clearly revealed.</p>

<p>&quot;Except for 'Squad 7', we were the fastest to reach the 12th floor, but...! Why were we surpassed by other teams!&quot;</p>

<p>The reason... is very simple.</p>

<p>Because there is no group fighting.</p>

<p>Because the efficiency of &quot;Team 3&quot; is too low.</p>

<p>Even if we travel the shortest distance along the regular road, the distance to the 12th floor is still much longer than expected.</p>

<p>Considering that there are still battles along the way, the consumption will be even more intense. Therefore, the &quot;Third Team&quot; that does not cooperate and only relies on its own strength to break through the floor will consume more physical and mental energy than other teams.</p>

<p>In the battle just now, even though they were at Level 2, the &quot;Third Team&quot; was unable to suppress the dragon and other monsters simply because they did not have enough energy (stamina).</p>

<p>(Under Nina's suggestion, this time we first carried out supplies after reaching the 12th floor, and then launched an attack, but...)</p>

<p>Physical strength can indeed be restored with magic, and mental strength can also be replenished with props.</p>

<p>However, it is said that &quot;baby dragons&quot; are a rare species that will not appear in more than five on the vast floor. This is also why it is called a powerful enemy (boss) in the &quot;upper floor&quot; where there is no floor leader. After all, it is difficult to encounter in the first place.</p>

<p>What will happen if the students from the &quot;school district&quot; are rushing to defeat this dragon?</p>

<p>The answer is - in this situation that looks like a &quot;battle for battle&quot;, it takes a lot of effort just to find it by luck.</p>

<p>So in the process of constantly consuming energy and searching for the dragon, the physical strength that was rarely recovered was gradually consumed... and then the &quot;Third Team&quot; became what it is now.</p>

<p>Starting from the 10th floor, there will be a monster feast in the dungeon, and the number of enemies and the number of battles will also increase significantly.</p>

<p>The younger brothers (little demons) surrounding Xiaolong are also very troublesome.</p>

<p>(Nina's &quot;Magic&quot; is more focused on reply and support. Although it is Level 2, forcing her to the front row is not a good strategy...)</p>

<p>In this team, if we abandon the support and reply to the vanguard, the consequences will be dire. The mental recovery medicine has been used up. Considering that she has to return, she must avoid placing a greater burden on Nina.</p>

<p>Everything is heading in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>If it were to simply break through the 12th floor, the &quot;Third Team&quot; should be able to do it easily.</p>

<p>But if you want to defeat the dragon in today's environment, the difficulty will skyrocket.</p>

<p>If an adventurer with several years of experience enters the maze, the consumption can be controlled, but it has only been four days since Iglin-san and the others entered the dungeon, so they are complete novices. On the other hand, the students who are about to completely break through to the &quot;upper level&quot; in just four days are indeed too good... But even at Level 2, if they are not efficient enough, they will naturally be tortured by the dungeon itself.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;I carefully considered my words and expressed the above meaning gently, but I was yelled at, &quot;Don't use hindsight!&quot;. I am so sorry&#8230;&#8230;!</p>

<p>&quot;...Let's call it a day today. We've used up all the items. It will be dangerous to continue.&quot;</p>

<p>The dragon will also appear on the 11th floor, but it has become a fierce battle area for the &quot;battle&quot;.</p>

<p>After hearing Nina's words, everyone in the &quot;Third Team&quot; who came to the 12th floor with the last ray of hope either had their faces twisted, or kept silent, or were dejected.</p>

<p>They did not refute and were about to acquiesce to the proposal, but at this moment.</p>

<p>&quot;...Nina, I'm sorry. Do you want to wait a little longer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p>I mentally apologized and interjected.</p>

<p>&quot;As for the 'Third Team', we can still continue.&quot;</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;This is my intuition. Probably, it only works here.</p>

<p>Now I am almost exhausted.</p>

<p>Although it is not yet at the &quot;limit&quot;, it is still a state of being forced into a desperate situation.</p>

<p>Only by seizing this opportunity can the &quot;Third Team&quot; change.</p>

<p>Eglin-san and the others have [upgraded] and reached Level 2. They can more or less defeat skill with force.</p>

<p>Because of this, they despise group fighting and rely on individual strength to force their way through.</p>

<p>Therefore, in today's situation where brute force cannot be relied upon, as long as they experience new methods - experience the success after hard work and the amazing results, they will definitely gain something. can be used next time. Able to use it as a weapon.</p>

<p>After all, they are all students in the &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p>(This must also be... &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot;.)</p>

<p>When I was in the &quot;deep state&quot; with Miss Liu, I had to use various means and ingenuity to become stronger, otherwise I would not be able to survive. If I could recreate that experience to some extent, it would be possible.</p>

<p>&quot;After being forced into a desperate situation, it is an opportunity to grow.&quot; I can't help but think this way now.</p>

<p>But to be honest, &quot;you can continue&quot; is the most dangerous word in the dungeon...</p>

<p>&quot;If it's this team, it's not considered an 'adventure'...so it doesn't matter.&quot;</p>

<p>I covered my eyes with my bangs and said with a smile.</p>

<p>Nina, classmate Eglin, classmate Reki, classmate Chris, everyone&rsquo;s eyes were wide open.</p>

<p>&quot;Adventurers must not take risks.&quot; I recalled Miss Eina's words and clearly told Nina and the others that they were not in the scope of &quot;adventure&quot; yet.</p>

<p>They got here through their own efforts alone.</p>

<p>So, if we can unite... the &quot;Third Team&quot; can go further. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Teacher Leon and the others probably knew this, so they never disbanded the team.</p>

<p>&quot;You, you said you can continue...what do you plan to do!? So far, nothing has gone well!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, so far, I have been observing everyone's movements, and then I also came up with something like a 'combat'...&quot;</p>

<p>For the past four days, I have been observing the &quot;Third Team&quot; from the end (supporter) position.</p>

<p>I'm usually in the vanguard. At most, he sometimes swaps positions with Miss Ming and retreats to the central defender, so the perspective from the back of the team is very fresh. Because of this, I understand a lot of things.</p>

<p>Like &quot;It would be nice if there was that attack now&quot;.</p>

<p>Like, &quot;If you just turn that way, you can lighten Chris-san's burden.&quot;</p>

<p>And&mdash;&mdash;&quot;What should I do if I am on the vanguard now?&quot;</p>

<p>In the process of thinking about various things, I gradually understood many things about the team members.</p>

<p>Probably, I have never experienced this feeling in [Hestia Familia]. Even if I retreat to the guard position. The cooperation of [Hestia Familia] is so skillful.</p>

<p>Precisely because they were &quot;students&quot; who were still making progress, I noticed many things.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you kidding! Who would trust a layman like you in combat?! If you blow yourself up here, who can bear it!&quot;</p>

<p>However, classmate Eglin, who held a sledgehammer in one hand, rejected me excitedly.</p>

<p>...There is no other way, it is indeed helpless. I have been serving as a supporter and have not made any contribution to the team so far. I didn't gain enough trust to propose &quot;combat&quot;.</p>

<p>This was totally my mistake.</p>

<p>If Lily were here, she would probably sigh and say, &quot;It's still too young.&quot;</p>

<p>Just when I was worrying about what to do,</p>

<p>&quot;I'm OK.&quot;</p>

<p>Reki-san, who had been silent all this time, said this.</p>

<p>&quot;Fight, I listen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You...what did you say!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The instructions for escaping just now were very good... much better than the dwarf's roar (forcing others to do something difficult)...&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone was taken aback. Student Iglin spoke out, but classmate Reki said calmly through a black mask. Eglin-san suddenly shrank, and Chris, who was looking back and forth between us, for some reason, put his hands on his hips and puffed up his chest.</p>

<p>&quot;That's okay with me! After all, Lapi's ears and tail are both furry! It must be a good fight!&quot;</p>

<p>There is no connection between the two, and the ears and tail are still disguise props, but for some reason, classmate Chris also believed me. Just as I was surprised again, Nina, who was looking at me, kept staring at me&mdash;as if she was recalling the figure of &quot;Lappy Flemish&quot; so far&mdash;and then slowly smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;I also want to hear about Lapi-kun's battle.&quot;</p>

<p>Three against one except me. Seeing the team's voting results, Iglin was truly speechless this time.</p>

<p>He muttered for a while, then seemed to give up and pointed his index finger at me.</p>

<p>&quot;If this is some boring battle, I won't listen to you!&quot;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really not easy for the team.</p>

<p>I thought like this after being supported by Lily and Welf until now.</p>

<p>But since you have gained credit and &quot;trust&quot; - then you have to respond.</p>

<p>Under the swaying bangs, I suppressed a smile, swore so, and nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Then Lapi-kun, what should we do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what you have to do is not difficult...&quot;</p>

<p>We naturally formed a circle and leaned together. After hearing Nina&rsquo;s question, I also gathered my thoughts.</p>

<p>Although I have only had sex with Lily a few times, but...</p>

<p>&quot;Would you like to try 'hunting'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Make full use of the terrain.&quot;</p>

<p>The first thing I learned from Miss Eina's lecture was this basic tactic.</p>

<p>Now, &quot;Team 3&quot; and I have returned to this foundation.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, is it really okay...!?&quot;</p>

<p>In the mist-shrouded hall, I heard the growling voice of classmate Iglin, and I hid the words 'probably' deep in my throat.</p>

<p>Would it be better for me to go there? But I need to make preparations here, and the &quot;Lv. 1 supporter&quot; cannot take on too important a task. Now we can only trust Nina and the others.</p>

<p>Finally, God seemed to hear our prayers as we waited with bated breath... only to hear the continuous sound of the earth approaching towards the hall.</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!&quot; &#12303;</p>

<p>The &quot;young dragon&quot; appeared with the momentum to break through the entrance of the passage.</p>

<p>The ones who rushed into the hall before the dragon were the half-goblin and the little human!</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, I caught it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As expected of me! Even the bait can be used easily!&quot;</p>

<p>As they said, Nina and Chris, who were on &quot;bait duty&quot;, ran towards us and shouted at the same time.</p>

<p>I asked Nina and especially Chris-san to serve as scouts.</p>

<p>Although he is a small human and can fight in the vanguard, he is also very powerful, but this time I want him to use the excellent eyesight unique to his race to find the dragon in the &quot;fog&quot; unique to this floor. After a lot of things happened between me and Lily - trying to steal the &quot;God's Dagger&quot; -, I already know that the eyesight of the small humans still works in this &quot;Fog Floor&quot;.</p>

<p>It is the job of the competent team leader Nina to ensure a safe escape route. The two of them found the little dragon together and lured it here.</p>

<p>Of course, the dragon is followed by other monsters such as &quot;Orcs&quot; and &quot;Little Demons&quot;. Facing an opponent that had been defeated, the team's state remained unchanged.</p>

<p>If you fight normally, you probably won't be able to block the opponent's attack, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;[Dark Thunder]!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&quot; ? &#12303;</p>

<p>In this hall, a large number of Reki-san's &quot;Land Mine Magic&quot; have been placed.</p>

<p>When Chris and the others went to &quot;fish for monsters&quot;, we buried as many magic light explosives as possible in advance.</p>

<p>&quot;Orcs&quot; and &quot;little monsters&quot; just step on the hidden magic circle, which will trigger a dark flash and explode into pieces one after another. The &quot;Baby Dragon&quot; is really impossible to knock down, but the left front foot that stepped on the mine has been destroyed. Nina and Chris, as agreed in advance, fled to both sides of the passage and moved to a safe area in the hall.</p>

<p>Things are simple.</p>

<p>It just took a little time to turn the ordinary hall into a &quot;favorable terrain that can be used effectively&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!&quot; ? &#12303;</p>

<p>The monsters that did not step on the mines were harvested one by one by the furious classmate Iglin. At this time, the little dragon roared, seeming to want to call his &quot;companions&quot;, but to no avail.</p>

<p>The walls of the hall have been damaged. Mazes are taking priority over completing structures and cannot spawn new enemies. Monster Feast will not spawn. This is also the reason why I stay in this hall.</p>

<p>While Reki-san was laying the mines, Iglin-san and I destroyed the walls of the maze. This hall has now become a minefield, and it is also our &quot;hunting ground&quot;.</p>

<p>Seduced out, set a trap, and brought down.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really just pure hunting.</p>

<p>This cannot be done when everyone goes their own way, but if the team can work together, there are as many ways as possible.</p>

<p>(Everything is &quot;experience&quot;.)</p>

<p>It's just that I have expressed all the &quot;experience&quot; I have accumulated until now - reaching the first level adventurer position.</p>

<p>Even if I can't teach others how to fight like Miss Ais and others, I can still do this kind of &quot;explanation&quot;!</p>

<p>&quot;Surround it, surround it!&quot;</p>

<p>The only remaining monster is a dragon.</p>

<p>What is floating here is not mist, but black fire powder. In this dreamlike space, the &quot;Third Team&quot; attacks from all directions, forcing the painful &quot;young dragon&quot; into a desperate situation.</p>

<p>then,</p>

<p>&quot;Oh laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!&quot;</p>

<p>Using the bait (support) from Nina and the others, Iglin-san used the dead tree as a jumping platform, jumped up high, aimed at the dragon's back, and swung the sledgehammer.</p>

<p>&quot;Goooh&mdash;&mdash;!&quot; ? &#12303;</p>

<p>A fatal blow that penetrated the dragon's scales and spine. I have already told him where the enemy's &quot;magic stone&quot; is.</p>

<p>With its head raised high and its body thrown back, the &quot;young dragon&quot; let out a death cry, and then a large amount of dust rose up.</p>

<p>please&#8230;&#8230;! !</p>

<p>After witnessing the monster's defeat, I was still watching nervously along with Nina and the others.</p>

<p>As if praying, I looked towards the explosion site where the little dragon turned into dust and dissipated, and then... there was a Gulu sound.</p>

<p>The sharp &quot;little dragon's teeth&quot; rolled down to the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!! Xiaolong's &quot;dropped item&quot;! It's so good!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's so, so great, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!&quot;</p>

<p>Classmate Chris shouted long live&mdash;! , raised his hands and cheered.</p>

<p>Then Iglin-san let out a sound of joy, and Reki-san grabbed the mask with her fingers and pulled it down, with a smile on her cute lips.</p>

<p>Finally, it was Nina who ran to me, who was standing there blankly.</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun, you are so awesome! The battle is so perfect!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, well, that's great... Ah, Nina, I'm sorry for putting you in danger this time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, there is no such thing!&quot;</p>

<p>It was the first time I saw Nina so excited. She held my hands tightly and kept shaking them up and down.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but smile shyly. At this moment, Iglin-san and the others, who were holding &quot;Little Dragon's Fang&quot;, also came over.</p>

<p>&quot;A layman! No, Lapi! You are very good at it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, no, it's just that everyone is very powerful, but I'm not...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you being modest! I think you are a maze nerd, right! Everything you say is so spot-on! That's why you entered school at such a difficult time, right!? Isn't that right!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, ah ha ha ha...&quot;</p>

<p>Classmate Iglin kept smiling, and Peng Peng patted my back, making me smile bitterly.</p>

<p>After all, I am actually an active adventurer, so even if I don&rsquo;t succeed, I&rsquo;m not far off?</p>

<p>&quot;Lappi, you are such a lucky rabbit! Become my guardian beast from today on!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you very much?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yeah--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-yeah&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>Classmates Chris and Lucky also shared some incredible joy with me.</p>

<p>Seeing the &quot;Third Team&quot; who was extremely excited for a rare moment, I solemnly expressed my gratitude.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you very much, Eglin-san, Reki-san, Chris-san. Thank you for your willingness to believe in me&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just Eglin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Call me Iglin! Don't use honorifics either!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me too, you can just call me by my name! After all, starting from today, you are my best friend in writing!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me too...name for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Looking at the smiling faces of Eglin-san and the others, I also smiled unconsciously.</p>

<p>It's incredible, it feels like the distance between us has shortened a lot.</p>

<p>A &quot;successful experience&quot; that can be shared with peers. The longer you suffer together, the greater the joy at the end.</p>

<p>This is the dungeon. And the fun aspect of group battles.</p>

<p>I unexpectedly returned to my original intention and I was so happy that my heart wanted to fly out.</p>

<p>&quot;...Nina.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;Um!&quot;</p>

<p>After laughing with Nina and the others, I called her one last time.</p>

<p>My intention must have been conveyed.</p>

<p>Nina nodded in response to me, then took a step forward and said seriously:</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, listen to me. I think this is the dungeon. If we don't work together, we will definitely not be able to move forward.&quot;</p>

<p>The students who had previously turned a deaf ear to the squad leader's words were now looking at her and listening carefully.</p>

<p>&quot;So, after this, I also hope that everyone can work together. Don't let this team be called the 'crane tail' again. ...What do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>The answer I got was &quot;...I can't help it.&quot; This was still not frank enough.</p>

<p>&quot;Even if it's for my dream, it's a headache if I can't get 'credits'. ...So, let me help you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I also think it's easier than fighting alone this time! Let's try it next time!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dwarves and small humans are so simple... But, no problem.&quot;</p>

<p>After hearing the answers from the three people, I felt relieved, while Nina seemed to be deeply moved, with a little tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>We stuffed the &quot;dropped items&quot; into my backpack, carried them carefully, and left the maze.</p>

<p>After returning to the surface, I found that the sun had already set.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the sense of accomplishment, the light of the sunset looks very soft and warm.</p>

<p>The smiling &quot;Third Team&quot; did not go back to the &quot;School District&quot; directly, but walked over to the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;...Hey, let's forget it, right? If you want to exchange for the &quot;Magic Stone&quot;, the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; can also be used...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Today is the anniversary of our breakthrough to the &quot;upper level&quot;! Such a small exchange office is not suitable for us who have triumphed! We should be proud of ourselves at the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot;!&quot;</p>

<p>Since the sledgehammer was loosened and carried on the back, the dwarf is now &quot;Noble Master Eglin&quot;. I couldn't help but smile bitterly when I heard what he said, but Nina looked a little dull.</p>

<p>&quot;but&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Nina who wants us to keep in step! I know this is called KY!&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing the words of Iglin and Chris, Nina was speechless and closed her mouth.</p>

<p>As for me, I wanted to go to the guild's bulletin board to collect information before and after exploring the dungeon, so I agreed - although I was a little afraid of meeting someone I knew - but seeing that she was not very active, I was a little confused.</p>

<p>However, this question was immediately solved.</p>

<p>After arriving at the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot;, we successfully completed the exchange in a corner of the hall, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;...Could it be Nina?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!&quot;</p>

<p>Nina was about to leave the hall quickly when a voice reached her shoulder.</p>

<p>It was Miss Eina who called her name.</p>

<p>&quot;...It's Nina, right? It's me, Eina! Do you recognize me!?&quot;</p>

<p>Nina held her breath when she saw her emerald eyes of the same color as her own wide open deep in the glasses.</p>

<p>Then, she looked away and ran out.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, wait, Nina!&quot;</p>

<p>She shook off Miss Eina's words and rushed outside.</p>

<p>Standing still on the spot with Iglin and the others, I looked back and forth between Miss Eina, who looked hurt, and Nina, who was running away, and at the same time reluctantly chose the latter.</p>

<p>I am a student (rabbi) now, but this kind of thing is no excuse at all. I said 'I'm sorry' in my heart and chased after my classmate who looked wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;Nina, wait a minute! What's wrong!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haah, haah...!&quot;</p>

<p>I ran on the street at dusk, weaving through the crowds, barely keeping a close distance, and when Nina finally stopped in the central square, I ran over.</p>

<p>On the northwest side of the square, a half-elf girl stood in front of a fountain with the sound of spraying foam, holding her chest tightly.</p>

<p>&quot;...Sorry, it's nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;B-but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, it doesn't matter... I just feel like I'm worthless...&quot;</p>

<p>Nina lowered her head and said so. There was a shadow on her face that I had never seen before.</p>

<p>Looking at her with a crescent-colored light, I couldn't ask further, nor could I say a considerate word.</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm going back to the 'school district' first. ...I'm sorry, Lapi-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Nina stepped onto the main road leading to the port town in the southwest of the city and disappeared into the depths of the crowd.</p>

<p>Wearing the &quot;School District&quot; combat uniform, I attracted many curious eyes from around me, but I could only slowly look toward the southwest and northwest.</p>

<p>&quot;...Maybe it's just being nosy, but...&quot;</p>

<p>Those two must have been sisters, and I was always helped by them.</p>

<p>So, I made up my mind.</p>

<p>I turned back the way I came, lowered my head, and asked Eglin and the others to take care of my backpack and other luggage, and then I was given time to move around freely.</p>

<p>&quot;Aha&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>When the sunset completely loses its figure and the sky is filled with stars.</p>

<p>I saw her sighing and coming out of the back door of the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot;, so I talked to her:</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Eina.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh...? B-Bell-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>Eina looked at me, who was squatting next to her with a sense of guilt, and her eyes widened.</p>

<p>I'm not wearing a wig now. The &quot;School District&quot; combat uniform was also taken off, and the camouflage suit was stuffed into a bag prepared in advance.</p>

<p>After I separated from Eglin and the others, I secretly walked to the alley of the &quot;Adventurer Avenue&quot; on Northwest Street. After confirming that no one was around, I walked into the underground store &quot;Witch's Hermitage&quot;. It was the magician's shop that I went to during the Battle of Maze Street and during my escape date with Ms. Hill.</p>

<p>If there were rumors that students from the &quot;School District&quot; were entering and leaving the [Hestia Familia] base, things would be very troublesome... So after thinking about it, this was the only place I could rely on. The shop owner, Ms. Lenno, said helplessly, &quot;Again Here we come.&quot; He welcomed me in. I bowed my head again and again, and used the fari gold coins I shared from Iglin and the others to buy clothes and change into them. When I left the store, I was no longer a student (Rapi), but turned back into an adventurer (Bell), and then , I came to the guild headquarters.</p>

<p>&quot;W-why are you here? And you feel more dressed up than usual...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, ah ha ha...&quot;</p>

<p>The clothes I bought casually were judged as dressing up, which made me feel a little complicated. At the same time, I also got to the point.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, I was at the &quot;Guild Headquarters&quot; in the evening, and I saw Eina-san... with a girl who looked very much like Eina-san...&quot;</p>

<p>When I said this with guilt and lies, Miss Eina's face was immediately colored with sadness. This deepened my guilt.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, I became a little concerned, and waited until Miss Eina got off work... I just thought, could you tell me something, or something like that.&quot;</p>

<p>I knew very well that I was interfering in their affairs, but I really couldn't ignore it.</p>

<p>Whether it's Nina or Miss Eina.</p>

<p>Miss Eina, who seemed a little confused, finally raised her face and nodded slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;The child's name is Nina... she is my sister.&quot;</p>

<p>Wearing the clothes of a guild employee and eating with adventurers would affect the guild's image, so we first went around to Miss Eina's house, and then went into a very stylish restaurant in the north of the city with her after changing clothes. The windows used here are not wooden windows, but expensive glass windows. Rather than an adventurer's tavern, it is more like a store where upper-class people can dine safely.</p>

<p>Miss Eina, who was sitting opposite, slowly began to tell while eating her meal.</p>

<p>&quot;We are six years apart...but actually, I have no memories with that child.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh...? W-what's going on?&quot;</p>

<p>There is indeed a big age difference, but there are no memories...?</p>

<p>&quot;Because the child was just born, I went to the 'school district'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our mother was very weak. She couldn't survive without medicine. My father worked very hard, but... as a child at that time, I was thinking about what I wanted to do. In fact, I wanted to work and make money right away, but my mother asked me to at least Go to the &quot;school district&quot; to study...&quot;</p>

<p>This was the first time I heard about Miss Aina&rsquo;s family situation, and I was quite shocked.</p>

<p>Miss Eina was only six years old when she entered the &quot;school district&quot;. As soon as Nina was born, she embarked on a journey to the Garden of Learning alone.</p>

<p>She chose to work in the guild through the &quot;school district&quot;, and initially she was interested in the generous salary. In order to send the money to her parents, she said with a little self-deprecation.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't go back to my hometown at all. Nina probably won't remember me. In other words, she probably only knows that she 'has a sister' and treats me no differently than a stranger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This, this kind of thing...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry, I said it a bit weird. But we are just so estranged. I only vaguely remember what the child looked like when he was a baby...When I was finally able to go back to visit my relatives, it was Nina's turn to go to the &quot;School District&quot; &#12303;.&#12303;</p>

<p>Miss Eina and her sisters are so far apart in terms of distance and time that I can only listen to her story in a daze.</p>

<p>Nina must have entered the &quot;school district&quot; with the same purpose as Eina-san.</p>

<p>I was separated from my family for the sake of my family and to help my family. Maybe in the lower world, such things are normal, but I still feel helpless and sad.</p>

<p>&quot;I have also sent letters. Not to mention my mother and others, I also sent them to Nina who goes to the &quot;school district&quot;. The letter says, 'You may be confused, but I am your sister, so if you have any troubles, just tell me. '. When I received the reply, the article above was very blunt, but I was very happy...&quot;</p>

<p>At this time, Miss Eina, who had always been smiling, suddenly became depressed.</p>

<p>&quot;But, from a certain point on, I never received a reply... I was wondering... if I was too busy, if I thought it was troublesome to send letters, or... if it was because I clearly didn't see you Even though I haven&rsquo;t done anything for her, I still think of myself as my sister, so I hate me...&quot;</p>

<p>So I never got to send her a letter, she sadly confessed.</p>

<p>&quot;My mother and others told me, 'There is no such thing, Nina values &#8203;&#8203;you very much,' but...I was very scared. So this year, when the &quot;school district&quot; came back...I couldn't just be happy. No, actually it was A little scared. After all, Nina is on that ship.&quot;</p>

<p>...That's right.</p>

<p>When I mentioned the &quot;school district&quot;, and for a moment in Port Town, I saw Miss Eina's sad eyes, which turned out to be thinking about Nina.</p>

<p>&quot;...So when I saw you today, the feeling of 'meeting for the first time' was stronger than if I hadn't seen you for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh... But, Eina-san immediately realized that it was Nina... her sister, right? And you even took the initiative to talk to her...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I understand. After all, she is wearing the clothes of the 'school district'...and she looks exactly like my mother.&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps recalling the scene in the evening, Miss Eina showed a smile.</p>

<p>Although Miss Eina said that she is exactly the same as their mother... But I think Miss Eina and Nina are exactly the same. No matter what others say, I think they are like a pair of sisters.</p>

<p>&quot;But Nina doesn't seem to want to see me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all, she just ran away... As expected, I was hated by her.&quot;</p>

<p>At the end, Miss Eina forced herself to make a joke.</p>

<p>However, it turns out that&rsquo;s the case. Now I kind of understand the relationship between the two.</p>

<p>Nina also has some kind of &quot;troubles&quot;... Teacher Leon said so.</p>

<p>Does this have a lot to do with what Miss Eina just said?</p>

<p>Teacher Leon said that she hoped I would listen to her directly...but could I really ask?</p>

<p>At least it wouldn't be possible to force her to speak.</p>

<p>I have a hunch... Nina's problem is more complicated than Miss Eina's.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's a good thing for me to intervene in what can be called a sisterly issue.</p>

<p>I need to think about it myself.</p>

<p>But anyway, now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I think Eina-san's sister must... no, she definitely doesn't hate you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her expression is very painful. She would not show that kind of expression when facing someone she hates.&quot;</p>

<p>I want to convey directly to her what I felt next to the two of them at that time.</p>

<p>Whether it was Nina's speechless profile after being called by Miss Eina, or the hazy expression stained with the color of the sunset when she rushed outside, they were far from disgust.</p>

<p>I stared straight into her wide-open emerald eyes, the same color as Nina's, and firmly concluded.</p>

<p>Miss Eina froze there, motionless...and then her eyes became moist, but now she forgot her sadness and smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Bell-kun...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, no, you're welcome...but I interfered even though it had nothing to do with it...I'm so sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, there is no such thing. I'm... very happy.&quot;</p>

<p>I suddenly came to my senses and couldn't help but apologize to her, and then Miss Aegina slowly shook her head.</p>

<p>As stupid as I am, I am always fascinated by the sight of young women with flushed cheeks and quiet smiles.</p>

<p>I immediately felt embarrassed and smiled awkwardly, so Eina-san covered her mouth and chuckled.</p>

<p>As if he had calculated the timing, or as if he had seen something heart-warming and wanted to pay the price, the waiter poured amber wine into Miss Eina's empty glass. By the way, I had to go back to the &quot;school zone&quot;, so I drank juice.</p>

<p>We thanked each other as if we were toasting again, and just as our lips were about to touch the glass&mdash;there was a bang.</p>

<p>There was a dull sound coming from beside us sitting by the window.</p>

<p>No, the only window next to us facing the avenue... I thought so, looked over there, and then,</p>

<p>&quot;Bell-kun&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lord Bell&quot;</p>

<p>Then they found Kami-sama and Lily's heads pressed against the window glass, their eyes making dull mouth movements.</p>

<p>&quot;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?&quot;</p>

<p>Eina-san and I both received a huge impact that seemed like we would fall off our chairs, and we cried out.</p>

<p>When I looked carefully, Kami-sama and the others were followed by Welf, Miss Ming, and Miss Haruhime, Miss Lyu. In short, all members of the [Hestia Familia] were there. I couldn't help but shout in my heart, &quot;Why!&quot; ? &#12303;.</p>

<p>While we were panicking, Kami-sama and Lily, who no longer hit the windows frequently, strode around to the entrance, shook off the wailing waiter's restraints, and broke into the store!</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing~~~~~~~~~~, Bell-kun~~~~~~~~~~~~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;K-Kami-sama!? Why are you here!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't answer questions with questions, Bell-sama! You shouldn't be in the 'school district', right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Li, Lili, no, I have something to do with Miss Eina, so I sneaked out for a while...!&quot;</p>

<p>The heavy pressure that seemed to be dragging me into the abyss made me tremble. Even though I had done nothing wrong at all, I still said something like a defense, and then&mdash;&mdash;Kami-sama and Lily's eyebrows swung! The earth stood up high.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Believe it or not, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!&quot;</p>

<p>In an instant, there was a huge thunderstorm! ! My ears ah-! ?</p>

<p>&quot;I dress up so beautifully just to seduce you, this consultant!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no temptation, God Hestia! Wearing a guild uniform will affect your image, so this outfit is a last resort...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, that's right, it's just tempting~! Looking at her moist eyes and her feminine expression, she even thinks about taking the innocent and ignorant Bell back home if she has the chance -!! Lily knows it all too well!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't have that, Artis!!&quot;</p>

<p>Even Miss Eina, whose face was red, was affected. I can&rsquo;t understand anything anymore! !</p>

<p>Could someone please explain this situation? ?</p>

<p>&quot;Sir Bell, actually... it was the cold-faced Sir Helen who sent Sir Sir's secret message to the guild hall...&quot;</p>

<p>Then, among the [Hestia Familia] who followed Lord Kami and the others into the store, Miss Ming spoke awkwardly.</p>

<p>&quot;The letter says that the shadow of a witch appears next to the White Rabbit who is being followed by Mr. Hegni... It needs to be dealt with quickly. There is also a map on it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since the Warrior (Tough Warrior) who dotes on rabbits might let Bell-dono go, I leave it up to my subordinates... or rather Hestia-sama and the others...&quot;</p>

<p>Being followed! ? By Mr. Hegney! ? How did you do it! ? I didn't feel any suspicious &quot;sight&quot; at all! ? Could it be that that person knows how not to scare rabbits (pets)! ?</p>

<p>It should be impossible to invade the &quot;School District&quot;, so... Could it be that I was being watched while I was in the city! ? Miss Hill, what are you doing&mdash;! ?</p>

<p>&quot;The girl in the tavern seemed to be trapped inside the rich hostess, unable to move. The &quot;goddess attendant&quot; went crazy after completing the owner's order. It took a lot of effort to hold her down... She broke in In the kitchen, we tried to take away the knife, but we managed to knock her unconscious...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;!?&quot;</p>

<p>Following Miss Ming, Welf, who was a little injured, said tiredly. What he said was the most speechless thing I have ever said. At the same time, the body temperature of the whole body is also dropping rapidly.</p>

<p>Although I didn't see the scene, the scene at that time still clearly appeared in my mind!</p>

<p>Miss Helen, are you still thinking about killing me? ?</p>

<p>My face switched rapidly between seven colors as if I was sick. Miss Eina was still shouting loudly with Lord Kami and the others, looking back and forth on both sides, and Miss Haruhime was panicking, and now she looked like the only one. conscience.</p>

<p>By the way, Ms. Liu, who was looking at me with a blank face all the time, was the most terrifying! !</p>

<p>&quot;After leaving the base, you shouldn't have had one girl after another, spending time in their homes all day long, Bell-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, no!? I'm studying hard!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No&mdash;it's hard to say that, Hestia-sama! Hermes-sama may have instilled something in Bell-sama!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Believe me, Lily!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Compared to this, Bell, I haven't received a reply to my confession yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Chirp, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh! ?&quot;</p>

<p>After Kami-sama Liliana screamed loudly, my strange voice also broke out! !</p>

<p>Why do you choose to say it at this time, Miss Liu&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! ?</p>

<p>&quot;B-Bell-kun, is this true!? She confessed her love... Ah, speaking of it, it seems that we had such an exchange during the war game...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, you remember that it was broadcast to the entire Orario through the &quot;Mirror of God&quot;, right - uh, Lord Lyu!? Why are you kneeling on the ground suddenly!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her face looks like a ripe strawberry!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The whole city... in front of everyone... the vows of love... are all heard...... eternal shame...... help me, Alize...&quot; &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't add fuel to the fire and then blow yourself up, okay, you big idiot!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's going on, Bell-kun&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please tell me the matter!! Tell me clearly!! Lily won't let you go back until you fully understand, Mr. Bell! If you say that, please return to the base immediately!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Bell... I should have stopped it... I'm so sorry, I'm such a scumbag...&quot;</p>

<p>After coming closer, she seemed to remember something, and Miss Eina stopped moving, Miss Minato was shocked by the goblin who suddenly collapsed to the ground, Miss Haruhime was panicked by the goblin's red face that seemed to be burning, Miss Lyu covered her face with her hands as if she was about to say something like, &quot;A fragile person is called justice.&quot; After Welf's roar, Kami-sama and Lily's roars also flew over. Finally, I heard Mr. Hegney apologize to me. Was it an auditory hallucination?</p>

<p>I was helpless to do anything about the chaos in front of me, and the urge to roll my eyes and pass out came over me.</p>

<p>Anyway... we caused trouble to the restaurant, so we're going to apologize to them sincerely, and then don't go anywhere near this place again.</p>

<p>&quot;Rapi-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>When I returned to the &quot;school district&quot; looking miserable, it was already late at night when the date was about to change.</p>

<p>Normally, at this time, the gangway at the control level that was built like a suspension bridge in the port should be closed, but it is still open now. Standing in front was Nina, who looked worried.</p>

<p>She ran over, and after returning to Ms. Renault's shop, I put on my wig and combat uniform again, hiding my fatigue and trying my best to smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Where have you been!? Seeing that you haven't come back, I'm really worried!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm really sorry... A lot of things happened in Orario...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Because of me? Because I made you worry...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's not! It's really not! It's not Nina's fault!&quot;</p>

<p>Nina just got angry and immediately showed a sad expression. Seeing this, I quickly denied it.</p>

<p>Going to see Eina-san was my own initiative. Rather, it was as if I was secretly investigating. What happened after that felt a bit out of control, but it was all my own fault...!</p>

<p>Anyway, I wanted to tell her that there was absolutely no need for her to blame herself, but Nina seemed to be sensitive to something,</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;big liar.&quot;</p>

<p>Just listen to her whispering.</p>

<p>The expression on her face seemed to be awkward or blaming me, but she also felt a little happy.</p>

<p>&quot;...I also caused trouble for Lapi-kun and everyone else, so we can clear both sides.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-really? I don't think so, but...if that's the case, that would be great, right?&quot;</p>

<p>I scratched my head with one hand and couldn't help but tell the truth. Nina really laughed &quot;haha&quot; this time.</p>

<p>Seeing this smile, I finally felt relieved.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we go back to the dormitory? Although there will be no &quot;special internship&quot; tomorrow, there is still training.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, regarding this matter...can I go to the &quot;Faction Experience&quot; tomorrow, Nina?&quot;</p>

<p>After all the things that happened tonight, Lady Hestia strictly ordered me to go back to [Familia].</p>

<p>In the &quot;School District&quot;, Orario's &quot;Faction Experience&quot; itself is a self-service application form. As long as you explain it carefully to the teachers and get permission, you can do it at any time. I heard that many students outside of the &quot;Combat Techniques&quot; department have already gone through the &quot;Faction Experience&quot; before the &quot;Family Recruitment&quot;.</p>

<p>Although I was very sad that I couldn't train with the &quot;Third Team&quot;, there shouldn't be anything unnatural about it. However, when she heard my application&mdash;&mdash;Nina was obviously shaken.</p>

<p>&quot;L-Lapi-kun...have you decided on a way out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? Ah, well, I want to be an adventurer, so I have a general direction...&quot;</p>

<p>I hurriedly pulled out the settings prepared by Teacher Leon in my mind, and after being confused... Nina lowered her eyes and said sadly, &quot;Really...&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;...Nina?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...! Huh, I'm sorry. I'm going to ask them to start the stopped elevator! Then let's go to the supervisor (Arisa-senpai) for training together!&quot;</p>

<p>Nina suddenly came back to her senses, hurriedly forced out a smile, and then boarded the gangway with a clang.</p>

<p>The sound of waves is faintly audible.</p>

<p>It was the sound of the vast ocean crashing into the Great Soda Lake.</p>

<p>She disappeared deep into the control layer, and I could only watch her back silently.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm~ What a youth!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Lord Eden?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whether it's sweet or bitter, they are the dots that decorate your life! Come and join me~, Aoharu&mdash;&#9734;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;A-Aoharu&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>The blond goddess with a springy face appeared briskly from the back of the gangway. I imitated her and stretched out one hand towards the night sky.</p>

<p>She must have negotiated with the principal (Lord Badr) for Nina and me, and then lowered the gangway.</p>

<p>What exactly is youth (Aoharu)? I thought about it seriously, and at the same time I thanked the goddess for her mercy.</p>

<p>And after that, I had to write several reflective essays...</p>

<p>&quot;Some direction! It's coming!&quot;</p>

<p>Lily's sharp instructions flew over.</p>

<p>In the maze wrapped in bark, the sound of flapping wings echoed around, and the entire team's endless fighting spirit was aimed in the same direction.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll do the 'Sniper Dragonfly'. Welf, please deal with the 'Killer Bee'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;oh!&quot;</p>

<p>The vanguard was divided into two groups. I dealt with the sniper dragonfly group with long-range attacks, and Welf, who possessed the light of level sublimation, took over the newly emerged giant bees.</p>

<p>I'm wearing a battle suit, a &quot;Goliath Scarf&quot;, and Welf's new rabbit armor.</p>

<p>Not a &quot;student&quot;, but the weapon of a long-lost &quot;adventurer&quot;.</p>

<p>The combat uniforms of the &quot;School District&quot; are also very good, but as expected, these are the ones I am more accustomed to wearing.</p>

<p>I felt the feeling of Level 5's ability pulsing through my body and released it completely.</p>

<p>Without using quick-attack shooting (Flame Volt), he immediately got close and like a top spinning in the air, he cut the entire sniper dragonfly group into pieces in one go.</p>

<p>If it were the current team, Lily and Haruhime-san would be exposed to risks if they rushed to the back row where the enemy was attacking from a distance, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruhime, bow your head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Yes!&quot;</p>

<p>Now we have the &quot;absolute central defender&quot;, Ms. Liu!</p>

<p>A large number of &quot;Crazy Beetles&quot; attacked the side of the team, and she passed in front of them like a gust of wind. It seemed that she just touched the new weapon &quot;Elvis Justitia&quot;, and there was a deafening sound, black and gray. explosions occurred one after another.</p>

<p>Now it's a chaotic war. When I wasn't paying attention, this experienced adventurer had switched to a one-hit kill aimed at the core to prevent the &quot;magic stone&quot; from being ingested by monsters. She showed a &quot;skill&quot; that made me widen my eyes. Make full use of the strength that the number &quot;Lv. 6&quot; deserves.</p>

<p>What's more, as if to explain the instructions she just gave to Haruhime-san, she threw one of the two kodachi.</p>

<p>The knife flew past the crouching black turban and passed through the empty space. Just when she thought she had lost her hand, she found that the bark of the tree cracked, and the Kodachi pierced the chest of the monster that was about to appear.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey! Hiccup!&quot; ? &#12303;</p>

<p>The &quot;Lizard Man&quot; who turned into dust and fell down the moment he was born truly demonstrated what &quot;life and death&quot; is.</p>

<p>What is the ideal way to deal with monsters in a dungeon?</p>

<p>In [Family], when this topic was brought up, Miss Liu, who was cleaning the clubhouse, said calmly:</p>

<p>&quot;Solve it the next moment it is born from the wall, or the moment before.&quot;</p>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>Indeed, this way the monster can't do anything.</p>

<p>Even so, it was impossible to achieve the unique skill of accurately detecting the aura of the monster that was about to emerge from the maze wall. At least it's impossible for us today. I'm afraid only Miss Ming who possesses [Yata Black Crow (Skill)] can barely practice it.</p>

<p>But Miss Liu has the same feeling and intuition as this &quot;skill&quot;. There is no doubt that she is the strongest person in [Hestia Familia]!</p>

<p>(Thanks to Miss Liu, the stability of the team has greatly increased!)</p>

<p>This will completely block any side or rear surprise attacks on Lily and Haruhime-san who are rearguard.</p>

<p>Perfect defense brings about a substantial increase in attack power. The vanguard group can focus on the enemy in front without any worries, and the destructive power of the team's assault will be completely different from before.</p>

<p>This feeling of being too reliable made me look towards Ms. Liu, and my eyes met Sora's eyes, and she immediately lowered her head. Even with her face covered, you could see her cheeks were flushed, and even her slender pointed ears were stained red. And I also felt tortured shame and a little dizzy.</p>

<p>The current location is the 22nd floor of the &quot;Big Tree Maze&quot;.</p>

<p>Just as I predicted, after the application for the &quot;Faction Experience&quot; was approved, I changed from &quot;Lappi&quot; back to &quot;Bell&quot;, returned to the &quot;Zohuo Pavilion&quot;, and was questioned by the god who had been waiting for me early in the morning. Asked again. Sitting with Miss Liu.</p>

<p>The two of us blushed, and after several questions and answers that were so incoherent that we couldn't even understand them, Kami-sama said &quot;Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas] Be continued between 2018 and 2015 this topic is tonight,&quot; and went out to work. I don&rsquo;t know how long it will take before I can make up my mind to reply to Miss Liu...</p>

<p>In short, I didn&rsquo;t expect to have any other plans all day today. While I was away, Lily and the others also re-examined the team&rsquo;s cooperation. Now that this is a rare opportunity, let&rsquo;s accompany Lily and the others to explore the maze.</p>

<p>It has been less than four months since I first set foot on this floor.</p>

<p>[Hestia Familia] has grown to the point where it can easily break through layers below the 20th floor alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Bell-sama, Lyu-sama&mdash;! We are fighting now, please concentrate! Why are you looking at each other like students, like the sweet and sour youth (Aoharu)&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>At this time, Lily quickly noticed our appearance and issued a stern warning. Is Aoharu popular?</p>

<p>The ugly sight of Lv. 5 and Lv. 6 being blamed made me want to cry a little, and at the same time, the entire team began to deal with the new wave of monsters.</p>

<p>&quot;...?&quot;</p>

<p>At this time, unintentionally.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of the battle, I glanced behind me.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Bell, where are you looking!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Sir Bell?&quot;</p>

<p>Welf, who was fighting on the side, called me, and from some distance away, Miss Ming, who was directly behind me, showed a confused expression. Ms. Liu, who was fighting from the side of the team, seemed to have noticed something and glanced at me.</p>

<p>I immediately said &quot;Sorry!&quot; and cut into the enemy with Welf.</p>

<p>He cut the stag monster &quot;Sword-Antlered Deer&quot; in two, and split the large monster &quot;Mammoth Yugong&quot; in the depths with Welf, and ended the battle safely.</p>

<p>&quot;...Um, Miss Ming. Can you tell me something?&quot;</p>

<p>The long battle is over and it's time to finally take a breath.</p>

<p>After picking up the &quot;magic stones&quot; and &quot;dropped items&quot; with Lily and the others, I said to Miss Ming while filling the water bottle.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter, Sir Bell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was wondering, since Miss Liu stayed at the center back in the last battle, could Miss Ming also move to the vanguard position...&quot;</p>

<p>In order to confirm and &quot;update&quot; the coordination and formation, I expressed what I felt.</p>

<p>&quot;Although I was in a good position at the time, I felt that if Miss Ming came to the vanguard, I could take another step forward and attract all the attention of the enemy in front. In this way, in terms of results, the safety of the team would be improved It will also be higher...probably.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see, it's true... I'm very sorry. I didn't think carefully.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, no, I'm not blaming you...! I am the one who said these words with a proud face. I'm sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>Before Miss Lyu joined, Miss Ming, the all-powerful adventurer, was the lifeline of our [Hestia Familia]. She has even used [Yata Black Crow (Skill)] to protect the rearguard (Lily and the others), and her consciousness has always been inclined to the guarding aspect. It is better to say that it proves that Ms. Ming has been making this kind of sacrifice up to now. Behavior. I may have been offended.</p>

<p>Driven by embarrassment, I kept apologizing.</p>

<p>At times like this, I will painfully realize that I am not suitable to be the group leader, but...Lily looked at me, looking very surprised.</p>

<p>&quot;Lily...? What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...It's okay. What Lily wanted to say was spoken out by Mr. Bell first. Should I say he was stunned or something...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!? Hug, sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's nothing. And Lily has never been a vanguard, so she can't say anything to attract the enemy's attention...&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Lily kept staring at me from head to feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Lord Bell... I always feel like you have become smarter?&quot;</p>

<p>...?</p>

<p>She suddenly said something unexpected to me, which made me roll my eyes in surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;My little girl feels the same way. Mr. Bell today always feels very knowledgeable...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Study, knowledge...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, you are indeed a first-level adventurer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so...?&quot;</p>

<p>The words of Haruhime-san and Welf hardly made me feel the same way.</p>

<p>As your level increases, your head will spin faster...well, maybe this is indeed the case...</p>

<p>While I kept tilting my head, Ms. Liu, who was watching us from a distance, pointed out something.</p>

<p>&quot;The 'field of vision' has expanded.&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing this peaceful and awe-inspiring voice, everyone looked towards her.</p>

<p>&quot;Bell, your 'personal' 'vision' is almost complete. Fall into the 'deep' with me and learn how it feels to lure enemies and respond to attacks coming from blind spots. That's it.&quot;</p>

<p>&#8230;It&rsquo;s not that I feel good about myself, but hearing her point it out like this makes me agree.</p>

<p>Miss Ais's teachings are connected with Miss Lyu's teachings, and it feels like what you see expands in one breath.</p>

<p>If that was the &quot;vision&quot; that Miss Lyu mentioned, then Bell Crane had indeed obtained a weapon.</p>

<p>In this sense, it can be said that thanks to the training I received from Alfric-san and the others in the &quot;Battle Wilderness&quot;, my &quot;vision&quot; of blind spots has become sharper now.</p>

<p>Miss Liu continued.</p>

<p>&quot;And now, you are gradually expanding this 'vision' to not only yourself, but the entire team.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It means the perspective of being a defender, right? Lyu-dono.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, please wait, isn't the purpose of the rear guard commander (Lily)...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It should be said that even though it's not a hit, it's not far off. So don't worry, Liliruka. Your command and his 'vision' are different things.&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Ming asked the question, and the content of the question made Lily panic. Then Miss Liu explained it carefully like the eldest daughter among the sisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be more specific, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;tactical vision&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;'Tactical Vision'...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A commander like Liliruka has to overlook the entire battlefield and guide the entire team, while Bell chooses the actions needed by the entire team based on the battle situation, or shares this information.&quot;</p>

<p>To sum it up, Lily's perspective is based on the overall perspective, while my &quot;vision&quot; is based on a partial perspective. This is probably how it feels.</p>

<p>The advantage is that where Lily alone cannot make up for it immediately, the vanguard and center defenders can make up for it. The burden on the commander will be reduced, and more intensive cooperation can be quickly carried out - Ms. Liu added.</p>

<p>&quot;Improving the annihilation efficiency and response speed will benefit the team. It is also critical that people in similar positions can see the same scenery. The commander can observe the actions in the front from the rear and further expand the strategy. There will be many more options.&quot;</p>

<p>After listening to her explanation, Welf and Miss Ming also said &quot;Oh&quot; and made sounds of understanding.</p>

<p>Indeed, as a vanguard attacker, my top priority so far has been to break into the enemy formation. Of course, thanks to the addition of Ms. Liu, the team has become far more stable than before, which gives me the freedom to have &quot;vision&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe the concept of &quot;vision&quot; was also cultivated by Miss Lyu during the [Asteria Familia] era. It&rsquo;s not about waiting for instructions from the center back or the command from the defender, it&rsquo;s just the ability of the forward to think. Can be the lubricant of the team, or the force of the gears. Maybe, Miss Lyu also learned this from someone from the [Asteria Familia].</p>

<p>&quot;Your 'expansion of horizons' this time is because you entered the 'school zone', right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought your trip to the 'School District' this time was a well-timed break. However... even this kind of break will be turned into food for your growth.&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Miss Liu smiled.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed when I was praised, but I also felt happy at the same time.</p>

<p>The time spent in the &quot;school district&quot; is by no means wasted. Perhaps, being able to command the &quot;Third Team&quot; for hunting is also a result of the experience of the last platoon (supporters) and &quot;Martial Arts&quot; and other courses.</p>

<p>I am very happy to be recognized for my studies in the &quot;school district&quot;. What's more, it's like Nina and the others have also been praised, which makes me very proud.</p>

<p>&quot;The cooperation with Bell has been confirmed. It's almost time to go back. After all, the road back is long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I also got a lot of &quot;magic stones&quot; and &quot;dropped items&quot;! As expected, Mr. Lucky Rabbit (Bell) is here, so I make a lot of money!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha&#8230;&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>After that, we completed several more battles and left the &quot;Big Tree Maze&quot;.</p>

<p>I want to return to the base before Lord Kami comes back. Today, the first-level adventurers (Mr. Alfric and others) are visiting the house. At the same time, they are also on guard against illegal intrusion by people who are targeting Haruhime-san, so I am a little worried. Besides, I have to go back to the &quot;school zone&quot; at night.</p>

<p>Just when I was feeling comfortable fatigue and satisfaction from this somewhat busy &quot;double life&quot; of a student and an adventurer,</p>

<p>&quot;Damn you...! You guys from the 'School District'! Don't be too proud!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are the ones, can't you be more polite! It turns out that all adventurers are a bunch of hooligans!&quot;</p>

<p>We were about to enter the cave-like &quot;Cave Maze&quot;. When we entered the 13th floor, we heard a heated argument.</p>

<p>Looking closely, there is an explosive atmosphere floating between a group of adventurers and the &quot;squad&quot; of the &quot;school district&quot;.</p>

<p>Is it a gift from a monster, or is it fighting for prey (monsters)? No matter where I was, it looked very unsettled. When I realized that the adventurers were ready to reach for weapons at any time, my feet moved without permission.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, what's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!? What do you care about&mdash;Shiro, [White Rabbit Swiftfoot]!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First level adventurer!?&quot;</p>

<p>The domineering human adventurer leaned back and backed away when he saw my face, and the other adventurers also became timid as if they were facing a monster from the &quot;deep&quot;. Ah, this reaction is so hurtful...</p>

<p>Naturally, the adventurer group didn't know what I was thinking. They said &quot;No, it's nothing!&quot; and immediately left the scene.</p>

<p>The only ones left were me and the stunned students of the &quot;Combat Techniques Department&quot;.</p>

<p>I don't know them. The articles on the chest are harp and books... Is it [Blakiban]?</p>

<p>&quot;The fastest rabbit in the world!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bell Cronny! The rude man who invaded the 'School District'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you planning to help us!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we did get help, so thank you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Thank you very much for helping us! Bah!&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>The team of four people thanked me together, and then spat on the ground in unison.</p>

<p>Seeing their backs leaving with the neat movements of an army, I felt like crying. Sure enough, I must not let Nina and the others discover my identity...</p>

<p>&quot;A student of the 'school district'. You too are completely hated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's my fault...there's nothing I can do about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really don't know if I am thanking you or hostile to you...&quot;</p>

<p>Welf and Lily, who had witnessed the whole process, also gathered over.</p>

<p>When I dropped my shoulders in frustration, Haruhime-san spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;There seemed to be a dispute just now...did something happen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Most of the students in the &quot;School District&quot; with good conduct are opposed to the lawless adventurers... When the &quot;School District&quot; returns to Hong Kong, we often see this scene. Whether on the surface or in the underground city.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all, the manners and etiquette taught in the 'School District' are the furthest thing from adventurers...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's just a common thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Liu, Lily, and Welf replied as if they were talking about the unique scenery of this period.</p>

<p>Ming-san and I, who have little experience in Orario, and Haruhime-san, who has been living in a narrow world like Flower Street, said &quot;Ouch--&quot;, and the entire team's reaction was divided into two types.</p>

<p>But, that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>From what they said, it seems that the rude adventurers and the students of the &quot;school district&quot; don't get along well...</p>

<p>&quot;Arrogant brats... just wait and see.&quot;</p>

<p>I looked towards the front of the maze where the adventurers had left.</p>

<p>I always felt as if I heard some malice that concerned me (murmured), and I had a somewhat unpleasant premonition.</p>
