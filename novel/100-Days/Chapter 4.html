<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-2"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 4 &#8211; I’ll Have my Cute Little Brother Travel</h1><p class="calibre2">&mdash;65 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, isn’t that Lady Lelouche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“She looks as filthy as always… our future princess is so unsightly…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…No wonder her fiancé abandoned her.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ve heard that she often tries to bully his new partner.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;Kusu kusu kusu…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I could hear their giggles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Whenever I walked around school, there wasn’t a single day I wasn’t exposed to those unpleasant stares and gossip.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, that couldn’t be helped either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to my daily swordsmanship training, my skin was being burned. My hands were enveloped in callouses. I didn’t have time to tie my black hair, so I had left it hanging in a low braid from the morning. I didn’t wear any make up because my sweat would only ruin it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the beginning, I must had been an eyesore to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a duke family, the Elcage Family was one with a long history. We also had exuberant wealth. After father got married, he wanted to create an impression of wealth and authority to keep my mother, a ‘foreign beauty’, from feeling miserable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My black hair, which I inherited from my mother, was considered rare in that kingdom. As such, it became a target of jealousy. Moreover, to maintain good relations with the foreign kingdom, I, her daughter, was made into the future queen. Thus, some people might find the idea distasteful.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">As for followers?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I had decided to never trust people who sold admiration, so I refused them from the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just because I had been forsaken by my fiancé, they called out to me… what a bunch of weirdos.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, if you have any problems, I’ll hear you out.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did he wait for me to come to school?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as I hurried across the school gate, the dazzling blond prince&mdash;Sazanjill, called out to me. I didn’t see Lumiere anywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Where’s Ms. Lumiere?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“She’s absent today. She seems to have developed a fever.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, then I shall deliver her assignments after school.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere did her best. She got a perfect score on the last quiz. Whenever we studied together, her head was always buried in books. The number of mistakes she made were decreasing considerably. She still cried every day, so she had double-eyelids… However, after some time, they’d soon return to their old, adorable, form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if she had a fever of wisdom, she still had to study. Of course, I’d give her a book with an easier topic that time around&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Whoops, I completely forgot what I was talking about.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Which do you think is better? An‘<em class="calibre3">Encyclopedia of Famous Paintings From Each Country’, </em>or the ‘<em class="calibre3">Dictionary to Help with Foreign Monologues’</em>? As for me, I think that the former is best for deepening the knowledge about the customs of each country, while the latter will encourage conversations with foreigners in the future.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…No, sorry. I’m the one who told her to take a rest. I really thought I had to talk with you. Can we meet after school?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I see, so Ms. Lumiere is fine?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In that case, I’d have to arrange for both books to arrive by noon. Surely, she’d be able to finish about 500 pages in a day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, even if it was&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;it was difficult to turn down the request of His Highness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it was presented as an offer, I definitely had to adhere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, I have plans for after school today.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, is it more important than me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, it’s a matter of life and death.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards that, His Highness was taken aback.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I seriously had no time for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The core problem hadn’t yet been solved&mdash;it hadn’t even been tackled, let alone that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the pressure of my gaze, His Highness gulped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“T, then, I’ll invite you another time.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, let me be the one who invites you next time.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">And the next time, will also be the last.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">But I promised&mdash;I’d definitely talk to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When that happened, I hoped we could talk with each other with smiles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The education for my successor was progressing well. I had also trained her for emergencies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was time to prepare for the next step.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fact that Lumiere was taking the day off made it easier. In order to make effective use of that free time, I returned home as soon as classes were over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Rufus, are you there?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I knocked on the door of my younger brother’s room. There was no reply&mdash;even though there should be one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My younger brother, Rufus Elcage, who was supposed to be the successor of my family, had secluded himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was pretending to not hear me. Then, I had the right to get angry, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The axe I had prepared glinted&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;where did I get it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it had something to do with money. As for any more than that, it would a maiden’s secret.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Heiya&mdash;!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I screamed as I swung the axe down.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Basha, boshi&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;</em>The furniture in the house was made of wood, and the doors were no exception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite originally being a powerless lady, I had been training in swordsmanship these days. I had learned a little about how to swing, and how to shift my weight when swinging a weapon.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Busu, busu.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a little refreshing to see the holes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, I could hear the screams of my cute little brother.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Sister!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’d be dangerous if I hit Rufus. Thus, I stopped. After a while, the door slowly opened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A boy with the same black hair as me appeared. He was 13-years-old. He also had a bad sleeping habit. He looked afraid.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Why would you put your paint brush in your pajamas?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Look, it has become unnecessarily colorful…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">My younger brother ran towards me while half-crying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Sister… what ails you?! In the morning and evening, you keep swinging a blade… it’s scary! Father and mother have decided to consult with the church, thinking that you’ve possessed by something evil…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufu, what a bizarre situation, even though I talk to god every night. Not to mention, I was indebted to him. I had to thank him next time. What should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I were to explain everything to Rufus, he’d truly think his sister had gone mad. Oh, no, a madman wouldn’t use that sort of word when referring to herself. I had to get through that life with a smile before I could say it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m alright. In fact, this is the first time I’ve ever been this motivated.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is that, how scary!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Even if he said that, what should I do other than being motivated these days? I had only about 60 days left…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“More importantly&mdash;excuse me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I entered his room without waiting for permission.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The room was as I expected&mdash;paintings were everywhere. There were various types of landscape and portraits. They were all oil paintings. The smell made me want to cry. Oh no, even his bed was soiled with paint. I was worried that he might get sick.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I opened the window. Then I turned around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Rufus, do you like drawing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What? That’s right…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rufus stuttered… but indeed, it was a foolish question. After looking at his room, the answer should be obvious, already.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a reason why he didn’t answer immediate. It was because our parents were against his hobby. When he was little, my parents had already showed some objection towards his hobby. Even after he grew up, Rufus liked to paint to an extreme degree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The problem was&mdash;he was the duke’s son. He should’ve studied more, trained more, and been more sociable. The more they forced him to do that, the more obsessed Rufus became with painting. In the blink of an eye, he had secluded himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To relieve their frustration, my parents dressed up extravagantly in social circles and splurged… such was the Elcage Family, whose only fame was its wealth. The fame might not even be based on the fact that their eldest daughter was the future princess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a way, that might also be my family’s way of showing remorse for leading my brother towards such a development.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was going to ask him again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It might be cruel, but it was for his future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t even know if he’d understand my affection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I wanted such a reward, I wouldn’t have enough time to receive it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, Rufus, let’s run away from home!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll arrange everything from A to Z!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I smiled while wielding the axe in both my hands. I shall let my cute brother travel. Indeed, that was what going to happen from now on.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">Our surroundings were already dark. The streetlights along the common streets went out before the end of the night. It wasn’t a time for teenagers to go out. Even more so, the daughter of a duke. As soon as the lights went out, she’d be kidnapped in no time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the brink, I screamed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please! This child is a genius painter! Only once, can you please look at his paintings properly?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No matter how many times you come, I can’t afford to take any more disciples.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please, do something&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Shut up!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I relentlessly brought up the apprenticeship for my brother&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">well, until the huge man hit me, that is.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Even though he had such a gorgeous beard for a man his age! He turned out to be such a ruthless man!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I could only spew curses inwardly. As soon as I reached home, the door of my house, which was a little more beautiful than my surroundings, closed with a bang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“S, sister!? Are you injured!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rufus rushed towards me in fear. Since he was carrying a large rucksack, I wanted him to exercise caution… but indeed, what happened was sudden. It couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m alright.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, such mishap was a daily occurrence in my training with Zafield. More importantly, it seemed that Rufus’ paintings, which had I brought with me, weren’t torn. As a matter of course, I couldn’t bring all of his paintings. I brought only two of his best pieces. One was a landscape painting of a lake… I was ashamed to admit that I was also depicted within said painting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The lake itself was a landscape of a neighboring kingdom we visited on a family trip five years ago, before he started secluding himself. Perhaps, that painting was meant to be a reminder of the time when our entire family was still on good terms.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Uu, he is such a gentle boy! What an eye-opener!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As an older sister, I absolutely must prevent a future in which my cute brother got trafficked! Anyway, I wanted to bring about a future where he could laugh boisterously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I mustn’t give up. With a small laugh, I raised my hips.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Unfortunately, it’s already late tonight. Let’s end our search for the day.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Are we going home?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No way.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">To go home after a day of leaving our home, where was the coolness in that? As of now, our parents should be making a fuss after seeing our letters. If we went home during the middle of that, we’d be severely punished. Rufus seemed to also be aware of that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If so, should we rent an inn? Is it possible to find one at this time without reservation?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In that respect, we were naïve. At first glance, staying at an inn sounded refreshing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, I looked up at the home and atelier of Rufus’ master (potential). That its owner had adopted foreign culture was self evident from the brick-like, slightly flashy, house. He used to be a baron’s son, but due to his passion for art, he left home and single-handedly created an atelier. I heard that he recently got into contact with my parent’s house. I wondered if there were any other ateliers like that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s okay, I have a good guess.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That level of difficulty wouldn’t break my smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Leave it to your sister!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, the aristocratic academy I attended was within Elcage’s territory. Since it was a traditional academy right next to the royal capital, there were villas nearby. High-ranking aristocrats and members of the royal family usually stayed in them for three years at a time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless, even if it was considered nearby, it took a quarter minute by carriage to reach. It was difficult to get there unless one was within the territory. Therefore, many students used the dormitory on the academy grounds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, there were many students who opted to stay in the villas. After all, there were many academic institutions in Elcage territory. Therefore, there were many cases of aristocrats with a professorship or research position owning a villa. There were also many ladies who had been taken in by such fathers and relatives for their three years at the academy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In my case, well&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;I’m sorry for the inconvenience, especially considering that it’s late at night.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, my daughter will always be indebted to Lady Lelouche. By the way, have you dined?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was talking peacefully with an acquaintance behind his house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A familiar lady was trembling. From her expression, I could tell that she was full of questions&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;“Why, why is she here!?”, “Why would she come to stay in my house!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I gracefully smiled at her, as if to set an example.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Forgive me, Ms. Lumiere. Even though you were sick, I am disturbing your rest.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hyaa!! N, no, not at all…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By the way, did you read the books I gave you? Since you’ve recovered, let me know your opinions during dessert.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Waaah&mdash;! I’m sorry&mdash;!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh dear, she ran away while crying. But I was positive that she’d read through the books by tomorrow. I should remind her to tell me about her impressions during breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rufus asked me in a small voice. “What did you do to her?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I just helped her study every day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thankfully, Baron Alban, who was the host and also the bearer of title ‘Economist.’, welcomed us with a dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By the way… your parents, is it alright to not deliver a message to them?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the norm to get permission from both parents to stay at a friend’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt sorry for what I was about to do next&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;I closed my eyes tightly and shed tears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry for the intrusion, but as of the present, my parents and I…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Baron Alban was immediately taken aback.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“T, then, it’s alright! Please stay at my home until you’ve mended your heart!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you, I’m indeed in pain.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I truly wanted Lumiere to witness that&mdash;the use of a woman’s tears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rufus tugged my clothes from behind once again, but I pretended to not notice. I hoped that he’d grow into a gentleman who wouldn’t be deceived by the tears of such women. I shall be looking after him from above.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, in the fluffy bed of another person’s house, I closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was truly tired that day. It was my first time recommending someone that vehemently&mdash;and honestly, I didn’t think it suited me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Are you going to continue tomorrow?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh my, did you read my mind or something?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I’m still a god.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, well, you’re correct.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the fluffy world of dreams, I bowed to the pure white god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It seems that my parents were also taken care of by the church. Honestly, I can’t thank you enough for taking care of my whole family. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Then, can’t you enjoy your days a little bit?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards the unexpected reply, I lifted my face. God had a truly awkward expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…As for his previous line, I couldn’t say that I fathomed it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As I mentioned the other day, I’m having fun every day?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“But, didn’t you say that you aren’t good at making promotions?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Except, making new discoveries and obtaining new experiences for the first time in these few tens of days I have left&mdash;that still counts as happiness.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Does that include barging into your brother’s room with an ax?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That was my first time ever doing that! My hands wouldn’t stop shaking!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Wasn’t that simply because the ax was heavy!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">God retorted, then lowered his shoulders with a sigh. …I sincerely thought that it was rude to sigh like that. When I puffed my cheeks a bit, god looked at me from the side.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Your younger brother, do you want to do that much for him?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m going to do something about my house. But for the time being, there’s no loss in giving him the ability to live alone. Moreover, since there’s a high possibility that my family will fall into ruin, I think he should have a path for becoming independent.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, I had chosen a former aristocrat to be his tutor. The bonds of nobility were understandable.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;Since he’s the former son of the Alban Family, if you meet the current head now, it’ll serve as insurance in the event of an emergency?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s true. If my brother is going to be sold either way, it should be with grace. He should at least be taken care as the servant of the Alban Family. …Hmm, did you read my mind again? How shameless.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“That’s not the case&mdash;!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I purposefully complained, making the god retort once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What a wonderful god, teasing him is so much fun!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Once again, the god sighed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Alright fine… I understand… It seems that I will need to take care of you.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh my, did I cause you any inconveniences?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I tilted my head, the god glared at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…It seemed that our conversation had been concluded for the day.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Then, good night.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Okay, okay, good night.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, dear.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt that god had become more difficult these days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Either way, it was nice because I was comfortable with him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next day, my <em class="calibre3">push sale </em>activity continued.<br class="calibre4" /><br class="calibre4" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">Early in the morning&mdash;…</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…It seems that Ms. Lumiere is still sleeping, so I won’t be able hear her impressions of the books. Apparently, she read until dawn. Good.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I went to the atelier with Rufus. His master (planned) stared alternately between us with a fed-up expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Oi, </em>show me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Huh!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Not <em class="calibre3">‘huh’, </em>show me the picture you drew. You’re old enough, already. Why are you still hiding behind your older sister?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">That’s justifiable.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It might be more worthwhile if the person in question was the one who did it. As such, I handed over the painting to Rufus. Then, Rufus gave it to his master (planned) with his own hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His master (planned), who was as unfriendly as ever, looked over the picture while caressing his fine beard. Rufus mumbled beside me, <em class="calibre3">“As I thought, it’s impossible…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Young fellow, when do you want to enter?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Not ‘<em class="calibre3">huh’</em>, if you don’t stop with your young master attitude, you won’t survive in this world. Of course, if you want to stay that way, you can hold your sister’s hand as you go home. Choose whichever makes you happier!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“B, but, is, it truly alright…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fix that habit of replying foolishly right now! If you are told something, the answer should be ‘<em class="calibre3">Yes!’, </em>I won’t accept any other reply&mdash;do you understand!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Y, yes!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Once again!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Yes&mdash;!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In response to Rufus’ shout, his master (official) snorted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I held my chest in relief, the master asked me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But, are you sure about this? Is your place alright with this arrangement?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, my.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Did he decide to agree despite knowing Rufus was the Duke of Elcage’s heir? It seemed that he’d be a more wonderful master than I imagined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Naturally, I’d respond to that kindness with utmost courtesy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course. The child has already been entrusted to your services. Please feel free to use him from this moment onwards.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Stop bowing like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How rude.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I returned to my usual posture, the master sighed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, I’ll take care of this one. However, once he becomes a <em class="calibre3">hot seller, </em>I can’t promise I will return him to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the master pushed Rufus’ back. As they entered the atelier, I raised one final question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Uhm! Why did you decide to take a look at my brother’s painting today?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The master scratched his head awkwardly. Even so, he answered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I had a dream. A man who looked like a god made me do it. Dammit… as if I can get rid of him after seeing that. For even a god to take his side&mdash;what a mad lad.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Dream…? God…?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The god’s words from last night resurfaced within my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“It seems that I will need to take care of you.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Involuntarily, I laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, I’m honored.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m not praising you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The master turned his back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I waved to Rufus who glanced back at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good luck!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes! Thank you, older sister!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards my little brother, who was advancing towards his dream, did I manage to properly send him off with a smile?</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Only 64 days remained for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Thus, I was sure that was our farewell for this life.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Wringing out </em>tears was a noble lady’s expertise. So was <em class="calibre3">suppressing </em>them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alone, I turned on my heels with a smile on my face.</p>
