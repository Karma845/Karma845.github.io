<p>Demons<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Demons.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crane hovered, wind cloaking his hands and feet.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha readied her sword, glaring at Crane.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Humans have abilities, don’t they? Show me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If that’s what you want, I’ll show you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The one who answered was Tycoon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Light glimmered from his staff, directed toward Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"[Overdrive]."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha and Reynold’s bodies began to glow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cress touched Robin’s shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"[Double]!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, that’s nice."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Two of me?! Twice the support, huh?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah! Let’s do this!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The two Robins high-fived as Myuane diligently nocked her [Explosive Arrow], channeling her power.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tycoon began chanting another spell.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon’s ability, [Sage], specialized in enhancement and weakening magic. Though he could also cast offensive spells, his focus on ally reinforcement and enemy debilitation made him less adept in attack magic.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh, looks fun. So that’s your ability. But… demons have abilities too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha accelerated toward Crane at an incredible speed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her enhanced velocity was beyond what ordinary adventurers could react to.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But––Sasha’s trajectory shifted.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She had been charging at Crane, yet somehow her position was off.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She crashed into a nearby wall, shattering it, and ended up embedded within the rubble.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora reached toward Sasha, whose body glowed faintly as her injuries healed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her ability, [Saint], granted healing magic. As a nun, Piasora’s prayers could cure not only wounds but illnesses as well, earning her the title of the strongest Saint of the era.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crane lunged at Sasha, his wind-cloaked fist aiming to strike.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No way I’m letting you!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold’s shield intercepted the blow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Not bad."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Shut up!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold deflected the attack with his large shield, then swung a smaller shield to strike Crane.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, the wind blocked his shield’s advance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>An invisible layer of air protected Crane.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Demons possess a power called Skills. Similar to human abilities, but on a completely different scale. In my case, it’s [Airflow Manipulation], which lets me control the flow of air however I want. Like this."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a snap of his fingers, several arrows flying toward Crane stopped mid-air.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"“What?!”"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The arrows turned and struck Reynold’s shield, protecting Sasha. They exploded upon impact.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh…!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Whoa, impressive."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Reynold, with the [Shield Master] ability, could enhance even a wooden shield to iron-like durability. His shield, crafted from the bones and hide of a Silverray Dragon, was reputed as the strongest in the capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crane gathered wind in both hands, scattering it around him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The wind wrecked the workshop, sending wooden crates flying and filling the cramped space with a raging storm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ahahaha!! Get it? If I went all out, I could cover an entire town in a storm. Human strength doesn’t compare. That’s why demons are the strongest. You bugs!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is that so?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha spoke, stepping out of the cracked wall, her hair fluttering lightly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She wore an oddly composed expression.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Indeed, that’s quite the power. But––you’re a fool."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmph…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Battle aura erupted from Sasha’s entire body.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let me tell you why you’re a fool. Come at me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tch, cocky little brat. I’ve decided—I’ll make you my pet."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If you can."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a whoosh, Sasha’s aura surged explosively.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crane cloaked himself in wind as debris swirled around him, smacking him in the face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He clicked his tongue and brushed his cheek, but––that meaningless action created a slight opening.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha didn’t let it slip.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Concentrating 70% of her aura into her legs, she moved with near-teleportation speed to Crane’s back, slashing instantly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Gah…?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Too slow."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A flurry of slashes followed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crane’s back split open, green blood gushing out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crane fell. Sasha accelerated mid-air, driving her sword into Crane’s stomach, pinning him to the ground.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Guh… gah…?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re an idiot. Sure, controlling wind is an impressive ability… but in a confined space like this, it’s useless. If the mine collapses, you’d be buried alive, too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"And most of all… you underestimated humans. Assuming demons were superior, you held back and played around. That’s why you lost."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You brat…!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crane glared at Sasha, bloodlust emanating from him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha withdrew her sword and plunged it into Crane’s heart, twisting it with force.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Gaaahhh!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I won’t take any chances. Die."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Urgh… ah…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cracks spread across Crane’s body.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon called out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, demons completely disappear when they die! Cut off its horn before that!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Understood."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Without hesitation, Sasha sliced off Crane’s horn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh… no mercy, huh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why would I show mercy?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh… you’ve got such a cute face… heh, heheh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Answer me. How did the demons enter the human world?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…[Teleportation Magic Circle]."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Teleportation Magic Circle?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. A magic gate creates an ‘entrance’ in the demon world and an ‘exit’ in the human world. We can come and go through it. But… it’s incomplete. A few demons can pass through a few times before it collapses completely. The exit I made will vanish with my death… heh heh… this research is the highest priority in the demon world. Someday, a massive demon invasion could happen out of nowhere."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Why tell me? Honestly, I didn’t expect you to talk."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Isn’t it obvious…? I hate the idea of me dying while other demons survive and ravage the human world… heh… better prepare yourselves…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Crane shattered, leaving only the horn behind.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha sheathed her sword and picked up the horn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, are you okay?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Thanks, Robin. Is everyone else fine?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold, Tycoon, Robin, Piasora, Cress, and Myuane.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>All her companions were unharmed. Though some were injured by debris during the storm, Piasora had promptly healed them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon clenched his teeth.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Demons, huh…? Cress, this needs to––"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I know. I’ll report it to Father and send word to neighboring countries."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Brother…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Myuane, things are going to get busy for a while."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Yes."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus, Sasha and her team completed their mission.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, they brought back a new threat: the Demons.</p>
