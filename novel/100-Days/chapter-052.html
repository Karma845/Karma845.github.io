<p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths – Haise's Journey 7<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Choco Latte had spent ten days heading for the lower levels.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just ten days, but for Haise, it had been an intense experience unlike anything he’d ever encountered before.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>First of all... the level of the monsters they faced was unbelievable.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>S-rate and SS-rate monsters were routine. At their worst, packs of SS-rate beasts attacked them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Without a Gatling Gun or Rocket Launcher, they might not have survived.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And surprisingly enough... Choco Latte turned out to be unexpectedly reliable.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Its weak spot is the stomach! Look, there’s an indent on its belly—that’s where the heart is!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Wait. Haise, if you can snipe from a distance, shoot from here. That one’s highly alert... get a few meters closer, and it’ll attack.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[That one’s the leader. If you take it down, the rest will scatter.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Choco Latte accurately pointed out monster weaknesses and strategies for dealing with them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Currently, Haise and Choco Latte were resting in a small cave they’d found, using it as a temporary shelter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They’d blocked the entrance with monster carcasses and were having a meal.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Huh, you’re sure?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. You’ve been a big help with your knowledge."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise handed a few skewers to Choco Latte.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Choco Latte took them without hesitation and started eating voraciously.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Delicious. Human food is the best.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...What are you doing?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While eating skewers, Choco Latte repaired armor, crafted helmets, and added extra plating using monster hides and scales.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It also attached scales to shields, sharpened swords, and moved with the skill of a professional armorer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[The materials from the monsters you defeated are perfect for enhancing equipment. I need to be able to fight too, not just share knowledge.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...You’re pretty handy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Am I? We Chaos Goblins make all our weapons and armor ourselves. Processing monster bones, hides, and scales is child’s play. There… done.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Choco Latte donned the modified armor, now equipped with a helmet and additional plating.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This left no part of his skin exposed—he was fully armored.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[All right, this will do. Ha, thank you, Haise.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, good for you... yawn."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[If you’re tired, take a nap. You’ve barely slept these past ten days, haven’t you?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[You still don’t trust me, huh? I get it, but...]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Five hours. I’ll sleep for five hours."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That was all Haise said before closing his eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Choco Latte quietly continued eating the remaining skewers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Five hours later—it happened suddenly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[GROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRR——...]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A roar echoed through the dungeon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise shot up, while Choco Latte dropped the file it’d been using.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What the hell!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Th-that was... a roar?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Choco Latte exchanged glances.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The underground shook, and a vibrating aura lingered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From deep within the dungeon, a horde of monsters came fleeing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even the creatures Haise and Choco Latte had struggled against ran past their cave in terror.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[W-what is... down there?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had a hunch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dungeon boss.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Delmadrome Labyrinth’s final, strongest foe.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If they defeated the dungeon boss, the labyrinth would vanish.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For over a thousand years, no one had conquered this dungeon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If Haise did, it would be remembered as his greatest feat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>People would acknowledge him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The strongest adventurer. The one who conquered the labyrinth alone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[…What’s wrong, Haise?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…No, not alone."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Choco Latte tilted his head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stretched and cracked his neck.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After five full hours of sleep, he felt completely refreshed, both mentally and physically.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Choco Latte, don’t you need to rest?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[No. Chaos Goblins only need two hours of sleep every ten days.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s... pretty convenient."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[That’s how we evolved—to work longer, to fight longer.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stood, packed up his gear into his item box, and prepared to move.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Choco Latte equipped all his gear, the new helmet masking his identity entirely.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"All right, let’s go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Yeah... but, what’s waiting down there?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The dungeon boss. The Delmadrome’s final foe."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Ugh...]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If you’re scared, we can part ways here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Who’s scared!? Let’s go, Haise! I’ll lead the way!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Choco Latte marched forward, while Haise followed with a Desert Eagle in hand, chambering a round.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Watch me, Sasha... I’ll clear this dungeon, no matter what."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise’s journey approached the final floor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Another ten days later—Haise and Choco Latte arrived at the floor before the final level, battered but alive.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Choco Latte examined a wooden plaque engraved with text.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Th-this is the final floor... [heme Park.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Theme Park..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Yeah. That’s what the demons called it. Their domain… it’s been abandoned for ages.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s where the dungeon boss is?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[And the treasure the demons left behind.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before them stood a large, ornate iron gate.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The gate was lavishly decorated and bore a large sign.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Faintly visible were the words:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Smudged, but I can read part of it... W-onder... Land?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Wonderland?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. No idea what it means... but this iron gate looks more like a prison."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise pushed the gate open, the creaking echoing ominously.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside, small glass structures dotted the area.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They had writing on them too.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Di-scovery... place?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Discovery place?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tickets, purchase, h-ere...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Tickets?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A ticket’s something you show at theaters. Is this Theme Park a theater?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[???]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Choco Latte tilted its head. Haise didn’t understand either.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside the glass booths were metal boxes with small [buttons].<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Pressing them made clicking sounds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Past the [discovery place], they entered a long residential area.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What is this... houses?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Seems like the demons’ dwelling.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A wide road flanked by large houses stretched before them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The windows were oddly large, with various tools displayed within.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise sensed these weren’t homes—they were Shops.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That must be the central plaza."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[A map, maybe?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A sign displayed a map of the Theme Park, with a central plaza surrounded by large buildings.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Jet... coaster... giant... wheel? What are these? Rides?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[This Theme Park... is deeper than I thought.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"For now, let’s head to the central plaza——"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly—<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[[[[[[[[GROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAARRRRRR——]]]]]]]]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Roars erupted from the central plaza, not just one, but multiple.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Haise heard it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uninvited guests have arrived."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A man’s voice.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The sound of hard shoes echoed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From the plaza emerged a single gentleman.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm... after all this time, a human and a goblin? How intriguing. Truly, this world never ceases to amaze—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bang!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise fired his Desert Eagle without hesitation, the bullet hitting the gentleman’s shoulder.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh, GAHHHHH!? Wha-what the hell!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The man clutched his bleeding shoulder. Choco Latte was dumbfounded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[H-Haise!? Wh-what are you doing!?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Anyone who talks like that is usually an enemy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Whaaaat!?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise switched to a shotgun, firing multiple rounds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The gentleman raised his right hand, pulling in nearby metal to form a shield, blocking the bullets.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seeing this, Haise summoned a rocket launcher.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait!! Wait, hold on!! That’s a gun, isn’t it!? Why do you—damn it!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The man used a nearby car as a shield and fled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise fired the RPG-7 Rocket Launcher, hitting the car and causing a massive explosion.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tossing aside the rocket launcher, Haise drew his Desert Eagle again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Who was that guy?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[You cause all that, then ask that!? He’s probably a demon. Dark skin, silver-gray hair, crimson eyes, horns—no doubt about it.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Got it... let’s go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[...I’m really glad I’m not your enemy.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Choco Latte headed toward the central plaza.</p>
