<p>Heracles 5<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri came to Clan Sacred once again.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reluctantly, she arrived at the clan, conveyed her business, and was led to the reception room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Within minutes, the five members of Team Sacred had gathered in the reception room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry to keep you waiting."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nah, it's fine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A small vein popped on Piasora's forehead, but Robin tugged at her sleeve to hold her back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha sat facing Hijiri. As always, their sitting styles were a stark contrast.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha sat with perfect posture, while Hijiri slouched, looking bored.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So, listen, Haise said, 'If you want to fight me, defeat Sasha first'."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? That brat... Using Sasha as a decoy—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Quiet!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora was about to lose her temper, but Robin restrained her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even Reynold didn’t seem amused... In fact, everyone in the room was hearing about Haise’s words for the first time.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To an outsider, it might seem like Haise was just pushing Sasha onto Hijiri because he couldn’t be bothered to deal with her himself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Sasha showed no anger, her expression remaining blank.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So, what’s your business here?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Of course, to defeat you. Sorry, but I won’t let you escape this time. I’m too obsessed with Haise to waste time on someone like you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m sure you’ve prepared a bunch of excuses to run away from me, but—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the next moment, Sasha instantly drew the "Rainbow Holy Sword Nanatsusaya" from her item box and thrust it in front of Hijiri’s eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not only Hijiri, but Reynold, Tycoon, Piasora, and Robin were all stunned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No one expected Sasha to act like this... It was almost like a declaration of war.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the same time, Sasha’s body began to glow with a golden aura.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"——I thought you were just a boring, proper princess."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh my... I’m a bit disappointed that your first words were so polite. I thought you’d pounce on me like a beast."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sa-Sasha!? Wh-what’s going on!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin hurriedly tried to stop her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha lowered her sword and smiled softly at Robin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nothing, I just felt better after letting it out. I’ve decided to be true to myself."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"For the sake of the clan, I was starting to lose myself as the Clan Master... But the real me gets angry when provoked, wants to eat a lot when hungry, enjoys soaking in the bath for two hours, and loves sipping sweet wine while sucking on candy. That’s who I am too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sa-Sasha...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry, everyone. I’ve been losing my composure lately. I was trying too hard to be the perfect Clan Master, and I hit my limit."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha let out a deep sigh.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The other four tilted their heads in confusion, but... Reynold gave a wry smile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t really get it, but you’ve got a good look on your face. It’s like..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He trailed off and shook his head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Tycoon spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t fully understand either. But let me give you one piece of advice. While private fights between adventurers are prohibited, a formal duel is allowed if the proper procedures are followed. If you want to arrange one, I’ll handle the paperwork."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora was trembling with excitement.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Th-th-that’s so cool... Ahhh!! I can’t think of anyone but Sasha!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri, who had been stunned, finally regained her composure and stared intently at Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Heh. You’ve got a good look on your face now, Sasha. I apologize for my rudeness up until now. I formally challenge you to a duel. Not as a request, but as a duel between adventurers, agreed upon by both parties."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I accept."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha responded immediately.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Private fights between adventurers were forbidden. But Hijiri had used requests to put a bounty on herself, forcing adventurers to attack her. It was the only way she thought she could fight other adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, if the proper procedures were followed, a duel was possible.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The process was tedious. It required approval from the Guild Master, and for S-rank adventurers, even the royal family of Heiberg had to give their consent.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The location, witnesses, and specific rules had to be decided before the fight could begin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon addressed Hijiri.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We’ll handle the paperwork. As for the rules, each duelist can set one rule of their choice. S-rank adventurer Hijiri, what rule will you add?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No holding back."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Understood. Sasha, what about you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No mercy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Sigh, understood."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon wrote the rules on a piece of parchment he had somehow produced.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He muttered under his breath, "Maybe they’re more alike than they think..." but when Sasha and Hijiri both glared at him, he quickly cleared his throat to cover it up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m looking forward to the duel."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. I’ll give it my all."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And so, the duel between Sasha and Hijiri was set.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>S-rank adventurer Heracles Hijiri vs. S-rank adventurer Brynhilde Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The duel will take place in the Overlook Wilderness northeast of the Heiberg Kingdom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The witnesses are S-rank adventurer Dark Stalker Haise, S-rank adventurer Combat Geist, and S-rank adventurer Panacea Apollon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The rules state that the duel will continue until one party is incapacitated, and it will end if two of the three witnesses declare it cannot continue or if one party concedes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If a life is taken during the duel, retaliation is forbidden.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If a third party intervenes, the witnesses are authorized to eliminate them, regardless of who they are.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......Um, this..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Give it up. This is all because you provoked Hijiri in the first place."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, in the Guild Master’s room, was handed the "Duel Summary" by Geist and read it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Somehow, he had been appointed as a witness.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s not written here, but the members of Team Sacred Crest and the Heiberg royal family will also be in attendance."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The royal family too?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. In fact, it was the royal family who approved the duel. Permission to pit two powerful S-rank adventurers against each other isn’t something the Guild can grant on its own."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"By the way, keep this to yourself. If word gets out, spectators will flood the place."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, when’s the duel?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Early tomorrow morning. The Guild will provide carriages for transportation."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see. Oh? Who’s this S-rank adventurer Panacea?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The greatest healer in the Heiberg Kingdom. She’s the Clan Master of Clan Asclepius and an old friend of mine, Barbaros... and the King himself."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Anyway, don’t be late tomorrow."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Got it. Guess I’ll skip taking any requests today and head home."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Haise turned to leave the room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Why did you provoke Hijiri? And why did you tell her to target Sasha instead of yourself?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...See you tomorrow."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise left without answering.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Outside the door, he let out a small sigh.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......I can’t say it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Because Sasha was being underestimated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Because Hijiri didn’t know how strong Sasha really was.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That’s why he thought it was better for Sasha to fight than for him to do it himself... But that was something he could never say to Geist or Sasha.</p>
