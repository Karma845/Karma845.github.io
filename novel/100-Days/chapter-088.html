<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had followed Sasha into the dense fog of the forest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Seriously... is that girl out of her mind?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The forest, perpetually shrouded in mist, was pure white, making it hard to see ahead.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>True, the fog thinned at certain times of the day. With a map, a veteran wouldn't get lost. But... for Sasha, who's acting on impulse, going alone is somewhat dangerous.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There might be a chance, after all.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise asked his companion,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Can you locate Sasha?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. Though, I'm surprised you'd ask me for help."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It's said that with Presea's spirit summoning, one wouldn't get lost even in pitch darkness. The spirits guide the way, allowing one to cross narrow bridges even with eyes closed. Haise didn't quite understand it, but it seems finding people is also within her capabilities.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To find Sasha, who had entered the forest a step ahead, the two proceeded into the forest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Haise... is this a request?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha entered the misty forest to search for a missing person. That's Sasha's request... but what about you? The guild master just told you to 'help Sasha', it's not a request or anything, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Indeed, that was the case.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Haise went to visit Geist, Sasha rushed out of the room. Hearing from Geist, it seemed an adventurer from Sasha's clan had gotten lost in the dense fog forest. Upon hearing this, Sasha dashed out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise inquired about the situation from Geist. Geist did ask if Haise could help Sasha... Normally, Haise would respond with 'if there's a reward,' but this time, he left the guild just after hearing the story.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He happened to meet Presea and invited her with 'I'll pay you, so help me,' leading them into this dense fog forest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was already gone. Probably, she had ventured into the forest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just a feeling. If Reynold and the others were here, I wouldn't have come this far. But... she rushed out alone. Probably, Reynold and the others don't know anything yet."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That was exactly the case.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the royal capital, Reynold and the others were each busy with their own tasks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold was training the shield bearers, Tycoon was discussing clan management, material trading, and rewards with the clerks, Piasola was called by the church, and Robin was training new archers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If they had to gather everyone after hearing about the missing person, it would take more than half a day.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So, Sasha, who could move immediately, went ahead to secure the missing person... that must have been the plan.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tycoon might get angry."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That scheming glasses guy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...pfft."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise couldn't help but laugh at the mention of the scheming glasses guy.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───...ugh"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Upon waking up, intense pain shot through his entire body.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh, ah..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She messed up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Opening his eyes slightly, she was enveloped in white mist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was lying on her back, with sharp pain in her right leg. Her right arm wouldn't move, and her side hurt.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She realized she had fallen.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then she thought,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............why"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dense fog forest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She had been here several times. She knew the map by heart.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The place Sasha had walked was supposed to be a cliff, with a fence installed. The ground should have been firmly packed, not something that would easily give way.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But reality was like this.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Damn..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha forced her aching body up, crawling to lean against a nearby rock.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Gravel ground. The sound of a river could be heard, and the fog was quite thick.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her right arm was broken, and so was her right leg. She must have hit her side, as she coughed up a small amount of blood.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her armor and sword were unscathed. But the impact of the fall had severely injured her body.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh... this is bad."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her voice barely came out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If she stayed lost, she might become prey for demon beasts. Right now, there were no demon beasts nearby, but at night, this dense fog forest teems with demon beasts of extermination rate A and above.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was known that Sasha had entered this forest. Help would come.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If only... I can hold out until then."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She seemed to be running a slight fever.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This is bad───... thinking so, Sasha couldn't move.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>An hour had passed since Haise and Presea entered the forest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Stop."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That railing, it's dangerous."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The dense fog forest, though a forest, has faults and several cliff-like areas.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There are sturdy fences installed by adventurers, so it's usually safe, but some fences have deteriorated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea lightly kicked the fence, and the iron railing bent with a crunch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...it's corroded."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Look. This isn't just corrosion. Something's been applied to the fence... like poison."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Poison?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. My spirits are repelled by it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stored the fence in his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let's take it with us for now. We'll ask Geist to install a new fence."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Right───... oh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What is it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Over there."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea pointed towards a bush enveloped in mist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise drew his Desert Eagle and pushed through the bush... there, he found a boy, Roland, unconscious.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, wake up... hey."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh... ah, what?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, are you okay?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ouch... yeah, yeah. What, where is everyone? Oh, Haise-san!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Calm down. Let me explain the situation."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After Haise explained, Roland hung his head, saying, "I see..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It seemed he was upset for causing trouble to his comrades.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea asked,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why did you stray from the path into this bush?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well... we were exploring near the forest entrance, and I thought we could go a bit further... after discussing with my comrades, we ventured in. Then, when we tried to return... um..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Roland rubbed the back of his head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don't know. It felt like I was suddenly hit on the head? The fog was thick, and everyone went ahead... then, Haise woke me up."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...hit on the head, huh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This smells fishy.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had a bad feeling about this.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Presea noticed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───Haise, the spirits told me. There's a broken fence and a collapsed ground ahead."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...could it be Sasha?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Likely. Maybe she slipped and fell."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright. I'll go. You take him and get out first."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...how will you get back?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I've marked the way. I'll pay you the reward when we return."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...got it. I'll attach a spirit to you. Is that okay?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea kissed Haise's hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wha-"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...there, done. My spirit is attached to you now."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-was kissing necessary?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. Now, be careful."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea quickly left, dragging the bewildered Roland with her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her slightly red ears were probably just his imagination.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was enveloped in warm arms.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her body felt lighter, as if soaking in lukewarm water.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Is she conscious... or not? Did she hit his head?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There was also a nostalgic scent.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha felt like acting spoiled. But, she was too dazed to understand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Open your mouth. It's a recovery potion. We'll do first aid for now... once Piasora joins, she can heal you properly]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She wanted to say yes, but no voice came out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A finger forced her mouth open, and a sweet syrup-like liquid was poured in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Strangely, the pain subsided.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She felt something being wrapped around her arm and leg.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her body floated lightly, and a voice she heard said,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[At night, ferocious demon beasts roam. Let's get out of here before then]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hearing the nostalgic voice, Sasha let go of her consciousness.</p>
