<p>Through The Town<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Night───…… Geist was alone, sipping tea by the campfire.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Hijiri were fast asleep. Sasha and Presea, who had just taken over the watch, were also deep in slumber. Mina had been snoring from the start, leaving Geist as the only one awake.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even though they were S-rank adventurers, they were still just teenagers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As an adult, Geist wanted to protect them, regardless of their strength.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well then…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist stood up, clenching his right hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry, but I’ll be heading over there. Can you stay quiet and wait for me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They were surrounded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>About twenty of them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They were more than a hundred meters away from the campsite, slowly closing in, likely planning to strike all at once. But… Geist had sensed their presence and threw a small stone at a spy perched on a tree about ten meters away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Guh—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The stone hit the spy’s throat. Unable to make a sound, the spy fell from the tree, and Geist caught him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, pressing a pressure point on the spy’s neck with his thumb, the spy convulsed as if struck by lightning and lost consciousness.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And like the wind, Geist dashed───… straight into the group of bandits who were about to complete their encirclement.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wha— Old man, you bastard!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Keep it down. My adorable disciples are sleeping."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist crushed the bandit’s throat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With fluid movements, he hunted down the bandits.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Throat strikes, eye gouges, pressure point attacks───… In no time, only the bandit boss remained out of the twenty or so.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Without even breaking a sweat, Geist spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You have two choices…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-you damn brat!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The bandit boss, wielding a large axe in each hand, swung at Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Geist simply sidestepped by half a step, dodging the strike, and grabbed the boss’s right wrist, dislocating the joint. Then, he crushed the boss’s throat to prevent any screams.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Guh— Gah—!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"One, you die here by my hand. Honestly, that’s the easiest option. The monsters will take care of the bodies, and I don’t care if there’s a bounty on your head. I’ll just report the extermination."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The bandit swung his left axe horizontally.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Geist stopped the blade with just his right thumb and index finger.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A man nearing his sixties had stopped the axe of a muscular bandit boss in his mid-thirties with just two fingers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The boss was stunned. He tried to pull the axe back with all his might, but it didn’t budge an inch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The other option is to turn yourself in… You’ll face execution or forced labor, but you won’t die here by my hand. If you turn yourself in, I can put in a word to spare you from execution."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Guh…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Choose."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist glared at the boss with murderous intent, causing the boss to turn pale and tremble uncontrollably. He dropped his axe and nodded frantically.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist smiled, pressed a finger into the boss’s neck, and knocked him out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yawn…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha woke up. As she stepped out of the tent, Haise was already preparing breakfast.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist was sipping tea. Sasha approached Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good morning, Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Breakfast?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Does it look like I’m maintaining weapons? Just go wash your face."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Pfft, got it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From Hijiri and Mina’s tent, snores could be heard, while Presea’s tent emitted soft breathing sounds. Sasha washed her face, tidied her hair a bit, and returned to Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was lightly toasting a baguette, cutting a slit into it, and stuffing it with grilled sausages. He was also mixing a sauce made of tomatoes and spices.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha, go wake up the sleepyheads. If they don’t get up, no breakfast for them."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright, got it… Heh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…What’s so funny?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nothing, just that you prepared food for everyone without even being asked."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Tch."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise said nothing, pouring egg soup into a cup and refilling Geist’s tea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha chuckled and headed to Presea’s tent first.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That afternoon, they arrived at the first town.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was a town with less than half the area of the royal capital. A typical town with an adventurer’s guild and various shops.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They secured lodging and left the horses in the care of the inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They booked three rooms: Haise and Geist, Mina and Presea, and Hijiri and Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As soon as they entered their rooms, Mina barged into Haise and Geist’s room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, let’s go eat!! Let’s go get food!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, it’s still evening. If you’re going, take Sasha and the others with you. And knock next time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A reasonable suggestion from Haise. But Geist laughed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hahaha, it’s fine. How about it, Haise, want to grab a meal?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m good… But I could really use some alone time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright. Then come join us after you’ve relaxed. Mina, let’s go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Okay!! Oh, Hijiri said, ‘I’m hungry for meat!!’ so let’s get some meat!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…You just want to eat too, don’t you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist took Mina and Hijiri with him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise lay down on the bed and opened an ancient manuscript he hadn’t read in a while.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[I ate too much and feel sick… But it’s cute how Ibis worries and holds my hand. Bargan eats more than me but acts like it’s nothing, Crossfald only eats vegetables, and Merryabel only drinks alcohol… What’s up with our team?]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sometimes it contained trivial things, other times hints about weapons.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Nobunaga’s diary.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He had read quite a bit of it, but strangely, the pages never seemed to end.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yawn…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Whoa!? Y-you… At least knock."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Right. It’s almost dinner time."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He had been reading the ancient manuscript, but quite some time had passed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As he closed the book, there was a knock on the door.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, you there?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, it’s dinner time. I asked the innkeeper, and there’s a bar nearby that serves food… So, want to go?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, that sounds nice."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea opened the door, and Sasha looked surprised.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"P-Presea? Didn’t you go to eat?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. I was going to invite Haise. Heh, you too?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"N-no, I wasn’t—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then let’s all go together."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…What about my opinion?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the end, they ate at the bar and had a few drinks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hijiri barged in, saying, ‘After food comes drinks!!’ and Geist brought Mina along… Eventually, the whole group ended up enjoying drinks together.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise muttered while sipping a fruit cocktail.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…This is going to go on for over ten more days, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ahaha!! Come on, Haise, let’s just enjoy the drinks!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Mina clung to him, Haise let out a deep sigh.</p>
