<p>The Loser Ability Users<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For now, I brought the two I saved and entered the bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina asks, "Huh? What happened?" but it's Haise who wants to hear the explanation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We could have just gone home, but Sasha ended up bringing the two inside.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>School uniforms, and upon further questioning, fifteen years old... They can't stay for too long.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After entering the shop and placing some casual orders, Sasha speaks up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So... why were you two being harassed in a place like that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, well..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The bespectacled boy, Sein, glances at the ponytailed girl, Miko.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miko turns away and mumbles.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, we got hungry and went out to buy some late-night snacks. Since it was past curfew, Sein said it was a bad idea... but, but I really wanted to eat the eclairs from Hakonedou, so we sneaked out of the academy, and then those guys started picking on us..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Those guys were saying something about your grades. First off, what's your relationship?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Me and Miko are childhood friends..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sein and Miko both look down. Mina lightly pokes Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-we... are at the bottom of our class at the academy. Our abilities aren't great, and both our practical and theoretical skills are low, so we get made fun of..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, my practical skills are decent though. I have the ability of a [Paladin]..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But you can't wield a greatsword, can you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha quickly understood.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miko's ability is [Paladin]... Generally speaking, it's considered an advanced version of the [Swordsman] ability. However, unlike [Swordsman], advanced abilities often have fixed traits.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For example, a [Swordsman] can use a variety of weapons, from standard swords to greatswords, dual blades, and rapiers, but the advanced abilities like [Dual Swordsman] specialize in dual blades, and [Great Swordsman] specializes in greatswords.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The 'Holy Knight' ability is an advanced version of [Great Swordsman]. The sword they can use is fixed to a greatsword.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miko is about the same height and build as Mina. Someone as short as Sasha wouldn't be able to swing a greatsword around.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sometimes, when an ability awakens, the body undergoes changes to accommodate the special ability... but Miko likely gained the 'Holy Knight' ability without any significant physical changes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It happens occasionally. Someone blessed with a powerful ability, but their body isn't suited for it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A Loser Ability Holder, huh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Ugh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, that name is insulting."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah... my bad."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise apologized straightforwardly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miko waves her hand as if to say she doesn't mind.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, well... it's not like I can't use it at all, you know? If I boost my physical abilities with the [Enchanter] skill, I can swing it around."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm, I see... What about him?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I, I have the [Swap Change] ability..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? [Swap Change]... I've never heard of that."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ahaha... It's a minor ability, only mentioned in the corner of the ability encyclopedia."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina tilts her head in confusion.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sein touches the glass of water he just finished and grabs a nut from the snack plate. In an instant, the nut and the glass switch places.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...That's all I can do. I can swap the positions of 'something I'm touching' and 'something I've touched'. But the maximum size is about the size of a glass, and it only works on things that fit in the palm of my hand... It's a useless ability."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sein forces a bitter smile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Indeed, this ability isn't suited for combat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, sipping his wine, speaks up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then why are you at AdAd? Surely you realize this ability isn't suited for adventurers, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Well, my family has been a line of adventurers for generations. My father is an S-rank adventurer, and he runs a large clan... All my siblings are attending AdAd too. I couldn't be the only one not going."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see. But trying to become an adventurer with that ability is practically suicide."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...If I drop out, my parents said they'd disown me. I can't survive on my own, so... I figured I'd at least graduate from the academy and become independent, no matter how much I get made fun of."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Wow, that's heavy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was genuinely pitiful.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Perhaps feeling the same, Sasha asks Sein,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is there anything else you can do?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Well, I'm good at calculations and stuff."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You do seem like the studious type."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's rude."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Muu, Haise, you were just—"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hold on. Don't start fighting... Huh? It's getting pretty late. You two should head back soon. We'll walk you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yes..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Miko suddenly gets up close to Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Onii-san!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-what?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Onii-san, you're so strong, it was amazing! I want to be your apprentice after I graduate!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Denied."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Instant rejection!? Ugh, I won't give up!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sein approaches Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Onee-san, I mean, Sasha-san!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-what?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"My ability might not be much, but... I want to become strong like you!! You seem like a famous adventurer. I'll carry your bags or do anything, so please take me as your apprentice when I graduate!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"S-sorry, I don't take apprentices."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Fufufu. You two don't seem to realize just how amazing these two are."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina puffs out her chest, about to say something, but Haise lightly smacks her head to shut her up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After paying the bill, Haise, Sasha, and Mina walk the two back to the academy.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Once they confirm the two have gone inside, Mina speaks up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise... why do you hide the fact that you're S-rank?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If they knew, they'd be even more annoying."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With just that, Haise starts walking back to the inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha glances back at the academy once.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Childhood friends, huh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For some reason, she recalls her own past with Haise, and though they're nothing alike, she can't help but see some parallels in their situations.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Sasha were walking side by side, chatting—a rare sight.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A few steps ahead, Mina is busy looking around at the town.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Loser Ability Users, huh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I know. Well, I used to think the same about myself."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"............"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, that glasses kid said he's good at calculations, right? Why not hire him as an accountant for your clan?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...That depends on his will. His eyes are the eyes of someone who dreams of being an adventurer and won't give up."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm... Also, even though it's a different type, that girl has a sword-related ability too, right? You should train her."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...If she can't wield a weapon, it's pointless. Ah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha suddenly remembers something.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Seven-Star Light. If we forge a greatsword from that ore, she might be able to wield it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Seven-Star Light... Ah, that gem from the Forbidden Six Labyrinth?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Swords made from it are light yet durable... but Seven-Star Light is classified as a national treasure. There's no way we can give that to a rookie adventurer."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise pulls out a Seven-Star Light from his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A translucent gemstone glowing with a rainbow hue rests in Sasha's hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"T-this is..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I picked it up in the deepest part of the Forbidden Six Labyrinth. It's useless to me, so you can have it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-wait, hold on!! I just said it's a precious material!! It's not something you can just give to a rookie adventurer... It'll cause envy and misunderstandings."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is that so... Well, I'm giving it to you, so do whatever you want with it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"~~~... You're really something else."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha sighs in exasperation as she stores the Seven-Star Light in her item box.</p>
