<h1 class="calibre1">40. Let’s Have Fun Together</h1><p class="calibre2">After that, I went to the cafeteria covered in mud (of course, Lumiere went home by carriage). The royal siblings were concerned, to which I answered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Recently, beauty methods using mud are popular.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also went to class as I was.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The teacher was surprised and suggested that I head home. However, I answered sincerely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Teacher… I want to have a flawless skin.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted to say that I also attended my after-school lessons as I was as well, but the royal siblings got angry and told me to go home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After returning home, I helped with the field work (of course, I also explained the mud beauty method to my father). I swung my sword about 100 times, took a bath, and had a relaxing dinner made by my mother after a long time. I wonder if I should eat and study for the follow-up exam with god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;So, here I am.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Don’t be so nonchalant about it!? Couldn’t you have at least gone home for the time being?! You could’ve borrowed a replacement outfit!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Rather than that, I’d like to borrow your feet?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…What? Why&mdash;”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I knelt before god, he became terrified.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I, is it about yesterday’s bet!? It’s fine!! There’s no need for you to do that!!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…But, as you said, the royal siblings came to teach me. Didn’t I lose the bet? I have to keep my promise.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Unconceivable! Please stop! It’ll a problem if your propensity distorts any further!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What’s that?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was truly interested in the god’s word just now. However, when I asked, he refused to answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How boring of god.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Then, answer my question! Hey, why did you remain covered in mud without changing your clothes? I need to know the answer! Lelouche, why did you insist on remaining like that?!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if he were to call me Lelouche… That question, even the royal siblings asked it of me over and over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because otherwise, it’d be boring?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“That’s not the problem! What about your reputation as a lady!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m honored to be complimented.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I’m not complimenting you!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ahhh… </em>God was energetic again that day. If he screamed that much, his throat would hurt, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because he had always brewed tea for me, it was my turn that day. It was a service.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Not to mention, the tea is special?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Take a look, God. The other day, His Highness received a large amount of these…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…What’s the ingredients for this tea?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It seems to be the root of a tree called burdock that is cultivated in the Orient. Apparently, when shipped, it is done so covered mud.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“In the end, it’s still mud!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was basically just the roots, right? Did he think that there was a woman who liked and wanted to be covered in mud? Of course, if it was after doing field work, that was different. I considered it a medal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I also had no grudge against burdock. According to my research, it was rich in fiber and was good for beauty. It also had a unique flavor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I drank it, the god also sighed and followed suit.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu, such a delectable drink.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">God then asked me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“So, what do you want to ask for as a reward?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is the reward I asked for of His Highness Zafield for the follow-up exam?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Well, was there anything else?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was sure that the god wanted me to ask for dresses, accessories, and a feast. But my answer had already been decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course!”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;8 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had to let go of my uniform and buy a new one. I tried to save money, but… it didn’t work very well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I couldn’t afford to fail until the retest. There were only 3 days to go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My studies were also on their last spurt. That morning, I was enthusiastic to receive tutoring from His Highness Sazanjill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, His Highness…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If Lelouche isn’t feeling well, why don’t we take a break from school and spend the rest of our time until the exam in the mansion?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, but I will have to refuse.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was trying to isolate me so that I wouldn’t be bullied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, His Highness refused to relent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But yesterday, Lelouche was bullied, too&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t disturb my enjoyment.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Enjoy, ment…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m looking forward to it!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I mean, look.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield was sighing, “<em class="calibre3">As I thought.”</em> He seemed to understand me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that it was important in cases of unavoidable circumstances, but… why should the victim have to evict? Shouldn’t it be the perpetrators who give up the place?</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;While heading to the classroom, such was my preaching to His Highness Zafield.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon entering, beautiful flowers were displayed on my seat in the classroom. There were a lot of white flowers with small petals. Ah, were they the ones called ‘<em class="calibre3">Shiragiku’ </em>from the East? The flowers with the meaning of the end of life…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I admired those flowers, I heard gigglings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, what is this?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s a gift from a kind person?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I took a flower from the vase and put it in my hair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Am I pretty?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield, who narrowed his eyes, didn’t compliment me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I looked at my faint reflection in the window, the flower shone against my jet-black hair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, my desk was too small. During class, I had to vacate the vase.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After having my classes as usual, it was finally time for sword practice. Unusually, His Highness Zafield invited me! Although, I didn’t spend much time holding the sword. Instead, I was taught passive techniques and what to do when being tackled. The solution was to pierce either the groin or the face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After having a good time, I returned to the classroom again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, the next lesson was&mdash;and when I put my hands inside my bag.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Kyaaa.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a tactile sensation of crawling on my hand. On it was a brown creature the size of a thumb nail. How dull? It had many thin limbs. They couldn’t be counted because it kept moving around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield, who was about to sit down, came to check the situation with a grim expression. Thus, I held out my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness, what’s this?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Gy, gyaaaaaaaaahhh&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh dear! His Highness’ scream surprised me!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The insect also fell from my hand and scurried across the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite his shock, His Highness was still concerned about me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Le, Lelouche, that’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t know what kind of insect that is… Oh, I still have more in my bag.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I turned my bag over, His Highness Zafield’s scream rang throughout the classroom. Apparently, they were earthworms! For them to have procured so much, it was evidence of good soil&mdash;or so Baron Aljerk said. There were others as well, such as spiders. I was impressed at how they managed to collect so many spiders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was observing them, someone grabbed my sleeve.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Le, Lelouche…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His fingertips were trembling while his beautiful eyes were moist. I wanted to tell him to just run.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, most of my classmates had fled from the classroom. Wouldn’t it be impossible to start class without someone cleaning up?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Due to the farm work, I’m used to all manners of insects! Leave it to me!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Lelouche!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufu. Even so, who would’ve thought?</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield apparently wasn’t good with insects. As long as one was alive, there were many interesting discoveries to be made every day. I was happy about that… and also a bit lonely, which was my only regret.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;If you aren’t good with insects, there’s no need to force yourself to help me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, I can’t do that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the time I was able to finish playing tag with the insects that had spread across the classroom and safely released them behind the school building, the bell rang. Unfortunately, the afternoon classes were canceled because the classroom needed a thorough cleaning. I was also offered a plan to have my classmates serve as cleaners to do away with the insects, but I seemed unable to respond to such good intentions from my classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, if I had free time, I’d prefer to continue my sword practice. However, I couldn’t request His Highness Zafield, who was still pale, for training. As expected, I had to take a break in the cafeteria. Most of my classmates appeared to have go out to play together.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Lelouche, please do your best to study for the follow-up exam!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">For them to support me, how kind …<em class="calibre3">really.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I needed a break. I sipped some cold Darjeeling tea I had brought with me. I stared at His Highness who sat across of me. He was about to drink a Café au Lait. However, he seemed to have noticed my line of sight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, I was wondering if I shouldn’t drink this.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I feel like the taste is odd.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt like the tea, which should have a hint of white grape, had another miscellaneous taste.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I muttered that, His Highness took the glass from me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Lend it to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He put a small amount in his mouth, tasted it as if chewing something, and then spit it out on a napkin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s a mild numbing poison. I don’t think you will be harmed from swallowing a bit, but are you alright?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m alright for now. What about Your Highness?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m fine. I’m used to poison.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That remark frightened me for a moment, but then I remembered…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…His Highness Sazanjill also said something similar a long time ago. When he was little, he had a habit of being poisoned. His Highness Zafield also didn’t know when his life was going to be targeted. He must have habitually ingested light poison to build up resistance. Therefore, he was inevitably familiar with poison.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Such a sad fate&mdash;still, I laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“My, you sound like royalty.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Unfortunately, I still am part of the royal family.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, His Highness Zafield laughed on purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he immediately changed his expression and suppressed his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What do we do? Should we call all the employees and interrogate them?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, it’s fine. It would also be troublesome if someone were to use that as blackmail material against you later.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As a prince, I have a lot of manpower. Therefore, do you believe I have need for moles?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;and here I thought you were more disciplined. After all, you did used to deliver a particular someone handwritten letters.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I voiced my concern, His Highness Zafield smiled bitterly. After sipping his café au lait, he offered me the drink. “This one’s alright.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Such petty tricks. Maybe they just want to be taken care of.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead of thanking him, I raised a question. His Highness rested his chin upon the table. As he fiddled with his collar, I had nowhere else to look.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Even if I were to be relied on or cursed by the person I like, if it could get me out of a mere in-law relationship, that might be good.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t say anything, so I drank the café au lait I received. Perhaps because it didn’t contain any syrup, its bitterness was stronger than I expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if he had noticed, His Highness fetched some syrup and poured it in the café au lait.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, how are you going to resolve this situation? Are you thinking of a way?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you trying to make your father file a formal protest?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I usually talk to my father every night in a joking manner.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What is he saying?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">He seemed to be off tune. Please rest assured for I’ll live up to your expectations?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, that’s right, how about arranging the usual reward?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m preparing it, but… I think it’ll be ready the day after tomorrow at the earliest?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The day of the follow-up exam?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’ll be feeling refreshed after the exam, won’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I see.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, my father mustn’t move until then.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I smiled and said, “I’m looking forward to it.”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;6 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without a hitch, I was bullied yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That day, I was doing fine as well. My study sessions with His Highness Sazanjill would end that morning. Because of him, I was having an easier time reviewing my lesson afterwards. Regardless, that still wouldn’t guarantee me a good score. As such, I decided to go home early that day and study quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was thinking that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…This is a problem.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a dimly-lit, closed, room, I was at a loss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was trapped. After class, my teacher asked me to help her carry her bags. To me, it was a menial task. There was no reason I should resort to spouting an embarrassing line like, <em class="calibre3">“Seriously, you’re asking the duke’s daughter for this kind of thing?” </em>As a student, I obliged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…However, that was a mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Incidentally, I was in the same class as His Highness Zafield. Nevertheless, as soon our lessons had ended, he rushed home. It seemed that both His Highness Zafield and His Highness Sazanjill were behind in their duties regarding public affairs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Well, that’s because they’ve been helping me with my studies.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, His Highness Zafield stayed with me as much as he could. I also heard that His Highness Sazanjill would accompany Lumiere, except when she was in class. For the both of them to act as shields… Somehow, for me, it was a little tasteless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was said that upon returning to the boarding house, they were buried in their duties with public affairs. The king appeared to be spartan. Although, that much should’ve been expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Then, another possible source of help&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;That was right. The equipment warehouse I was trapped in was located behind the academy. There’d be no student bothering to visit that place. The equipment for club activities were in other warehouses, weren’t they? I had no idea if anyone would come to that warehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, there was also the matter of security. However, I was sure that the one who planned this ensured there would be no security around that day. At least, if it was me, I’d plan with that much forethought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was why&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Yep, I’m stuck.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed that I’d be spending the night in that place as it was.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">It sure is cold…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was fortunate that I had my bag with me. But, well… other than my textbooks and writing implements, there was nothing that could fight against the cold. Although, I did have a hand mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu, should I burn the textbooks to make fire?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That’d surely keep me warm. In the unlikely event of a fire, someone might come to save me. A tiny amount of light was spilling from the upper vent, something which I could reflect with the mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;However, after relentlessly trying for about an hour, no fire was produced. It seemed that only experts could light a fire with such a tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While doing so, the sun went down. It was getting darker and darker. Even if I tried to study, I would barely be able to see a thing. I had no choice but to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…But I might catch a cold again&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I hugged my bag, wishing that it’d keep me warm&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;My, I have a pretty friend.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wasn’t able to return it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the item reminded me of the day I had requested the annulment of my engagement. I felt awkward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After burying my nose in the clumsily-made stuffed rabbit for a long time, I embraced it tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Won’t you sleep with me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I lied down with my bag as a pillow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My small friend gave warmth to cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wasn’t lonely, because&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Hence, it comes as a surprise to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“No, you really should be surprised?! You’re trapped! You’re being confined? Imprisoned? Anyway, be more scared?!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’re expressive today.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I were to compliment him, the god wouldn’t listen to me. On the contrary, he took out a blanket from somewhere and wrapped it around me while I was on a chair. Then, he rushed to brew some hot tea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dream world was neither hot nor cold, but… <em class="calibre3">how does this make sense?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, I was happy. I was grateful for the cup of tea. The scent of ginger was both tingling and pleasant. I smiled involuntarily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I mean, I can still meet god in my dreams?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Eh?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because of that, there’s no reason for me to feel lonely.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The god suddenly paused.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh my, his face is bright red.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I pretended I was too immersed in drinking the delicious black tea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I drank it in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Would you like to have another?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I nodded, god regained his composure and poured me a second cup of tea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he seemed more worried as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Don’t you have a test tomorrow morning? If you don’t get out by then&mdash;”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do you have any cinnamon sticks? I also want some honey…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I do&mdash;more importantly!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I poured some honey into the cup. Afterwards, I gently mixed it with a cinnamon stick. While gracefully enjoying the scent and sweetness, god exhaled a loud sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…<em class="calibre3">Liar.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t really think that I was a liar. God puffed his cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“You aren’t lonely because you have that child, right?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That child… Speaking of which, I wondered why that stuffed animal had been placed on the desk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was an ugly stuffed animal left there by His Highness Sazanjill. It was a cluttered stuffed doll that had its eyes resewn. To word it better, it… totally seemed handmade.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I dared hug the stuffed animal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you perhaps jealous?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“That’s not it! Why would I be jealous?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You wish that this stuffed animal was you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“What?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I responded as such, god suddenly stopped moving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…It was quite interesting. I wanted to repeat my sentence, but there were times when even I got curious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“For a god like you to be jealous of such a thing, aren’t you adorable?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Like I said, I’m not&mdash;</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;That’s not the issue.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After I had stared at him, god finally relented.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“It’s one of your precious memories, isn’t it?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What? Isn’t this merely something His Highness Sazanjill forgot?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Wasn’t it a gift you gave him back when you were children?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">What?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I could only stare at the god. He seemed as if he was being pinched by something. Right, he had golden eyes. They were as mesmerizing as the evening’s first star. Regardless, I couldn’t afford to swoon at the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Y, you don’t remember?”</em></p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">When asked whether or not I remembered, I examined my memory.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I made such a clumsy thing?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I couldn’t deny the possibility. After all, the queen was particularly dissatisfied at my embroidery and sewing. To the extent that she once said, <em class="calibre3">“It’s already a miracle you haven’t stab your finger.” </em>Well, even without sewing skill, I could still become a queen!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, did I give such a stuffed doll to His Highness?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I pondered that, God let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“No way, you truly don’t remember?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Not at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“It might be because you actually wanted to throw it away.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What does that mean?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The god answered when I appealed with my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I think you said it about five times back then. You asked the first prince to abandon the idea.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“To His Highness!? Me, such a thing&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, the other party was still a crown prince. For a mere duke’s daughter to insist on such a thing…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Maybe I did.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Indeed. You threw a tantrum. Cute, don’t you think?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…Again, I couldn’t deny the possibility. I could only laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As of the present, I was a patient person. When I was little, though, I seemed to have thrown tantrums as according to my age. My saying, <em class="calibre3">“Please throw it away&mdash;!” </em>back then might not be all that strange.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…‘A patient person’? You?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Reading my mind is shameless.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“The timing couldn’t be more accurate.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps, the god thought he had grasped my weakness? In that case, I had an idea, too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Pervert.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I, it’s not like I see you when you’re naked?!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">God’s face immediately turned red. It was a hundred years too early for him to make fun of me. After all, if it was only that much, I wouldn’t be swayed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, that concluded my punishment towards the god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should return to the main topic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But why, even though I should’ve disposed of it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Why are you asking me? You should’ve asked him directly?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, god suddenly turned away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I didn’t want him to suddenly clam up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Can you suddenly not get in a bad mood just because I recalled it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I’m not in a bad mood. I just thought that I mustn’t spoil you too much.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, dear. Since when did god become so amazing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I’ve already been amazing since the beginning&mdash;for I am god!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…Speaking of which, that was the case. It was easy to forget that fact, considering how casually we treated each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, regardless of how he acted, he was still a god&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;wait, that wasn’t important as of the present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before that, there was something more pressing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I toyed with the stuffed animal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Should I just throw it away?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I think you should cherish it.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you still in a bad mood?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the god seemed serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Considering that you’re going to die in a few days, you just don’t want to leave any traces of yourself behind, right? At least, that’s what people usually say…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I merely wanted to be rid of the reminder to my shameful past.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Well, either way is fine.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, god stood up while saying, <em class="calibre3">“It’s about time.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That was all for today.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had more work to do in reality.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Do your best on the exam.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Light shone in the white world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Someone was calling me&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;Lelouche! Lelouche!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">How many times was that…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;5 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche! Lelouche…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I hazily opened my eyes, dazzling light was pouring through the door that should’ve been closed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ‘Gold Prince’ who wore the radiance of the morning sun as a halo was just too dazzling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah, good morning, Your Highness Sazanjill.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That isn’t what you’re supposed to say at such a time!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, but greetings are the basis of everything.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Sazanjill supported my back. I gently corrected my posture and asked him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you for your assistance. What time is it now? Have I missed the exam?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If it’s the follow-up exam, there’s still time. Before that, let’s get you examined.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“There’s no need to worry. I won’t die, yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What kind of joke is that…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn’t a joke, but a fact.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I got up quickly and attempted to move my body… I had slept in a cold and hard place. Therefore, I was sore. Still, I had a good night’s sleep. My head was clear. There was nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, I shall take the follow-up exam. Let me thank you later.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how much I studied, there’d be no point if I didn’t take the exam.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried to rush out, but my arm was pulled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, wait, why does Lelouche have this?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He showed me the pink rabbit, the friend I had spent the night with. &nbsp;It truly was disproportionate to the beauty of the crown prince, yet His Highness Sazanjill firmly held the ugly doll.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I involuntarily diverted my gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You dropped it on the day you came to visit me. I’m sorry that I didn’t return it as soon as possible. Then, can you please throw it away?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I won’t! Lelouche did her best to make it!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But, it’s as ugly as a garbage&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s my treasure! No matter what Lelouche said, I won’t abandon it!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Why was he getting angry?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The person who made it said it was garbage. Thus, it was decided that it was garbage. Even so, the opening bell rang. I couldn’t wait any longer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I combed my slightly damp black hair that had been left unkept overnight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If you say that, then have it your way. I need to go.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“T, the exam, do your best.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The corners of my mouth rose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I won’t smear Your Highness’ face with mud.”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">I completed my follow-up tests. I was given 30 minutes for each subject. Those who had failed multiple subjects had to report to that classroom. I couldn’t help but wonder if there was always one such person every semester.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among them, I finished early. As such, I still had time to attend my classes. It was when I was about to go find His Highness Sazanjill&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Lady Lelouche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Good morning, Lumiere.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Why is she going out of her way to call me?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…Moreover, where was the formal greeting?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment I reprimanded her about it, Lumiere hurriedly curtseyed me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Well, it seems to be an urgent matter.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I wondered what had happened?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why are you in such a hurry?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please come with me!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, she roughly pulled my arm. It couldn’t be helped. We went to the place where His Highness Sazanjill always propose to me before our classes began. A crowd had gathered there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the middle of it, His Highness Sazanjill was making a ruckus that day as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“All of you, what’s the meaning of this&mdash;!? Not only did you cover Lelouche in mud, you also dared confine her&mdash;!! Are you that eager to be beheaded&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">He’s truly angry…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t know what to retort anymore. His wrath had reached a level where he was threating his surroundings with decapitation. Even as the candidate for the future king, wasn’t that overkill?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Involuntarily, I whispered to Lumiere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Could it be, you want me to stop him?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s better to stop him, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, uh…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Honestly, I didn’t want to get involved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, perhaps… At the very least, I was aware that he was angry for my sake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, it was troublesome. I didn’t like it. I didn’t really like studying, either. This was supposed to be a day where I was finally freed from studying&mdash;one where I could enjoy a sense of refreshment. Instead, immediately after that, I was told to not only stop His Highness, but to also reconcile with all my classmates?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was when I was about to sigh, saying that I still wanted to enjoy myself with everyone in the class.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, make way, please&mdash;!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the other side of my rumbunctious classmates, a familiar voice echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My classmates split in two to make way. While apologizing, the ‘Silver Prince’ passed with a cart. It was truly a surreal sight. Moreover, the scent that drifted from the cart…</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">The sea, maybe I should’ve gone visit it again.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even His Highness Sazanjill was surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Zafield, what are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Aah, this is Lelouche’s reward~”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche’s reward?! She refused my offer, but accepted Zafield’s!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Don’t get me wrong?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted him to pay more attention to the contents of the cart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now that it had arrived, it was a different story. His Highness Sazanjill was still complaining, <em class="calibre3">“It’s unfair! I’m Lelouche’s fiancé!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I saw my classmates trying to dissolve, I knew that it was my cue to start.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’ll be wise for you to stay back, Lumiere.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Fue?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I approached the royal siblings. They both said my name, but instead of answering, I rolled up my sleeves. The cart was overflowing with mud. When I put my hands inside, it felt cool and refreshing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“L, Lelouche…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I smiled to His Highness Sazanjill, before proceeding to press a handful of mud to his face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">…Ha?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">For a moment, it was as if the concept of sound didn’t exist in the world. There was only silence. Everyone froze. Only the ‘Golden Prince’, whose face was smeared with mud, was confused.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if nothing had happened&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Hey, Your Highness Sazanjill, did you know? This is the latest beauty method! That is, through the use of mud!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Beauty, method?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Indeed, I learned that mud contains a lot of beauty ingredients and is very good for the skin! The sea on the Asatida Coast in the West is very beautiful, isn’t it? I asked for it of His Highness Zafield! However, as I’ve been being placed under His Highness Sazanjill’s care on a daily basis, I’d like you to experience it first!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although His Highness Sazanjill would occasionally get injured, his skin was white and unblemished. That fineness was unmatched by most ladies. In addition to his beautiful appearance, he was also the ‘Gold Prince’. Therefore, there was no need for him to undergone beauty treatment. Still, about half of what mentioned about was accurate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was fine. An academic institution had actually reported that the mud from Asatida Coast had high beauty effect. Albeit, it hadn’t been exactly commercialized, as of yet. I was merely promoting it. The research itself had been started because people of all ages&mdash;be it men or women&mdash;who lived near the Asatida Coast had beautiful skin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, aside from that prank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Has your head cooled down?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I smiled at His Highness Sazanjill, the black mud clinging to his face began to drip onto the cobblestones.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“H, how generous of you, Lelouche…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ufufu, even though I said, <em class="calibre3">‘I won’t smear mud on your face.’ </em>I’m truly sorry for that. By the way, I answered everything correctly. The teacher graded me immediately afterwards.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While showing off an elegant curtsey, I smirked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">The game is on.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, never had I had so much fun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought such as I proceeded to throw the mud at Duchess Lala Fable to whom I had also been indebted to until now.</p>

<br></br>

Of course, mud was formless. As such, even if I were to throw it wholeheartedly, I wasn’t able to muster a clean hit against her face. Instead, it struck her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Forgive me.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I could hear the grief-stricken cry of Lala.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, what are you doing…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Pardon me, but wasn’t it Lala who’ve taught me of this beauty method?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I approached Lala and wrapped my arm around hers.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Isn’t it useless to resist?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I wasn’t as skilled as my instructor. Nevertheless, I had trained every day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, as I forcibly dragged her towards the cart&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Close your mouth?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I put my hands in the cart once again and pressed the mud onto her face. Actually, I wanted to just dunk her head into the mud. However, at the same time, I wanted to appear dignified. As such, I had no choice but to be patient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lala, along with the classmates around her, screamed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, Lumiere ran away.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Well, I’ll tell her all about it later.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As it was, I had my hands full with Lala.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Rejuvenating, isn’t it? Enjoy it to your heart content.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you stupid&mdash;!? Do you think you can just…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once again, I pressed more mud against Lala’s indignant face. My smile didn’t break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What are you talking about? Even His Highness Sazanjill was pleased.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What?! Do you have holes for eyes?! Where and how does His Highness appear to be happy&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Then, would His Highness like to behead me, as well?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I turned towards His Highness Sazanjill, who was watching the situation in a daze. He still hadn’t wiped the mud off his face. Instead, <em class="calibre3">“Hohe!?”</em> He opted to let out such a foolish cry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, that’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Your Highness, aren’t you having fun…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I asked with a smile, the future king of the Kingdom of Lapisenta gulped and nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah&mdash;yes! Pardon me, I was bedazzled due to my misunderstanding! For you to throw mud at one another, it seems that you have a particularly strong bond with your classmates of the Un class…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, it’s true! We are good friends, aren’t we, Lala!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was given his consent. I hoped she’d reflectupon her profane acts. I also hoped that she’d be content with the mud.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was chasing her&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;By the way, I talked to my mother and father about this beauty method recommended by Lala. Incidentally, she said she was going to attend a tea party at a particular salon. I’m sure my mother will bring it up as one of their topics of discussion.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, the house where my mother had been invited to was the Fable family. She mentioned that the queen was also being invited.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Lala, I’ve gone this far for you.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">But, it wasn’t like I merely say, <em class="calibre3">“Just tell Her Majesty that you want to become His Highness’ fiancée, to the point that you’d harass Lelouche Elcage! Of course, if you have the courage to declare that… If you do, I shall introduce you to the royal siblings, as you have the courage to love them.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, I knew that’d be a useless thing to ask from Lala.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, I’m honored that Lelouche liked it so much, I’d love to hear your feedback…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When she awkwardly admitted her defeat, His Highness rolled up his sleeves as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have to thank Lelouche for taking care of me on a daily basis, too. Therefore, I’d like to participate.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Huh!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone froze on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For me, it didn’t matter if His Highness wanted to join in the fun. There was no reason to refuse. Anyway, his face was already black. He had also already begun throwing mud at the boys.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Is he the kind of gentleman that won’t aim at female students?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I’d assume responsibility for that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness Zafield, please distribute the contents of the cart to people over there?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh? No, I don’t want to get dirty.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield backed off awkwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Eh? Despite His Highness Sazanjill’s excitement, his younger brother won’t be participating?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I purposefully gasped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What do you mean!? Even after I went to such lengths to deepen the friendship of the class, too!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Deepen, you say&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Is it okay for the ace of the swordsmanship club to be so lackluster?!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was when I tried to complain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lady Lelouche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one who ran up to me was Lumiere, whom I thought had fled at first glance. Her coral hair fluttered as she showed me some ladles with a brilliant smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I borrowed them from the café’s kitchen! Can we use them?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As expected of Lumiere!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ehehe, thank you for your compliment.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was the best compliment I had ever bestowed upon Lumiere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t know who had bad taste anymore. Meanwhile, His Highness Sazanjill flung a bucket of mud at the boys, laughing as if he wanted to show them who the reborn Demon King was. The ladies desperately ran away. There were also some who tried to retaliate by throwing mud back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was when everyone was happily throwing mud.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed that I had slipped on some mud at my feet. I fell on my butt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, are you alright?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A muddy hand was extended towards me. Looking up, I could see His Highness Sazanjill. His appearance was no longer that of the ‘Gold Prince.’</p>
<p class="calibre2">I laughed aloud at his muddy appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha! Your Highness is covered in mud!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s fun, it’s as if I’ve returned to the past!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A long time ago… That was right. We were both betrothed and childhood friends. There may had been such a time…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Indeed, I’m having fun!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was pulled up by his large palm. Then, with a smile, I started filling the ladle with mud again.</p>
