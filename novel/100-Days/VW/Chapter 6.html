<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 6 &#8211; Let’s Perform the Last Dance</h1><p class="calibre2">&mdash;I discarded my feathered hat and combed my hair. Then, I cleared my throat. I was tired of forcing myself to speak in a low voice. Although, apparently, that was how an ideal noble lady would speak.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to my old, mischievous habits, I was able to change my voice to an extent. However, I should’ve practiced more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking up at me, His Highness Zafield muttered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">…Lelouche.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, let me repeat myself&mdash;<em class="calibre3">good day to you, </em>Your Highness Zafield.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The corners of my mouth slowly lifted up. Once again, I held the hems of my pink dress and curtsied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield sat on the bench while holding his cheek. His eyes were wide open.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Aah, what a nice expression.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was glad that he was surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The starlight and the lanterns were our only sources of light. In the darkness, at the edge of the garden, not a soul could be seen. All that could be heard was the gentle music and the voices of people drifting over from the hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a chuckle, I looked down at His Highness Zafield.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How’s my kick? Unfortunately, when push came to shove, I still hesitated in aiming for your crotch. I’m sorry that I couldn’t adhere to my teacher’s teachings.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…What’s that supposed to mean? Is it a punishment for a liar like me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In a nutshell, it is. Oh, right. There’s something else I’d like to ask&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My leg aside, the hand that hit him stung.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…But, compared to the pain in my chest, it was nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If possible, I didn’t want to ask about this, either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Two days ago, the sword that I left at the academy went missing. Do you know where it went?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as I asked, His Highness Zafield burst into laughter. He patted his jacket and trousers, which were much flashier than his school uniform, to show that he wasn’t hiding anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Who knows? Maybe it was stolen because they deemed it too good for an amateur?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, my, and here I thought that Your Highness, who had skipped out on our training, would know. But… what a shame.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Now, it’s my turn. I’m more curious about your dress. What happened to the dress that you went to pick with me and paid for yourself? Your current dress, shouldn’t Lumiere be wearing that?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As usual, your acting is solid! Did you think I was Lumiere? Then, were you trying to ask her out? For two princes to vie for a baroness… it sounds like something out of a maiden’s novel!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he sat down on the bench once again, His Highness Zafield shrugged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I got it, already. Lelouche is mad. Sorry about that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He apologized while laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amazed, I couldn’t help but sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’re no longer planning to kill your brother, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What? This, again? Lelouche seems to love that setting too much. Do you want me to be the culprit to his murder that much?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“While that isn’t necessarily the case, how do I say this. That’s right&mdash;<em class="calibre3">I saw it in a dream. </em>A dream in which you stabbed His Highness Sazanjill to death. It was terribly awful.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In truth, I heard that from god last night <em class="calibre3">in a dream.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I didn’t lie.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I tearfully said that, His Highness Zafield laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Poor you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, as if nothing happened, he invited me to sit on the handkerchief he had laid out on the bench. When he saw I wasn’t moving, he proceeded to stand beside me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Right? The other day, Lumiere praised me for being dreamy!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is that truly a compliment?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, what else do you think it could mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While making jokes as usual, I began to think.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to god, His Highness Zafield would get angry at His Highness Sazanjill for stabbing me, and killed him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I recalled correctly, god mentioned at the beginning that someone was aiming for His Highness Sazanjill’s life… or something like that. It was already a hundred days ago, so the memory was vague.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After confirming it last night, I wondered about the cause of my death&mdash;<em class="calibre3">and the aftermath.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, I couldn’t help but think that His Highness Zafield was plotting something…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Precisely at that moment, the sound of the bell echoed amidst the dark night. The party was about to start. I couldn’t stay with His Highness Zafield there forever&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;Then, should I ask frankly now?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Your Highness Zafield, do you have anything you’d like to say to me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hm? <em class="calibre3">I love you.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, no. Not that kind of joke, please!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I puffed my cheeks, His Highness Zafield gleefully wiped away his tears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Even though those were my honest feelings… Lelouche is really the worst.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…By the way, other than this dress and bullying Lumiere, have you done anything else?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, I did. Three years ago, do you remember when I told you that unless you made your social debut, my older brother would only see you as his little sister?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">From then on, I began to put tremendous effort in becoming the future princess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, His Highness Zafield added.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I lied. My brother’s concern towards you was genuine.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Aside from that, is there anything else?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After blinking several times, His Highness Zafield nonchalantly explained everything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Also, I probably said a lot to my brother. I told him that in order to alleviate your stress, it’d be better if he didn’t approach you in school. That way, you could forget about the princess education, even if a little. I also told him that if you were avoiding him, then he should show some manly dignity once in a while and catch you by surprise.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Well, well, no wonder he spawned everywhere to the point that I was overwhelmed and exhausted.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I think those are honestly good pieces of advice, coming from you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Haha, that’s right! As expected of Lelouche, you understand, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did you have fun?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I asked him, he gently narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Knowing that he wouldn’t respond right away, why did I ask such a thing? Not like the answer would benefit me either way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, I was neither resentful nor angry. Thus, I proceeded to the next question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did you enjoy seeing us being influenced by such behavior?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…That’s right. It was a lot of fun.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Hey, Your Highness Zafield.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">If what you said is true, then why is your face filled with sorrow?</em></p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">The music from the venue grew louder and louder. I could vaguely hear them announcing the names of the attendees. The party was progressing steadily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among it, the voice that answered my question wavered slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Lelouche, were you shocked?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Ugh, look at you, trying to sound all sad.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Did he think that I couldn’t see through it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">How long had we been together?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Were you disappointed? Did you despair, perhaps? Or maybe, the two of you already overcame those obstacles and made up. Then, isn’t it all’s well that ends well?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, if you were to ask me, I just think that what you did is unreasonable.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s that? Is that it? Are you satisfied with just a slap? You can unleash your frustration on me. After all, an opportunity like this may never come again.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In the first place, it has nothing to do with love.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I sighed, His Highness tilted his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…The one who saw the other as nothing more than a sibling&mdash;is probably me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A long time ago, I was told that my fiancé only saw me as his sister.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Admittedly, I was depressed at that time. After all, to be able to support the crown prince, I’d have to at least be his equal. As such, I resolved myself to debut in society. In fact, at that time, I was probably desperate. However, it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, because I did get what I wanted in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, now that I thought about it, His Highness Sazanjill was akin to an older brother to me, always worrying about me relentlessly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">But, Your Highness Zafield…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Does that mean that he isn’t important to you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until a while ago, I didn’t understand what love meant&mdash;but that didn’t mean I didn’t have someone important to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If my heart doesn’t flutter when I see him, that doesn’t necessarily mean that I don’t cherish him. Even if I didn’t feel that way towards him, he’s still important to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Father, mother, Rufus, the king, the queen, His Highness Sazanjill, His Highness Zafield, and everyone else&mdash;they were irreplaceable people for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I was angry towards His Highness Sazanjill, and as a result, I gave him the cold shoulder. Due to the misunderstanding, I was resentful from the bottom of my heart. Even so, he’s still important to me&mdash;and so are you, Your Highness Zafield.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, no matter how mean he was, no matter how deplorable he was&mdash;I still couldn’t hate him. To disguise myself and surprise him, before slapping and then kicking him&mdash;as long as I could see his goofy face, then that was enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I kept people at bay, once I had grown attached to them, cutting them off was an impossibility for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How haughty of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s why, to you, whose been watching over me for so long&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Aah, the timing’s just right.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield, who had been quietly listening to me for a long time, suddenly stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It looks like I won’t have to listen to you anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, as he turned around, he let out such a refreshing remark. His long, silver hair appeared reddish due to the light of the lantern.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you, Lelouche. But the guilt is simply unbearable&mdash;so goodbye.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a sadder smile than usual, he spoke in the gentlest tone possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, at the end, my best friend said the worst thing ever.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Please, for the rest of your life, remember me for the bad guy I am?”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">There was a subtly sound of rustling grass. Yet even when I looked around, I couldn’t see anyone amidst the quiet ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, a terrible premonition loomed over me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was similar to the feeling I had when I confronted His Highness Zafield about the sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…I see.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">My time has come.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I jumped to my feet and seized His Highness Zafield’s arm. He also taught me that move. Then, just like that, I was able to sweep him off his feet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected of myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was even better than during the practice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result&mdash;the sharp tip of a sword plunged into my abdomen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;it hurts.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…it burns.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">My entire body felt as if it was burning and freezing at the same time. Due to the incomprehensible sensation, I fell to my knees.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, dying was rough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he looked down at me, His Highness Zafield was at a loss for words. But in the next moment, he shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“</em>Go away&mdash;! This is it&mdash;the end of the task!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards His Highness Zafield, who approached me on all fours, I smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Now, now… you’ll just get your pants dirty.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Le, Lelouche…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">At his behest, the assassin left immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What fell on the spot was a familiar, small sword&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">I see, I see… That’s how it was…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You… did you want to frame me, for your death…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, stay strong, someone, please come here…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">&mdash;Answer me, Zafield Louis Lapisenta&mdash;!!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">My scolding, which resembled an angry roar, finally caught his attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I grabbed him by the collar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you a moron!? Did you try to kill yourself?! To throw your own life away, what kind of foolishness…!? Surely, god won’t&mdash;no, <em class="calibre3">I personally won’t forgive you for this…!!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t care if you wanted to frame me as the culprit, or about the lies that you’ve spoken to me! Rather than that, if you indeed watched us the whole time, then why didn’t you realize it!? Why didn’t you realize that you’re important to His Highness Sazanjill!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Did he hear me?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">He shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Idiot…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how much he denied reality, he wouldn’t be able to change it&mdash;because it had already happened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, I didn’t teach you, so that you can pull this sort of thing…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, wasn’t I unexpectedly on schedule…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Who’s protecting who, now?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it didn’t matter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although His Highness Zafield was a much bigger idiot than I expected, everything was still within the scope of my prediction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Your Highness Zafield, you’re a precious childhood friend to me. Because you’ve always watched over me, I can be myself. As a result, I did a lot of foolish things in the past.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Back when I fell from the staircase, His Highness Sazanjill wasn’t the only one present. His Highness Zafield probably saw the entire thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also knew that when it got truly dangerous, he’d stop me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, back when he taught me swordsmanship, he’d get terribly angry when I pulled a reckless stunt. It was the same when I played in the mud the other day. Somehow, before the teachers could inform my parents about it, His Highness Zafield managed to convince them that making me write a self-reflection letter would suffice as a form of punishment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">I’ve always been spoiled by you, haven’t I?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I was happy.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hence, I slowly stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Otherwise, I’d end up being spoiled by him again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Albeit my dying figure might be unsightly, <em class="calibre3">but please&mdash;just see me off.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, have to go…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Where are you going with that kind of injury&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Do not follow me!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I ended up screaming for no reason. Due to that, my vision flickered, while my body wavered. As a matter of course, every time I move, my pierced abdomen hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Unfortunately, I won’t be dying beside you. Therefore, please wait here for someone other than me to scold you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">this isn’t the end for me.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I had to go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, to him, and to her&mdash;I still had something to say.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Leaning my weight against the wall, I moved forward step by step while covering my oozing abdomen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ah… why does the venue feel so far away?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Truly, I’m no match for Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield, who finally knelt down, didn’t follow me any further.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The tune of the orchestra rang terribly loud.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With every step I made, a red stain spread further across my pink dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In truth, I despised that dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to a lot of unnecessary ruffles, it was very heavy. The skirt was also unreasonably flowy. Not to mention, the stiletto heels didn’t feel right. The heels were simply too thin. Under normal circumstances, I would’ve picked something that was easier to move in. After all, simple was best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Although, even if I made such an inward complaint, nothing would change.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At last, I reached the corridor. I entered the academy from the emergency exit, before heading for a passageway where I would be able to easily access the venue. In the midst of that grand party, people seldom lingered around the school building. Even so, I was worried that a guard might see me… Thankfully, that didn’t happen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, if there was a commotion in the end, I wouldn’t be able to pass on peacefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The venue was still far away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Normally, it’d only take a few minutes to reach that place.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">It’s all because of this dress!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though I had prepared a nice, lighter dress…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why did I wear the type of dress that I hated the most?</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Really, it’s His Highness Sazanjill’s fault! Also, His Highness Zafield’s!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…I disguised myself to make him cry, but I should’ve stopped, after all!</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is so annoying!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Feeling exhausted, I collapsed on the spot. The floor was cool and comfortable. It almost made me want to close to my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufu, what a disappointing end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To think that I said those words with so much bravado to god…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Someone, help me already…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Give it your best.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt like I heard such a voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For a moment, my vision was dyed white. Before I knew it&mdash;I felt much lighter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I got up in a hurry, but as I thought, my wound hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Nevertheless, the useless drapes and frills were all gone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, I found myself wearing a deep, red dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A silk dress that was tight except for the hem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, there were no useless decorations on the sleeves, so I could move nimbly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The shoes also had thick heels and gave a sense of stability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hair on my shoulders and face was also smoother than usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…That goes without saying.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Involuntarily, I smiled wryly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For my dress to change in an instant&mdash;there was only one being who was capable of such a feat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Aah, you’re disqualified as a god, after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">To willy-nilly perform such a miracle on an individual like me… Previously, didn’t he mention that he’d get an earful? What a foolish man…</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I had made it this far.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It didn’t matter if I was a queen candidate, or a duke’s daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I were to give up here, I’d be a disgrace of a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I put my strength in my legs and stood up again.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Hey, god.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Until the last minute before the dance party began, I was researching about the “witch” that Nameless wanted to protect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, witches were feared. It went without saying that their eyes and hair were both black. Apparently, they were the characteristics of those who destroyed the world before Genesis. Thus, they were sentenced to a punishment called the witch hunt, for the crime of being born.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">How outrageous, right?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the present day, it was the kind of story that’d make people laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Common sense changed with the time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I had lived during that period, I may have already given up on my life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…But what if there was someone who was reckless enough to reach out to me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If there had been, then that person would’ve been god-like to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was no way I wouldn’t fall in love with such a gentleman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would’ve wanted to protect him <em class="calibre3">no matter what.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">But of course, I have no intention of asking him about that history.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I wasn’t a witch&mdash;but Lelouche Elcage. I was the eldest daughter of a duke family, and had been appointed as the next crown princess. Nothing more, nothing less. As a matter of course, I couldn’t cast any spells, or perform miracles&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Which was why, I wanted to show His Highness Sazanjill, His Highness Zafield, and the other people who were heading towards their own future…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I was mediocre, without any particular talents, or a good personality to boast&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">but I do know that I lived here and now.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Even so…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I finally arrived at the lobby, most of the people were gone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, His Highness the Crown Prince, Sazanjill Lukino Lapisenta, and the baron’s daughter, Baroness Lumiere Alban were there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Sazanjill was instructing the guards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We’re fine! Go to the emergency patient immediately!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Understood!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">By that order, even his own escorts vanished. A commotion erupted from inside the hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness! I’m truly sorry! I’ll open the door immediately!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…What kind of situation is this?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Suddenly, the door won’t open? And to have everyone leave to aid an emergency patient…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Even if it’s a miracle, it’s overkill. I’ll have to complain to god later.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I gave myself a pep-talk.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">This is the final stage!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I mustn’t show them a clumsy appearance!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, I stood firmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah&mdash;! Lady Lelouche&mdash;!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere, who noticed me, became relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What, are you still trying to escape the responsibility having been escorted by His Highness?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…Even though the navy blue and gold dress looked stunning on her, she still had a long way to go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I curtsied without saying anything, His Highness Sazanjill let out a small sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You seem to be alright, Lelouche. What is a relief. A lot of problems just came out of nowhere. They’re only some minor issues, but it doesn’t look like the party will be able to start for a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is it on the left? Then, Your Highness&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lady Lelouche, pardon my rudeness… But is something wrong with you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I’m the same as usual.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite my smile, Lumiere only narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Liar. Lady Lelouche can’t even bend her legs to give a proper to curtsy like usual. The reason you didn’t show up until now is probably because you were resting somewhere…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere rushed to me and put her hand on my back. I couldn’t help but yelp, causing her to worry even more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lady Lelouche…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She observed me, before reaching out to my stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Excuse me…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, her hand became sticky red with blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lady Lelouche&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lumiere, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing that scream, even His Highness rushed towards us. At that moment, he saw everything. I left a red trail behind me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ah, I was hoping that they wouldn’t notice…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I didn’t expect you to realize it, Lumiere.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, immediately call a doctor&mdash;…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I saw that Lumiere was about to flee, I caught a hold of her arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, I noticed the bracelet with a string of white shells on her delicate wrist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was so happy I held out my hand. I was also wearing the same bracelet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m so happy… You wore it…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lady Lelouche, now isn’t the time…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please stop… I know best that I’ll die soon. I’m glad I was finally able to see both of&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the middle of my speech, I finally lost the strength to even stand. As I was about to collapse, His Highness Sazanjill caught me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He looked about to cry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the future king to cry in front of his people, wouldn’t that be outrageous?</p>
<p class="calibre2">After staring at each other for a while, His Highness gritted his teeth. Perhaps, my thoughts were conveyed. Then, he slowly spoke to me in a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is there anyone you’d like me to call, such as your parents?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No… the two of you are enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yesterday, my father and mother spoiled me a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Thank you, Your Highness Sazanjill.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In my blurred vision, I looked up at Lumiere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lumiere… you’ve endured my strict guidance for the past 100 days.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lady Lelouche…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Why are you crying so much? Aren’t you afraid that your eyes will melt?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Apparently, I couldn’t cure that crybaby side to her in 100 days.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I can’t dictate which path you’ll take… But, if possible, I’d be happy if you could support His Highness Sazanjill instead of me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">As you know, His Highness is a bit lacking.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I said that, she shook her head over and over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I can’t do it… If it isn’t Lady Lelouche, it’s impossible!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;Still, I’m sorry, I have no one to ask but you.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…And, even if I know it’s unreasonable, I still prefer you.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, she was the only one who knew everything I had learned, what I’d been thinking about, even though she resented me for the princess education.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If you choose that path, you’ll have to walk an even tougher path&mdash;one that the title of baron can’t handle. So… just lend me your ear.”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">To her, who gently lent me an ear amidst her sobs, I whispered…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Tell your father&mdash;</em>Nameless didn’t protect the witch. Nameless was able to survive because he was protected by the witch&mdash;and that they were genuine lovers.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…God, forgive me, I forgot what I heard from you.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that was the only way I could come up with to help her family. Even if the Alban family became related to the Elcage family… as expected, her title of baron wouldn’t suffice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand, a knowledgeable baron might be able to unravel the history further from that idea alone. If the achievements of Baron Alban&mdash;a historian&mdash;increased, then he might gain more recognition. That way, it wouldn’t be impossible for Lumiere to be adopted by the Elcage family and marry into the royal family.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">It’s going to be a discussion between adults, but… this is the best I can give you.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Then, the last thing I’d like to say is…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That bracelet, if it gets in the way, you may discard it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I won’t&mdash;! I’ll always… I’ll definitely cherish it forever! I’ll never remove it!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;<em class="calibre3">Well, being utterly honest, it doesn’t even match her dress today… What a goofball.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">After smiling, I turned around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness Sazanjill…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is it…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Somehow, I felt like I’d been asked such a question by His Highness all this time. <em class="calibre3">‘What is it?’, </em>or, <em class="calibre3">‘Do you have any worries?’ </em>Until the end, all I did is make him worry… Perhaps, it wasn’t wrong for me to be thought of as a little sister. Hence why, I’d leave the preaching for that older brother…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Currently, His Highness Zafield is still overwhelmed outside. Can you beat him up for me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Beat him up, okay? He’s a naughty boy who doesn’t value his life.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Yes, I’ll definitely give him a lesson.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Also, Your Highness.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes? What is it? What is it, Lelouche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Aah… His Highness’ arms are so warm… I’m getting sleepier…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t feel like I had any strength in my limbs anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But before I closed my eyes&mdash;as someone who was once a candidate for the queen, I had to say this one last thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please, may the world you rule be prosperous.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the doors opened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What caught my eyes was a breathtakingly beautiful painting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The large decoration in front of the venue was nothing compared to what was depicted in the book.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I could no longer see the crowds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, I saw bright red flowers lit up by the brilliant setting sun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amidst such a scenery, a man clad in white could be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was gazing at the same scenery.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Hey, when you turn around, can you tell me your name?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“As if I’ll ever tell you, you bad girl.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the god who descended down with his usual pure white appearance flicked my forehead with his fingertips.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">I could no longer feel any pain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My body was light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Or rather, that was the first time it had ever felt so light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Below my feet, I could see the remains of “Lelouche Elcage” being embraced by His Highness as he stifled his tears. Amidst the crowd, Lumiere’s childish cries reverberated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Hmm… I’m in a worse state than I thought.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Blood was all over the place, and it went without saying that even my <em class="calibre3">new </em>dress was ruined…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Did I fail?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, god. Did I lose the bet?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“What are you talking about? …You did enough. You’ve shown me something truly beautiful.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is that so? But look, my makeup is ruined&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;Lelouche.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">For the first time, he uttered my name.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I involuntarily stared back at him, god briefly showed a painful expression, before talking to me like usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;But, isn’t that cheating!? You told my story to someone who had yet to die!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How is that so? All I did was transformed Nameless’ past into a story that’d give courage, hope, and inspiration to those of the present age.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I don’t like that at all! It’s so embarrassing!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">After making a fuss, god averted his gaze and folded his arms.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Like I said, I don’t like it. Besides, she wasn’t my lover.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, I see. Was it an unrequited love? What a tragic love affair!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Leave me alone&mdash;!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">For me to still be able to ruffle god’s feathers, I was very happy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, god. Let’s dance!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Huh!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I forcibly dragged god into the dance hall. Of course, with a dead lady in the lobby, no music was playing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I usually wouldn’t meddle in <em class="calibre3">someone else’s </em>affairs, but it sure was noisy here…</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, well.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The warm and vivid color emanating from the chandeliers were gorgeous, and so were the flower decorations. Above all, the splendidly-framed paintings at the center of the hall were so colorful&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Should I invite him to admire the paintings of Andre Oscar?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“B-but, I’m not a good dancer!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Apparently, there are things that even god can’t do. It’s alright, let’s just twirl around.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides, no one was watching.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I took god’s hands and started spinning.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu, I don’t have to worry about bumping into someone else.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, dancing while soaring in the air was so much fun!</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, what kind of relationship did you have with the painter, Andre?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Eh? He was my junior back when I was still a student. He always admired me. Even after the incident, he still invited me out and gave me various things.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, is it okay to tell me that?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I had died, weren’t there topics he shouldn’t be telling an ordinary human like me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I continued to tease him in that regard, god sulked and said, <em class="calibre3">‘I won’t talk to you anymore!’</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That appearance of his was so cute, I couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, the same god who said that he wouldn’t talk to me asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…More than that, isn’t there something you want to know?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“For example?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Duh, the future of the second prince!? For your information, his older brother will beat him up after this. Then, after getting beaten, he’d say, ‘As I thought, Lelouche hit the hardest.’”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t care about such a thing!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“For real&mdash;!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Being a ghost sure was great. No matter how much I spun around, I didn’t feel dizzy. Not only that, I also didn’t feel any fatigue. It felt as if I was back in the dream world, where I used to drink tea with God.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I might’ve said something regrettable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite that, I was aware that even if I knew their futures, I wouldn’t be able to return.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I made it brief and spoke with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yep, it doesn’t matter! Besides, to me, their just a trivialities.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…I knew you’d say that.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was Lelouche Elcage, after all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It didn’t matter if I was crying or laughing. It didn’t matter what kind of education I received, or what kind of environment I was born it&mdash;I couldn’t be anything <em class="calibre3">other than myself.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">My hands were too full with myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…As such, please let me indulge myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides, the only thing I could do was believe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hence why I only did what I had to ensure my own happiness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, god.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Hmm…?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Regarding that bet…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t stop my feet, nor could I let go of god’s hand. Even though god had promised to grant my wish, I hesitated to say it out loud. I wondered what kind of expression he’d make…</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Don’t hesitate to tell me your wish? I’m used to your outrageous behavior.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As we spun around, god smiled with an unusually benevolent face.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I dedicate this selfish wish to the wicked you.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Alright, I want us to fall in love.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Okay, let’s arrange for us to fall&mdash;wait, what!?”</em></p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-27"><h1 class="calibre1">60.2 Let’s Perform the Last Dance (4)</h1><p class="calibre2">As expected, god was hesitant&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Not on my watch.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Did he think I’d back down?</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, hadn’t I just led a gentleman&mdash;namely him&mdash;to a dance?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is it no good? From what I heard, it seems that the work of a god is more cumbersome than that of a queen, so why don’t you become a human? It isn’t like you’re suitable to be a god, anyway. How is it? It’s the perfect solution, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“No, no, no, no! I’m suitable for this job, if I do say so myself! But as for falling in love with me (boku)&mdash;”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, my, did god just refer to himself as “I” (boku)? You’re so cute… It suits you! When you spoke so reverently, I always wondered what kind of person you truly were!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Like I said, I was a god!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As he reluctantly danced with me, the god spat those words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu, in past tense?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That trivial phrase made me so happy. Although, he himself might not be aware of that. Nevertheless, his steps became messy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Ugh, enough! Until the end, you just do whatever suit your fancy! What kind of villainess are you!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, I’m honored to be praised.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“As I’ve said countless times, I’m not praising you!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">After taking a deep breath, god exhaled slowly. We had finished dancing. Then, he roughly scratched his head while glaring at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…You won’t regret it?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Regret what?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“If I were to meet you again after being reborn, you won’t say something like, ‘Oh, you really came? I only said that as a joke.’”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, wow, you’re good at mimicking voices. Well, while that’s a great idea, please don’t worry. I can’t promise I won’t complain if you’re late, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we were going to fall in love with each other, it’d be better to start when we were both young. Although falling in love with each other after we matured sounded like a fine idea, I was inexperienced with romance. Therefore, I wanted to start with the basics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides, I wasn’t going to throw away the bet I’d wagered my life on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I hid my smile with my hand, god nodded after slowly sighing once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Haa… </em>Fine, I got it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he spoke while pretending to be in contemplation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“There’re so many things to process, so it’ll be difficult to reunite with you after you’re reborn right away. But… I’ll come for you as soon as possible. As such, can you please wait for me?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Is that truly alright?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“What is…?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you truly in love with me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">I mean, my personality is not exactly agreeable.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">To be honest, even if I was reborn, I doubted that I could become a pure and upright person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I anxiously asked him, god looked unusually happy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With tears in his eyes, he smiled wryly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I’ll grant your wish&mdash;didn’t I promise you that? Besides… no, never mind. Then, until we meet again.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What? After everything we went through, you still dare to keep a secret from me? I thought we’re close!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“This entire conversation happened because of you, okay!? No matter how close we are, it’s just impossible!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Huu… That’s just saddening, I’m going to cry…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I pretended to cry, god extended his hand to me. Although his fingers were white and slender, they had firm knots. When I hesitated about what to do, god made me take his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Now that it has come to this, I’ll have to go, soon. Because of you, I’ve become busy.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I’m not a patient person, you hear me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Alright, okay, I’ll do my best…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, we soared high and passed through the ceiling. His Highness and the others disappeared entirely. The starry sky was brighter than usual, I couldn’t see the ground beneath me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I looked up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, god.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Hmm?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s your real name?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Well, it’s ‘Nameless’?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eeh~…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Alright, I’ll tell you&mdash;”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Until the last minute, I had many conversations with god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, until the next time we met again, it’d be goodbye.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">So, goodbye&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;those I loved, who watched over me…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Thanks to you, I had a very enjoyable time.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Thus, until the day we meet again, my best wishes for you.</em></p>
