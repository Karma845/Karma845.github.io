<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 1 &#8211; Idle Talk: The Monologue of the Former Fiancé</h1><p class="calibre2">I, Sazanjill Lukino Lapisenta, was the first prince of the Kingdom Lapisenta. That made me the crown prince.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t know what benefits the order of birth offered. All I knew was that my duty was to become king ever since I was born. At the same time, the future queen had also been discussed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My future spouse was introduced to me when I was 5-years-old.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Sazanjill, this is Lelouche&mdash;the girl who’ll be your wife.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Even if she’s called my future wife…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I could only see the black hair of a little girl hiding behind her slightly rotund father. Her long black hair was actually graceful. My mother told me that such a color was uncommon in our kingdom, Lapisenta. Apparently, it seemed to be the characteristic of a foreigner. Her mother was apparently a beautiful woman referred to as the ‘Foreign Beauty.’</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I didn’t think my mother found it as amusing, as that sort of title should be reserved for her, the queen. Furthermore, the daughter of her rival had become her successor. Said daughter would become my wife and would stand while shouldering the future of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Well, that kind of adult situation had nothing to do with us. We were five and two years old at the time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Play with your friend in the garden.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As there was going to be an adult discussion, I was entrusted with taking care of Lelouche. Of course, there were maids around but… She seemed curious about my actions. She was immersed in observing me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Well, I’m in trouble…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I had a younger brother who was of the same age as her, but he was currently asleep with a cold. Of course, that was my first time looking after a girl. Occasionally, I saw some little girls at the salon of the tea ceremony my mother participated in, but I only greeted them. I never played with any of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As such, what should I do with this girl who seemed ready to cry at being separated from her father?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is your hobby?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you interested in flowers? Let’s admire the garden.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Or, would you like me to prepare some sweets?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Uh, what about horses? I can be one…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A, a horse?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Horse!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Why did she only react there!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">About two hours passed before her parents decided to pick her up. I carried her on my back endlessly and was on all fours the entire time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Your Highness, I feel like I caught a glimpse of the future couple.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, some say that a man is happier when he’s driven by a woman.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As they made those remarks, her parents’ eyes seemed distant. But I was wondering if it was alright, since the little, black-haired, girl seemed to be enjoying herself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I started meeting her regularly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though we were engaged, we were still but eight and five years old at the time. All we did was roam around the garden looking for bugs together.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tMCpFp0/201747.jpg" width= "345;" height= "460;"></img>

<p class="calibre2">“By the way, Lelouche, is it alright for you to be looking for frogs today?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of her as an innocent girl. She didn’t care much about manners&mdash;probably because her mother was a foreigner. It was said that her mother was a third princess in her homeland… Well, I didn’t mean to badmouth another kingdom I knew nothing about.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the girl in front of me, I was enjoying myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I mean, Lelouche is a girl? Don’t you want to read a picture book? We can draw together.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I hate playing at home.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As it had rained yesterday, Lelouche felt sure that there were still some frogs in the garden. (It seemed that she had read it in a picture book.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, we ended up crouching down by a puddle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche puffed her cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yesterday, I was sewing with my mother…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, what did you make?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A rabbit plush toy.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t that amazing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But it isn’t cute at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She said so and lowered her face. Reflected upon the puddle was her almost crying expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She was only five years old, right? Why was she so depressed at not being able to sew?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was said that the formal princess education would start after she celebrated her fifth birthday. I was allowed to see her for a bit, but my mother was truly stern. She was much stricter than she used to be. My younger brother, Zafield, and I were often punished… But I felt that my mother was even stricter with Lelouche.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Honestly, I couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That girl should’ve been crying and running away. But instead, while holding back her tears, she tried to face my mother’s strictness upfront.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Then, isn’t it alright to spoil her a little?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“If so, can you give me the plush toy?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That stuffed animal. It’ll be my birthday soon. I want that stuffed rabbit.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her eyes went wide. Those black, pearl-like eyes, which contrasted her bright skin, were staring at me. But, she quickly dropped her gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But, I already threw it away.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If so, make it again.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But, it’s awful?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s alright.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It truly isn’t cute?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll still like it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, she laughed a little. “Your Highness is weird.” Until a while ago, she called me, ‘<em class="calibre3"><span>Onii</span>-chan.’ </em>It felt like it had been a long time ago, and I felt lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As long as it made Lelouche happy, anything was fine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was the vow I had made towards my fiancée in my childhood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The stuffed animal I promised… is unbefitting of Your Highness. So, I’ll give you this instead.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">During my birthday celebration, what Lelouche gave me in such a mature tone was a ready-made fountain pen. The small rabbit carved with the engraving of my name was probably compensation for breaking her promise. Perhaps, because she was in front of many, she felt nervous. She kept glancing at her parents and my mother.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I was aware of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She must had done her best to make a stuffed animal. In the first place, she was the one who threw it away when I wanted to see it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;I carefully accepted the fountain pen, and put on an exaggerated smile that everyone could see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you! I’m very happy!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, that’s a relief…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">But, Lelouche&mdash;did you know?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Inside my jacket was the ugly rabbit you thought you had thrown away. There was no way I could dispose of something she had made. Her efforts, her kindness&mdash;I wanted to cherish her for the rest of my life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is the best birthday gift.”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">Lelouche’s princess education was especially fierce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When she was 10-years-old, and I was about 13-years-old, I once had a private conversation with my mother.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked her, “Do you really need to be so strict?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">To that question, my mother’s sharp eyes widened for a moment. However, she soon concealed her face with fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do you think I’m someone who’d waste my time doing something unnecessary?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But there’s still time before she makes her social debut, other than that&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You, are you going to suspect me of bullying her due to my grudges, as well?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…<em class="calibre3">As well?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment I asked that, my mother sighed loudly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I just reprimanded Zafield the other day. I made a mistake with him, but you, on the other hand, are about to make your social debut.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’d be qualified to participate in the social circles after her thirteenth birthday. The same applied to other aristocrats, as well. Naturally, that also included the royal family. Seemingly about to reach a turning point, my mother put her hands on my shoulders. After confirming that no one was around, her face approached mine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…The world of women is really difficult!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mother…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was taken aback by the tone and attitude that was different from her usual lady-like manner. However, my mother’s enthusiastic speech that resembled a complaint didn’t stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t mean to say that the world of men is sweet. All I can express is, sinistery hides beneath all those prim appearances! Lurking behind those smiles and white powder is nothing but filth! Moreover, to hide behind a man once it becomes inconvenient&mdash;that kind of mindset needs to be changed! I believe that when someone hit you, you need to strike back a million times harder!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“M, mother, I got it, already…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is that so?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt like my mother, who laughed on purpose, had been possessed by a demon of madness. As I withdrew, my mother looked down at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Anyway, whether she likes it or not, as the one who’ll stand at the top, she’ll have to face some battles. If this auntie were to give her the slightest bit of leniency, she’d get gobbled up. I wouldn’t want that. As such, I have to give her proper weapons to stand up for herself. To give her the right amount of confident to laugh at those noisy, feathery, cretins.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She then smiled gently while saying, “I’m still her second mother.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My mother would only show that warm expression when Zafield or I fell ill. At the same time, I couldn’t get the fact that my mother had just spoken with such vulgarity out of my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">It must have been my imagination…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t believe she just referred to herself as an auntie, to have badmouthed other aristocrats. What was more&mdash;to call them ‘<em class="calibre3">noisy, feathery, cretins.’ </em>while grinning…</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">No way, there’s just no way.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I asked for a confirmation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, it isn’t because you dislike Lelouche or her mother?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, I dislike that <em class="calibre3">‘Foreign Beauty’ </em>princess, alright. But I do wonder… will her beauty remain for eternity? Not only that, she’s so subservient to her husband, even referring to him with honorifics from her kingdom… Her brazenness drives me crazy.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mother…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She didn’t seem to want to hear it. I didn’t know what to call her honest impression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, my mother snapped her fan shut.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I won’t do anything as petty as hitting the girl. She’s innocent. Rather, I feel sorry for her. She has to marry into the royal family despite the fact that she doesn’t like it. It’s because of the family history of her parents… Well, the daughters of noble families are nothing more than tools. Still, as expected, I wish we had a little more choice in this day and age.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mother was formerly a princess of a neighboring kingdom. She seemed to have gotten married for the sake of maintaining peace. But like a habit, she often told my father, “I married you because I want to.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, in her homeland, there seemed to be many candidates for the marriage. Among her brothers and sisters, she seemed to have been chosen. She said that she won the title of Queen Lapisenta through rock-paper-scissors after having a conflict with her younger sister.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche, on the other hand, was born to be my fiancée. Due to the agreement decided by her parents, she wasn’t given any options. It was the same for me… but I couldn’t think of anyone other than her, so I never thought of it as unfortunate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;But what about Lelouche?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t ask her that because I was afraid.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I pondered about that, my mother gently stroked my head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, that’s why. As a man, what you’ve just done is quite evil. If you’re one of the gentlemen, try to be in a position where she can remain assured enough to focus on her battle. Refrain from stepping into her world.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…But, what I just did, isn’t that what women usually want?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I lifted my eyebrows at her so-called general theory. My mother dismissed me with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She said, “You should broaden your horizon.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That smile convinced me. That was the face of a woman who stood at the top of the kingdom&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;and that was also what Lelouche was striving for.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Even if you say so…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I was told to not step into the world of women, I couldn’t help but worry about her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet when I asked Lelouche, she’d resolutely answer&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;<em class="calibre3">That’s correct, </em>Your Highness. I do feel that it’d be troublesome if an outsider were to barge into my world. But more importantly, the queen isn’t bullying me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, she was about 13-years-old. Recently, she seemed to have deepened her knowledge regarding the history of the arts. However, she also had bad memories towards my mother’s treatment towards her. Due to how she was treated that day, she was depressed. Thus, I asked her if she was still in pain and if there was anything I could do for her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immediately before her social debut, she became able to execute the most elegant curtsey I had ever seen from a noble lady in the last three days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you for your concern, Your Highness Sazanjill, but I’m alright. Her Majesty scolded me due to my own failure. I’m grateful she was willing to point it out.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;She smiled humbly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That night, as I slept in the castle bedroom, I heard singing from the hallway.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Eh? A ghost?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I believed that ghosts were fictitious&mdash;something out of one’s delusions. Or to be precise, one’s delusions were the catalyst for that. As such, the possibility that such mysterious phenomenon could occur existed. Perhaps, the books only lied about the ghosts being fictitious&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">As I thought…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I want to go to the bathroom.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how much I argued to dispel my fear, I couldn’t suppress the urge to go to the toilet. To experience wetting myself or to face a mysterious phenomenon. Faced with those ultimate choices, the latter was the only option for the future king candidate who had already made his social debut.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Uuh, how cold…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While holding my sleepwear, I walked through the terrifyingly dark corridor. Every time I got closer to my destination, the singing only grew louder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I saw it&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Aah~ this helmet is so cloudy~ father~ I’m giving up~ this head~”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">She had donned a maid’s uniform. If possible, I wanted to see her wearing such garments in a bright place. After all, I was sure it would emphasize her gorgeous black hair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that a modest appearance, she entwined herself with the decorative armor as if dancing. She was happily polishing the top of its helmet with a cloth. Soon, her song reached its zenith&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">How lovely~ is the vegetable noodle~”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, Lelouche Elcage met my eyes. Her cheerful singing stopped. For some reason, I was giving a round of applause to her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What a nice song.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, is it alright for me to keep singing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">For some reason, even after I had reached at the toilet, or even after I fell asleep, her singing party didn’t stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche would be staying at the royal castle for two nights and three days. Part of her princess education required her to reside in the royal castle day and night to acquire the spirit and taste of the royal family.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, the following day, Lelouche was still in the castle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to my lack of sleep the previous night, I overslept a little. I had to hurry to the cafeteria. After all, I had promised to eat with my entire family. Not to mention, Lelouche would be present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the way, I met Zafield who was staring across the courtyard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Zafield, if you don’t hurry, mother will scold you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, older brother…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was stunned…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“L, Lelouche!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She was rolling around in the courtyard. Moreover, she was laughing boisterously. Her dress was caked with grass and mud.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I rushed to her rescue, she greeted me with a perfect smile as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Oh my, </em>good morning, Your Highness Sazanjill. What a fine day this is.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, what the hell are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Shouldn’t it be obvious? As you can see, I’m practicing cartwheels.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“C, cartwheels!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Fufu, </em>it seems that you’re still half asleep.’</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Does she think I’m befuddled from sleep deprivation?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">But it wasn’t necessary for Lelouche to learn cartwheels, right? Would any lady be cartwheeling at a party?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I involuntarily turned towards Zafield who had already fled. He probably went to call someone. Then, all I had to do was calm Lelouche who was smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A, ah… I see, I just can’t think of anything else to say… Why are you doing such a thing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because I want to master acrobatics!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A, acrobatics?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Indeed. The other day, I saw the performance of a theatrical group called a circus with my father. I was truly impressed.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Certainly, a circus came to the Elcage territory last weekend. I was also invited, but I couldn’t miss my public-related affairs.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I wonder if it was truly entertaining?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">More importantly, I’m glad that she enjoyed it.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Therefore, I want to dive into a circle of fire!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">A circle of fire!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Also, wouldn’t it be great if I were to be able to train a beast?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Is the beast in her previous statement a metaphor?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, from the flow of the conversation, I could only assume that she was referring to the real thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, what should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It had been a while ever since I last saw Lelouche’s black eyes gleaming. I was truly happy at the sight.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">If I were to ride a beast and dive into the ring of fire, would Lelouche be&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Then, as my thoughts strayed;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Brother! Lelouche! I’ve called her father!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Zafieeeeeeld&mdash;!!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">They came!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">As expected of my brother, Zafield!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was truly relieved, delighted to the brink of tears at having such a competent brother.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zafield had summoned our parents. After they had kindly admonished Lelouche, she was made to return to bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, I don’t see anything wrong with that. It’s common for adolescent girls, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;I think my mother’s education might be too strict?!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">After saying that to my mother, she casually dismissed me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because you were so noisy, a doctor was called in. That said, I don’t think there’s anything to be worried about? If she can rid herself of her frustrations every once in a while, won’t she be satisfied?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Should you be speaking in such a manner towards your own son?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t grasp what my mother meant by ‘rid herself of her frustrations.’</p>
<p class="calibre2">My father, who stopped us while sighing, said, “Everything is fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course, you should stop her before she gets hurt. Once she grows up, I’m sure her eccentricity will calm down. Until then, kindly keep an eye on her.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Even though I was admonished by my parents, I was still worried about Lelouche.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I asked Lelouche, who was diagnosed as “Not having any issues,” by the doctor, “Lelouche, is there anything I can do for you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;In return, I was given an unprecedentedly harsh gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness, may I say something…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course, tell me anything!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Aren’t you being a little self-centered?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Self-centered? Me…?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Was it wrong for me, as the elder, to worry about my three years younger fiancée?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if she was already 12 years old, I still recalled the vestiges of those days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That day when she was delighted to ride on my back. That day she was sad because she couldn’t make a stuffed animal well&mdash;I could still recall them…</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">That’s why, I…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you for your concern, but I can do it by myself without the help of Your Highness.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“B, but we’re a couple…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If so, shouldn’t you worry about yourself before worrying about me? Don’t the princes also have to take royal education? I’ve heard rumors that your grades are lackluster.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Wha!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">While it was true that the academy I had entered that year require more than the average minimum regarding grades, it wasn’t as strict as top academies. More importantly, I couldn’t bring public affairs to the dormitory, so I often returned to the royal castle (to see Lelouche). However, it could be said that I hadn’t been studying enough. More than that, together with her, I wanted to&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;To each of their own, let’s do our best first. I’m alright alone. I’ll definitely become a queen that suits you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">But if that’s what she wants…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I shall hold my breath and watch over her. I shall also do my best to become a king suitable for her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if her heart broke in that difficult world of women, then…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I’d definitely support her. No matter how eccentric she behaved. No matter how many tears she shed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter who she was, I’d be the man she wanted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I swore that to the clumsy stuffed animal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, her eccentricity did diminish as she grew older, but it never went down to zero.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hence, when she enrolled into the academy, a lot of trouble and misfortune occurred. At first, I thought I was going to have a seizure.</p>
