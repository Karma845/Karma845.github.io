<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 2 &#8211; Their Positions Have Changed</h1><p class="calibre2">&mdash;20 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Are you truly returning to the academy starting tomorrow?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had fully recovered from my cold. Rather, I felt tired from sleeping too much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was healthy, taking a break from the academy would be outrageous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At my immediate response, god furrowed his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Why don’t you just stop meeting everyone?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh my, do you want to monopolize me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While holding the special tea that I had brought into my dream that night, I smirked at god. In response, he slammed his own cup on the table. <em class="calibre3">Oh, no… </em>The special tea spilled onto the tablecloth. Of course, there was no maid within my dream. When I thought of bringing a handkerchief next time, I noticed that god was trembling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s wrong? God, are you perhaps sick?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“N, no. A god doesn’t get sick. You don’t have to worry about that.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right. To be healthy all the time&mdash;I envy you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, dear.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite me smiling throughout the entire conversation, god was sighing deeply. He was a very beautiful person, to the point that he appeared picturesque. Still, I wanted to see the other sides of him. By the way, I felt like I rarely saw him smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Hmm… how do I make him laugh?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite my worries, god poured himself more tea and drank it all at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;You missed the point! Shouldn’t it be obvious? I don’t know what will happen to you if you do as you please! What’s with you!? Why did you offer to annul your engagement now?! You also aren’t flirting with the second prince! What is it that you want!? What is it that you are trying to do?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I haven’t decided yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also drank my tea all at once and smiled gracefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Everything is for the sake of my beautiful death.”<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;19 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Life was unpredictable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Lelouche Elcage! Please marry me!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amongst all the students, was there anyone who could have predicted His Highness Sazanjill’s new morning greeting? Even I was caught off guard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, His Highness was donning a uniform. However, within his hand was a bouquet of bright red roses that didn’t at all belong at the academy. As expected of the ‘Golden Prince.’ His kneeling appearance was so beautiful, no one could help but be fascinated by it&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Although, there were some bluish-black marks on his face. Seeing that they hadn’t heal in a week, that must had been painful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, we were at the academy. It was the middle of the main street, a few steps away from the academy’s gate. Moreover, it was a few minutes before the morning homeroom would start. He was attracting a lot of attention from both outside and inside the academy buildings. No matter how much I thought about it, that wasn’t the time for a proposal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Let’s not inquire any further about this.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I passed by next to him, there was a lady waiting for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead of laughing at the scene before her, she gave an excellent curtsey with a perfect smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While curtsying, I also gave a smile to the lovely lady with fluffy, coral-colored, hair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good morning, Lumiere. It’s a fine day today.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good morning, Lady Lelouche. I’m very happy to see you in good health.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you very much for your polite greeting. Shall we go to the classroom?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">At my modest invitation, her eyes widened for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, her curtsey was fine, indeed. It didn’t pale in comparison to mine, someone who was an ‘Un’ grade student. My compliment must had been conveyed as her expression became brilliant.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…That smile&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Surely, she’d be able to bring happiness to many in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you telling the truth?! Thank you for accompanying me!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, what an exaggeration.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I patted Lumiere’s shoulder. She was half a step behind me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Lelouche…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ignored the voice that was calling for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was satisfied. I could go to the academy with a friend.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, that night&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;I see, you prefer those of the same sex!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I won’t deny that kind of orientation. But sexually, I prefer men.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That day, I tried to brew an herbal tea with an elaborate taste. I chose tea leaves with a relaxing effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But… the god didn’t calm down at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Then, why did you ignore the proposals of both princes and instead make friends with a noble lady?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, my. I did that merely because in my absence, she studied hard and showed me quite the gracious figure. Do I need any other reason to be nice to her?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“That may be the case, but… what will you do now? What about those siblings?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“If you read my heart, you’ll understand it right away.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I teasingly winked at god.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…You said you didn’t like any of them.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Indeed. So please watch until the end.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After smiling so much, I drank the herbal tea and suddenly asked&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;By the way, is god alright as a man?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…What do you think?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Maybe, just to confirm, I should peel off your clothes right here and now.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Don’t do that!? That’ll be especially bad!!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I laughed a little when I saw god mumbling in concern. I wondered which aspect of him was manly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Ah, this is good.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks to the herbal tea, the inside of my chest felt warm.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;18 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During a rainy day&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Lelouche Elcage! I’m here to propose to you again&mdash;”<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;17 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even on a day where the wind was strong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Lelouche Elcage, at the very least, listen to my explanation&mdash;”<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;16 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, even during a sunny day filled with beautiful autumn leaves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lady Lelouche Elcage, this humble man beseeches you to listen to his story!”<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;15 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Don’t abandon me!!!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That day, too, I passed by His Highness Sazanjill and went with Lumiere to the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Elcage, I want to talk to you for a moment, is that okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The teacher in charge called out to me. After glancing at Lumiere, I left for the staff room. Then, I was shown something.<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, did you really receive a bad score?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Yes, on two subjects, as well. I was surprised.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">During lunch break, I had a conversation with His Highness Zafield when I was about to ask for sword practice. As soon as we were alone in the corner of the usual academy grounds, His Highness leaned against the wall with his arms crossed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, rather than that, please train me today as well. Last time, it was about how to anticipate a blow to the abdomen, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, no, we can’t have that. You have to study.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s not necessary.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I answered immediately while swinging my sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Whether it was a bad score or failure, it wouldn’t matter. I’d die in a dozen days. My parents would be surprised, of course. But after the loss of their daughter, I didn’t think my bad grades would matter. To delay the teacher from reporting that to my parents, I shall bribe her for the next dozen or so days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Practicing swordsmanship was much more important than any of that. It was physical preparation. Although to be honest, I still didn’t have much insight about the assassination of His Highness Sazanjill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By the way, Your Highness Zafield, are you planning to assassinate His Highness Sazanjill?’</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What? Why would you casually ask me that?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, will you seriously answer?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tilted my head, and His Highness Zafield smiled in response.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t see any reason to kill such a miserable brother. He is already doing it to himself, every morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Miserable… it is?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In that regard, I’m very grateful to Lelouche. I’m looking forward to tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, as long as I can help.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Truly, for the time being, it seemed unconceivable that His Highness Sazanjill would be targeted by an assassin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If such was the case, then I didn’t have to master swordsmanship anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Still, it’s unpleasant to quit in the middle of something you’ve started. Therefore, please continue!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, I told you to study!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh dear, I almost forgotten the original topic.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield was also stubborn, wasn’t he?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, with a tone as if admonishing a child, His Highness asked me;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…So? Why did you end up with such a low score? I know you were in bed due to a cold just recently, but you seem to be unexpectedly fine?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Although my score is considered <em class="calibre3">below average, </em>the standard in our class is over 80%. While the exam questions are the same, it’s quite unfortunate that the standard score of each class is different.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right&mdash;no, I won’t be fooled! It’s unheard of for an ‘Un’ class person to have such a bad mark!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Eeh.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Certainly, I always tried to stay on top. It might seem natural, but that was also the result of studying hard while no one else was looking? The etiquette and history I learned from the queen’s education were different from the academics taught by the academy, such as arithmetic and business administration. As such, I also had to put in effort to cover the latter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, for the last 100 days, I had put my efforts elsewhere. Not to mention, I was absent for a week. Even though I went to class, it was difficult to say that I was concentrating. I also hadn’t done any self-studying&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">it is what it is…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I had invested a proper amount of time into my studies, the regular test was held immediately upon my return. On that same day, His Highness Sazanjill had also started proposing to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Did he do well in his exam?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How were His Highness Sazanjill’s scores?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Who knows? But since it’s my older brother, I don’t think he will be lackluster about it. <em class="calibre3">‘If my scores are bad, I won’t be able to face Lelouche!’ </em>That kind of scream kept echoing around midnight.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt sorry to everyone who worked in the mansion. It must had been terrible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it couldn’t be helped that I didn’t pass. I didn’t have any choice but to do what I should do!</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, let’s start training with confidence!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, as I keep saying, Lelouche should study!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I felt very reluctant. That day’s lunch break ended after I was told to study.<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That, is it true that Lady Lelouche has to try again?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After school that day, as soon as I went to the empty classroom to educate Lumiere, she asked me that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed that the rumors, <em class="calibre3">‘The villainess, Lelouche Elcage, who has His Highness begging on his knees, received bad scores?!’ </em>were well known to Lumiere’s ‘Trois’ class.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Oh, my, since whenever did I become a villainess?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I heard that, I couldn’t help but feel curious. After all, it was quite a transition from the merciful fiancée. However, Lumiere didn’t concern herself with that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mayhap… you spent too much time on me, forsaking your own studies&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, my. Lumiere, are you calling me stupid?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, of course not!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She rushed to deny it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, like I said, I was stupid.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the first time in my life, I had to a supplementary lecture for the additional exam. Moreover, it seemed that I’d have to skip the make-up class. Somehow, recently, my duty as an aristocrat felt irrelevant. Was that because I had only a little bit of time left?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, it wasn’t Lumiere’s fault. I did everything myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was thinking of a way to convey it to Lumiere who was half-crying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s my time to shine!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Goodbye, because no one has called you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would have liked for the person who had burst through the open door to leave immediately. But unfortunately, that person was His Highness Sazanjill. There was no reason for a prince to unconditionally comply to a request of a duke’s daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I refuse! It’s time for a senior like me, who has maintained top grades for majority of his three years in school, to be useful?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Is that so? Rather, isn’t your perfect track record useless against bad grades and additional exams?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I won’t be turned down! I’ve already readied my equipment!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness presented a lot of notes with both his hands. But while responding appropriately, I turned to Lumiere, “Did you call him?” She nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">How utterly unnecessary…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">What was more, she also didn’t listen to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“For the time being, don’t concern yourself with my problems. Please make up your score quickly.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You aren’t planning on skipping, are you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No way. I was able to reach the top of my class on my own this time as well. Next year, I will be in the same class as Lady Lelouche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Promotions of class were reviewed with consideration to the results and performance of the past year. The contents of the exams were the same for all classes. Not only did Lumiere managed to become the top of the ‘Trois’ class, her scores seemed to have exceeded that of ‘Deux’ and the average score of ‘Un’, as well. In other words, she had scored better than me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though until recently, she was at the bottom of the ‘Trois’ class. While I had a cold, she must had been doing her best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I want to be Lady Lelouche’s friend!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I smiled bitterly at the former thief cat who bashfully said that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Aren’t we, already?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It couldn’t be helped. I bowed to His Highness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please tutor me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As my student went so far to say that much, I couldn’t avoid showing her a disgraceful sight at the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, even though I only said one sentence, she was already making such a fuss. As I thought, she still had a long way to go before she could become a proper lady. I had to help her improve as much as possible. At the same time, there were still many things I wanted to teach her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, we’d naturally end up getting to know each other, right?</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;14 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“C’mon, Lelouche! Let’s study!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made plans to study with His Highness Sazanjill in the mornings and after school. Meanwhile, during the afternoons, I’d have sword practice. As I thought, I couldn’t quit. I had to see it through until the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After school, Lumiere would also study with us. His Highness was shocked at my instructing Lumiere to balance eight books on top of her head.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…I might cry, as well.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I stopped. I felt like I mustn’t cause the future ruler to shed tears.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Now that he mentioned it, I’ve never heard of any future ruler crying…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness prepared his own teaching materials. The main points were summarized in a very easy-to-understand manner. His Highness’ commentaries on those subjects were also quite enticing. I was spending an unexpectedly fulfilling time learning trivia and other tidbits of knowledge that wasn’t limited to the exams.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Regardless…<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></em></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;13 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cold air of the early morning turned my breath into a somewhat white mist when I exhaled. That day, His Highness Sazanjill arranged an empty classroom for us to use again. We were both sitting around one desk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I stopped my pen, which I had been silently running across the page.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness, have you been sleeping properly?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Fuah!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked after I finished solving the problems. His Highness, who had created those problems, made a strange sound.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Let’s overlook the strange sound…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The area under your eyes is dark blue. Are you sleeping properly?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, isn’t that normal? I’ve been sleeping 24 hours every day!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Considering that we only have 24 hours a day, you must be having a wonderful night’s sleep.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…For him to not even notice my sarcasm, it must be worse than I thought.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I closed the notebook and stood up. Finally, Sazanjill showed a semblance of awareness. He sat up and held my arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, wait, Lelouche! I’ll definitely help you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Then, Your Highness, I have a request.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is it?! I will make it happen!!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Please don’t look so desperate? I’m the ungrateful girl who requested you annul our engagement, remember? Still, what a fool…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Can you sit there and close your eyes for 30 seconds?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">At my unexpected suggestion, His Highness’s widened. Yet, due to my pleading tone, he relented. Although he seemed unwilling, he still closed his lapis lazuli eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">One, two…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I counted slowly in my heart. It didn’t take long for His Highness’ breathing to relax.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That he wasn’t getting a proper amount of sleep was only natural. The moment our classes ended, His Highness would return to the royal castle and work hard on public affairs. Despite that, he still made time for us to study after school…</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…At what time do you do your official duties?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">To begin with, when did you even create these supplementary exam preparation notes for first years?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was flipping through a pile of such notes, I noticed a certain book was mixed within them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Bringing public affairs materials to school isn’t good, you know…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…At the same time, I knew it was by accident.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, notes were also sandwiched in the book. Words such as, <em class="calibre3">‘costume rental’, ‘garments for a &nbsp;national holiday’, ‘waste reduction’, </em>and <em class="calibre3">‘approval of His Majesty’</em> greeted my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Is this an idea for a proposal?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Really, he should be focusing on this more important matter than me.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…What an absolute busybody.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I sighed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">If you want to be useful to me, didn’t we already agree you wouldn’t intruding into my private affairs?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t feel like being sarcastic. Because …it was partly my fault. I didn’t know that he’d be that desperate after the annulment. Even if he wasn’t actually in love with Lumiere, I thought that he’d only be slightly depressed. I didn’t think that he’d go to such lengths to catch my attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">I am loved.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only now did I realize that, but it was too late. What could a woman who’d die in 14 days do?</p>
<p class="calibre2">All I could do was stay away.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">May you not be lonely anymore.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">All I had to do was ensure that the path I was going to take was as bright as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gently brushed the bangs that obscured His Highness’ eyes. His face was pretty. I didn’t know he could make such a foolish expression. I didn’t know even though he was my fiancé that entire time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…I barely know anything about you.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Had I noticed earlier, would I have made a different decision?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, Sazanjill.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the first time, I called him without honorifics. That would be the first&mdash;<em class="calibre3">and also the last.</em></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/BcYkmgw/201748.jpg" width= "345;" height= "460;"></img>

<p class="calibre2">I gently stood up and left the classroom so as to not wake him. It was about time for the other students to come to school. Of course, that classroom was off-limits&mdash;<em class="calibre3">but, oh…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Leaving His Highness alone in an empty classroom wasn’t good, wasn’t it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless of His Highness Zafield’s denial, claiming that the assassination case was resolved was difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Then, is this the moment the swordsmanship I’ve honed comes into play&mdash;?!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was when I tried to turn around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My heart skipped for a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking back on the familiar voice, I saw the Silver Prince&mdash;His Highness Zafield. How rare. He brought a paper bag with him. It smelled delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When he saw the look on my face, His Highness Zafield chuckled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You see, I bought some for my brother, too. Has Lelouche eaten breakfast, yet?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was right&mdash;during yesterday’s lunch break, light snacks such as cookies were no longer enough. The fact that my stomach rumbled lead to my getting laughed a lot during the training. It was still fresh in my memory. Just remembering it embarrassed me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Why did I make such a blunder…?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The actual reason was simple&mdash;I didn’t have time to eat breakfast in the mornings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I looked inside the bag, I saw a lot of delicious bread. <em class="calibre3">Oh, is that fresh cream? </em>I grabbed a piece of the bread filled with fresh cream and took a bite on spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">How sweet! I’m happy!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment I opened my mouth to take another bite, His Highness Zafield wiped the corner of my mouth before proceeding to lick his fingertip.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Surprisingly, Lelouche is a glutton.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Please keep that confidential.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course, being able to monopolize such a cute side of Lelouche is great.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, may I ask for more?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield tilted his head and asked, “Do you want a drink?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I told him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“His Highness Sazanjill is sleeping in the classroom. Can you bring him to the nurses office?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, what?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield was flabbergasted to the point that his beauty was ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I told him while smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Right now, he’s sleeping alone in that empty classroom. This is the perfect opportunity to assassinate him, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Like I said, that kind of joke isn’t funny!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I grabbed another piece of bread and left. “Thank you for the help.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I could hear a big sigh from behind me… but, he was close with his brother. I was sure leaving him to His Highness Zafield would be alright.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;12 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had grown quite accustomed to the morning study sessions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps, His Highness Sazanjill also reflected on himself after being carried off bridal-style by his younger brother yesterday. That morning, the dark circles under his eyes had become much thinner. His Highness Zafield also brought some bread earlier than yesterday, allowing us to eat while studying together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, Lelouche, to solve that question, shouldn’t you be using this formula?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, you’re right.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In that case, this is better. The answer you end up with is the same, but this one saves about two calculations.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">We were all sitting around the same desk. Moreover, to surround one notebook while eating bread, it felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, the two royal siblings didn’t seem to be on bad terms. Although it might had been early in the morning, inviting Lumiere might be a good idea. While considering that, I focused on my studies</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that soon came to an end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have a shift this afternoon. Therefore, I’ll have to take my leave.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see, I’m tired, too. See you after school.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, I shall head for my classroom.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I left cleaning up the classroom to the two and headed out into the corridor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless of their titles, they still had to do their classroom shifts. As there was nothing else left for me to do, I made plans to visit my homeroom teacher in the morning, update my diary, and note down the necessary learning materials. Afterwards, in-between my classes, I would have to clean the blackboard. That was part of my shift.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;Thus, I went to the staff room, safely put my diary away, and then tried to enter the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, I was splashed by water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, my, I apologize. As you were late for the afternoon class, I cleaned the blackboard in your stead.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How is it? Marvelous, no?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lala Fable and Media Remel were the one behind that brazen action. Once again, they were wearing matching ribbons. Today, too, they were still good friends.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the blackboard as prompted, I let out a small gasp.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Well, what do you think?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn’t just the two who laughed at my expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">‘Depraved Lady’, ‘Lelewd’, ‘The Tainted Future Queen (lol)’, ‘Flower Blooming in Mud’. </em>The board was scribbled with words I didn’t like. Not even I would use such vulgar and insulting words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone in class was laughing at the graffiti drawn with colorful chalk. Their unity was beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry to pop your balloon, but the teacher can’t write like this. So, I’ll erase it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I started erasing the blackboard, I could still hear laughter from behind me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">‘She’s trying to act strong.’ ‘Wow, how stuck-up.’</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards those words, I needn’t pay any heed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The graffiti seemed to have been drawn with great force. As such, it wasn’t disappearing easily. At that time, I heard a low voice coming from the classroom door.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Lelouche, what are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The classroom stilled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I exhaled a little and turned around with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness Zafield, as you can see, I’m merely doing my duty.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why are you soaked?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My uniform still clung to my skin. My drenched hair was still dripping with droplets. Still, to me, who kept smiling, His Highness Zafield was unconvinced.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">That’s not good. Don’t make such a terrifying expression. It’ll ruin the title of ‘Silver Prince’ and the two other fancy nicknames you have.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You misunderstand. I tried cleaning the blackboard with water, only to spill it on myself. How careless of me!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, my hand, which was cleaning the blackboard, was caught by him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you truly alright?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, your breath is tickling my ear.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next thing he did was sigh. I was robbed of the rag as it was. When I turned around, His Highness Zafield had reverted to his usual self.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll do it instead. Please change your clothes, Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But I can do it myself&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Are you trying to bother me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I looked down at my chest. Certainly, my uniform clung to it. However, it wasn’t transparent, for it wasn’t the summer uniform. Nevertheless, His Highness Zafield seemed keen on dismissing me&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Well, it’s fine.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">For the most part, I was able to erase the parts I didn’t want His Highness to see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well then, I shall happily oblige.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll tell the teacher. Take your time.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before leaving the classroom, I thanked him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, I turned around and smiled bitterly. Instead of Lumiere of the ‘Trois’ class, they were now targeting me. They thought I had fallen so miserably. Thus, in an attempt to curry favor from the royal siblings, they targeted me instead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yesterday, I received multiple gifts from both the Silver and the Golden Princes. It was a shame that the news hadn’t reached them. Personally, the painting they had given me was too godly, though…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">But, are you all aware?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">To pick a fight with me also means angering both of His Highnesses.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Would your parents approve of your actions?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">How courageous&mdash;! How bold&mdash;! I didn’t hate it, at all&mdash;!</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">So, how should I return the favor?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I contemplated that while combing my damp, black, hair.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;11 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a house that had been growing in power for many years, the Elcage family had a bad reputation. Part of the reason why was because my mother came from abroad. The fact that it was due to diplomatic reasons was something no one paid any heed to. That said, none of that meant my parents couldn’t socialize with them. They just weren’t very social.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For that reason, now that there was no official successor, the opportunity to destroy my family existed. Hence, the students of the ‘Un’ class began oppressing me. They might had been trying to dabble in my father’s work, as well, but no news regarding that had reached my ears. At the same time, I didn’t want to worry my family. Thus, for the sake of the future, I had to get along with everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, unfortunately, starting from the next day was a break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, there was going to be a follow-up exam over the weekend. Thus, to keep from revealing any vulnerability, I acted enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What would you like as a reward?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’ve been studying hard. I want to reward you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Sazanjill, who came all the way to the Elcage family (without an appointment to visit), asked me while examining my answers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right, should I give you something?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield (who without an appointment to visit) leaned over from the other side. <em class="calibre3">Your Highness Sazanjill, I don’t mind you glaring angrily at your brother, but please don’t corner me?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, from behind. “…Should I go home?” Lumiere (the only one I invited) tried to read the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, you shouldn’t.” I ignore the other two and stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;I proceeded to open my closet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Anything is fine, please choose the one you like.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Fueee!?</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to the strange noise she made, I wanted to give her a light smack… but, it was understandable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, what was in the closet were my dresses. There were about ten outfits for everyday wear inside…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Ah, I see. She’d prefer something better.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“For party, we’ll need to go to another room. Let’s go see them.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, no, no! I can’t possibly receive such a fine thing!? I just came to pick up one of your old ones?! Also, wasn’t it supposed to be a uniform!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As she said, I had an old uniform. Even though it was old, it was a uniform that I had only worn for the few months classes had been held this year. I no longer felt like wearing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I spoke with Lumiere, she wondered if I had any spare uniforms. Since entering the academy, Lumiere had lost a lot of weight. She said that it was due to the stress of being bullied. However, after I started teaching her, her body became even skinnier. Because of that, her uniform had become loose. Thus, instead of letting her buy a new one, I offered her my old uniform. As I was taller, it’d be a bit long, but that wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to my training, my uniform was worn out. Meanwhile, my old uniform was still beautiful. Even if I bought a new one for myself, I wouldn’t be able to wear it more than ten times, anyway. Giving it to her was more meaningful, she was someone who’d be continuing her student life.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">As for these dresses… there are more than enough to be kept as reminders.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">If so, wouldn’t they be more useful for her dance practice?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I shall be relentless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Take a look, what do you think? This one is my favorite!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a dress I truly loved. The garment was particularly luxurious as was with abundant gold embroidery on a gorgeous dark blue background.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It may be necessary to adjust the size as it was made a long time ago, but it’s still meant for everyday wear.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Sazanjill sat up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…He seemed to remember it. It was the dress he had given me when I made my debut into the social circle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I focused on Lumiere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I really want you to wear it, for I can’t anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as I said that, His Highness Sazanjill rushed out of the room. He seemed to have pulled His Highness Zafield along with him. Along the way, His Highness Zafield muttered, <em class="calibre3">“That can’t be true!” </em>as he followed after his brother. Lumiere was the only one who couldn’t understand the situation. But I wouldn’t tell her. If she knew, she’d probably refuse it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is a gorgeous dress, especially when dancing. Please take good care of it.”<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Seems like you’re doing everything you can…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ve never been so grateful to god!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even in my dreams, I was studying with all my might.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the world of dreams, I was free to do whatever. It was wonderful. I always ended up conversing with god, though. When I thought about it, couldn’t it be used more meaningfully? Considering that I only had a little time left, I regretted it a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Now why do I feel like I’m being ridiculed?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s not true, I love god.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Wow, how suspicious. As I thought, you’re belittling me.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m hurt. I’m not trusted.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I pretended to cry, I didn’t look away from the reference book.</p>

<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Hmm… I’m not very good at accounting.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps, a passing score in the follow-up exam was still attainable, but… Looking at the past questions prepared by His Highness, it seemed that there’d be one nasty question. To deal with that, a formula from my third year should suffice, but it was quite difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I looked up towards the god who was pouring tea. We were sitting face-to-face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“God, are you good at studying?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“If it’s the solution you want, I can tell you. But that’s why the process and way of thinking are also important, right? If you were to skip the middle point and go straight for the answer, I think the problem will be insanely difficult to comprehend.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…In other words, it’s something that a genius can’t understand even if you teach it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I don’t want to make you sound like a fool. But well, that’s roughly it.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I read the reference book once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…I’m in trouble.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I ask the teacher? But that would be tedious. What if as a consequence of my asking, the teacher made the question even more difficult? What if the teacher told my father? If my father were to know that I had to take a follow-up exam…</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I contemplated, god suggested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why don’t you ask the crown prince? Isn’t his teaching method easy to understand?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Sazanjiill was certainly talented. However, it wasn’t merely because of his competency. The reason his teaching was very easy to understand was because he put in a lot of effort. Effort was also considered a talent. Rather, I thought that it was the most important talent in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But… that was why I shook my head to god’s proposal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was because I had handed his gift&mdash;one with sentimental value&mdash;to another woman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As of the present, he probably won’t care about me anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Would you like to make a bet?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">God spoke while offering a cup of tea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I’m going to bet that tomorrow, the royal siblings will be waiting for you with a lot of study notes. What will you do if I win?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm, I will lick your foot?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“There’s no need to go that far!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">There was no way I could emerge victorious from that one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I only quietly face the reference book.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;9 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good morning, Lelouche. You’re a little late. Are you perhaps feeling sick?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I think you’re the ones who came too early.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Are these people stupid?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As usual, the royal siblings were waiting for me inside the empty classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it was unusual for His Highness Zafield to be here at this time. He always came shortly before I finished my tutoring ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the desk, handmade notebooks were piled up. There was also a paper bag giving off a delicious smell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield shrugged took something out from the paper bag.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because it’s cold today, I brought some soup. Won’t you drink it before it gets cold?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Thank you very much.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I brought you some soup, too, Lelouche. There are corn pottage and chicken consommé&mdash;which one do you prefer?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, the pottage.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Alright.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…W, why are they acting as if nothing happened?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Shouldn’t His Highness Sazanjill still be angry about the other day? His Highness Zafield must be feeling shocked by my folly. The royal siblings being on good terms was great, but there shouldn’t be any room for me anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, His Highness Sazanjill still offered me the soup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Involuntarily, I fell down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would apparently have to lick god’s feet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…No, it’s nothing. Your Highness, may I ask you something?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ask me anything!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I lifted my head and immediately took out the reference book.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the same scene as usual. However, it felt warmer&mdash;much warmer than the soup. I kept eating to hide my eyes from them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, my daily life was also on its last spurt.<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, will you be studying during the day?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If possible, I’d like to have sword training once in a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You still haven’t given up!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lack of exercise will make me dull.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You just bought a new uniform. Do you want it to get dirty again?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The morning classes had ended. Immediately after that, His Highness Zafield beckoned me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was nothing wrong with Lumiere’s uniform. Rather, her uniform, which wasn’t worn anywhere, felt good. As I stumbled for an answer, His Highness grabbed my hand.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vcGw6Dy/201750.jpg" width= "345;" height= "460;"></img>

<p class="calibre2">“Alright, alright, let’s head for the cafeteria, soon. I reserved some seats.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Duchess Lala Fable and Count Media Remel were who interrupted us. I stared at the two, they were smiling. Sure enough, His Highness Zafield’s lapis lazuli eyes filled with coldness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I’m sorry, but Lelouche already made a promise with.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s wrong with that? Recently, those coming up in the palace have been monopolizing Lelouche… We are lonely, too!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We also want to get along with Lelouche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Wow, what lies….</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was obvious that they were planning something. Hence, I was interested!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I smiled to His Highness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness, I’ll definitely head to the cafeteria. …Could you leave first?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you for reserving me a seat, but I’d like to respond to this!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After I appealed to him, His Highness shrugged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Lelouche sure is stubborn.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s an honor to be complimented.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s not a compliment.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While saying that, I thought that His Highness, who had let go of my hand, was truly kind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Come on, over here!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“There’s something we want to show you, Lelouche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The destination I was being taken to was the back of the academy building.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh my, how thrilling…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">It’s too obvious, whatever am I going to do?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, my uplifting feelings calmed down once I saw who was there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lumiere?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lady Lelouche!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere, who beckoned to me in sorrow, was surrounded by boys. The brand-new uniform I had given her was ruined. That said, the showed seemed to have yet reach its peak.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">These guys are bad news.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I narrowed my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What the hell are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t it obvious?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufufu, they seem to like her. We merely introduced them?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their well-sounding words failed to conceal their malice. When I glanced at Lala, she had a twisted smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t Lelouche the same as her? You continued to string along His Highness Sazanjill while also playing with His Highness Zafield along the side. As the future queen, isn’t it troublesome? I mean, what if the father of the child becomes unclear?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“His Highness Zafield belongs to everyone!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Media?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Is that it?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the duke’s daughter, Lala was aiming to become the fiancée of His Highness Zafield. As for Media, I thought that her motive was much shallower. I didn’t think any of them had a fiancé, yet. I often saw them frolicking in the academy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Considering the possibility that Lala would marry into the royal family, I gave her some advice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If it’s His Highness Zafield that you’re aiming for, then it’s better to stop? It sure is an honor to marry into the royal family, but the current queen, who is also his mother, is a very strict person. I think you’d be happier marrying someone of equal status.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Considering Lala’s daily words and conduct, the future hardship was clear. While His Highness Zafield wasn’t a bad person, he also wasn’t an unconditionally kind person. Like his mother, he was truly spartan. After all, I was trained harshly every day. Did she think that he’d comfort her when she cried about the princess education being too painful?</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Lala refused to wake up from her dream.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“S, so what?! I’m not like the others!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was pushed away by her. I staggered a few steps and bumped into Lumiere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lala raised her hand before slapping me mercilessly. I was shocked, my head and neck jolted backwards. My view was dyed black. The smell and taste of earth made me suffocate to the point of wanting to cry. It hurt. I couldn’t open my eyes. There was a faint voice forcibly calling me, “Lady Lelouche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My beautiful classmates pointed their fingers as they laughed and looked down on us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ahahaha, ahahaha! What an unfortunate accident! But it suits you well, Lelouche! Which other lady would look so good caked in mud!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Look at this menace of a duke’s daughter!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why don’t you both become serfs? It’d suit you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…I see. They are making fun of farmers.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ufufufu…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">As I thought… this is too fun.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, mud was dropped from the second floor.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Dropped?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">They carried mud all the way up there? How hardworking!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufufu… Ahahahahaha!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“L, Lady Lelouche…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I laughed as I held Lumiere’s shoulder. I smiled and smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I stood up alongside Lumiere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What a pleasure, I truly think it is!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was laughing loudly, everyone became scared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Did she go crazy?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Who knows?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">You are the ones who picked a fight with me, so you better be prepared.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That was to be my last school life.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I shall entertain you thoroughly!</em></p>
