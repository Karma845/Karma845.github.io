<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 4 &#8211; Idle Talk: The Monologue of a Former Swindler</h1><p class="calibre2">I was second by nature.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zafield Lewis Lapisenta. Among the people, I was the second prince whom was commonly known as the fascinating ‘Silver Prince.’</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ‘Silver Prince’… It was because I had silver hair, hence the title.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My older brother was the ‘Gold Prince’, while I was the ‘Silver Prince’ as I was second in the place. It was an easy-to-understand irony.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I was the second prince, I had no fiancée by nature.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had always thought of it as unfair, but whenever I’d complain about it, my older brother would always say:</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;Instead, you can choose who to marry. Isn’t that a blessing?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">What utter nonsense. As someone who always had fun with his fiancée, what right did he have to say that? He’d always speak about, <em class="calibre3">“Today, Lelouche&mdash;” </em>or, <em class="calibre3">“Yesterday, Lelouche was&mdash;” </em>Over and over again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Such a bird brain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My older brother’s fiancée, namely Lelouche Elcage, was also an odd girl. While of similar age as me, her appearance was uncommon. Her mother was a beauty who was also known as the ‘Exotic Beauty.’ Lelouche strongly resembled her mother. Both her eyes and hair were black.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…When I first saw her, I thought that she was scary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, she must had been accustomed to being treated like a weirdo. Thus, she smiled at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Nice to meet you, I’m<em class="calibre3"> Lelouchelcage</em>! Pleased to make you acquaintance!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if she mispronounced her name, I fell in love with her who never stopped smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was sure that it was love at first sight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She was a strong, dignified, noble. My impression of that beautiful girl hadn’t changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, around the age of eight, I realized that she was in fact a weirdo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite having already begun her princess education, she’d still openly talk to me when my mother and older brother had yet to arrive. She was advised to respect my older brother for he was the future king. However, I was the second prince and of the same age as her. Still, she only used honorifics for my older brother, and not me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those close, special, feelings were more enjoyable than anything else.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hm? Where’s His Highness Sazanjill?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If it’s my older brother, he’s being reprimanded by his swordsman instructor.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What about Your Highness Zafield?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Well.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I’m a spare for my brother, as such, my education isn’t as intensive.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Beside, with a waist as slender as mine, I didn’t think I’d benefit much from the swordsman instructor for a while longer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To keep my brother’s face, I didn’t say anything unnecessary. To try to kill time, I talked with my brother’s fiancée.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Rather, shouldn’t we do more than that?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Shall we eat sweets? If I recall correctly, the Southern lord brought me some salted sweets.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s interesting, but… Your Highness Zafield is free right now, aren’t you?’</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had a bad feeling. I just couldn’t shake the negative sensation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sure enough, she showed a perfect smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do you know what the queen’s weaknesses are?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, she wanted to vent her daily frustration. Not to mention, my mother was the cause of it all. For her to admit that to my face, I had to admire her courage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m scared of the queen, but if I can scare her and make her scream, I don’t think I’ll be scared anymore!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Although, I have never seen anything scarier than my own mother.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if she were to ask about her weakness&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Oh, that’s right.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I believe she’s lamenting been that she has gotten fat, lately. Because of that, she can’t fit into the dress she likes.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see… then I should do something that’ll make her thinks that she’s fatter. Maybe, I could tighten the waist of her dresses.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While elegantly eating the sweets I had introduced, she pondered in all seriousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I don’t think that’s a good idea.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, are you good at sewing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Can you think of any other weaknesses?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I also thought that part of her was adorable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It couldn’t be helped. Even if she was seriously contemplating on pulling a prank on my mother, I just couldn’t get angry at her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, Lelouche stared at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What is it…?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">If she stares at me like that, I’ll blush…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness Zafield’s eating appearance is beautiful, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, not as beautiful as yours, Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I wasn’t made to study etiquette as much as Lelouche, I was still a prince. Despite being the second prince, I had many opportunities to eat in public. Therefore, both my instructors and mother taught me manners.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking from my head to my toes, Lelouche clapped and said, “Right!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Your Highness Zafield, why don’t you wear my dress for a moment?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">How did this happen?!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I could regret it, it was already too late. When did she master putting on dresses and wigs?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As a young lady, it’d be a problem if I couldn’t put on a dress in an emergency without the help of a maid.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Hmm, I haven’t heard much about that.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, my slender waistline was the cause of it all. Because of it, I was able to fit into Lelouche’s dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Also, why is she dressing up as a castle maid?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">While grinning, Lelouche also proudly showed me a black wig.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, while leaning on my shoulder, Lelouche smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How cute, Zafield-chan~”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sight of Lelouche, who was wearing a more lackluster dress than usual, hurt my heart. I also wasn’t happy by the compliment. But when I sighed, another tragedy happened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Now, it’s my turn.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche took off the dress she was wearing underneath her dignified, original, dress, leaving her underwear in plain sight&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Gyaaaaaaah!!!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">My scream echoed throughput the royal castle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, despite my scream, we still exchanged clothes and went to surprise my mother together. After receiving a three-hour sermon from my mother together, Lelouche complained to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“For you to scream at the sight of a maiden in her underwear, that’s just terrible. Besides, it’s just a chemise, it’s not that strange!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Well, I’m sorry that I shouted. I don’t even know the difference…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">But instead of replying, I just nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I noticed it, she was laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, today was fun, let’s do it again sometime!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Uh, no.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The expression she was making was truly adorable, but it was already evening… I was tired. Looking out in the window, my older brother was still confronting his swordsmanship instructor in the courtyard. It seemed that the instructor had already forgiven him. Then, when my brother tried to land a blow, he fell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked out of curiosity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, do you always do this at home?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Dressing up?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, and other acts of mischief.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm, I’d like to do the same when my little brother, Rufus, gets a little bigger.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Poor Rufus.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">At that time, I’ll comfort you as a senior.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche, who didn’t know of my inner thoughts, was counting off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thinking about it, I tried pulling out some of my father’s hair when he was asleep, ate the sweets my mother was hiding, pretended to be a baby and played with Rufus’ toys. I also pretended to be a maid and helped with cleaning and washing. Also, I tried climbing one of the trees, but it’s difficult, y’know?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, I’ve never climbed a tree before, so…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Wow, she did a lot more than I expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing the secrets of Lelouche that I didn’t know&mdash;I went and asked for more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Does anyone else know?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah, about that, keep it a secret from His Highness Sazanjill, alright? He’s my fiancé, it’d be a problem if he hates me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…<em class="calibre3">What’s that?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was alright for her to be hated by me, but not by my brother?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite that, Lelouche closed her eyes and placed a fingers against her cherry-colored lips.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s a secret between us two, so don’t tell anyone!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…It can’t be helped.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;In the end, two years later, my older brother would also chance upon her strange habits. Still, I was the first to know. As such, I knew Lelouche the best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was what I liked to think.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">…Nevertheless, my sense of superiority only lasted for a few years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, we were 13-years-old. Lelouche would be having her social debut next month. Meanwhile, my own debut would occur approximately three months later. For the sake of her final training before her debut, Lelouche came to stay at the royal palace. From that time on, she wouldn’t act informal with me anymore. To everyone, she always acted like a proper noble lady.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While nothing was wrong with that&mdash;I felt lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the morning of the second day, Lelouche’s eccentricity was revealed to my brother. He went to protest to my mother, <em class="calibre3">“As I thought, Lelouche is overly stressed by mother’s education!” </em>Afterwards, he even summoned a doctor for her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I feel wronged!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shortly after her physical condition was examined, Lelouche became very angry. Even if her phrasing was formal, I noticed that she was openly expressing herself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Does he honestly think I have gone mad&mdash;!? Don’t you think it’s terrible&mdash;!? What’s wrong with wanting to dive through a ring of fire&mdash;!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah… well, I think you should refrain from doing such dangerous acts?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s why I’m practicing from the basics!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">That’s not the problem, here.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I pulled a round chair over with a bitter smile and sat beside her bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What, does Lelouche want to impress my brother through a display of acrobatics?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right! After all, His Highness Sazanjill has never witnessed anything like that before! Isn’t that a waste!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Is that all?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Also, what’s wrong with trying to improve your physical abilities? There are no drawbacks to it. I mean, what if I get assaulted by a beast? What if the castle is set on fire? Surely, my training would be put to good use!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Lelouche, what is your true purpose behind all this?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked her with sarcasm, but she proudly answered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In this word, you only succeed&mdash;<em class="calibre3">or you learn! </em>If you have the opportunity to learn something new, isn’t it the responsibility of someone as high-ranking as me to do my best?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…As expected of the Queen of Hearts, your ambition is so good, it brings tears to my eyes…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, I’m honored to be complimented.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I realized when I saw Lelouche’s impeccable smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She knew it was a sarcasm and triumphed over me with her last retort.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">As I thought, I can’t win against Lelouche…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, her mood didn’t seem like it could be fixed just by playing with me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right, I can’t believe His Highness Sazanjill! He went out of his way to summon a doctor for me! Without any reservation!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That just shows how important Lelouche is to him, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;“That… well, perhaps…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, how cute.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite pouting, her cheeks had turned slightly red.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What’s that…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…I kind of didn’t like it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Even if it’s a little mean of me, it won’t lead to anything serious, right?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Doesn’t my brother think too lowly of Lelouche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Hm?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“He always protests about your education against our mother. I believe my brother must see you as his sister, instead of someone of an equal standing. Otherwise, I couldn’t think of any reason why he’d be so overly worried…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…his sister?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her dark eyes widened immensely. Towards that Lelouche, I dared to continue to speak gently, as if to advise her…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…But that may be unavoidable. After all, my brother has been watching over you since you were little. So, why don’t you show him how independent you are through your social debut? Besides, because he spends so much time with Lelouche, his grades at school are suffering. As such, for my brother’s sake&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;There’s no need to say anything further.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Lelouche cut off my words, she didn’t seem angry. She just lowered her face in contemplation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I’m sorry, I want to be left alone for a while. Therefore, can you leave?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah, of course…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I turned on my heels.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Yes, think slowly… and give me a good show.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">If not, isn’t it unfair?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The two most wonderful people of my life had always been close with each other. Meanwhile I, who always had eyes for her, could only watch from the side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I laughed a little at the dignified profile that was in serious thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, I gently closed the door.<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I saw it. The back of my older brother who was shocked when Lelouche suggested that they should put some distance between themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was more refreshing and pleasant than I had imagined…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…The show was getting better and better.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand, from the time I made my social debut, the number of matchmaking stories revolving around me continued to increase.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apparently, my parents wanted to decide on my fiancée before my enrollment. It sounded troublesome. Well, my numbers of ‘girl friends’ increased every time I went to a dinner party. I was sure that they were worried.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My first candidate for the matchmaking was Lala Fable, the daughter of a duke. As she was of the same stature as Lelouche, there shouldn’t have been any problems. Rather than a foreign lady, I seemed to be being advised to pick a domestic one. In a sense, it was a matter of balancing. Lelouche was the representative of the foreign faction, while Lala was a representative of the domestic faction. I was sure that my parents had settled upon such a decision.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…But, I personally disliked Lala. It was because compared to Lelouche, she was a lowly existence to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why do you loathe it so much? What’s so awful about Ms. Lala?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided to answer my father’s question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Because she resembles me.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That girl was quite haughty. The other day, I saw her basking in pleasure as she bullied a lady of lower stature than her. It wasn’t something that Lelouche would do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Really, her ugliness was just like mine. She was jealous of what others had. Then, instead of challenging herself to improve and fight, she just harassed people from behind the scenes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…How wicked.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hence, I lied that day as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t particularly hate Ms. Lala. I just want to learn more about other women.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Is it because you’re young? Do you want to play around?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, it may be unavoidable for my words to be taken that way. After all, the world consists of men and women. Meanwhile, the only women my brother knows are his mother and Lelouche. If so, in the future, as a supporter of my brother, I want to familiarize myself more with the thoughts of women and attain broader insight.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As usual, you have a smart mouth.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Is my father aware of something?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">But it’s part of the reason, though?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I hung my head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, Zafield Lewis Lapisenta, promise you that I’ll decide on a spouse upon graduating from the academy. So until then, please give me an opportunity to deepen my insight.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once we graduated, Lelouche would officially marry my brother. Then, my faint first love would be over. After that, I was sure that I’d spend empty days watching over the two happy people with a woman who wasn’t Lelouch beside me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My father sighed at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Alright, but do be careful. The number of ladies frustrated by you has been increasing day by day.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, while saying that, I tried to persuade other girls while keeping only Lelouche in my sights.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">My older brother was a bit lackluster. I didn’t think he was a bad person. Nevertheless, he wasn’t very tactful. Of course, he also had many talents. My older brother was an honest, hardworking, and kind-hearted man. He was capable enough to garner the people’s approval, which led to earning their support.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I was slightly doubtful. Should the future ruler of our kingdom be decided solely through receiving a sweet evaluation and the privilege of being born earlier?</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">After all, </em>wouldn’t that kind of person be taken advantaged of by a bad person like me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I messed with him. I did it on a whim.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It happened around the time when I was about to be enrolled in the academy. As traveling back and forth between the dormitory and the royal castle everyday would be difficult, we went to our mansion in the territory of Elcage. Casually, I said it at dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“At the academy, how about you keep your distance from Lelouche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why? I’m only given a brief respite from the castle. This is my only opportunity to spend time with her.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I was aware of that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Knowing my brother, he’d stay with her from morning until evening. In the morning, would she ride in a carriage arranged by my brother? Then, would she be sent home by him? He even confirmed whether or not he would be allowed to rent out a section of the cafeteria for a year. That was probably so he could spend his lunch break with her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I wasn’t going to let him do that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is her only opportunity to be free from the castle, too. I’m sure the moment she sees my brother’s face, she’ll be heavily reminded of her responsibilities as the future queen.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Go on.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My brother’s complexion had changed. He was obviously shocked. Although he wasn’t as clingy as he was three years ago, it still annoyed me. He’d often spoke of Charlotte and her eccentricities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But my brother, because he had to keep his distance at the castle, he’d surely try to stick with her at school.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My brother was a simple person&mdash;I hated and loved that side of him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, if you were to let her go&mdash;if you were to refrain from meeting Lelouche as much as possible&mdash;wouldn’t she be able to spread her wings? I’m sure she’d love to have fun with her friends as well. You can’t monopolize Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I see, what you said is sensible. But what if something were to happen to Lelouche? I won’t be able to help her immediately.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Coincidentally, I’ll be in the same class as Lelouche. If anything were to happen, I shall help her. What, is my brother jealous of me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No way?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My brother wiped his mouth with a napkin and spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s not true! I’m sure if I were to entrust her to Zafield, she’d be alright! While Lelouche enjoies her student life, I shall work hard to become the future king!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Haha, don’t overexert yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;That stupid older brother of mine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So as to not rattle the silverware, I suppressed my laughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If my brother intended to devote himself to public affairs, I would lend him my assistance. I’d speak to our father about how motivated he was, and see more get added to his workload. I wondered if I could get him do mine as well? Even if he found out, he’d surely say, <em class="calibre3">“It can’t be helped.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Isn’t that so, my kind older brother?<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></em></p>
<p class="calibre2">One day, some time after we had enrolled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, how was Lelouche today? Did she have a good time?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, she appears to be on good terms with the daughter of Count Remel. They were conversing happily.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;Of course, that was a lie.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In all actuality, Media Remel seemed to want to curry favor with Lelouche. Lelouche, who disliked that kind of thing, refused without any hesitation. In the end, Media decided to collude with Lala of the Fabel family instead. The Fabel family belonged to an opposing faction. Due to the relationship between their houses, Lala had always been hostile to Lelouche.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was looking forward to the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My older brother, who wasn’t aware of the truth, was happy with my false information regarding Lelouche.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s just how Lelouche is. She doesn’t care about titles. She just wants a lifelong friend.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Speaking of friends who don’t care about their titles, I heard that there’s a person who has recently become acquainted with my older brother?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Who are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, so he wasn’t aware that they were on good term? Even though they were together every morning? Was he more obsessed in fixing that rag than being taught by her? Perhaps, he didn’t even remember her name?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m talking about the baron’s daughter&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Ah, do you mean Lumiere? She’s the only daughter of Baron Alban, the historian.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What kind of person is she?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wondered what would he say? Expecting my brother, an unconventional idiot, to badmouth her would be too farfetched. If he were to say, “She’s lovely and the right person to be my playmate,” I’d be sure to spice that statement a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But as expected, my older brother’s answer couldn’t be taken advantage of.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In terms of manners, she’s a little clumsy. But she’s a refreshing conversation partner. She’s sensitive to those around her. In truth, she might be quite talented. I’m sure if her manners were to be polished, she’d become a splendid lady.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Hmm… </em>Was that how my older brother perceived her? What a good and decent little girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, let’s give some advice to my kind-hearted older brother.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…How’s the stuffed animal?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m having a difficult time fixing it. I was planning to finish it and show it to Lelouche this semester, but it’s tough. Our long vacation will be coming soon.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Didn’t you try to not meet Lelouche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">That’s right, you didn’t try to interfere with Lelouche’s wonderful and enjoyable student life, right?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In reality, Lelouche didn’t have any proper friends. She continued living in solitude, similar to a wall flower. The high-ranking ladies were likely following the orders of their parents. Unless they were foolish like my brother, they wouldn’t see pass her status.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This sullen fiancé of hers, ignorant to that, was puffing his cheeks like a child.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I want a reward!” He said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;By getting in the way of Lelouche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Sometimes, it’s okay to spoil myself! I’ve put up with it! I’ve endured not seeing Lelouche for a long time!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, that was right. After all, I had to listen to his frustration every day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did he take my advice and refrained from meeting his beloved fiancée? Even at a party where he was supposed to accompany her, he pretended that everything was fine so as to not create any rumors, right? Such was my advice as a younger brother who was good at treating women.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During that time, the precious item he cherished tore. My older brother wanted to use said keepsake as a reason to meet her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was true&mdash;you did your best, you moron.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I advised my beloved brother once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, at that time, bring Lumiere with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Huh, why?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did you hear the rumors? They said that Lumiere is a candidate to be your mistress, and that you favor her.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I only have eyes for Lelouche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, my older brother would say that. The actual rumors were so much worse. The rumors spoke plans to annul his engagement with Lelouche before ultimately assassinating her. Although, well, I adjusted those rumors before they could enter Lelouche’s ears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, rumors are rumors… but women are sensitive to them, right? While she may look stubborn, Lelouche might be concerned by them.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Even though in reality, nothing is happening… The world of women sure is rough. Before that, didn’t you have an argument with your lover back then? What did you do to resolve it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm? Of course, we solved it ourselves. I just listened to her side of the story. Of course, when I heard it, I was a bit discouraged. However, it was plain anxiety on my part. In the end, a misunderstanding is a misunderstanding. It’s best to discuss it directly with everyone involved.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I understand…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, I was truly a kind younger brother. He was capable of giving me such an answer. This me, who fanned the flames.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, as a reward to this bystander, wouldn’t you present a spectacular sight?</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;What did you do to my Lelouche!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as I returned to the mansion, my older brother hit me with a clumsy punch. Thinking it was a good opportunity to hit him, I fought back. My older brother flew away. I didn’t mean to put so much strength into my blow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Well, it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While pretending to be confused, I apologized, “Sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;According to my lie, everything was supposed to be my brother’s fault.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why would you blame me? With all the good intentions in my heart, I gave you advice…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…That’s&mdash;I’m sorry, I was upset.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, it’s alright. Rather, is it true that Lelouche requested to annul our engagement? <em class="calibre3">Why!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As his kind-hearted younger brother, I reached out to my older brother.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…But as expected, my brother wasn’t as tactless as I thought. He might be aware that I was behind everything. In fact, he had gradually stopped asking for my advice, and had been acting on his own. Although, as it was, it was already too late.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For him to keep pretending to not see it&mdash;I thought that was one of his bad habits.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My brother clenched his fist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He seemed to be angry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, I sympathized with the fact that the dress my brother had given to Lelouche was given to someone else. My older brother was unusually out of it. It’d be troublesome if he were to commit suicide as it was. Thus, I sent him back to the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I tried to hold his shoulder, he shook it off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, but it’s fine. I was told to annul our engagement. I’m sure that to her, my present was in the way.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Brother…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wondered if he’d give up on Lelouche now that he had understood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was stupid to think that for even a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Zafield, I’m not going to give up on Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Even if it’ll cause her to despise you even more?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, even if it means that. …I also won’t give up on you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…What? I didn’t understand what he meant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My older brother was staring straight at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Regardless of how much you despise me, regardless of the extent of your misdeeds&mdash;I believe in you. I’m your brother&mdash;and always will be. Keep that in mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that said, my older brother returned to the mansion alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I truly didn’t understand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did he truly have the same eye color as me? If so, why did his eyes give off such a strong color?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I returned to the mansion and picked up a mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lapis lazuli&mdash;it was the color that I abhorred the most in the world.<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">As of the present, I was watching my muddy brother and Lelouche getting scolded by the teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What kind of situation is this?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Almost everyone in the ‘Un’ class, a first-year class, was covered in mud. In the meantime, I was sitting near the school gate. What the teacher was saying was right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The ladies who represent the people shouldn’t be throwing mud outside of the academy building!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was no surprise. Even when the opening bell rang, no one stopped. Well, the two lead aristocrats kept throwing mud while laughing. Perhaps, everyone thought they’d be forgiven, as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the principal’s turn to give a sermon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche Elcage, why did you start doing this!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Because it was necessary for us.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even after being made to sit upright on the stone pavement, Lelouche answered resolutely. The teacher flinched. Lelouche wasn’t one to miss that opportunity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The teachers may be unaware …but you see, we have a feud. I come from a duke’s house. Meanwhile, these respective two hail from the houses of a baron and a count. Due to the titles inherited from our parents, we inevitably have a hierarchical relationship. Of course, I’m well aware that the academy is trying to educate us to not judge people based on their status. Still, the teachers should know that is just a front. While we’re spending our youth in the same academy, we have a feud precisely because of our statuses. However, if everyone were to be covered in mud like this, we will all be considered equal. We’re all <em class="calibre3">equally </em>muddy. Finally, we’re the definition of <em class="calibre3">equal</em>!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The teacher couldn’t argue against her overwhelmingly powerful sophistry. But eventually, the same teacher said, “Even if that’s the case, it’s too much!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Yeah, do your best, teacher. I don’t think Lelouche will reflect on this no matter what you say.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, both my brother and Lelouche looked very happy. Why did they look so refreshed? Even though their entire bodies were covered with mud. Also, for them to giggle during the teacher’s sermon… as expected, they felt zero remorse.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ah, I don’t know anymore.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I did hope my mother would get angry at them later, though.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Ahh, I’m truly frustrated.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Why did they make up?</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the trouble in went through to screw their relationship up, too.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">At that time, a young lady meekly stood beside me. I was standing beside the cart I had used to deliver the mud. She was a petite lady with pretty coral hair&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Baroness Lumiere Alban…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Did I make a strange expression?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The next second, she softly beckoned me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Uh, Your Highness Zafield&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is it? Shouldn’t you hurry to your classroom? It’s not like you have to deal with this kind of thing. If you’re worried about the physical wellbeing of my brother and the others, I shall inform you later.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Other than me, she was the only one not dirty with mud. Upon giving Lelouche some ladles, she scurried off to a remote area to watch the situation unfold. Hence, she should be able to attend her classes normally. In the first place, she was in the ‘Trois’ class. Therefore, her classroom experience shouldn’t be impacted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike me, whose classmates were all covered in mud, she could still leave with her dignity intact&mdash;or even jeer at us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because I’m interested.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…You’re merely scared of your Lady Lelouche, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Or rather, I want to learn how Lady Lelouche will overcome this adversity.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Didn’t she mean to say that the sight of Lelouche getting reprimanded was too interesting?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t help but see the child Lelouche in her. When I suddenly burst with laughter, Lumiere’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…As I thought, she truly resembles Lelouche.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, I merely thought that you’re definitely Lelouche’s disciple.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While we were discussing such a thing, the teacher noticed us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The two over there! If you have time to run your mouths, shouldn’t you be returning to your respective classes?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, soon, the teacher was dragged back into the debate starred by Lelouche who refused to back down.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Well, then&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;I wondered if I should also participate in the war for a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I raised a hand and innocently asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Teacher, isn’t everyone in the class currently studying under the blue sky?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right! Today, we were merely studying under this blue sky about the nature of Western mud with our skin! Teacher, if you’d like, why don’t you join us?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Lelouche Elcage!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, what is it, teacher?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ahh, this place is entirely being run by Lelouche as of the moment…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Next to Lelouche, who seemed to be enjoying herself from the beginning to end, my brother was peacefully taking a nap.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was sleeping very comfortably…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Only I knew why.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had been staying up all night every night to prepare teaching materials for Lelouche’s follow-up exams. I thought he’d finally catch some sleep yesterday, however, he stayed up to make memorandums for last minute measures…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not to mention, this morning, I went to the Elcage family to see Lelouche to the academy only to learn she wasn’t there. Her parents said she had stayed at Baron Alban’s house with a friend. Of course, my older brother had heard nothing about it&mdash;and neither had Lumiere and Baron Alban. After questioning the people of the Count Fabel, we confirmed that it was indeed her who sent that false message to Lelouche’s parents.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, my brother went to fetch Lelouche as fast as he could. Afterwards, he even threw mud at everyone together with her. His falling asleep couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Are you aware of all the hardships my brother went through?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche lined up more sophistry to the teacher. The teacher scratched his head before finally laughing with joy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Hey, Lelouche.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Is it truly because you just want to have fun?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Or was it to let my brother get some rest?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ahh&mdash;…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…I looked up at the sky. The beauty of the blue sky made me feel even worse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone was told to go home that day. After all, if they were to enter the classroom in such state, I’d pity the cleaners.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That day was supposed to be a holiday. In an empty classroom, Lelouche and my brother, who were forced to attend school, apologized in writing as per the teacher’s instructions. The teacher wasn’t that angry, though, and ended up compromising.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The future king and queen reflected during the holiday. Certainly, they felt some ounce of shame. Even so, the two felt no remorse at all. They were having fun chatting while the composition paper laid before them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ah, what have I done?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, in the end, all I could do was watch the two from a distance.</p>

<p class="calibre2">***</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ah, I feel like crap.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">But, it was like you said&mdash;I didn’t know when to stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hey, Lelouche, where should I have given up?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I still didn’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Had I asked earlier, would you have given me an answer?</p>
