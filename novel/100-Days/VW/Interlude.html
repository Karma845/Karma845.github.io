<h1 class="calibre1">Interlude &#8211; Idle Talk: The Monologue of a Swindler who can’t Keep Quiet</h1><p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Aah, I feel sick.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Do you know what I dislike the most?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">I hate my brother. I hate Lelouche. And I hate myself. I feel like a piece of shit. I’m nothing but a piece of shit&mdash;be it now, and in the past.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">All I can do is watch my brother and Lelouche enjoy themselves.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I tried so hard for so many years to drive a wedge between them, but in the end, they’re still just as good friends as before.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;Aaah, I can’t do this. I can’t.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">It’s as if they’re destined to be together. To hell with that. Such a world. If I all I can do is continue to look at this sickening world&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Oh, that’s right!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After I had let Lelouche go, I noticed something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Lelouche, you were unusually frightened.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">If it was the usual Lelouche, she wouldn’t have even bat an eye from being cornered by a man.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Kuku…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the darkest corner of the stairs, I laughed to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I’m truly hopeless…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…</em>After all, I was happy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was happy at the thought that she was scared of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Because at the very least, she feels something towards me.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Hey, aren’t I crazy? Aren’t I better off dead?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was an eternal liar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Surely, there was no need for such a man in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Well, doesn’t that make it simple?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, what should I do? Where should it be?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I were to do something spectacular, then let’s do it at the dance party the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nearing the end, I wanted to dream a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Let’s call it my last act of selfishness.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I stood up and immediately started preparing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First, I stole Lelouche’s sword. At that time, she should be studying with Lumiere. As expected, I found the sword at the swordsmanship club. As the club members were practicing outside, slipping in unnoticed was easy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, I contacted my trusted mercenary. Back when I paid him to push Lelouche down the stairs, I told him to use a secret passageway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">No matter how peaceful the world may be&mdash;not a day goes by when night doesn’t come, right?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As long as I paid enough money at a bar in town, I could be introduced to those guys.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Hey, Lelouche, I’d like you to imagine this&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;Tentatively speaking, if your sword were to be found next to my body, what would happen? Wouldn’t you become the main suspect to my “murder”?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Although, considering it’s you, you might be able to prove them wrong.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;Nevertheless…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…If I were to create such an uproar at the end of my life, would you curse me?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Instead of my brother, will you curse me?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Will you stare at me with every ounce of resentment in your eyes&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;and only at me?</em><br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2">Two days later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Today was the day I would die. I had no regrets. To not have to look at things I didn’t like anymore, it was somewhat refreshing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That morning, my brother was concerned about Lelouche. <em class="calibre3">“What is she going to do alone at today’s dance party?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As I thought, he suspected nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Well, I won’t bother you anymore, so be happy together. Do whatever you like.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided to review today’s plan. Although, it was quite simple. During the dance party, I’d be killed by an assassin I had hired. Of course, the murder weapon would be Lelouche’s short sword. Just in case, I had an extremely lethal poison smeared on the blade. There was no antidote, so my death was guaranteed. After doing something so outrageous, I’d rather not have a chance of surviving. I didn’t want to live in shame.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, I had arranged it so that the Fable family would be linked to the acquisition of the poison. I took it as an opportunity to quell down those noisy people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My only concern was Lelouche’s unknown whereabouts. Until it was about time to enter, my brother and Lumiere would be waiting in a separate room. As a matter of course, I was also invited to the event. After refusing because I didn’t have a partner, I was told to partake in the lobby just like the other students.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All that was left was to prepare someone to scream on spot. If possible, I wanted to see what kind of expressions my brother and Lelouche would make at the end. Whether or not I’d still retain my consciousness by that time was a gamble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like Lelouche, I didn’t have a partner. I was surprised that Lala Fable had the courage to approach me the day before. She looked truly embarrassed. I felt a little envious of her. If I had that kind of courage, my future would surely be different.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…I’m sorry for making fun of you in the past, saying that we were similar.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of getting her involved, but as a symbol of apology, I let her go.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Surely, not all students have been engaged.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">There must be one or two remaining pitiful ladies. Pretending to give a hand to one of them, I was about to take advantage of her as I saw fit. Then, while I was wandering around the academy, which was more glamorously decorated than usual, I spotted a girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wearing a large pink feathered hat, the dress the girl wore also bore the same color.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recognized that dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, I lied to Lelouche about that exact dress, saying that it was a gift from my brother to Lumiere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had heard that instead of Lumiere, a girl who was in the same class as her would be renting that dress. If I wasn’t mistaken, her surname was Troyes. Under Lala’s command, she lied to Lelouche when she was under house arrest. After the operation failed, the girl was cut off by Lala, but my brother and Lumiere approached her. In any case, her family had just ascended to the title of baron, and their faction hadn’t yet been decided. Thus, as a form of punishment, my brother made her join his faction.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">As I thought, my brother is too soft.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so… it was amazing. Unexpectedly, I was also fascinated by her. Upon seeing that flashy dress for the first time, my initial reaction was, <em class="calibre3">“Who’s foolish enough to don this?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Apparently, depending on the person who wore it, the dress could become gorgeous. Probably because the girl herself had good posture. While the dress looked heavy, the girl’s posture and demeanor were flawless. As everyone waited for her entrance, their eyes were trained on her. Even I couldn’t hide my surprise. Apparently, the girl who was cut off by Lala was quite the talented person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There she was, standing proudly by herself in the center of the lobby in front of the auditorium. The male students who had no partners approached her, but they were all rejected without a second thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Then, I shall go with her.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">If I were to disappear with a girl who stood out like that, I’d be found faster. As such, I’d have a higher chance of seeing Lelouche’s expression at the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The beautiful lady over there. If you’d like, could you give me the honor of escorting you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I pushed the men around me and kneeled before her, extending my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In turn, she responded, “Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Amazing.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though I was used to being with women, a chill ran down my spine.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Is she truly a mere baroness?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">What would become of the kingdom?</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Well, it no longer mattered to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I lightly dropped a kiss on the back of her hand, then stood up and wrapped my arm around her waist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“There’s still time before the party starts. If you prefer, let’s talk in a quieter place.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Can you guide me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once again, I was astonished by the girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Even though she’s of the same age as me, for a first-year student to have such dignity…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The world didn’t cease to surprise me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s a beautiful starry night today.” As I remarked politely, I led her to the corner of the garden&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Indeed, it was the place where I used to train with Lelouche during lunch break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those were happy times, to say the least. After all, my brother wasn’t there. As she gripped her sword, Lelouche would stare at me with a serious expression. During those times, I was the only person in her world. Yet, no matter how many times I wished that time would last forever, the bell that announced the end of each day would always ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hence why I thought that place would be a good place to meet my end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, the time for the operation was set for five minutes after the party had started. That was around the time when high-ranking aristocrats were getting ready to enter the venue. As the second prince, I’d naturally be the last to enter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I guess I could kill time with her there for about ten more minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was laying a handkerchief on the bench for her to sit on&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;I appreciate your concern, so could you turn to me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Right after I turned around, a sharp pain ran through my cheek.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;It huuuurts!!!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the sound itself was dull, it was truly painful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the lady in front of me lifted her skirt with both hands and mercilessly drove her heel into my stomach. As I dropped down on the bench, the girl lifted my chin with her fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With starlight as her backdrop, the girl raised both corners of her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The girl was more divine than anyone else.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did I catch you off-guard, Your Highness Zafield?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She tossed her feather cap away with one hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if slightly ruffled, her hair, which held the same color as the night, fluttered gracefully in the wind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche Elcage smiled gracefully at me.</p>
