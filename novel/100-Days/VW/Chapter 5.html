<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 5 &#8211; They were a Very Dazzling Three Days</h1><p class="calibre2">&mdash;3 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, I pushed the teacher beyond her limits. I never thought that my days off would be spent writing letters of apology.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Teacher, isn’t this why your wrinkles haven’t smoothed out in the slightest?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Alright, let’s send her some beauty cream of my mother’s favorite brand next week.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, today was the last day off of my life. Of course, the place I would visit had already been decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, Lumiere, do you remember why that dance party is going be held the day after tomorrow?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, it’s the annual party to celebrate the master painter Andre Oscar’s masterpiece, <em class="calibre3">‘The Nameless Sunset.</em>’ He was a graduate of our academy. During his lifetime, Andre Oscar loved dancing.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was only given 100 days to educate Lumiere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, I wondered what would happen. However, as the girl in question answered, I began to notice that she had changed. To be honest, her knowledge was minimal. But that was fine&mdash;all she needed to do was to be confident in herself and keep her back straight. She already had the charm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Therefore, I’m sure you’ll be able to overcome anything.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Actually, I wanted to show her off in public a little more. Perhaps, that’d boost her confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…But, I realized that was merely selfishness on my part.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We were inside the study of Baron Alban. I had become accustomed to that place. While breathing in the scent of the paper into my chest, I asked the following question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Alright, previously, I gave you a manuscript titled, <em class="calibre3">‘Nameless’ Confession.’ </em>Upon reading it, what kind of person do you think ‘<em class="calibre3">Nameless’ </em>is?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh, <em class="calibre3">‘Nameless’ </em>is…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">My, cat got her tongue?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That was a book I had lent to Lumiere when she got sick. It felt like such a long time ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Could it be, you forgot the contents of the book?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, no, I do remember… I thought that he was a unique person, especially his ideas…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You don’t have to sugarcoat it. Tell me your honest opinion.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I urged her, she put a finger on her chin and averted her gaze. “Hmm.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She should’ve fixed that habit of hers by now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Surely, the queen would point it out sooner or later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All she had to do was not embarrass herself at the dance party three days later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She then spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">’Nameless’ </em>lived about 1500 years ago, didn’t he? In the midst of the war, he lied about being a prince. Then, he took the lead in protecting a large number of people amidst a torrent of flaming arrows. He miraculously survived and was revered as a hero… but in the end, he was exiled.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His fearless attitude gave people the courage to win the war. Regardless, no matter how heroic he was, the kingdom at that time was less flexible than it was at present. It was a mortal sin to pass oneself off as a member of the royal family.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, the man was stripped of his name and became the anonymous ‘<em class="calibre3">Nameless.’ </em>For the rest of his life, he had to confess his sins to god at church.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“‘<em class="calibre3">Nameless’ Confession’ </em>is a compilation of narratives he had written in the confessional room of the church.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">There existed a passage&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">‘&mdash;I merely wanted to protect the witch. I regret nothing. If there’s something that I’m concerned about&mdash;is she laughing, now?’</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“In the end, who was the ‘<em class="calibre3">witch’ </em>that <em class="calibre3">‘Nameless’ </em>wanted to protect?” Lumiere asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“She was said to be a princess at the time. In reality, she was a witch. It’s a story from 1500 years ago. Nowadays, that something called ‘magic’ can only be found in picture books. It’s unreal.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I explained the general theory, I realized that Lumiere was giggling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After I glared at her, Lumiere wiped her tears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, I expected Lady Lelouche to believe in magic.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Well, I’m sorry about that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere laughed aloud when I averted my gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Excuse me!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere then said to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But if <em class="calibre3">‘Nameless’ </em>did everything for the sake of protecting the witch… He’s truly amazing.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Amazing?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because the witch seems to be a strong figure. Meanwhile, <em class="calibre3">‘Nameless’ </em>was a person with no special power. Objectively speaking, he should have been in the position of being protected. For him to miraculously survive those fire arrows&mdash;perhaps, the witch had helped him.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Certainly, that’d be the case if the woman he intended to protect truly possessed a mysterious power. In fact, what he did may have been pointless. That woman might have been able to manage on her own, regardless of whether or not he risked his life. Rather, as Lumiere speculated, his life might had been saved by her, instead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…This was mentioned in a historical book that you haven’t read, yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was an ancient book. Only those with a penchant for historical facts would touch that book.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It was said that ‘<em class="calibre3">Nameless’ </em>distracted a group of enemy soldiers to save the nearby witch who was about to be hunted. It was said that <em class="calibre3">‘Nameless’ </em>merely partook in the war to buy time for the witch. At that time, black hair was considered a bizarre thing. I’m not sure if she truly had any mysterious power, though…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fact that black hair was regarded as a heretical color in ancient Lapisenta was recounted in many books. Even in my mother’s homeland which was still considered a foreign country.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…But, in the present day, black-haired people were no longer discriminated against in Lapisenta.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was grateful. Had I been born during that time, I’d be having a more difficult life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In truth, I had always been fond of ‘<em class="calibre3">Nameless’ </em>who had tried to protect that <em class="calibre3">‘witch.’</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“If the supposed hero, <em class="calibre3">‘Nameless’, </em>partook in war for the sake of one woman, instead of the people, wouldn’t he be the more selfish, but also <em class="calibre3">kinder</em> than anyone else?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">At my nonchalant question, Lumiere tilted her head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Is he? I feel like he’s a little <em class="calibre3">too </em>selfish.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, it’s fine if you don’t agree. It’s fun sharing our interpretations with each other.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">As I thought, she disagrees…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">A long time ago, when I spoke to the queen about it, she said, <em class="calibre3">“What’s so good about this buffoon? If he just wanted to protect a woman, there’d have been a better way. This is an epic tale, and not a romance story.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was shocked at the time, but now that I recalled it… the memory felt both precious and nostalgic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because, even if the queen disapproved, I couldn’t stop falling for the hero, and thought of the tale as a romance story.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Even if everyone disagrees …I still think that he’s wonderful.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if it was considered selfish of him. Even if he made a foolish choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be able to sacrifice everything for just one person&mdash;nothing was more amazing than that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if the choice had cost him both his life and honor&mdash;even if it was a foolish choice&mdash;the more I found him endearing…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere couldn’t comprehend my excitement. However, she immediately smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right! It’s an honor to be loved by Lelouche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, I’m glad I can talk to Lumiere like this!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’d have been too annoying if she were to make a fuss about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Baron Alban gently knocked on the door.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“For a break, why don’t the two of you enjoy some tea? I’ve just received delicious sweets.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Gladly!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I responded without a moment delay, which caused Lumiere to giggle as she stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let’s go to the guest room, Lady Lelouche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She pulled my hand with hers.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">While I was busy having snacks as a guest of the Alban family, Lumiere spoke to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By the way, Lady Lelouche, regarding the dance party three days from now, is it true that you refused His Highness Sazanjill’s invitation?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">More importantly, I was paying close attention to the donuts on the plate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…What is this circular food? Why’s the center empty? Moreover, it is covered with a lot of powdered sugar.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">If, if it’s like this, isn’t it obvious that it’d be amazing?!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Why haven’t I heard about this? Is this a treat of the common people?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…Well, while I was truly interested in it, it’d be difficult for me if I ate too many.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Naturally, maintaining one’s body was also important for a lady. Considering the amount of powdered sugar… the area around my mouth would inevitably turn white.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, may I eat such a sinful thing?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">God, forgive me&mdash;or, even better, I shall let you enjoy them as well!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Because god’s my best friend!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Alright, let’s include some for tonight’s teatime. No matter how much I ate in my dreams, I wouldn’t gain any weight!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Baron Alban had bought them. He was currently away, though. Then, when I go to bid him farewell, I shall inquire to the location of the shop as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Uh, Lady Lelouche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were no forks or knives. If such was the case, then I shall eat it by hand…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Although, Lumiere seemed to be eating it by sandwiching it between a paper napkin. I did the same and took a bite.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Woaaaah&mdash;!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">What was that sweet burst that exploded in my mouth? Combined with the sweetness of the oil that spread every time I chewed, it tasted utterly sinful. I was a sinner! The taste itself wasn’t complicated&mdash;it was of oil and sugar.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Ah, how blissful!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I wouldn’t mind if I died anymore!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">At any rate, I’d die in three days. I should’ve found that snack earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should’ve listened to god’s advice about eating more delicious food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lady Lelouche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lumiere, haven’t I taught you that you mustn’t repeat your lines?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I admonished her, my expression turned stern. However, Lumiere only smiled at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do you like the donuts?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, let me thank the baron later.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I think my father will be happy to hear that. So, may I ask you to listen to what I have to say?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course, what is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why won’t you participate with His Highness Sazanjill?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere emphasized her question by dividing each part.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, so that’s what this is about.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I washed my mouth with unsweetened tea before talking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By the way, are you aware that Baron Aljerk and my cousin, whom I’ve introduced to each other, will meet you next time?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“L, Lady Lelouche?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…How annoying, this isn’t good. Rather than the previous topic, shouldn’t this be more interesting?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Perhaps, we’ll become relatives?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although, by that time, I wouldn’t be there anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if the marriage went well, the Elcage family could become Lumiere’s backing?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere was in a daze. It couldn’t be helped. I should briefly remind her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Only betrothed and lovers partake together in such an activity.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only the upcoming dance party, but also the other parties.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unless there were unforeseeable circumstances, the standard practice for most ladies was to be escorted by their beloved when entering the venue. Moreover, in the case of a dance party, the first dance was done with their partner. I was the escort for Lumiere at the dinner party of Count Remel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, practice was over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You must attend with His Highness Sazanjill, Lumiere. I’ve also informed him of this.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But that’s just strange!? Why should I!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because I already request for our engagement’s annulment.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Strictly speaking, I hadn’t received the king’s permission. The engagement hadn’t been annulled. But, I’d die in three day’s time. I didn’t have to go through those unnecessary procedures. There was no need to upset a lot of people, including our parents. If I were gone, the engagement would naturally cease to exist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason I request His Highness to annul our engagement, that was due to my selfishness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere wouldn’t acknowledge it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But, that was just a momentary lapse in judgement because of your cold! You were happily throwing mud with His Highness!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But that’s that. Didn’t His Highness give you a dress for the dance party?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A dress, ah…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere, who was shocked, hurriedly stuffed her donut into her mouth. She swallowed it as it was and drank some tea. However, I didn’t have time to pinch her because she immediately hit the table. The area around her mouth was still covered in powder, too.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/C83Qz14/203266.jpg" width= "345;" height= "460;"></img>

<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche, you misunderstand&mdash;!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is there to misunderstand? When a man gifts a dress to a woman, there’s only a single meaning.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hence I said, you misunderstood! I haven’t received a dress!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if she said that… I went with Zafield to sneak a peek at the pink dress that’d surely match her coral hair well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, her gaze was serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I put my half-eaten donut back down on the plate and raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What do you mean?”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">That evening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, god! Today, for the first time, I did a <em class="calibre3">‘Koibana (</em>love talk)’!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“First and foremost, is there a need to report that!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, my. I haven’t said anything and he’s already complaining.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, that was right. Since he was a god, he probably wasn’t interested in <em class="calibre3">Koibana. </em>It couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Alright, let’s move on to the next topic.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, have you ever had a donut? They are very delicious!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;No, what I’m saying is, didn’t something more pressing occur today? Shouldn’t you prioritize that?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">He asked in a tone as if he was coddling a crying toddler.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hence why I was upset.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;How annoying. Didn’t god advise me to <em class="calibre3">‘enjoy every day’</em>? I managed to put it into practice, too. What are you so unhappy about?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The god, who brewed tea while complaining to me, spoke in a coaxing tone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…No, of course I’m happy that you seem to be having fun.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, I’m glad to hear that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;For the time being, I don’t think that was a Koibana…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu. Did we just disagree about something? How cute.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why? I spoke about a man I like&mdash;isn’t that what a<em class="calibre3"> Koibana </em>is?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But… the man you like, isn’t he a historical figure?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So what, can’t I fall in love with someone who’s no longer of this world?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I took a sip of the tea he had brewed and tilted my head. God casted his gaze downward.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“That’s not what I’m saying. What if the person called ‘Nameless’ didn’t actually exist? For him to survive tens of thousands of fire arrows… it’s just preposterous.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do you think so?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps, it’d be better if I didn’t ask such a question. As a god, he mayhap had a duty of confidentiality. Therefore, he might not be able to give me a clear answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Still, that didn’t mean I shouldn’t ask, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…’Nameless’&mdash;does he actually exist?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Since you’re a god, you should know the answer, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Come on, god, aren’t we buddies? For you to keep a secret from me, how saddening…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Can you please not?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The story of a hero who braved countless fire arrows just to protect his beloved witch&mdash;is it just a bundle of lies?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…It’s the truth.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Hey, god. Is it alright for you to answer?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted to laugh, but at the same time, I couldn’t. God’s expression was sad.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…He existed. There existed a man whom is now referred to as ‘Nameless.’ The story about the fire arrows is also true. But… to call him a hero&mdash;that’s just ridiculous. That man abandoned everything for the sake of that woman, yet in the end, he still failed to protect her. He’s the greatest idiot among idiots in history.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Emanating from his every word was regret and repentance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did the witch perish?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. She shielded ‘Nameless.’ Isn’t it ironic? He wanted to protect the woman, but he alone survived under the protection of said woman. Such a repulsive man, he was&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;<em class="calibre3">He was cool, I think.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I immediately denied his words. As for the basis? There was no such thing. It was just my feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For some reason, I was sure that was the case.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sure she thought so, too. She loved him until the end. Therefore, I think she just couldn’t help but shield him!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I said that, the god smiled with a gentler face than usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Thank you, hearing you say that, somehow, I feel like that was the case.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, my. Why is the god thanking me? Aren’t you and ‘<em class="calibre3">Nameless’ </em>supposed to be two different people?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“T-that’s right…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That was right. That was all I needed to know. More than that was unnecessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should draw a line.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…But looking at how the god was guffawing, why did he look so happy? There were even wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…He was so beautiful and cute, I felt bashful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, even if I said something awful, I wouldn’t be punished, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By the way, god…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“What is it?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry to say this, but have you ever been told that you don’t look like a god?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, he stiffened. I didn’t care. I was looking forward to the donuts.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Wow, it’s amazing…!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The sweetness of the exuding oil was the exact taste of sin. It was the most addictive flavor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…My, donuts are great even in the dream world.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was enjoying the donut, god, who sat in front of me, suddenly stretched out his hand. Then, his fingertips gently traced my lips. Afterwards, while licking said fingertips, he said, <em class="calibre3">“You’re right, it’s delicious.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">W, what are you doing…!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“H, how uncouth!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I don’t want to be told that by someone as rude as you.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What, are you angry or something?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing that, god only beamed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“No, you’re just so accurate, I can’t say anything in return.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I fell in love with his face all over again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, I could only pretend to be innocent while eating donuts.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;2 days remaining</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche! Will you grant me the honor of escorting you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My school day wouldn’t be complete without hearing His Highness crying out to me at least once. At the same time, that was also going to be the last.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, I had decided to spend tomorrow relaxing at home. Without giving any particular reason, I said, <em class="calibre3">“I’d like to spend time with my family tomorrow… Can’t I?” </em>Perhaps because I had asked sweetly, my parents agreed almost instantly. They were too lenient on their daughter. My father even decided to rearrange the schedule for dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">The future of the Elcage family is in good hands…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…I could only trust them on that point.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, that day would be my last day at school. Although, to be precise, that’d be the day after tomorrow, when the dance party was to be held. However, on the evening of said party, I’d be wearing a dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, it’d be my last day wearing a uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apparently, that was to be my last time experiencing such a lively morning, as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the last time, I thought of giving His Highness a thoughtful reply.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I stared at His Highness Sazanjill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dazzling blonde hair and gallant lapis lazuli eyes. His beauty alone was almost like a work of art&mdash;if we were to discount the fact that he seemed utterly desperate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His nose was swollen. His eyebrows were furrowed. His eyes were also glazed over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As such, I couldn’t help but laugh at his beautiful, <em class="calibre3">hopeless, </em>appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Pardon me, Your Highness Sazanjill. Good morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Y, yes, good morning…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was another beautiful day. Despite the season, the temperature was mild without a single breeze blowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">That’s right, does he still have it…?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness, do you still have that stuffed animal?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah? You mean this?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a somewhat happy look on his face, His Highness Sazanjill took out the tattered stuffed animal. I honestly thought that as a young man of age, he shouldn’t be displaying that so proudly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…How hopeless.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have a once-in-a-lifetime favor to ask of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W-what is it? I’ll do whatever you want!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing how eager he was, I felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Can’t you be a little bit more cautious…?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, since he said that he’d do whatever, I could ask him to return the stuffed animal. After all, it was supposed to have been thrown away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Would you like to skip school together with me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">What?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, His Highness Sazanjill continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, w, what’s gotten into you, Lelouche? If my mother were to learn of this, wouldn’t you be in a lot of trouble?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“When that happens, please be my shield.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I… if it’s only that much, it’s no problem!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu, Your Highness, your eyes are swimming, though?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon, we were speaking inside a carriage as we headed for the city. As I alighted from the carriage, I stretched out.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oooh&mdash;! I love the mixture of guilt and sense of freedom of strolling in the city so early on a weekday morning&mdash;!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Lelouche, should we wear a disguise?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, that’s a great idea. Well, Your Highness, you may disguise yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’d be a problem if the dignified crown prince was caught skipping school and playing around in the city. As such, disguising himself was probably for the best. However, when I was about to enter a nearby clothing store, His Highness pulled my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, let’s refrain from doing so. It’s a uniform date.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, we walked around the city as we were.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I had discovered a trendy donut shop, we ate there together. As expected, the area around His Highness’ mouth became pure white. Then, I spotted a strange mask at an antique shop, and told His Highness to wear it (later, he bought it.) There was a shooting game in the amusement park, so I let His Highness try it and he almost hit the clerk. We both flat out apologized afterwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, the people and the clerk who saw us were astonished. After all, not only were we in uniform, it was the crown prince and his fiancée. Everyone’s initial reaction was, <em class="calibre3">“What on earth happened!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">But every time, His Highness would say.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We’re having a uniform date, so I’d like to ask you to keep this a secret.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Please don’t use the word ‘date’ so casually&mdash;!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was careless in inviting someone as serious as him. If possible, I wanted to refrain from giving everyone the impression that we were on good terms. Otherwise, when I died, it’d be a full-blown tragedy. Instead, it’d be better for everyone to hear that the villainess who was on bad terms with the crown prince had<em class="calibre3"> finally</em> died.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I put the nail in the coffin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m going to ask you to not only annul our engagement, but also to escort Lumiere to the party the day after tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But why…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness was so utterly shocked that he dropped his cutlery. Meanwhile, I was twirling the pasta around my fork as I looked at him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lumiere has no one else besides Your Highness. Without you, won’t she be lonely?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’d be embarrassing for a lady to enter alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, with whom are you going?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…That’ll be a secret until the day of.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is it Zafield?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course not.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, is it someone else that you like!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…That person wouldn’t be able to attend, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He couldn’t participate in the party. In the first place, would I survive until the start of the party? If possible, I’d like to see ‘<em class="calibre3">Nameless’ Sunset’ </em>one more time. The crimson flowers, along with the setting sun, were so beautifully drawn, they left me lost for words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I brought the pasta to my mouth, His Highness put his elbow at the table.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Is that supposed to be a riddle? I don’t understand at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, it’s complicated, so do your best.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">‘My fiancée is going to die the day after tomorrow, yet refuses to attend the party with me to make a final memory.’</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I’d be in trouble if he got that right. I’d also be troubled if he were to be saddened by the tragedy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right, let’s return to the academy after we finished eating. There’s someone I’d like to meet.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is it Lumiere?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, half-correct. I have to make a final confirmation of her party etiquette.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If so, then is it Zafield?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Being honest with you, I’d like to refrain from meeting him…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">He lied to me about the dress Lumiere had supposedly received from His Highness Sazanjill!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I knew he had his reasons such as because he had a crush on me, or because he was testing His Highness Sazanjill. Regardless, I couldn’t just keep silent and move on…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Still, I regretted that I couldn’t continue to train until the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he clenched his fist in frustration, His Highness sipped his water and said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did he do something to you as well?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">As well?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, never mind. Don’t worry about that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’d rather not meddle in the siblings’ affairs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I opted to think about the alternatives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, don’t worry, I’ll deal with the rest.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is there anything I can do for you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By all means, escort Lumiere.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Like I said&mdash;!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;We’re in this together.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was sure that he’d be able to handle it. I finished my lunch and got up from my seat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Everything’ll be alright, I’m not that fragile of a woman.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Am I such an unreliable man?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, it’s not like that. I just don’t know how to depend on you. But one thing is for certain, Your Highness…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I put my napkin on the chair before smiling at His Highness and telling him how I truly felt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I really appreciated our date today. Because of you, I had so much fun!”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Then, I’ll ask you to do so on that day.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After school that day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I said my goodbyes in the hallway of the ‘Trois’ class and turned on my heels.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Well, I guess that’s all I can do. The rest is up to him…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, I had to go meet Lumiere. Since it was my last day, I happily bought some snacks. But as I didn’t want her to get too plump after eating doughnuts every day, I bought cookies with lots of dried fruit in them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I hope she’ll be happy with them…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was walking down the corridor, there was a sudden tug on my arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Eh!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was pulled behind a secluded staircase. In the dim light, a man’s long, silver, hair shone from the backlight. As both of his elbows trapped me against the wall, I could see his lapis lazuli eyes from up close.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“To not be able to defend against this kind of situation, you still have a long way to go, Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…<em class="calibre3">Your Highness Zafield, </em>please don’t corner me while saying something like that?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">We were at a distance where our noses were likely to touch. Thankfully, the other party was His Highness Zafield. Otherwise, it’d have been impossible for me. Popular with the girls, His Highness Zafield was handsome like usual&mdash;as such, it was bad for my heart. When I averted my gaze, His Highness Zafield leaned to my ear and chuckled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…What a relief, you still see me as a man.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I always think of you as a gentleman.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why did you skip today’s training?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, did you wait for me? My apologies.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As usual, it was common practice for young ladies to pretend like nothing happened. However, my hand trembled as I held the paper bag. It was obvious that I was behaving strangely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, where did you go with my brother today?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We took a stroll around the city for a change of pace.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Even though you’re no longer engaged with him?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…He had a point.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/zXQpDRH/203267.jpg" width= "345;" height= "460;"></img>

<p class="calibre2">After he had pointed it out, I was amazed by my own shallowness. Still… I wanted to forget everything else and make memories. I knew it wouldn’t make sense. No matter how much I tried to cut them off, they were still the few, closest, people I had.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Did you know? That includes you too, Your Highness Zafield…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“In truth, I’d have liked to invite His Highness Zafield out, as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If that’s the case, then why didn’t you invite me? I would’ve gladly skipped school if Lelouche had asked.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But you told me a great lie, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…I’m angry with you.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield chuckled. When I thought that he had finished laughing, he slammed his fist against the wall right above my head. Involuntarily, my shoulders flinched, and I dropped the paper bag.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He mercilessly screamed at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Yes! That’s right!? </em>From the very start, I’m a big liar!! Is that why you discarded me!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Don’t raise your voice, please. Even if it’s after school, it’s not like there are no people&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Are you worried about the implications!? What, is it because it might affect my brother’s reputation!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…That’s not what I’m saying. But he hasn’t officially accepted the annulment of our engagement.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was too late to salvage my own reputation. But if things went on like that, His Highness Zafield would suffer the consequences, as well. By trying to assault his brother’s fiancée, his future engagement could be affected. Besides, even if we were childhood friends, there was no excuse for such a close distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I didn’t think he’d understand that at the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield scoffed at my words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But in the end, you still prefer him, don’t you? The day after tomorrow, you’ll ask my brother to escort you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…No. I’ve just turned him down again.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Ha? </em>What do you mean by that? Don’t lie to me by saying that you have someone else you like.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s not exactly a lie.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, who is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I looked up at His Highness Zafield. Both his fervor and frustration left me no choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Nameless.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…<em class="calibre3">Nameless?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. ‘<em class="calibre3">Nameless’ Sunset.’ </em>Surely, you’re familiar with him?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">&mdash;Don’t mess with me!!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, I got yelled at once again. I wasn’t joking… What should I do? I was truly at a loss. How was I supposed to convince him?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, something hot dripped on my cheek. I was confused. We were inside the academy, it shouldn’t have been rain. When I finally lifted my face&mdash;I saw that His Highness Zafield’s azure blue eyes were overflowing with tears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Don’t play around with me, Lelouche. Don’t you know how I feel about you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to his tears, I involuntarily told him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I… am destined to die the day after tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">…What?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, I have no intention of reciprocating anyone’s feelings. I shall dedicate my whole being to god.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if taken aback, His Highness Zafield blinked profusely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">That’s right.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">For saying something like that, I fully expected that no one would believe me. It was a matter of course.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">But why?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It made me want to cry, too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that’d be selfish of me. I slipped out of his loose hold and picked up the paper bag.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, I shall excuse myself. Lumiere is waiting for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I tried to leave, I could hear him mutter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…<em class="calibre3">Do you love my brother that much?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">It’s not like that.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">It’s different.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">But of course, my voice didn’t reach him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I quickly headed to the usual empty classroom and closed the door behind me. Upon seeing me, Lumiere, who had opened her textbook, sat up in worry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Lady Lelouche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After taking a breath, I smiled at her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry for being late. I bought some sweets. Would you like to eat them together?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That day, I went to the storage room belonging to the swordsmanship club before returning home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As one could imagine, keep a sword with me during class or in my bag was dangerous. Therefore, I stored it properly when I wasn’t using it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason I dropped by the warehouse was to take it home with me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Now, where is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a small sword that I especially chose. No one from the swordsmanship club would’ve ever used it, but I couldn’t find the sword anywhere.<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Hey, about the thing you said earlier&mdash;”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;What? Did I say something strange?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">During nighttime. Of course, I also bought god some cookies. However, many of them had crumbled. Yet, god still ate them without saying anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, while eating, god bashfully remarked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…<em class="calibre3">That, you’re dedicating yourself to god…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufu, isn’t that a common answer?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“T, that’s right! It’s something that priests often say! Hahaha…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Still, those were my honest feelings.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Fwah&mdash;!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu, god blushed.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Usually, I’d have been astonished by the gap in character, but I had become accustomed to it. At the same time, I was also elated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“More importantly, you seem to have had fun today. You also have a talent for shooting&mdash;”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I spoke to god about the things we did in the city and what we ate. God listened to my innocent talk and give appropriate responses. I was most grateful for that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because until the end of my life, I wanted to keep smiling.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;1 day remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As planned, I spent my time with my family that day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I helped my father tend the field. Unlike usual, I took my sweet time. After that, we all ate the breakfast that my mother served. While discussing what to do that day, we were in great agreement that we should check up on Rufus who was studying under a master of painting!</p>
<p class="calibre2">For them to agree so easily, I thought that it was odd… But it turned out that my parents were visiting my brother once a week! They sure were overprotective! Moreover, the master always caught them. He even complained, <em class="calibre3">“At least, put some more effort into not getting caught.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That day, the three of us got found out, too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But after that, the master gave Rufus some time to rest. Rufus, who I hadn’t seen in a long time, had tanned and looked quite manly. Apparently, he’d run some errands for the master along with the other apprentices. Despite having a hard time, Rufus seemed to be enjoying himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Boys sure grow up fast…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, I went home and made dinner with my mother. I tried my hands at making a stew, but white sauce was actually difficult to make! Thus, I accidentally burned it and the sauce turned black. Even so, my father said, <em class="calibre3">“How delicious!” </em>When I burst into tears, my parents were shocked. Shrugging it off and shifting the topic proved difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I took a bath and the three of us played cards for the first time in a while. My mother was unexpectedly excelled at cards. In contrast, my father wasn’t so good. Hence, the winning side became obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">My mother’s luck is truly amazing…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hopefully, she’d bestow some of it to my father’s scalp.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Then&mdash;<br class="calibre5" /><br class="calibre5" /></em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;My apologies, I ended up pulling an all-nighter.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the pure white world, I apologized to god. He wasn’t angry and instead smiled quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Did you have fun?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, it was a truly fun day…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That day was the last day I’d be spending with my family. Said day turned out to be very peaceful and enjoyable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon, tomorrow would arrive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">then, on the morrow…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">God asked as he brewed tea as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“What would you like to do tonight? Do you want to spend your time chatting like usual? Or&mdash;”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;No, actually, there are many things I’d like to ask you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon steeling my resolve, I gazed into god’s sullen eyes. He offered me a cup of tea and said, “Go ahead.” After quenching my thirst with the steaming black tea, I raised some questions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“First of all, are you truly a god?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Isn’t it a bit late to be asking that? Unfortunately, yes. It’s my obligation to look over the activities of the living in this world and govern the cycle of life and death… Although, despite saying something so grandiose, other than a person’s life expectancy, I don’t know anything else…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I see. God isn’t omnipotent. Well, even if a god is supposed to be omnipotent, this particular god just didn’t seem like he would be…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Oh no, what do I do?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I’m sure he’ll get offended if he reads my mind right now.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, is it alright for a god to lend his aid to an individual such as me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…In all honesty, it isn’t. Right now, I’m still safe, but I’m sure that I’ll suffer consequences later.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your work environment sure is harsh.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“It’s merely a different dimension. Once you get inside, everywhere is the same. I have a superior and subordinates. Besides, I’m relatively low-ranked. There are many substitutes for me.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">As I thought, the world of gods is difficult to comprehend.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt like if I understood too much, my dreams would shatter into pieces. As such, I decided to not dig too deep. Alright, let’s return to the main topic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;<em class="calibre3">Why? </em>Why are you going to such lengths for me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had always wondered about that. While calling himself ‘arrogant’, why did god insist on helping me? I refrained from asking that question because I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to see him anymore. Thus, I decided to keep quiet.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">After all, I was stated to die in 100 days.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…There’s no way I can spend those days by myself.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“It’s just like I said at the beginning. It’s due to my arrogance. I merely&mdash;…I only want you to be happy. Even if there is only a little bit of time left, I wanted you to spend those days to the fullest… That’s all.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, but you ended up placing a lot of pressure on me, like, <em class="calibre3">‘Why don’t you go out more?’, ‘Why don’t you eat something delicious?’, ‘Don’t you want to fall in love?’”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Well, that’s because… Up until now, you haven’t enjoyed yourself at all. When it comes to girls of your age, don’t you like talking about who you like and such, along with eating delicious food while looking at pretty things?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&nbsp;</em>“Like I said, you’re merely imposing your ideals to me. If I were to die in 100 days, I’d refrain from doing anything that’d cause my family to be unhappy. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to do anything about it!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I stated the truth, God shrugged and smiled wryly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…I agree. This time, essentially, I wanted to let you live for yourself. But you… are just that kind of girl, aren’t you?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“…What do you mean, <em class="calibre3">‘this time’?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Never mind. I’m sorry. It’s irrelevant to our current topic.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What’s with that?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though I was truly curious, god only shrugged me off.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“In the end, did I become a hindrance?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh my, did you realize that just now?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Hey, god…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t want him to make such a face. I wanted to see him smile. I wanted him to smile happily&mdash;<em class="calibre3">beside me.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“God taught me the future. Because of you, I was able to do something for my family. Besides, I had a lot of fun these past 100 days&mdash;and it was all because of you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I couldn’t wish for anything more than that.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right, I was truly looking forward to seeing you every night! I can’t thank you enough!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I straightforwardly said that, god chuckled and started laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Look at you, saying such a thing so happily… Are you trying to seduce me?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, of course!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon affirming his question, god turned bright red.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Really, he’s more selfish, arrogant, and human-like than anyone I know.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, god. Do you remember the promise we made?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Of course, what is it you want? Wealth? Fame? A romantic lover? An irreplaceable friend? Or, would you like to become a god as well? If so, I can recommend you.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m keeping it a secret until tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I winked at him.</p></div>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">“I’ll keep it a secret until tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I winked at him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ah, but I have an urgent request…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do you have… sometime tomorrow? If possible, when I die, I want you to be the one to pick me up…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I’ll be here the entire time. If it’s only that, I can grant your request. Consider it special treatment.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How kind of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“If I don’t do that much, I don’t know what kind of complaints I’ll get later.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You understand very well.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">God smiled bitterly once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From there, I asked a variety of questions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">‘If I hadn’t done anything, how would I have died?’</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was truly excited to hear the answer to that question. However, it turned out that His Highness Sazanjill would have accidentally stabbed me. Due to hearing rumors that I was going to be assassinated, I carried a dagger for self-defense. Thus, His Highness Sazanjill tried to confiscate it. Because of our strained relationship, I misunderstood and desperately fought back. The rest was history.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">That’s a splendidly outrageous way to die…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, history distorted the facts into something like, <em class="calibre3">‘Lelouche Elcage was condemned.’</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Truth is stranger than fiction, indeed.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, when I asked god about the affairs of my family, he said that quite a lot of people harbored grudges and envy towards them&mdash;especially the head of the Fable family. My father broke his engagement with a member of the Fable family to marry the <em class="calibre3">beautiful princess of a foreign country.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Basically, a typical example of being hated because you are well-off.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">At last, I asked about the truth behind the assassination of His Highness Sazanjill.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“But why are you asking me all of this now? Wouldn’t it have been better to ask earlier?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“At first, I was running away because I was scared to hear the truth. But now, it’s different.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Could it be, you’ve figured it out&mdash;”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I leaned forward and pressed my finger against god’s lips. As I enjoyed the cool sensation of his lips, I smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll refrain from saying anything else. After all, I have no intention of listening to your useless advice.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“How terrible. You should listen to what others have to say.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But doing the opposite of that sounds like what a villainess would do.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Well, even if so…”</em> God gently pushed my hand away, before slowly putting down his cup&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;I’ll make sure to witness your final moments.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Properly see it, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I stood up from my chair and elegantly bowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Hey, god, be sure to watch.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I’ll show you the most beautiful last stand you’ll ever see.</em></p>
