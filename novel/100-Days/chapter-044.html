<p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths - Haise's Journey 3<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, with a pair of Desert Eagles holstered at his waist, a grenade launcher strapped to his back, and a shotgun in his right hand, was walking through the first floor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The first floor resembled a street lined with buildings, their windows oddly intact, and a ground unusually firm beneath his feet.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>White mottled patterns marked the ground, with dilapidated cars and motorcycles abandoned everywhere. Traffic lights stood scattered along the way.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This is one strange dungeon..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There was no sign of enemies.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This dungeon was known as a place you could never leave once entered, and so little information was available.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise regretted not asking more about it during his truce with Balgan.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Click! He loaded his shotgun and pressed forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? Is that... writing from Isekai?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A small signboard came into view. Upon closer inspection, the sign read ‘Ice Cream House’.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ice... cream? What’s that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Perhaps it was a stall of some sort. It looked like a cart with wheels, but Haise couldn’t understand its purpose.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, flipping through the ancient texts he carried, he found a passage written by Nobunaga.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What does it say... 'I want ice cream. I’ve tried various ways with the materials here, but it’s no use. No way I can make vanilla essence. And seriously, how do you even make mayonnaise in another world? Too many protagonists in these other-world stories seem to have specialized knowledge. Enough with the convenient plot devices already.' ...I don’t get it at all. Maybe they struggled too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Closing the ancient text, Haise resumed his journey. The path descended underground, so heading downward seemed like the goal. Suddenly, a shadow darted out from behind an abandoned car—a black goblin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ki ki ki! Ki ki ki!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Black Goblin..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Rated B for danger, it was a formidable magical beast.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Larger than a regular goblin, it wielded an iron sword crafted from what looked like a car door.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There were five of them. Yet Haise remained calm.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ki ki ki! Kibut!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Boom! His shotgun roared.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The head of a Black Goblin burst apart. Haise fired repeatedly, taking down three of them before discarding his empty shotgun. Drawing his Desert Eagles, he swiftly eliminated the remaining two.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"All this on the first floor... I’d better stay sharp."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reloading the magazines for his Desert Eagles, Haise cautiously pressed on.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Half a day later.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had made it to the fifth floor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The scenery within the dungeon remained unchanged.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From the ancient texts, Haise learned that this path was called a ‘road’, and the nearby structures were known as ‘buildings’.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The doors of these buildings were all locked and wouldn’t open.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, as he descended the stairs toward the sixth floor, he noticed a small hut near the entrance.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise raised his Desert Eagle and examined the surroundings.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The hut appeared to be a storage shed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sliding the door open, he found a sheet spread out on the floor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There were also traces of a campsite—likely left by a party that had once attempted to conquer this dungeon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise took out Beast Repellent, and Detection Magic Stones from his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He placed the magic stones around the hut and spread the repellent, a liquid undetectable to humans but with a strong scent that kept beasts away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The detection stones worked by triggering an alarm in the hut if a beast passed nearby.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Both were essential tools for dungeon exploration.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Phew."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise decided to camp there for the night.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From his item box, he set up a foldable tent, chair, and table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Lighting a lamp, he prepared to eat some vegetable soup, meat skewers, and bread he’d bought from a stall.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Reaching the fifth floor on the first day. Not bad."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was alone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This meant he had no one to keep watch at night. Resting to recover his stamina was crucial, so he planned to sleep right after his meal. Placing a detection stone close to his ear, he crawled into his tent and closed his eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s fine. I can handle this..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was his first dungeon.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even for someone like Haise, the tension was palpable.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tomorrow, the tenth floor. No rush, just steady progress..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Muttering to himself, Haise drifted off to sleep.</p>
