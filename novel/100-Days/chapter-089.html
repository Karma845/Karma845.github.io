<p>Pursuit<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When I woke up, there was a large back in front of me.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, you're awake?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………Reynold?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. You were sleeping like a log. You okay?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, yeah…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Currently, Sasha was being carried on Reynold's back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Flustered, she got down, and Piasora rushed to hug her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Aahhh!! Sasha, are you okay? I healed even the tiniest scratches perfectly!! Does it hurt? Are you alright?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Piasora… Was it you? Wait, Tycoon and Robin too?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Honestly, don't make us worry like that."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hehe. Everyone stopped their work and rushed to Sasha's side."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Everyone…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold and the others had moved immediately after hearing the report that 'Sasha had entered the misty forest alone to save Roland.'<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Even if we're in different clans, we're still Team Sacred. If the leader moves, we move too. That's what comrades do, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Reynold…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh, pretty cool, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Hehe… You were the one who saved me, right? Thank you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't mention it. I just carried you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha felt happy knowing it was Reynold's broad back that had saved her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, she suddenly remembered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wait, what about Roland!? Don't tell me he's still in the forest!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nope. Presea saved Roland. He was lying near the forest entrance with Sasha."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is that so? What about Presea?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"She went back. Seems like she was just nearby by chance."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Could Haise have been there too?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha wondered about that as she glanced in the direction of the misty forest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, is this okay?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What is?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Not telling them it was Haise who saved Sasha? Just lumping Roland, who passed out, together and letting me hand them over?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's fine. No need to go into details, and getting extra thanks is a hassle."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright. Well, whatever."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise had returned to the royal capital ahead of the others.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After saving Sasha and returning to Presea, he found Roland, who had passed out from the tension snapping. Haise left Sasha with Presea and headed back to the capital first. Then, Presea, who had handed over the two, joined him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Their destination was the adventurer's guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise explained to Geist that he had saved Sasha and left her with Reynold and the others.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see, so she's safe… That's good."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist looked relieved.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Haise took out some 'items' he had retrieved from his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist, there's something I wanted to ask."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hm?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"About this. And also, about the abilities of S-rank adventurers you told me about before…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise listened to Geist, compared it with the items he had retrieved, and became certain.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When he explained his conviction to Geist, Geist held his head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist, can you summon that guy?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…It's possible."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Please do."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist nodded silently and called for a veteran receptionist to start writing a letter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Tch, it's here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What is?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A summons from the guild. The location is… huh? Why the outskirts of the forest?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Are you going?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Can't ignore a guild summons. Probably nothing serious, though."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright. Take care."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The S-rank adventurer known as Chaos headed to the summoning location with a light heart.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What awaited him there wasn't Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was Haise, an S-rank adventurer in a black coat and an eyepatch.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise took something out of his item box and threw it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a clang, a fence landed and rolled in front of Chaos.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This fence, it's coated with corrosive poison."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Standing before Chaos was Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He had gone out of his way to summon Chaos to the forest on the outskirts of the Haiburg Kingdom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Chaos, for his part, simply stared at Haise without a word.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Your ability is [Venom]… You can secrete poisonous fluids, right? That's what Geist told me. You apply it to knives and weapons to fight, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…And?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Roland said he was punched by someone… And the request Roland and the others took was suspicious to begin with. Their main task was herb gathering, but there's no way they'd come to the dangerous misty forest. No herbs grow there. Someone manipulated the information, led them to take the request, and then someone lurking in the forest set Roland up to be left behind."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Only Sasha was free to move. They timed it when Reynold and the others were away from the clan, making sure Sasha would go into the forest alone. And… they made sure Sasha would grab a rotten handrail and fall into the ravine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………Are you saying that was me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Chaos tilted his head with a smirk.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The evidence was too weak to prove anything.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just because there was poison on the handrail, you think I'm the culprit? Maybe some poison just happened to splash on it during a fight, right? Then the adventurer's guild is at fault for not checking the handrail. And Sasha was the one who grabbed the rotten handrail and fell into the ravine, right? Is her carelessness my fault too?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You called me all the way out here to the outskirts just to say that clumsy Sasha was set up, and I'm the culprit… really? Hey kid, just because you're an S-rank adventurer, you think you can throw around baseless accusations?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's not baseless. You're the culprit."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Without any evidence, you're saying that? Pretty arrogant, aren't you? Oh great adventurer who cleared the Forbidden Six Labyrinths?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Whatever. If that's all, I'm heading back."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Chaos turned around with a smirk and waved.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Haise threw another fence from his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It flew over Chaos's head and rolled in front of him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tch… what now, kid? Still not done?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Take a good look at that fence."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The fence was also coated with corrosive poison.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just like the first one.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But───Chaos was startled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wha…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Stuck in the fence was the 'broken tip of a knife.'<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This fence was found near Sasha. Your knife's tip is stuck in it. You… used your ability to cut into the fence, right? That's when your knife broke. Cheap stuff breaks easily, idiot."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-you're lying!! My knife wouldn't break!! I wouldn't use cheap crap that breaks just from cutting into a fence and pouring poison!! I made sure───…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Chaos covered his mouth, realizing too late.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise smirked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Made sure, huh… Geist, you heard that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wha!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, I heard."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Geist appeared behind Chaos.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He exuded a chilling, murderous aura.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah, I was the one who broke that knife. Don't worry, your knife isn't broken. Well… you did show your stupidity, though."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-you bastard…!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"When I heard about the corrosive poison, I immediately thought of you. But the fence alone wasn't enough evidence. So… I decided to set you up. I knew you'd slip up."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"G-grr…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're the one who tampered with the fence in the misty forest, used Roland as bait to lure Sasha, and set the trap."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───…Damn you!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Chaos drew his knife and charged at Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise aimed two Desert Eagles, but without a sound, Geist stepped between Haise and Chaos.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With snake-like movements, Geist grabbed Chaos's wrist, twisted it to make him drop the knife, then delivered rapid kicks to his groin, stomach, and neck, finishing with a palm strike to the jaw.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You fool."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With those cold words, Chaos collapsed to the ground.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He was completely unconscious.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, who had been unable to do anything, stared in shock at Geist's back.</p>
