<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 9 &#8211; I Shall Enjoy These Wonderful Consecutive Days Off</h1><p class="calibre2">&mdash;31 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">The fun, consecutive days off, break will start tomorrow!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">For three nights and four days, I was ready to stay at Baron Alban’s house. In preparation of teaching a certain someone from the time she woke up to the time she slept, I postponed the after-school tutoring session. To keep her from getting bored, I introduced about five recommended books to her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, recently, Lumiere had become less disliked. I kept hearing, <em class="calibre3">“Lumiere has become more beautiful,” </em>from the surroundings recently. I also heard that His Highness Sazanjill had directly praised her. Her score quiz seems to have been far higher than before. Those visible changes seemed to be accompanied by her aspirations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was glad&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">this way, even after I’m gone, everything will be alright?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That day, for the first time in a long time, I had no plans for after school. I wouldn’t be practicing swordsmanship for three days, and I was about to go home thinking that I could just do some self-study.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lady Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It had been a long time ever since someone referred to me like that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was reluctant to say it, but my appearance had devolved even more recently. Not only was I covered in dirt, my uniform was also torn. As expected, people started to suspect I was being abused. I began to wonder if I was about to be involved in some unnecessary chit-chat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ve heard a rumor.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The people speaking to me were Duchess Lala Fable and Countess Media Remel. They weren’t sisters, but they were close friends. The two tied their hair using the same ribbons and in the same style.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’re going to spend your break with a daughter from a baron family? If I’m not mistaken, she’s from the Trois class, isn’t she?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“She’s been getting along rather nicely with Prince Sazanjill, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">At least refer to her by name, and not her class.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">How can you not know it?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">My eyes narrowed. Regardless, I didn’t care enough to point that out. Therefore, I answered with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“They are, indeed. I’m really looking forward to staying with her so we can deepen our friendship as women during our consecutive days off.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, Lala whispered, “Well, pardon me…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had no choice but to listen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Shall we cooperate?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As I stared at them, their lips, which were covered in lipstick, distorted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Isn’t doing everything yourself difficult? For your consecutive days off, shall I help you prepare some flowers for her? I’ve been doing business with a trader lately. I heard that pure white chrysanthemums are preferred in the Eastern part of the continent. It’s a flower that symbolizes the end of life!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t it wonderful?! I wonder if that Trois student has that kind of knowledge, though? Should I send her a dictionary of flowers?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, I see.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The two of them were truly excited, as if they were blooming.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…How silly.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">What was worse was that they never used malicious words&mdash;such as bullying or harassment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If this went well, then I, the future princess, would be indebted to them?</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if anything were to happen, wouldn’t I be blamed? In the end, they were just planning to impose everything on me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">How convenient for you.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I’m sorry.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I wasn’t one to make use of wild cards. I was about to reach my end soon&mdash;so I alone was enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, but I’m in a hurry. Excuse me, ladies.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although my dress was shabbier than theirs, I showed off my perfect curtsey.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…But, I heard something interesting. A flower that symbolizes the end of life?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maybe I should think about that for a moment, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Rumors, hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hadn’t been all that concerned about rumors lately. I didn’t have any plans that day. It might be a good idea to look into it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Then, what’s the result of your investigation?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">After investigating, I felt like reporting to someone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">God was the right person to complain to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Merely looking at it give me a stomachache…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I were to list them in bullet points:</p>
<ul class="calibre6"><li class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">I </em>burned Lumiere’s textbooks.</li><li class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">I </em>tried to tamper with Lumiere’s test.</li><li class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">I </em>mixed insects into Lumiere’s lunch</li><li class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">I </em>swatted Lumiere’s head with textbook.</li><li class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">I </em>ridiculed Lumiere every day until she cried</li><li class="calibre7"><em class="calibre3">I </em>ignored the greetings of Lumiere&mdash;etc.</li></ul>
<p class="calibre2">Those were all petty forms of harassments. Based on the etiquette of the royal castle, it could be concluded that the perpetrator was high-ranking. Few people were so thorough at the academy. What was more, I was impressed at the cunningness&mdash;there were a few clauses that actually did happen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I sighed, “Good grief… I also heard that due to <em class="calibre3">my </em>pent-up rage, I finally decided to assassinate her. It is said that Lumiere ran to the toilet during class the other day because I had poisoned her lunch.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Let me ask you this, do you remember doing any of that?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I obviously don’t? I’ve been busy training with His Highness Zafield every day during our lunch break.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the other times, I’d be ambushed by His Highness Sazanjill in the morning and be with Lumiere after school. Far from having no time to carry out such tricks, I had a solid alibi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">God asked with an unabashed face.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Is Lumiere doing fine physically?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I think it was just diarrhea? She should have been feeling refreshed after release it all.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…Why do you know that much?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I recall the appearance of Lumiere from that date and time. Her lower abdomen had become a bit smaller.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“You’re a bit gross.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">How disrespectful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As her educator, managing her body shape was also part of my job. I felt annoyed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I turned away, god then said, <em class="calibre3">“You love doing that, don’t you?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I pretended to not hear him, just like what he did back then.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After shrugging, god asked me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“But, why would they do such a thing? No one is watching.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“However, the evidence is always there.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Evidence.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“By that, I mean this.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a bet whether or not I could bring it into my dream. Turns out, as long as I placed it on my bedside, it seemed possible. In that case, I’ll prepare a tea set and go to bed tomorrow. After all, having a conversation without tea felt dull.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While entertaining such a thought, I handed him a letter pressed with flowers. On the letter, words seemingly penned by a lady, stated as follows&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;An amiable relationship that is also self-explanatory.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the end, my name and the initials of my family were added.</p>
<p class="calibre2">God spoke after alternating his gaze between me and the letter.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Is this your handwriting?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s completely different. For one, talking with such vain similes isn’t my habit.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I planned to write a number of letters with royal seal in the future, so I had concentrated on my penmanship. I had reached the level of handwriting as organized as those in my textbooks with both my eyes closing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…As long as the context, <em class="calibre3">‘A jealous woman whose fiancé is being stolen from her’ </em>still stands, such evidence is enough to paint me as the culprit.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Although, the fact remains that you’re tutoring that thieving cat despite the possibility of losing your fiancé to her.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, my! You say some excellent things!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After I praised god, he seemed hesitant. <em class="calibre3">“I’m finally being treated like a god?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It couldn’t be helped, after all, I was told such a thing?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Being honest with you, god&mdash;you aren’t very god-like.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Why!? For me to appear inside your dream, isn’t that celestial enough!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I mean, there’s that, but if you truly are a god, then you should have already known the results of my investigation?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, he knew of my future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">God seemed reluctant once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…I just thought that you’d want me to ask you.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t remember ever asking that of you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“But, you said, ‘It’s really interesting, you know!?’ with a pair of glittering eyes!? It’d be impolite for me not to ask!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, you’re good at imitating my voice!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Listen to what I’m saying for once!?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu, I mean&mdash;isn’t that embarrassing?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Did I talk that much?</p>
<p class="calibre2">True, I was happy at being able to talk to god a lot that day. More so because we had been fighting for the past few days… I still missed those arguments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, I shouldn’t tell him that, yet. When I laughed, one full of implications, god only sighed. These days, I was happy to be able to communicate with him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">God, who guessed, also switched the topic.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“&mdash;Here’s the real question.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“How were you able to figure everything out in just those few hours after school?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s all being a lady is about.”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;30 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Therefore, keeping hold over the weaknesses of others is important. Acquiring information with money is possible, but you may end up exposed on the spot if you do that. The secret to winning an intelligence war is to give a firm impression&mdash;<em class="calibre3">‘Turning me into your enemy would be a mistake.’”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">We had a fun and enjoyable night of studying. Of course, it was held at the residence of Baron Alban.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After greeting the baron in the morning, he left due to business. That day was a good opportunity to teach some things that were difficult to learned at the academy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I shall teach her how to manage her life!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…Yet, Lumiere looked even worse that day. From what I could tell, she wasn’t sick. While shaking, she was looking at some letters on the desk that we always used.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I went around the desk while playing with the pointer&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">what’s the problem?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s with those threatening letters?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, why does Lady Lelouche have these!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I told you yesterday? I collected some while the others were given to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were the letters regarding Lumiere’s bullying, the same ones I showed to god yesterday. They had either been thrown away or were being collected by others for fun. Some of them were torn, and I had only acquired three of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I merely brought them with me to use as impactful texts…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…But the impact was too much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, I’ve been doing well&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Just in case, do you really believe I’ve been bullying you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tilted my head slightly in pure doubt. Lumiere immediately raised her face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…The part where I’m being told to bury myself and study 5 books is true.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“They were actually seven books.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you a demon!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, even if you cry every day, you still studied, no?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I let out such an adorable fact.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere, whose blue eyes were filled with tears even that day, was staring at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Pardon me for speaking out&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;She imitated the correct manner of speaking to a superior. That told me she was slowly accustoming herself to the rules of the royal castle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After acquiring my permission, Lumiere continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;His Highness Sazanjill said that Lady Lelouche would never do such a thing.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why was his name being mentioned?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Was she trying to keep me in check? Was she so tired of studying that she wanted to joke around?</p>
<p class="calibre2">That couldn’t be the case, thought. I had been mentoring her for 60 days. It wasn’t a long time, but I had grown to comprehend her a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She wasn’t one to tell jokes while sporting such a serious expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Not long after I enrolled in the academy… about half a year ago, I started getting bullied. I happened to have the prince by my side and things calmed down for a while…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Someone like her wouldn’t usually get along with the first prince, someone who also happened to be her senior.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if I were to point that out, the conversation would surely stop. First of all, I had to listen to her until the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But the day before our break ended, I received a letter&mdash;supposedly from you, Lady Lelouche. The letter told me that if I don’t distance myself from His Highness, I wouldn’t get away with it., Sazanjill&mdash;I mean, His Highness then yelled, <em class="calibre3">‘Luche wouldn’t do such a thing&mdash;!’”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche corrected herself. However, I didn’t care about that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Go on.” I urged her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her hands, which were clasped on top of her thighs, trembled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“His Highness said that he’d like some time to resolve the misunderstanding. He thought that by saying greeting Lady Lelouche directly, he’d be able prove your innocence. But the bullying only intensified… the prince, he was unable to withstand it, so he began to stay by my side. Nothing happens when we’re together.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did you start being harassed around a month after enrolling into the academy?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Actually, it began about five months ago…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…It was around that time when the rumors began that, <em class="calibre3">‘His Highness had a lover.’</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Around the end of the long vacation, the rumors had earnestly transformed into, <em class="calibre3">‘The first prince is planning to annul his engagement with Lady Elcage.’</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, I heard the prophecy from god&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;that I’d die in a hundred days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Then, after school, Lady Lelouche scolded me&mdash;no, taught me how to study!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;and then the bullying lessened in intensity once again.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, I’ve hardly been alone at academy… until very recently.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, His Highness and her would ambush me quite early in the morning. Then, he’d be with her during lunch. She’d also be tutored by me almost every day after school. As such, she’s had almost no opportunities to interact with other people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But recently, the bullying had intensified once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But, you’re otherwise unfazed by the recent harassment?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, compare to Lady Lelouche’s tutoring, they are&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Oh, my. Don’t look up at me with such a expression face after such a slip of tongue. If you carelessly show such loveliness, you’d be taken advantage of by bad guys.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;what a pain.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I laughed a little and confirmed to Lumiere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, you know for yourself, don’t you&mdash;I’m not the culprit.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course! …But, these letters… On the contrary, there’s no proof that Lady Lelouche isn’t the culprit.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s just the devil’s proof.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The handwriting of the letter didn’t belong to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it was a short letter, and I could have just altered my handwriting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To prove that I didn’t do it was harder than proving that I did it. How difficult&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">The devil is more troublesome than god.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Yet&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“His Highness believed in me from the beginning…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere nodded at my soliloquy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If what she said was true, maybe it’d be better to talk with His Highness as soon as possible and not at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…but.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t help but lower my gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So far, all I did was reject him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How should I face him after everything?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if to crush my anxiety, Lumiere gripped my hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please, won’t you listen to His Highness Sazanjill!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…But, are you alright with that? Don’t you want a special relationship with His Highness?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was mean of me to ask.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if I were to be at odds with His Highness, wasn’t there a chance she could become the new crown princess?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When asked about that possibility, she showed an uneasy smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’d be lying if I were to say I didn’t dream of that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But I’m no match for Lady Lelouche&mdash;after all, you’re terrifying.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She said that with a cute smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I pressed my finger on the face that everyone thought was adorable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“’I’m no match for you,’ you say? Alright then, 30 vocal exercises as punishment!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eeeh!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t complain!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hit her on the back with the pointer and looked at the window.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My face, which was reflected upon the window that gave way to a the beautiful garden, showed a slight smile&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;but only slightly.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">&mdash;28 days remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Alright, let’s review&mdash;who will be hosting of tonight’s dinner?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lady Lelouche, studying while getting dressed is just&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Then, shall we resume our study during the dinner party?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My smile was reflected upon the mirror. I could see Lumiere through the same mirror. She was wearing a pastel green dress and her shoulders were drooping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s Count Remel. This event is for celebrating the birthday of his second son, Horus. However, as Horus’ fiancée has yet to be decided, the purpose of this party seems to be for finding him a suitor.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How old is Horus?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“He’s 13-years-old, two years younger than us… I wonder if he wants to select a fiancée before his social debut next year.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s correct. That’s why we, who are relatively close in age to him, were also invited… ostensibly.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Lady Lelouche!? </em>Y, you’re scaring me!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, an invitation had also been given to me even though I was officially engaged. It was inevitable to think that I shouldn’t refuse the invitation. On the other hand, there was no particular reason why Lumiere shouldn’t be invited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a smile on my face, I mercilessly tugged Lumiere’s coral-colored hair which she had styled herself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I-am-truly-scary.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, I am, really, afraid of you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Jeez.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Anyway&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;I was concerned for her future. After all, she was merely slight nervousness and already couldn’t repeat my words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Lumiere, why are you staring at me?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What? Didn’t you say that you wished to see the culmination of my tutoring today? Are you having second thoughts about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N, no!? But, Lady Lelouche has only been helping me prepare… don’t you need to prepare as well?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Indeed. I’ll be ready soon. More importantly, His Highness isn’t going to escort you, correct?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, yes. I just told him that Lady Lelouche would prepare an attendant for me… Was that alright?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apparently, His Highness Sazanjill was also going to present at the birthday party of the count’s second son. I was mostly worried about Lumiere, though.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I laughed fearlessly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry, I have nothing to fear.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was destined to die in 28 days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tidied Lumiere’s always fluffy hair. It was time to discipline the pretty lady, someone who was also in good shape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Alright, Lumiere, give me your hand.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Okay…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As she alighted from the carriage, her limbs were trembling.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Good grief…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…</em>With that, no matter how brilliantly I escorted her, it’d be for naught.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had no choice but to assist to Lumiere who was barely able to get off the carriage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t be so nervous. You’re more beautiful than anyone today.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, what!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">What a strange reaction. I was only trying to transform her tension into self-confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Aside from Lumiere, who was confused, I started looking around. The beautiful, starry, night was suitable for the party. The light escaping from of the mansion emphasized its gorgeousness, partly because the night air was cold. As the objective was to find a fiancée candidate for a 13-year-old boy, there were many pretty flowers. When coupled with the splendor of the dresses of the ladies who were entering one after another, a gorgeous night was created.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Please&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;</em>I hoped that my last night would be as beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;I casted that yearning aside. I entered the wave of people in black tailcoats. Naturally, I did so while pulling the hand of Lumiere who was dressed in a fluffy dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For some reason, everyone’s attention was transfixed on us. Was it because of Lumiere? Or was it because I had transformed into a butler?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The deacons who managed the entrance were also confused as they compared the two invitations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are you truly Lady Lelouche Elcage?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, there’s no mistake. Don’t you remember this black hair?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“M, my sincerest apology…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment I displayed my black hair, I was admitted without any trouble. The black hair inherited from the <em class="calibre3">foreign beauty </em>turned out to be useful. It wasn’t a face pass, but a hair pass.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W, w, w, what?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I entered the venue, a commotion ensued. It had been a while since I had been noticed. I wasn’t displeased by it, though.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/njPBgR8/193690.jpg" width= "345;" height= "470;"></img>

<p class="calibre2">“Is she making her social debut?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The humble baron and the traditional duke are walking together?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“They’ve always been the center of the attention at the academy?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I knew they wanted to praise me, but couldn’t they keep their voices down?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">How can someone so lacking in confidence intend to stand beside His Highness?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">While the answer was still a mystery, I forcefully pushed her hips forward. We couldn’t remain in the entrance forever.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hold up your back. Lift your chin.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gave Lumiere instructions in a low voice and she immediately adhered to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">That’s right. There’s no need for you to say anything.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">She was beautiful if she kept silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a petite servant next to her, she’d appear a little more majestic, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, that image wasn’t the mere purpose of my butler uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why, if that isn’t a very familiar ponytail?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the attention of our surroundings were glued to us, a young man casually beckoned to us. Without anyone’s permission, he ran his fingers through my hair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His blue, sapphire, eyes sparkled underneath his noble, gleaming, silver hair. His Highness the Second Prince, whose shock couldn’t be concealed even by his dignified attire, smiled as he approached us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I poked Lumiere with my elbow, and she hurriedly lifted the hem of her dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m honored to meet from you, Your Highness Zafield. I’m Lumiere Alban, a student of the same grade as you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Y, yes, thank you for the polite greeting. You’re even more beautiful tonight. I’m surprised to see you dressed as an adult.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The second prince, who was accustomed to dealing with woman, reflexively offered a praise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu, is that so?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Since he had praised her that much, it seemed that Lumiere was indeed well dressed that night.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be frank, Lumiere had a baby face. A simple dress would suit her better as it would further enhance her loveliness. Instead, she simply put her hair together and used brown makeup. If such a lady were to show off her perfect curtsy, she’d look like a lady with age-appropriate attire and beauty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, her greeting at the beginning was still a little strange. I’d have to reprimand her later… Still, I had to give her a point. I didn’t expect for His Highness Zafield to be there as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;That day, I was but a humble attendant. Therefore, I would refrain from talking to the royal family. Then, towards Lumiere, who raised her face, Zafield whispered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Won’t you introduce me to the pretty servant beside you? She looks very familiar.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Uh, she’s, she’s going to be escorting me today, so…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was true. That sort of ad lib was still too early for her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I raised my face, put my hand on my chest, and bowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m Lelouche Elcage, and as for today, I shall be attending Lumiere.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, I know that already for I’ve been dedicating my daily lunch breaks to you.’</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although His Highness Zafield was concealing his mouth with his hand, it was obvious that he was laughing. Well, for that night, I would forgive him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s rare to see you here, Your Highness. It was said that only His Highness Sazanjill would be making an appearance later.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“My older brother is still busy. His schedule is keeping him busy all the way through the birthday of the count’s second son…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What about you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I felt like attending.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield showed his usual bitter smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Lumiere only trembled even more. Well, she had never met His Highness Zafield before. Also, thanks to His Highness Zafield, we received even more attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With such lavish attention, the party started. The organizer gave his greetings and the day’s protagonist was introduced. Once that opening was over, it was time to mingle. I had to greet the protagonist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, Your Highness, we must give our congratulatory greetings.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Did you come to promote Lady Lumiere today?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was about to leave, His Highness frankly asked that. It honestly blew me away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I placed my index finger against my mouth which wasn’t adorned with crimson lipstick.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why would I sell the lady I raised at such a bargain?”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">Lumiere was a baron. The Horus’ family was a count’s family. Counts were superior to barons. As Horus was the second son, he most likely wouldn’t be the next head of his family. Nevertheless, if Lumiere were to marry Horus, it’d mean marrying into a higher-ranking family. That’d be an ideal marriage for Baron Alban. It wasn’t something that could be described as a mere bargain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere must had understood that as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“L-l-lord Horrrus…. g-grats for turning 13-years-old, a-also thanks for inviting me to such a flowery party, it’s so cuute…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Hey, Lumiere.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I applaud your spirit to practice until the last moment, but didn’t we practice this line over and over?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Both her expression and voice were terrible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lumiere, who performed far below my standard, kept practicing next to me. She pretended that I wasn’t there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, she couldn’t express the greeting smoothly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I immediately pulled her back when I saw someone rushing towards her. Then, I steped forward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What the!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t believe she was foolish enough to scream.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’d scold her later. For now, I had to confirm the damage. As expected, juice had been spilled on my clothes. I was glad I wore something cheap.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I concealed the relief I felt and looked up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What a great time for my garments to be soiled, especially considering we were about to greet the protagonist of the party.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What a capable servant, Lady Lumiere. After seeing how cute your escort is, I thought you were babysitting.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh my, you were protected by a child?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My classmates were the ones who suddenly made those sarcastic remarks. They didn’t even bother to greet us.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Of course it’d be the Duchess of Fable, Lala, and the Countess of Media, Remel.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">There was no way they wouldn’t attend. After all, this was Countess Media’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were wearing similar dresses yet again. They were trendy yellow dresses. I wouldn’t say the dresses didn’t look good as they both had pale brown hair. Still, it was too mediocre.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, as a servant, I had no reason to praise them. However, a certain person who should had greeted them, on the other hand…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Are you okay!? Oh my, we have to clean this, wipe, a wipe…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Calm down, Ms. Lumiere.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I stared at Lumiere, she trembled a little. After facing them a little awkwardly, she bowed to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good day to you Lala, Media. Happy birthday to your little brother. Later, then…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Too stiff, too stiff, too stiff!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Besides, why are you saying goodbye to them so early!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Talk to them! About the weather, their dresses, anything…!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, at least, Lumiere was still better than those who didn’t say a word of apology despite having spilled their drinks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, the two wouldn’t let us go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hold on? I want to apologize to that cute servant. Would you like some sweets? What do you say, Ms. Lumiere?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“These sweets are my favorite, why don’t you try them?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">They’re telling us to eat some dessert despite having not greeted the protagonist?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I saw them carefully place two cookies with red jam on top of a small plate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What kind of jam is that?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t hesitate.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The duchess and the countess definitely weren’t well-intentioned in the slightest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite that, I knew that Lumiere wasn’t that fragile. Despite her slight quivering, after glancing at me, she gulped and tried to reach for the cookie. The venue grew noisy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Allow me to taste it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">An arm extended from the side and grabbed a cookie without hesitation. The beautiful young man carried the cookie to his mouth as it was. The man, whose blond hair shone amidst the glistening hall, shook for a moment. His temple and forehead started sweating, but his facial expression didn’t change in the slightest. He smiled gracefully and thanked the ladies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Forgive me for the suddenness. Since I had come in a hurry, I was famished. Even so, it had quite the unique taste. However, as it’s Ms. Remel’s favorite type of dessert, I will remember it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A, a, aah…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The three ladies were stupefied by the sudden appearance of the first prince, His Highness Sazanjill. Who was the third lady? Of course, it was Lumiere. Before calling out to his lover, he called out to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By the way, you’re wearing a very unusual dress tonight. Is that the trend, now?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Good day, Your Highness. Would you like me to repeat my greeting?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I couldn’t spread my skirt due to my current attire, His Highness Sazanjill grimaced at me, at my trousers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Forgive me, Lelouche…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He then spoke my name. Two small screams overlapped. Then, I showed my perfect, lady-like, smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As I was shocked due to the appearance of His Highness, my greeting was delayed. Good day, Ms. Lala, Ms. Media. I’m honored at being praised for being cute. That’s right, I was starting to bore of these unfamiliar clothes. Thank you for your patience, and for your delicious cookies.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I tried to reach for the plate, it was removed at a ridiculous speed. Leaving only a small apology, the two fled in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I exhaled and looked around, true enough, I was the center of the attention. After all, the sweaty first prince was in a hurry to drink a glass of water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I stared at him, whose small, red, tongue stuck out.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/wyQPhVF/193691.jpg" width= "345;" height= "470;"></img>

<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">How spicy. </em>That was my first time tasting something so hot.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s because you tried to do something you usually don’t. Ms. Lumiere, will you wipe His Highness’ sweat?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I took out a handkerchief from under my jacket, Lumiere looked very confused.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“M-me…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">It’s because my clothes are soiled…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Therefore, please help him and let me leave.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now that her true escort&mdash;and not to mention, the prince&mdash;had arrived, there was no longer any need for me to stay, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the first place, I was dressed like that to discipline those two ladies. My goal had been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was why&mdash;I wanted to leave&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">why does she look so withdrawn?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one who said that was Sazanjill. After eating that malicious dessert, he was able to laugh calmly. But as of the present, he looked a little angry and very impatient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Wait, I have a lot of things I want to say to you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…This is Horus’ birthday party. With how I am dressed, I’d like to withdraw. Could you please relay my congratulatory message, instead?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I came here because you were attending.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Such uncouth words, no matter how uncivilized you are, that’s&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;The same goes for you who attended in a male attire.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was right. Involuntarily, I concealed my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hence, I’d like to withdraw as soon as possible.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thanked him while placing over my hand on my chest like a butler.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I hurriedly made myself scarce. I regretted tying my hair in a ponytail. I wished I had styled my hair in a way that could conceal my face better.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">However, my ponytail was unexpectedly grabbed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hold on, Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had left the mansion and was trying to wait in the courtyard for my carriage to arrive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A classmate who resembled the prince who had just earlier eaten the spicy cookie held my arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What happened, Your Highness Zafield?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…No matter how you think about it, isn’t it dangerous to be alone in a place like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s alright. There are guards.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite it being nighttime, the stars and the mansion served as light sources. The visibility was well-maintained near the fountain. I couldn’t say how many, but I knew knights were there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not to mention, that day wasn’t the day I was destined to die. As such, I didn’t think anything strange would happen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But His Highness Zafield refused let go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I forcibly raised the corners of my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your Highness, did you see my physical performance earlier? I brilliantly protected Lumiere&mdash;that was thanks to your guidance!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Then, are you saying that you want to cease training because your efforts have been paid off?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I wish to remain your disciple for a little longer.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as I bowed, His Highness finally let go of my arm. He was scratching his head, instead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry for being dismissive, but do you want to protect my brother so badly?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I will refrain from replying.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although, always practicing swordsmanship merely because of that it wasn’t necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since I heard the future from god, I had been behaving quite recklessly. If not because I was aware of my time limit, I probably wouldn’t have resorted to crossdressing in the first place. After all, I’d just tarnish my family name at the first mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless, if rumors of what had taken place that night were to spread, the folly of Count Remel and his daughters to the crown prince would also spread.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">I could only pray that Count Remel and the others would put up a gag order.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt sorry for Horus.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Shall I secretly send him a list of recommended ladies later?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, setting that aside&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;His Highness seemed to be glancing at me. But as he played with his own coat, he seemed to be pondering something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What is it?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I would be free until my carriage arrived &mdash;<em class="calibre3">therefore, let’s ask him.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What does Your Highness intend to do?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Had you been wearing a dress, I’d have lent you my coat without hesitation. But I wonder what should I do when you’re dressed in such an outfit.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Ah, perhaps because he saw that my outfit has gotten soiled.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It certainly felt a little cold&mdash;but only around my chest. As expected, only my coat got wet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, I smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry for the trouble, but your mere sentiments will suffice for me. I don’t want Your Highness’ clothes to get dirty.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t care about that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sighing, His Highness pointed to a nearby bench. It wasn’t like I could go against his words, so I sat down. “Excuse me.” As I sat down, His Highness Zafield sighed once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I suggested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If you’re unoccupied, we can train here?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Are you stupid?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t mock me with such a straight face&mdash;I’m a little hurt.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was someone else’s residence, so there was no way I actually meant it. I also wondered if puppy-like eyes would work against him&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;Haha, look at me…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As I tried to fake crying, His Highness sighed three times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">It’s a little awkward, isn’t it?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">While quietly looking up at the sky, we talked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is it okay to not greet your brother?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I didn’t come to see my brother.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, what about congratulating Horus? Just dismissing him like that would be pitiful. After all, he’s still the lead of the party.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt sorry for being the main culprit of the commotion, but I’d do something about it later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, His Highness Zafield said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I also wanted to meet Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh my, I’m quite popular.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">To the serious His Highness, I uttered that casual joke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But His Highness wasn’t amused.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I like you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…He said that kind of thing the other day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I was still the fiancée of his brother, His Highness Sazanjill. As such, I pretended to not to hear him and didn’t even look his way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, His Highness grabbed my shoulders and forced me to face him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m serious. I’ve always liked you, Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness looked as if he was about to cry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So please, would you marry me? For that to happen…. I’ll do anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You jest.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I snorted at his plea. My reaction seemed to incited His Highness’ anger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Like I said, I’m serious! Let’s speak to my father about my older brother’s repeated infidelity! Then… I might be able to succeed the throne. If that happens, you won’t have to step down from the role of the future queen!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“My, such a funny joke… Then, let me ask, what if a rebellion happens?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment I gave such a quiet piece of advice while laughing, His Highness became silent. At first glance, there was no one around us. The sound of the fountain was loud, but in the unlikely event that those suspicion words were deemed unacceptable&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Suddenly, I recalled god’s advice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;As long as it was with moderation, would it be alright for me to spoil myself?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was just the matter of telling His Majesty the King.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, I wanted to spoil myself under the category ‘friends’ or ‘brother-in-law’…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, receiving another opportunity to start a relationship in 30 days was unlikely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Accepting his favor might not be a bad option.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Something that I had never experienced before. The sweet feelings ordinary girls could experience.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I were to decide to go through with it, no one would be able to blame me in the end&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;However, I&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Hey, Your Highness Zafield.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Towards His Highness Zafield. Towards Lumiere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Also, towards a certain god that I had gotten familiar with&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;I wanted to live beautifully without any shame until the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do you recognize this handwriting?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">What I brought out was the letter threatening Lumiere. The writing had a strong accent, something which tended to belong to men. After all, they didn’t practice their handwriting as much as the ladies because they preferred to be masculine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness Zafield narrowed his eyes for a moment before gently shaking his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I have no clue.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, one more thing&mdash;what happened to me near the staircases about 72 days ago?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s really specific.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was right. Because I had been counting them in the morning, the day, the night, and before going to bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, His Highness only tilted his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, but I don’t remember.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is that so.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I lowered my gaze, I heard a voice from a real butler saying, “Lady Elcage.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apparently, my carriage had arrived. I stood up and smiled gracefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, I’m sorry to hear that… I’d like to see you again during lunch for training tomorrow.”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…I don’t know what to say to you.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, may I be the one to talk?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I only have bad feelings about this… but I’ll listen to what you have to say.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, I went home. My parents were surprised by my outfit. Regardless, I went to my room and closed my eyes after collapsing on my bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long time, I spoke to god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Who would’ve thought that god’s advice would actually be helpful?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“…What a thing to say!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ufufu.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The way the super-beautiful young man stared at me was actually a little intriguing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Over the last few days, I hardly slept at Baron Alban’s. It was because of Lumiere… She snored. Perhaps, it was her exhaustion from working too hard during the day. But one day, that sleeping habit of hers might disillusion someone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless, how could I not feel sorry for Lumiere?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I was being conscious, I didn’t get enough sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, I had a very fulfilling break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A long time had passed since my last tea party with god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What do you think of the tea that I prepared?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Honestly, you shouldn’t have gone to such troubles.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though he was moody, god still drank the tea I made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I placed it on my bedside table, and it really came with me. Then, when I stood there holding the tea set, god prepared a wonderful table.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Fufu, this chair is comfortable, and the tablecloth lace is beautiful.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll bring some more refreshment tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Like I said, there’s no need.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fufufu.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also enjoyed tea. It was a dream world, and even though a long time had passed since I boiled the water, the temperature was just right. I could enjoy its mellow scent the whole time there&mdash;which was wonderful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While enjoying such exquisite tea, god looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“No, I just don’t think that my advice will be useful…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Oh my, is he upset?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although his appearance was cute, he didn’t come off as god-like.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“While it may be useless, I’m not saying that I won’t ask for your advice anymore?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">&mdash;Again, what a thing to say!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m honored to be complimented by you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“I’m not complimenting you!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I knew that.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">But, do you think that I can’t be mean?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But, was god aware of it, too?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“About what?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;His Highness Zafield.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He tried to frame the constant bullying towards Lumiere on me. He also pushed me down the stairs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I guess he hired another person for the stair incident. After all, if His Highness Zafield was nearby, I’d have no doubt been aware of it. I wondered if he was involved&mdash;but the answer seemed to be quite likely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did he want to make it look like Lumiere did it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">That way, it’d be a full-fledged conflict.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By any chance, was he trying to seize the throne by publicizing the unfaithfulness of His Highness Sazanjill?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I set my cup on the saucer. It was half-empty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“For you to recommend such a man to me&mdash;isn’t your taste a bit bad?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he was a god, was he aware of His Highness Zafield’s involvement?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“That’s not it. His feelings for you are genuine. If you were to accept him, he’ll take good care of you. Do you honestly think people are capable of changing that much?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, who pushed me down the stairs?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“At that time, the second prince intended to catch you. However, it so happened that the first prince was there, as well. He tried to help you, but failed… Nevertheless, because the first prince was underneath you, you didn’t suffer any major injuries, did you?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I… I wasn’t aware of that… at all…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Did His Highness Sazanjill attempted to help me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">…When he came to visit me, his jaw was injured.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So that was why.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I could no longer turn a blind eye to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I, instead of thanking him…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ridiculed his sympathy, misunderstood his actions, and cursed him in my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“Why don’t you try to talk to both princes at least once? The second prince is being suspected of trying to incite a rebellion, and that lady is being bullied… Who knows, it may unexpectedly lead to a good result.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, that’s right…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Actually, I planned to talk to them in the end&mdash;and it was to say my farewells, to say only what I wanted to say.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…It was because I didn’t want them to see my ugly side. My jealousy. My anger. My sorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, wouldn’t it be beautiful that way?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before my fiancé, I wanted to be the perfect lady until the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was why, I&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Still, there were 27 days left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only a short time remained, but it was still too for avoiding them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll think about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I responded like that, I could only hear a laugh. Of course, it was from god, the only other participant to the tea party in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why are you laughing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Hm? Because my advice turned out to be useful?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Uwaaa! He’s angry!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Did he induce the conversation to create such a flow?</p>
<p class="calibre2">For me to be dancing on top of his palm&mdash;it was actually embarrassing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“God is being cheeky?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Ahaha, as a god, that’s a first someone has ever used such a word to me.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Whether or not your advice will be useful is yet to come!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed&mdash;from now on, I’d talk to His Highness. I didn’t know what would happen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All I knew was that I’d die in 27 days&mdash;and that was it.</p>
