<p>Stampede Battle 1<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was reading an ancient manuscript in the inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ten days had passed since the Stampede strategy meeting. Each clan was busy preparing for the battle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Weapons, food, and supplies were being urgently imported from other nations, and reinforcements were being arranged. The four great clans were also asked for support, but only about 500 archers were sent from Yggdrasil.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Apparently, the other great clans had no intention of offering substantial help.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They merely lent about 100 adventurers from their local branches in the Heiberg Kingdom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...This looks useful."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was expanding his arsenal of usable weapons.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The ancient manuscript—a book written in a language of another world.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The more he reread it, the more pages he was able to understand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though he thought he could read the whole thing eventually, the book showed no signs of ending.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It seemed as though the more he read, the more pages it added—an unusual kind of book.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That makes twenty usable weapons now. I'd like to test them, but…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For now, all requests at the adventurer's guild had been temporarily suspended.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Residents of the kingdom were forbidden from going out, and food was distributed under a rationing system.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Stampede threat had been widely announced.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Many residents were leaving the kingdom. Now, with the borders sealed, adventurers monitoring the S-rank dungeon reported that the Stampede was expected within a few days.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise drank a cup of weak tea on the inn's ground floor. He left a few gold coins on the table.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"One-month extension, with breakfast and tea included."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The innkeeper gave no response.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise's payment schedule was arbitrary. He might pay again just days after a payment or almost forget to pay entirely.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This time, it was 20 days since his last payment—a reasonable interval. Even so, the innkeeper said nothing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………I don’t need it anymore."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I'm closing shop. The Stampede… it’s another tragedy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…You know about it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Thirty years ago, I came from a village destroyed by the Stampede."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…What?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I lost my daughter and her family, my grandchildren… I bought this inn for them after great effort. This property was meant for my daughter and her husband. When the Stampede occurred, I was away scouting this location. My village was wiped out."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nothing was left. The house I lived in, the inn my daughter and her husband ran, the doll my granddaughter cherished… not even bodies. Only bare land and monster tracks. My village was just in their path."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It was a small village inn. My daughter and her husband wanted to open a place in the capital… Send their child to school once she grew older. I didn’t object… I poured my savings into buying this old inn. I still think about it. If I hadn’t kept it a secret, if I hadn’t planned a surprise… If we had all gone scouting together…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The newspaper in the innkeeper’s hands was crumpled, dampened by his tears as his body shook.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise said nothing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Instead, he placed more gold coins on the counter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"One-month extension. Breakfast, tea… and include the newspaper."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The capital won’t fall to the Stampede. I’ll protect it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………You…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was the first time Haise got a proper look at the innkeeper’s face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He usually only caught a glimpse. Now, he noticed for the first time—a large jar at the innkeeper’s feet, filled with gold coins.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Most of the coins Haise had paid seemed untouched.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was clear that money or sustenance wasn’t the reason the innkeeper ran this place. He was merely fulfilling the dream of his late daughter and her husband: running an inn in the capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Whether this was atonement or something else, Haise didn’t know—and didn’t care.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Old man, until the day you die, this will be my base. So stay alive. If you’re continuing the inn for their sake, then see it through to the end."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"And like I said before—this place’s creaky beds, the squeaky floorboards, the weak tea, the hard bread… They kinda grow on you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………Hah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For the first time, the innkeeper smiled at Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He grabbed the gold coins from the table and placed them in the jar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"One-month extension. Breakfast, tea, and the newspaper. I’ll have them ready. But keep your word."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmph, cheeky brat…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise laughed and headed out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………Thanks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He thought he heard something but decided it was just his imagination and left the inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was busy preparing for the Stampede battle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her team was one of twenty. The Sacred Clan, with a total of about 100 members, was burning with determination to protect the capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Sasha had already made her decision.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Gathering the team leaders, she explained,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The only ones going to the front lines will be us, the Sacred team. The rest of the members will focus on defending the capital."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She conveyed what had been decided earlier.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Baphomet, the leader of the Sacred Clan's S-rank team Diamonds, spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Knew you’d say that."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In his late twenties, with a wife and kids, Baphomet smirked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>All four S-rank team leaders in Sacred were married with families.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It wasn’t just Baphomet—the other three leaders smirked as well.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sorry, but this is final. S-rank teams will guard the walls. B- to C-rank teams will wait at the final defense line. D-rank and lower will patrol the town."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-Wait a minute!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Roland raised his hand. Sasha turned to him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"W-We can fight on the front lines too! We’ve gotten stronger thanks to this clan, and…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I know. That’s why you’re patrolling the town instead of staying at HQ."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why…?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Because I’m still inexperienced."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The Sacred Clan is newly formed. Those on the front lines are veteran adventurers who’ve earned S-rank certifications. Our clan is still inexperienced."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…………"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I know you all believe in me and follow me. I want to meet those expectations. But I need more time. We’ll become a clan you can be proud of."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was decided: only the Sacred team would go to the front lines, while others defended and patrolled the capital. This was formalized in the adventurer’s meeting.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Of course, other teams were also tasked with patrol and defense.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The front lines, however, would see over forty teams, with a combined total of 2,000 adventurers from various clans. Including reinforcements from other countries, over 7,000 adventurers would fight on the front lines.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just a few days until the Stampede. Everyone, stay sharp and be ready."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After the meeting ended and everyone else left, the Sacred team members entered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s been a while since we all fought together, hasn’t it? Tycoon, you holding up?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Of course. And you, Reynold? Have you been maintaining your weapons?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Obviously. Right, Piazzolla?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don’t talk to me so casually! Aah, Sasha, it’s so great to fight alongside you again!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Everyone, I’m counting on you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Leave it to us! We’re the invincible Sacred team—nothing can stop us!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Sacred Clan united as one, ready to face the Stampede battle.</p>
