<p>Feelings<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What’s the big idea, Reynold?! That… that lover thing!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s fine, isn’t it? Haise didn’t seem to care either.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On the second floor of a small private café in the old commercial district,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This slightly secluded place is perfect for private conversations.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As soon as Sasha and Reynold entered and their ordered iced tea arrived, Sasha spoke up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That… lover…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her face flushed, her gaze lowered, lips pressed tightly together,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And her right hand fidgeting with her silver hair as she twirled it—<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To put it bluntly, she looked ridiculously cute.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold couldn’t help but admire her as he asked,<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, Sasha. Do you like Haise?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wha—!? Wh-wh-why would you think that!! I was the one who expelled him from the team, remember!? Not just that… It was the information I brought that nearly got him killed. I betrayed him! Liking or disliking him—”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You kicked him out to protect him because he couldn’t keep up in battle, right? That’s not it. I’m asking if you like him or not. You’re childhood friends, grew up together, didn’t you?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Well, I don’t dislike him. Though he probably hates me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Hah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Anyone could tell—she liked him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Whether it was love or not.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was more than just friendship or being childhood friends.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Of course, Reynold had no intention of backing down.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After all, right now, it was him standing beside Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Listen, Sasha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“W-what…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You’re about to get busy founding your clan. Naturally, I’ll support you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Y-yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You’re aiming for the best team to challenge the Six Forbidden Labyrinths, right? Then… now’s not the time to worry about Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Besides, you saw him, didn’t you? Haise already has companions.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The elf girl.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha was certain it was the Presea mentioned by Prime Minister Bonnet.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was slender and strikingly beautiful.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She also seemed close to Haise, who didn’t appear to reject her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Remembering Presea walking beside Haise made Sasha’s chest tighten.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m not saying to forget about Haise. But, at least for now, don’t think about him. He’s still playing around, challenging dungeons on his own.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Playing around…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah, that was poorly phrased. He intends to challenge the dungeons. But he’ll hit his limits alone. When that happens, you can welcome him into your best team. Or show him that his path is a mistake.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha didn’t answer, sipping her iced tea instead.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I… I’ll step outside for a bit.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Saying that, Sasha left the private room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold sighed and slumped back into his chair.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the private room two doors down from Sasha and Reynold, Haise and Presea sat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise sipped the same iced tea as Sasha while reading his newly purchased books.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea, too, was immersed in hers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then Presea spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That Sasha girl… your former teammate, right?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I wonder how she felt seeing us walking together.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignored her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea already knew all about Haise’s situation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her ability, Spirit Domination, allowed her to use spirits unseen by anyone without the same power.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Using it, she could eavesdrop on distant conversations or disappear entirely.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was child’s play to investigate the S-rank adventurer Haise, who was all the buzz lately.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Do you like her?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For a brief moment, Haise’s lips twitched, and Presea didn’t miss it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Childhood friends, huh… For me, Adra was like that. A childhood friend and fiancé… Back then, marriage didn’t mean anything to me. And I thought it didn’t matter who it was, whether it was Adra or anyone else.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“But lately…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea glanced at Haise, but he was too absorbed in his book to notice.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, Haise.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Hm?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Just tell me this—do you like her? Or hate her?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Who knows.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise closed his book and stored it in his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Like or hate… I’ve forgotten already. Besides, you know what happened, don’t you? I was nearly killed by her.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That’s… not exactly true.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Maybe. But… we can’t go back now.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With that, Haise left the private room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea closed her book and murmured.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“We can’t go back… huh.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So, had he once tried to go back?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Sasha exited her room, she bumped into Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She instinctively turned her face away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>‘Do you like Haise?’<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold’s words echoed in her mind, and Sasha shook her head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignored her and began walking away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Sasha spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Yeah?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well… what a coincidence.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“So… how’ve you been lately?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Fine.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…I see.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Don’t force yourself to talk to me. You’re with Reynold, aren’t you? Don’t bother with me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Wait. Let me clarify… Reynold is my comrade. Not my lover.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Is that so.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“And you… that elf girl, Presea… you’re not with her?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Whoever told you that, she’s just tagging along. She’s not a comrade.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…I see.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Can I go now?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Haise, can we talk? Just for a bit.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Do you really think there’s anything to say?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No. But I want you to listen.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Sasha left the shop and sat on a nearby bench.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It had been years since they sat side by side like this.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ve formed a clan.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I know.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“We’re still selecting applicants. Soon, I’ll get busier than ever…<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So busy I won’t have time for things like romance.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise, dwelling on you forever isn’t good for either of us. So, I’ll say this clearly once more, right here.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They looked into each other’s eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I expelled you from the team because I thought it was best for you. You may see it as a selfish decision, but I believed it was right. I can’t dream of forming the best team with you anymore.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll build the best team with my own strength. If you aim to be the strongest alone, I’ll cheer you on.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What about what you did to me?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That… was unintentional. We never meant to betray you, and I can promise you that.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise, I know you’ll never forgive me, and I’m fine with that. I’ll aim for the top and climb higher. Even if our paths are different, I believe the goal is the same.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll move forward, Haise. You should too.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha stood, flashing a confident smile at Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then she walked away.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Damn.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She was dazzling.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Sasha Haise once admired had grown strong.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She had shed her guilt toward him, accepted him as an equal, and moved on as his rival.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Fine then.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stood as well.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He would never forgive what happened, and he wouldn’t forget.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But letting her get ahead of him wasn’t an option.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Go ahead and build your best team. I’ll become the strongest my own way.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise smirked and walked forward.</p>
