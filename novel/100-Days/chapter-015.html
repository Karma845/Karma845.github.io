<p>Sasha’s Journey 2<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Switching watch duty, Sasha stepped into the tent.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She removed her armor, her hair accessory, her jacket, and then her undergarments... revealing her perfectly proportioned, beautiful upper body.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha filled a bucket with water and wrung out a towel.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She then carefully wiped down her body.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Phew…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There’s always at least one public bathhouse in every large town. Piasora had mentioned there was one in the mining town they were headed to, and she was eager to visit.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, as an adventurer, understood and had experienced days without bathing. But... she was still a young woman. If possible, she wanted to keep her body clean.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Besides, even Tycoon had said, "Change clothes daily. Dirtiness is bad for both your mental and physical health."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After wiping her body, lightly drying her hair, and changing into fresh underwear, Sasha slid into her sleeping bag.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The journey went smoothly for several days.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Myuane, who had started off energetic, grew quieter—perhaps due to the fatigue of walking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By the time they passed the third town, conversations became sparse.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In contrast, Cress was lively.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a hobby in plant observation, he collected rare plants and medicinal herbs, storing them in his personal item box and using his spare time to concoct medicines.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though injuries or illnesses could be healed by Presea’s magic, Cress’s pharmaceutical skills, unrelated to his abilities, were valuable in their own right. When praised, he only chuckled and said, “It’s just a hobby.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>About ten days in, they stopped for final supplies at a town near the mining settlement.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Myuane seemed exhausted.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Sasha suggested, "We’ll take a carriage back. But for now, let’s finish the journey on foot," her spirits lifted slightly. Unlike Robin, who was the same age but had greater stamina, Myuane’s endurance matched her age.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As soon as they checked into an inn, Myuane fell asleep.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the girls’ room, Piasora looked at her sleeping form and sighed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“She’s such a child.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Don’t be harsh. She’s royalty, not an adventurer.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…If she’d joined Haise’s side instead, what would have happened? In some ways, it might be better she’s with us… Haha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Robin said this, Sasha chuckled wryly, “True.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora, however, seemed uneasy.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Sasha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Did something happen between you and that man?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That man.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora disliked—no, loathed—Haise and avoided mentioning his name.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Not really…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Are you sure?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes. Someday, I hope to properly apologize and make amends.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Hey, Sasha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Do you… have feelings for him?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…………”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha blushed faintly and smiled bitterly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I don’t know. But I do think Haise is different from other men…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……In what way?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“He’s my regret... and now, my goal. Because of us, Haise’s life changed. I want to take responsibility for that and apologize. To me, Haise is special. I don’t really know how to put it…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“……Hmph.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Piasora didn’t seem satisfied.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin chimed in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I still wish Haise would come back…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“You were so attached to him—like a puppy being fed treats.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That’s not fair! But… Haise was kind. Even though I’m younger, he always looked out for me. He’d sneak me snacks and let me taste freshly made meals.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sounds exactly like feeding a puppy… Good grief.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmmph. Hey, Sasha… I don’t regret trying to leave the team with Haise when he was banished, you know.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I know. But you came back… or rather, you returned for Haise’s sake, didn’t you?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…So you noticed.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin hugged her pillow, hiding her face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Everyone agreed with Haise’s expulsion. I thought I’d be more effective staying in the team and persuading them rather than leaving.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I understand, Robin.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…I like you, Sasha, Piasora, Tycoon, and Reynold too…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I know. Thank you, Robin.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robin blushed, and Piasora turned away with a “Hmph.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The bonds within Team Sacred were incredibly strong.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At last, the mining town came into view.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The greenery faded, giving way to rocky terrain. The roads were well-maintained, with carriages frequently passing by.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, these carriages carried not people, but ore and stone mined from this area, particularly in the mining town of Lystal.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Upon arrival, Sasha presented her adventurer’s card to the gate guard.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“S-rank adventurer Sasha, of Brynhildr. I’m here on a royal mission to subdue the crystal golem inhabiting the mine.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“W-what? An S-rank adventurer!? Oh, finally!! Please, come right in. I’ll take you to the mayor!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They were led to the mayor’s house.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The mayor greeted them upon entry.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah, welcome, S-rank adventurer. It’s an honor to have you here.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Thank you. Let’s begin; I’d like to hear the details.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the sitting room, the mayor began his explanation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Two months ago, a crystal golem appeared in the royal family’s crystal mine.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“A royal-owned mine…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon adjusted his glasses.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One of Team Sacred’s rules was that only Sasha and Tycoon could speak during client briefings. They were the most level-headed and skilled at asking pertinent questions.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes. This mine produces the highest quality ore and crystal in the region. Normally, the resident adventurers can handle the monsters in the mine…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see. But now, a crystal golem has appeared, made of the same material. Is that correct?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha stroked her chin in thought.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“The crystal golem. Its subjugation rate is SS, correct?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Indeed. Its body is made entirely of crystal, which deflects both magic and physical attacks. Only magic or techniques surpassing the crystal’s durability can defeat it. But… in a mine, my large-scale magic isn’t an option. Robin’s arrows won’t penetrate, and even Sasha’s sword may not suffice.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hm, a formidable foe. That’s SS-ranked for you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Sasha pondered, Myuane raised her hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Have you forgotten my ability?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Myuane’s confidence shone. Tycoon murmured, “…I see.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Indeed. Myuane’s ability might work. And Cress.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah, I was thinking the same.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Then it’s possible. Mayor, do you have a map of the mine?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“O-of course!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The mayor spread out a map, and Tycoon began asking questions about the mine’s layout.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After a few inquiries, he nodded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’ll work. Alright, everyone, I’ve devised a strategy. Listen closely.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tycoon explained his improvised plan.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…That’s the plan. Thoughts?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“As expected of Tycoon. I have no objections.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“If Sasha’s in, so am I!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Count me in.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Same here~”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hehehe, finally, it’s my time to shine.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll give it my all.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Good. Sasha, are we set?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yes. Let’s go with Tycoon’s plan. The subjugation will be... tomorrow.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus, Team Sacred’s mission to defeat the crystal golem began.</p>
