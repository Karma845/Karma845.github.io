<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 8 &#8211; Idle Talk: The Monologue of a Former Thieving Cat</h1><p class="calibre2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Idle Talk’ is mainly about recollections from another character’s POV</p>
<p class="calibre2">I, Lumiere Alban, hated studying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since my father was an assistant director of an academic institution, it was expected of me to have some intelligence and knowledge. I found reading the history of art that my father specialized in quite refreshing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lumiere is a girl, there’s no need to push yourself so hard.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Look, Lumiere is good at sewing. I’m sure you’ll become a wonderful bride.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every time I heard something like that, I felt truly sorry for myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t want to be introduced as my father’s, a scholar’s, daughter. Thus, I eventually distanced myself from the social circles. Gradually, I became scared of studying itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, through the connections of my father and my peers, I managed to enter into an aristocratic academy. I was told that, <em class="calibre3">“Even if you get married, there’ll be no loss since you have an education.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how many connections I had, I was still a baroness. I wasn’t a gorgeous noble lady, someone described as dazzling in every rumor. Soon, I started to be bullied, especially because I was the odd one out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was in trouble. I didn’t want to go to school anymore. Despite that, there was no way for my father to know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When everything felt hopeless&mdash;I met him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did you drop this?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">During our first meeting, my first impression of that person was that he wasn’t a noble. Because what he had dropped was a stuffed peach rabbit. What was more, it was ugly. He probably received it from his sister, or brother…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Then, the blond man replied with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, thank you…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">W, what’s with this handsome person!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I had only seen a face that beautiful on paintings and sculptures.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…A prince?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was unworthy for a prince to hold such a thing… But he was truly dazzling. I rushed to hand over the stuffed doll. However, I accidentally ripped it instead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The rabbit’s neck tore… It must had been frayed since the beginning. The thread was already thinning. The doll was quite worn out. Even the prince-like man was aware of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah… don’t worry, it’s worn… since it’s very old…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">W, why do you look like you’re about to cry!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That was right! It was an accident! It couldn’t be helped! Even if he wasn’t truly a prince, it was still an aristocratic academy, right?! He should be able to purchase many such things!? Or, was it rare!? Maybe, it was a national treasure-class gem sewn by a famous seamstress who had died…!?</p>
<p class="calibre2">While being unsure of what I was hesitating about, I suddenly said such a thing&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;D, do you want me to fix it…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Can you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m good at sewing, so…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I didn’t want to study, I always sewed instead. My mother even cried, <em class="calibre3">“A commoner wouldn’t even do as much as you!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the prince’s(?) sapphire blue eyes sparkled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please, if you would&mdash;no, if you don’t mind, could you teach me how to sew?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">***</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was the beginning of my misfortune with him&mdash;no, if I said that, Luche would scold me… But I was sure that was my turning point.</p>
<p class="calibre2">***</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the days of teaching him how to sew began. During those days, we’d sit near a flower bed in the corner of the courtyard as he struggled to learn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then, pass the thread through the needle&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;This needle is frayed. Is it defective?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, <em class="calibre3">senpai </em>is just clumsy.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I diagonally cut the end of the thread and handed it over to him once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ugh… it would have been much faster if I were to do it myself… When will he be able to thread a needle?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps because he was embarrassed over learning something from me, our meetings were always early in the morning. I wasn’t good at getting up early, so I’d very much have preferred after school… But he seemed to be busy, so I was begged to come about 10-20 minutes earlier in the morning. I couldn’t say no when such a pretty person was bowing to me…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Well, let’s think of them as days where I practice my patience…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it had been three days. It had been three days since he started practicing how to thread a needle. Then, we had to take a break the following week due to there being a ball. During that time, he went back to square zero. Thus, we spent two more days of learning how to thread a needle again… in no time at all, we became friends.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, for some reason, he was adamant about me not doing anything! I couldn’t even help him thread the needle! It’d be overwhelmingly faster if I remade everything from scratch. If it was something like that stuffed toy, I could make one with my eyes closed during class!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if it was a prince’s request, I was fed up with it. So, I gently suggested that I make it instead&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;but he shook his head with a tearful expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I can’t. This is… something that Luche gave me. I want to fix it myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Luche…</em>? I felt like I had heard of that name from somewhere. Who was it again?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I see…</em></p>

<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Does he have a girlfriend? …Well, that’s only to be expected. After all, he’s this handsome. It would be weird if he didn’t have a lover or two…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was a little depressed about the fact, he asked me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By the way, you aren’t wearing leather shoes today?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I couldn’t help but yelp.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Shoes… shoes…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I changed into my athletic shoes during P.E class yesterday, my leather shoes were hidden. I couldn’t find them. I would need some time before I could get a new pair, for it was custom. If I were to explain the situation to my parents, I might be able to quickly obtain a new set, but I refused to tell them about the bullying. As such, I had no choice but to go to the academy with these one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I laughed like a fool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">Haha~ </em>I seem to have lost my leather shoes…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Those aren’t something you normally lose, do you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I know, right? How stupid of me!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My grades were bad. I was bad at studying. It was a fact&mdash;I was an idiot, despite being a scholar’s daughter. No wonder I was bullied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was about to laugh and shrug it off, but for some reason the prince nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Alright.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did you finally understand how to do it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, I’ll try to stay by you as much as possible for the time being.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">B, but why?! Why would you do that?!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was at a loss, the bell rang. It was about time for a lot of people to leave academy. Hence, we would separate there. But he didn’t get up from the flower bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Shouldn’t you return to your classroom?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll stay with Lumiere until the very last minute. The hostility should be reduced a little.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Did I tell you my name?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I usually look into the names of those who help me. I’m sorry for not calling you by your name before.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he stood up and extended his hand with an utterly dazzling smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“My name is Sazanjill Lukino Lapisenta, once again, please take care of me.”</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Wait, he’s a prince? Like, an actual prince!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">For me to not even know the face of my own kingdom’s prince… I felt ashamed. I didn’t know I was that stupid…</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was how those days of having such an influential person wait on his people began.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How could she…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What happened with Ms. Luche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Maybe, she’s his mistress…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is she?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Considering her rank, even the status of a pet is too high for her.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">As I thought, it’s too much for me to stay beside the prince, isn’t it!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, whenever I went to the cafeteria during lunch break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lumiere, this way.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sazanjill, who waited for me, would raise his hand and beckon towards me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’d attempt to make myself appear small as I sat down on the chair Sazanjill had pulled out for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…W, why are you referring to me without an honorific?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do you dislike it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, I don’t dislike it…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">If one wasn’t close to someone of the opposite sex, honorifics were only to be expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once I told him that, Sazanjill whispered with a serious expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If we were to appear to be friendly to some extent, it’d be more effective as a shield. Besides, I never use honorifics with any of my friends in the first place.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">’Friend’&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;I didn’t know whether to be happy or sad when I heard that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I mustn’t think about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I just nodded, “I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Highness was merely offering me some countermeasures.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If Lumiere doesn’t mind, I can just directly warn the person behind all this?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N, no, you shouldn’t…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Even if you refuse to admit it, this is actually an important matter, right? If your father heard about it, he surely wouldn’t like it. Well, now that you’re already using a prince as a shield, it shouldn’t be a problem anymore…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were times when I wanted to refuse that kindness. However, I had to be firm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But… is your fiancée alright with this?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Luche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Luche is…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking down, Sazanjill silently took the stuffed animal out of his pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’d like to explain everything to her, but until this is fixed, I won’t have the face to see her.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">What is that?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Was the doll such an important thing between the two? Was he that concerned about Lelouche?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I contemplated about what to ask, Sazanjill looked up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Therefore, I’d like to fix this as soon as possible. Will you help me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn’t like I had the right to refuse. Besides… I had already gone that far, I had to see it until the end with him. Thus, I answered immediately without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Although I soon regretted that immensely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was truly clumsy. I thought that the original maker (Ms. Luche) was clumsy, but Sazanjill was even clumsier!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never thought that it’d take that long! Most of the time we spent fixing the doll in the first half of the year didn’t bear fruit! As long as Sazanjill permitted it (about every three days, for less than an hour), we’d keep going at it. Then, we ended up spending about four months in total?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">To merely fix the neck of such a small stuffed animal!!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought it was about to be over once he was half-done.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he instead was like, <em class="calibre3">“No, I wonder if I can sew even better, now…”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">He wasn’t even good at finishing it!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, after overcoming such a long struggle…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes…! We did it, Lumiere!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, you did it, Sazanjill!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t care about honorifics anymore. It didn’t even matter if he was my senior, or the prince.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During that hardship, our bond had developed into something more than just friendship. We were <em class="calibre3">comrades. </em>The two of us clasped our hands and shed tears…</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ahh…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was sure no one would blame me for having a small crush on him. After all, he did his best. Besides, since Sazanjill had been with me the entire time, I was also spared from the bullying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But reality was cruel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“At last, I’ll be able to see Luche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a prince, he was true to his words. He truly refrained from seeing his fiancée during the last few months. His fiancée must had been angry… Of course, I didn’t say such a thing to Sazanjill who was happily hugging the peach stuffed toy, saying, “I can see Luche!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, I tried to keep silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, I crushed the letter in my pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, god was cruel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Tomorrow is the start of a new semester! Let’s go see Luche together!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, a new semester would start tomorrow, and also a change of heart. Sazanjill’s business with me was over… It was just the right time to stop seeing me. Besides, I was afraid of Ms. Luche, so I shook my head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t think I can do that. You should go meet her by yourself, Sazanjill.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Certainly, there may be no reason for Lumiere to see Luche. But, won’t you accompany me for my sake? I’d like to introduce you to her as a friend.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Rumors about the duchess having finally been abandoned had swirled around. Since he hadn’t had the chance to clear things up earlier, he was probably asking my cooperation to make up for it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But&mdash;as I clutched the letter I had in my pocket, Sazanjill raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What have you been hiding?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, but let me have a look.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I could let out a scream, my hand was pulled&mdash;then, it was seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is this… from Luche?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The envelope indeed had the same initials as Lelouche. It had been delivered to my house a while ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">“The new semester will start tomorrow. You think you’re so cute. Know your place.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even a fool like me could see what it meant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, Sazanjill asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did anything happen while I was away?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…There hadn’t been any major damage. My notebook had only been torn, and I was cursed on the blackboard. I had also been hit from behind. Compared to the previous time, it didn’t cause much harm. As long as I didn’t dwell on it, it was nothing. I hadn’t seen anyone but Sazanjill during that vacation… However, during the tea party at the salon I attended, someone accidentally spilled juice on me, forcing me to get changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, it wasn’t Lelouche. However, the culprit was probably in the same class as her.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/ygpMsXj/193689.jpg" width= "345;" height= "470;"></img>

<p class="calibre2">But, I kept silent. Sazanjill forcibly pulled my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let’s go to explain that this was all a misunderstanding! I honestly don’t believe Lelouche is the kind of person who’d do such a thing. This is a work of someone who wants to tarnish Lelouch’s reputation! I must prove it!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Ah, how wonderful for her.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I looked up at that desperately serious expression of his, and thought that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also wanted someone to be that desperate for my sake. I also wanted to be loved by someone to that extent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">How wonderful. It must be great. How wonderful. It must be great. How wonderful…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Such a yearning, one that’d never come true, turned into feelings that were certainly love.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, in the new semester, no matter how much Sazanjill approached Lelouche, she always ignored him. I was convinced that it was because he brought me&mdash;the thieving cat&mdash;along with him. Lelouche was angry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But did Sazanjill understand that?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I’m sorry, but I want to prove that Luche isn’t the culprit. So, will you go out with me tomorrow and forget the tutoring?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He said that, bowing to me every day. As we went out together, Lelouch became angrier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why wouldn’t you listen to him properly?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sazanjill was that serious for your sake. He did that while thinking about you. Or, were you perhaps the real culprit and didn’t have the courage to face him?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you wouldn’t listen to him properly&mdash;<em class="calibre3">then I will.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">If it was me, I would.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, Lelouche’s anger gradually turned into a misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…If that catastrophe were to continue, will Sazanjill think of me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">One day, the news arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche Elcage fell down the stairs and had been unconscious since.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">When I heard that Lelouche had fallen, I immediately went to see Sazanjill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apparently, Sazanjill had tried to cushion her fall, but failed. The depressed Sazanjill had a wound on his chin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…If Lelouche stays like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">If she dies, can I be your next fiancée?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I hurriedly drowned that idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I’m the worst.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter what happened, I mustn’t think like that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gently put my hand on Sazanjill’s shoulder. His shoulders were trembling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Again, I found myself envying the person called Lelouche Elcage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted to properly meet her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I made a suggestion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Can you take me to visit her, too?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;How did this happen!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that I had received my punishment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Lelouche, who had awoken, mentioned she wanted to have a chat with me&mdash;only the two of us. As soon as I was prepared for a fight between women, I found myself sitting on a chair as Lelouche preached about the etiquette of a lady.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“To stand beside His Highness, you’ll need a certain amount of education, not to mention appearance! If you can’t impress someone of my level, then you are unfit to be the queen!!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Uh, Lady Lelouche?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">You’re the fiancée of Sazanjill, right?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Why are you talking as if you’re my mother-in-law?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">In the first place, weren’t you the one who bullied me!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The person named Lelouche Elcage was a very gorgeous person. She had graceful black hair. She had long but sleek eyes. Her makeup wasn’t thick, while her lips were the color of cherry blossoms. Her white skin looked as if it was made of porcelain. She was slender and had long limbs. She was the exact opposite of me. Moreover, she had confidence in herself. Every word she spoke inspired me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She suddenly put something on top of my head. It was heavy, if I were to lower my head, my neck might snap&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;uh, a book?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche then said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right. First, place it on your head and sit for thirty minutes. In the meantime, I’ll be asking you various questions. Answer them as best as you can. Well then, let’s start by getting to know each other. Nice to meet you, my name is Lelouch Elcage. What is your name?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">I already know!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Besides, you’ve already investigated me, right!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, her black eyes mercilessly commanded me to answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lumiere Alba&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I could finish my answer, the book fell from the top of my head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche proceeded to smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Again.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre3">No more&mdash;!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The next morning, I appealed to Sazanjill in the morning. I would pass myself of as a fragile woman so he’d spoil me. To be honest, I didn’t really like it. I was already at my limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was really difficult! I had met various tutors and etiquette teachers, but no one was as strict as Lelouche! I much preferred being yelled at! I never knew a smile could be so scary!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless of what I had to say, there’d be book on top of my head. I was made to introduce myself endlessly if I stuttered. I was forced to curtsey for more than 100 times. I had to answer all the tests’ questions! If my posture was bad, I’d get struck on my back as a pointer!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sazanjill listened to all my complaints with a serious expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t that generous of her?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">What did the prince just say?</p>
<p class="calibre2">My mind blanked. As if recalling something, Sazanjill crossed his arms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Lelouche received all the education that is needed as a noble lady from my mother. My mother, she’s even stricter.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mother… Sazanjill’s mother?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, the current queen.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was right. The prince’s mother was once a princess, of course. Since Lelouche was also the fiancée of the first prince, she was a candidate for the future crown princess. It wouldn’t be strange for her to receive direct guidance from the current queen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sazanjill continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lelouche underwent that education when she was five. I don’t think her child self had any problems with the guidance…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">…<em class="calibre3">Ever since she’s five-years-old? She had to endure all of that?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…</em>No, it was just impossible for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yesterday, I thought that as long as we could communicate with each other, a difference in status was but a trivial obstacle!</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;I had decided, it was impossible for me to become the next princess!</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I paled, my gaze met the sideways glance of His Highness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, if Lumiere can’t take it anymore, I’ll say a word to her. Although, I don’t think she’d listen…”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Sazanjill, why are you so pessimistic? Do your best! Do your best as a man!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">…However, he instead appeared unreliable… I unintentionally voiced a complain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But why would Lelouche educate me…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry. I’ve been with her for a long time. When her stress builds up, she tends to do crazy things.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I tilted my head, Sazanjill’s gaze moved onto something faraway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right. One time, she adorably pick all the flowers. She also once said that she wanted to chop wood with an ax. Another time, she said that she wanted to ride a horse alone for a long trip. Yet another time, she tried to make a raft by herself to go to an island in the lake. There was also a time when she disguised herself with armor and trained alongside the soldiers. She has also dressed up as a maid and cleaned the inside of the royal castle in the middle of the night. When I think about that, my heart feels like it is about to stop.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…What a curious person.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I managed to find a gentle word to describe her actions, and Sazanjill gave a happy laugh because of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Truly, if she’s that stressed, I wish she’d come to me and talk about it… For a long time, she has never complained about herself.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">&mdash;Ah, he truly loves her.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I could tell that at a glance. He loved Lelouche. It was a passionate love.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was definitely the third wheel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In that case, why don’t you talk to Lelouche alone, Sazanjill? That way, she might be honest with you…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But Zafield…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lord Zafield?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wasn’t that Sazanjill’s younger brother? There were rumors that he was a sloven person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sazanjill continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“When you’re about to get entangled in such a conflict, it’s important to make sure that your loved one truly sees you. Besides, there’s that particular suspicion of her harassing you this time. That is the reason why I want to hear, <em class="calibre3">‘I didn’t do it.’ </em>from Lelouche’s very mouth. It’s hard to prove the devil, but first of all, I have to trust her.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Probatio Diabolica </em>meant that one should bring forth a devil to prove that there was a devil. But, wouldn’t proving that there was no devil be harder? In other words, wouldn’t proving Lelouche hadn’t harassed me be difficult?</p>
<p class="calibre2">During the small talk we had amidst our study time, Lelouche had taught me about that. If not, I wouldn’t know what he was talking about.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…But, but Lelouche could still lie about not being the culprit. However, it seemed that Sazanjill would blindly trust her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn’t like I couldn’t just ask Lelouche directly&mdash;but as I thought, I was too scared! It was absolutely impossible!</p>
<p class="calibre2">What if she said, <em class="calibre3">“Oh, you finally found out?”</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was really scared of the consequences!</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was afraid of Lelouche, who I had already pictured as a villain in my mind&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;To be honest, these problems between women are difficult for me. But I’m sure that Zafield, who’s intimate with many women, will understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sazanjill added.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Is that so?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I only had a friend of the opposite sex… I didn’t know because I never had any female friends. If the prince said so, then that might be the case.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;<em class="calibre3">just a little more…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted to keep dreaming, just a bit more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the price was receiving such a strict education, then I’d try my best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps, after hearing Sazanjill’s advice, Lelouche would become less strict.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;But that didn’t happen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche disregarded Sazanjill’s desperate advice. I was crying every day, so Sazanjill strongly reprimanded Lelouche&mdash;but it was to no avail… <em class="calibre3">tohoho…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Around the time when I began to get used to the mystery education that was forcibly being carried out on me, I began to feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lumiere Alban, you’ve been doing your best lately.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Last week’s quiz had been returned. The teacher, who’d usually bitterly gaze at me, warmly said that to me. I instinctively looked at the red number marked on the answer sheet twice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…9, 96 points…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By the way, Alban is the top student at the ‘Trois’ class. The class average was 63 points. Even in the ‘Un’ class, the average didn’t reach 90. Everyone should follow her example and do their best!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone in the class was abuzz. That was unexpected. Even in the lower class, ‘Trois’, I ranked at the bottom. Suddenly, my score was better than ‘Un’ class students!? I was utterly shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I went back to my seat and gazed at the answer sheet once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was my first time receiving such a gorgeous score, one penned with a red circle.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;That’s only to be expected for I have invested a lot of my time.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After school that day, as soon as I reported the score of my quiz to Lelouche, she casually dismissed it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…Uh, there’s no harm in praising me a little?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">While sitting sideways in the seat beside me, Lelouche gracefully rearranged her legs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did you just realize it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I believe your surroundings have long since changed their impression of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Well, if you were to ask me…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It felt like the gossip had decreased a little?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, there was no end to people criticizing me for being unsuitable to stand beside Sazanjill&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;but certainly, the frequency had decreased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was still regarded as an eyesore, however, it also felt as if the boys had been noticing me more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Recently, it’s been rumored that Ms. Lumiere has become cuter. There are also those who desire to confess to you and regret the presence of His Highness beside you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W-w-w-w-what are you talking about!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Me?! This stupid, laughable, daughter of a scholar?!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">As I flinched, Lelouche tilted her head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is it that surprising? It’s natural to be favored from the start when you’re good-looking, elegant, and confident.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Me? Elegant and confident?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Indeed. Even when I’m not present, you’re mindful of your posture and manners, yes? Your efforts have paid off.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was too scared to let my guard down because I felt as if Lelouche was everywhere to rebuke me with her merciless smile!</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Her smile hurts, and it’s scary!</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">But, I see… it seems that I’ve recently become popular…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That was my first time experiencing something like that&mdash;I was a little happy and also embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Lelouche asked me a question. From her tone, she seemed impatient to hear my answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What kind of dresses do you like…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Dresses?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was grateful that the topic had changed, <em class="calibre3">but dresses…?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The dress that came to mind was the dress that His Highness Sazanjill lent me. Being honest, I didn’t like it all. However, I had to keep up with the pretense that we were close. I thought I had to wear it at least once to save His Highness’ face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While thinking that I should report that to Lelouche…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s just curiosity on my part&mdash;but when it comes to dresses, you have your preferences, yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;The implication behind her smile terrified me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Alright, let’s talk about troublesome things again.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I quietly answered her question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I like mature dresses… Navy blue or black. While they may still be too early for me, when I see the madams wearing them, I thought they’re cool… I admire them…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see, as I thought, you’re a cute person.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">What does she mean? Is that sarcasm? I don’t think I said anything strange…</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I furrowed my eyebrows, Lelouche shook her head a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“There’s nothing wrong with your preferences, so don’t worry. Let’s start our studying session.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">She got up from her chair and struck the pointer against her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was just around that time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bullying had stopped for a while, but it restarted once His Highness wasn’t present. My textbooks would be scribbled in or there’d be insects in my bag. I was also given the wrong timetable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, that was nowhere close to being a big deal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, there was no need to bother His Highness anymore&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&mdash;but His Highness suddenly made a suggestion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let me be the taste tester. Growing up as a member of the royal family, I’m more familiar with poison than anyone else.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a flash, I slapped His Highness’ hand which moving for the fork to my lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t be foolish. What if something happens to Your Highness?! Don’t forget your position!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was lot angrier than expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was surprised at that, His Highness smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You sound like Lelouche.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Indeed. I can see Lelouche doing the same thing.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How dependable.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two of us giggled. I gently hid the envelope underneath the plate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After I parted with His Highness with a smile, I crushed the letter without even reading it. They’d always contain the same thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless, Lelouche couldn’t be the culprit. It was simply out of the question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m not going to lose.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I threw the piece of paper into the trash can.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, Lelouche suggested that she’d like to have a training camp at her home over our following three day break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course, with the permission of Baron Alban, I’d like to stay in your mansion for three days. What do you think?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">…I can already see that we’re going to end up studying again.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">What was more, in the same room. I wondered if she was going to watch me sleep. I felt scared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I was surprised when she straightforwardly said that she wanted to talk to my father.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Could it be, I was looking forward to it?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre3">Can we get along better?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I laughed at myself for having such expectations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lelouche asked while tilting her head. I responded with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, I’m looking forward to your stay.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">***</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Presently, I wanted her to teach me more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If she were to learn of that, would she scold me again? Or would she compliment me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Either way&mdash;I wanted to see Lelouche again.</p>
