<p><p>A Changing World Sasha took a deep breath, inhaling the air of her clan's homeland after so long. The parade had just ended, and after greeting the king, Cress, and Muarne at the royal castle, she had walked back through the town. Understandably, Sasha was exhausted. “Ugh… I’m so tired.” “Same here…” “So am I…” “Me too…” “Well then, let’s call it a day. Alright!! I need to compile all the intel on the Forbidden Six Labyrinths. Kukukuku, it’s going to be a busy time!! Sasha, we’re heading to the guild tomorrow, right? I’ll be holed up in my room until morning, so call me when it’s time to go!! Later!!” Tycoon, brimming with energy, dashed off to his room, leaving their stunned clanmates behind. Just then, the Clan Master of Yggdrasil, one of the Four Great Clans, descended the stairs. “It’s been a while, Sasha.” “Ibis-sama…!! Thank you for overseeing things in my absence.” “Ah, none of that formal stuff. Running a young and lively clan was nostalgic and enjoyable. So… you’ve done it at last?” “Yes… we’ve conquered one of the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, the Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans.” “Well, well. You and Haise… the young ones these days sure keep me entertained. Perhaps it’s time for me to retire?” “…What? Haise?” “Hm? Oh, has no one told you? Haise just returned a short while ago.” “!!” Sasha’s eyes widened in shock. She wasn’t the only one. Reynold, Piasora, and Robin were also visibly surprised. “It seems he returned during the parade. He went straight to his inn and is now sound asleep.” “Then… that means…” “Indeed. While the details haven’t reached us yet… it appears the Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome has also been conquered. Haise accomplished it alone.” “…I see…” Sasha clutched her chest, her face showing a mix of emotions. Reynold gave a wry smile, Piasora looked away indifferently, and Robin clasped her hands together, muttering, “Haise…” “Well, I’ll report this to the guild. Honestly… conquering the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, only for Haise to promptly leave the Dizarra Kingdom…” Incidentally, Shante seemed to be in tears handling the aftermath. However, the profits from selling the materials of the Yamata no Orochi alone were enough to fund the Dizarra Adventurers’ Guild for seventy years, causing quite the celebration. A massive renovation of the guild was also underway. “Well, we’ll probably see Haise at the guild tomorrow. Now then, Sasha… things are about to get busy.” “What?” “In your absence, we’ve received over five hundred applications to join the clan. Quite the feat.” “F-Five hundred…?” “Don’t slack off, got it? Listen, Sasha… Adventurer teams wanting to join the clan are its treasure. Back in my day, managing the clan meant I couldn’t go on proper adventures for years. But Sasha, you shine the most in dungeons and on adventures. That’s why I say this: don’t cut corners. Run the clan properly.” “Ibis-sama…” “You’ll be busy for a while. I’ll lend you some of our staff. Also, there’s a party at the royal castle in three days. Make sure to dress up.” With that, Ibis left. Reynold spoke up. “So, Haise conquered it too…” “Hmph. I don’t like it one bit.” “Come on now. Ibis-sama is reporting to the guild, right? By tomorrow, the whole kingdom will know about Haise.” Robin was right. The news of S-class adventurer Dark Stalker Haise conquering the Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome spread as an extra edition, reaching the entire kingdom. ◇◇◇◇◇◇ “Haise. Did you… skip reporting to the Dizarra Kingdom?” The adventurers’ guild. As soon as Haise entered, the rookie receptionist started making a commotion. By the time the guild's attention turned to Haise, Geist appeared and beckoned him into the Guild Master’s office. “Geist-san, it’s been a while, and the first thing you say is that?” “I’d praise you for your work, but Dizarra Kingdom wanted to invite you to a party as the adventurer who conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths.” “I’ll pass.” “Figured you’d say that. Apparently, Shante from the Dizarra guild told them you ‘returned to your homeland in Heiberg due to injuries.’” “…What kind of excuse is that?” “Also, the Clan Master of the Count of Monte Criste covered for your absence. Seriously… leaving without a word after clearing a Forbidden Labyrinth isn’t something people usually do.” “Ugh…” Geist’s scolding hit hard, as always. But then Geist smiled. “Still, you did well, Haise. I can’t believe… you conquered the Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome alone.” “…” Haise briefly recalled the Chaos Goblin. Teaming up with a beast to conquer the labyrinth? Explaining that sounded like too much trouble. But… he couldn’t lie to Geist. “I wasn’t alone.” “…What?” “There was someone else. If not for them, I might’ve died.” “…A companion?” “No. At first, it was an enemy. But it ended up tagging along.” “Huh?” Haise didn’t elaborate further, as explaining would’ve been too difficult. Just then, someone knocked on the door. It was the rookie receptionist—or rather, not so much a rookie after half a year—named Mina. “Excuse me!! Haise-san, the appraisal for that golden beast is done…” “Oh?” “Um… well, the materials are all unknown, and the price is astronomical… By the way, how much did Dizarra pay for their share?” “I donated it, so no idea.” “D-Donated…? Also, paying you for these materials would bankrupt the guild’s treasury. Actually, it’s still not enough…” “That snake’s worth that much? There are four heads left.” “Whaaa!?” After the Yamata no Orochi’s defeat, six heads remained. One was used as equipment by Choco Latte, two were destroyed, and the other five were salvaged. “Well, it’s been decided. The Heiberg Kingdom will purchase the materials instead. They plan to craft golden armor and a sword for the king.” “Do whatever you want.” “The payment will take a while, though…” “Fine.” “Also… you could live lavishly for twenty lifetimes with that money. Any plans for it?” “Not really.” “Then, treat me to dinner!! A special meal with an S-class adventurer—doesn’t that sound amazing? Oh, a date, a date!” “Geist-san, how about a drink tonight?” “Hey, ignoring me!? That’s so mean, Haise-san!!” “Alright, alright. Stop pulling my arm already.” Mina clung to Haise’s arm and dragged him away. Geist chuckled at the sight. “Geist-san, I was serious about that drink. Up for it? I’d rather not deal with just her.” “What!? You’re so mean, Haise-san!!” “Sure, I don’t mind. But Mina, if you’re aiming for a wealthy marriage, Haise isn’t your guy.” Haise glared at Mina, who instantly let go. “Oh, no way, of course not.” “Geist-san, let’s just go, the two of us.” “W-Wait! I’m sorry, okay!? Please don’t leave me out!!” Mina clung to Haise’s arm again, shaking him. Just then, someone knocked on the door. “Excuse me. Geist-san, S-class adventurer Brunhilde Sasha, reporting back… ah.” “…Yo.” It was Sasha. Behind her were Reynold, Tycoon, Piasora, and Robin. Haise raised a hand in greeting, Mina still clinging to his arm. Sasha glanced at Mina. “You seem close.” “Of course, we’re best buddies!!” “Shut up. Let go. Get back to work. Leave.” “Mean!! But I’ll go back to work~! See you tonight, Haise-san!!” Mina saluted and left the room. Sasha, seeing Haise after so long, spoke. “Six months… It’s been a while, Haise.” “Yeah.” Piasora smirked. “Hmm… A date with a girl right after coming back? You’re lively as ever.” “Piasora… you’re alive? I thought you’d died. You’re weak, after all.” “Whaaaat!? You jerk, how dare y—” “Piasora…” “Ugh…” “Sorry. I’m glad… you’re alive.” “Ah… Thanks.” Haise stood up. His eyes met Reynold’s. “Yo, Haise.” “Yeah, Reynold.” “…Your hair’s grown.” “Can’t cut it myself. I’ll get around to it.” “Alright. Hey, Sasha, mind cutting my hair again? Like you did in the dungeon?” “What? But you’d be better off with a barber.” “I like your work.” “…Fine, then.” “Thanks. Ah, sorry for interrupting your conversation.” “No worries. See you, Geist.” Haise turned to leave, but Robin grabbed his hand. “Haise, wait!!” “Huh? Robin?” “We’re throwing a party soon!! To celebrate conquering the Forbidden Six Labyrinth!! You have to come!!” “…What?” “Let’s celebrate together!! I really want you to be there!!” “…Even if you do, the others might not like it.” Reynold, Piasora, and Tycoon exchanged glances. Tycoon was holding something. “Huh? Tycoon… is that an ancient travelogue?” “───!? Haise, can you read this!?” “Uh, yeah. Why?” “Marvelous. Haise, I know you might have personal feelings, but would you teach me the ancient script? And tell me how you learned it? Of course, I’ll pay y—” “Hold on, hold on!! Calm down, Tycoon.” Reynold interrupted. He stood beside Sasha and spoke. “Sorry, Haise. We’ve got a report for Geist. Could you step out for a bit?” “…Got it.” “Ah…” Sasha reached out, but Haise had already left. Six months apart—a long enough time for their relationships to become strained once more.</p></p>
