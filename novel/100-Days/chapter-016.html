<p>Forest Kingdom Yggdrasil and the Sacred Great Tree 1<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Walking the road to the Forest Kingdom Yggdrasil, the closer he got, the more strange things Haise saw.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...What is that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From a slightly elevated spot, Haise saw the Forest Kingdom Yggdrasil.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And nearby, a giant tree that seemed large enough to cover an entire nation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was huge. A gigantic tree, one that might be a hundred years old, a thousand years, or even tens of thousands. Haise was astonished at the size of the tree, which seemed to reach the heavens.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't you know?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That’s Yggdrasil."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That name was one of the Four Great Clans.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yggdrasil, the forest kingdom home to many demi-human races, centered around elves.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea looked at Haise and spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Even S-rank adventurers like you, who are just starting out, don’t know it. The four S-rank adventurers who lead the Four Great Clans are called the Prime Four. The Yggdrasil Clan Master, the Infinite Ancient Tree Ibis, is a hero among the elves."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That tree is said to have been created by Ibis-sama’s abilities."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Seriously?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea spoke plainly, but her eyes sparkled with excitement.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, not particularly interested, muttered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The Four Great Clans, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Four Great Clans.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A clan is an organization that only S-rank adventurers can form, where they can have an adventurer team under their command. There are over a hundred clans in the world, but the Four Great Clans are the largest, each with a scale that rivals an entire nation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To the east, Yggdrasil, which has many demi-human members.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To the north, Fantastic Fantasia, which runs the largest pleasure district in the human world.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To the south, the Dwarven-run mining group, the King of the Cavern.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To the west, the Seifart Holy Knights, a human-only group whose members are skilled with swords and weaponry.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>These four are known as the Four Great Clans.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Sasha runs a clan of this size?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sasha?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s none of your business."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise took out a letter from his pocket.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist-san sure knows some impressive people..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He decided to enter Yggdrasil and head towards Yggdrasil.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the main gate, after showing his adventurer card (as expected, he was met with surprise), he entered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Instead of taking a request immediately, Haise decided to find an inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea also took the same inn, and the two of them walked into town.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I can guide you for a fee."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No need. I’ll just wander around and eat."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Right."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea didn’t seem to mind and silently walked beside Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As they left the inn, Haise immediately noticed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Still, elves... but that's no surprise. There are a lot of demi-humans."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yggdrasil is a nation of demi-humans, after all."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Elves were the most common.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There were also many beastmen, people with animal traits, and winged beings. Humans were the least numerous.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Most of the buildings were made of wood. The country was full of nature, and many rivers ran through it. Ferries could be seen transporting goods by boat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the center of the town stood high-class inns, restaurants, and the adventurer guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Since we’re here, let me just check for requests at the guild."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What's wrong?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nothing. I’ll wait here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly, Presea vanished from sight.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It seemed she hid herself using spirit magic.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise tilted his head but didn’t worry about it as he entered the adventurer’s guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside, the guild was crowded with elves and demi-human adventurers.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, look at that..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A human..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is he alone?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Just a kid."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is he solo?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As soon as they saw Haise, people started whispering.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignored them and headed to the reception counter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He showed the middle-aged receptionist the request from the Heiberg Kingdom and his adventurer card.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The receptionist, after checking, widened her eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A request from the Heiberg Kingdom?! And... an S-rank adventurer?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ll take the request starting tomorrow. Just handle the paperwork for me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-yes..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The guild buzzed with excitement at the mention of an S-rank adventurer.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Many of the eyes on Haise were skeptical, with some mocking and disdainful looks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Haise ignored them. He was used to these kinds of looks… however...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, hey, hey, an S-rank adventurer? A kid? Is that a fake card?!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A bovine beastman and his companions started laughing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise glanced at them, but that was all.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, what’s with that look, kid?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ha, a kid being an S-rank adventurer? Humans really don’t know what they’re looking at."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The receptionist returned after confirming the documents.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Your request has been accepted. Here’s the permit for entry to the Sacred Mountain Gagazia. Um... are you alone?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah... no, there’s one more person. She’s waiting outside."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I understand. If you show this permit, you can enter. The Sacred Mountain Gagazia can be accessed from the East Gate, so please greet Yggdrasil, who manages the gate, before you head there."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Greetings?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. Yggdrasil values greetings above all else."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, understood."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Kid, don’t ignore me!! —–H-hey, ggh!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly, the bovine beastman grabbed his throat and began choking, stumbling, and struggling.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise ignored it and walked past.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As the other beastmen tried to help their fallen companion, Haise left the guild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Presea appeared next to him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That was you, wasn’t it?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, yeah. I asked a spirit to choke him."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…So you were listening to the conversation?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. Thanks."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"For what?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"When they asked about the entry permit, you mentioned me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......Well, let’s eat. This place smells good... I feel like having something sweet."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s a random thought. Amitz Street has a lot of great dessert shops. It’s to the west from here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise walked toward the western street, with Presea walking beside him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That night.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was reading an ancient manuscript in his room.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......Hmm."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This manuscript was something he had picked up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But, for some reason, he felt a connection to it and couldn’t part with it. It felt like meeting it had been fate, and now, he carried it with him wherever he went.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He understood three pages. The pages contained the names and shapes of weapons.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The words written were in a language called Eigo from another world.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For some reason, Haise could understand a little of Eigo. He realized the person who wrote this manuscript had the same [Weapon Master] ability as him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───…!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Haise understood several more pages.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He decided to try using his abilities in his room, and successfully materialized a weapon. It seemed that by fully understanding the weapons of another world, he could materialize them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Let’s try shooting tomorrow... that’s fine for now."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tomorrow, he would head to the Sacred Mountain Gagazia.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There, there would be plenty of targets.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ll have to practice too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The first weapon Haise created was a grenade launcher.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Next, he materialized a Desert Eagle, followed by a rifle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He trained in shooting on his own and deepened his physical combat skills with Geist. Haise grew stronger.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise began fiddling with the new gun he had created.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next day.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After breakfast, Haise and Presea headed to the East Gate.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Incredible."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From the East Gate, the Great Tree of Yggdrasil came into view.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was so massive that Haise had to crane his neck to see the whole thing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He just noticed now—the East Gate was constructed to wrap around the giant tree.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Two elf guards stood near the gate.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise showed them his adventurer card and Geist’s letter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m Haise, an S-rank adventurer. I’m here on a request from the Heiberg Kingdom, heading to the Sacred Mountain Gagazia. Let me pass. Oh, and this—my acquaintance wanted your clan master to have it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>One of the elves checked the letter, his eyes widening, then quickly bowed repeatedly before disappearing into the guard post.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A few minutes later, an elderly elf hurriedly arrived, looking flustered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh my, oh my! To think you’re Geist-sama’s apprentice…! Apologies for keeping you waiting. Please, this way."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? No, wait. I just need to pass through. The letter is just to say, ‘Hey, my mentor knows your clan master, so let me through.’ That’s all."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"No, no, no! Please, right this way! The Clan Master is expecting you!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh… what?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This has turned into a bit of a hassle, Haise thought.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist had given him the letter, saying it "might be helpful," but Haise hadn’t expected to need any help.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He’d only meant to show it as a formality to proceed, but being summoned by the Clan Master was unexpected.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Please, please, come along!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Uh, okay. Fine, but I’ve got things to do, so five minutes, tops."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Pressed by the elderly elf’s insistent demeanor, Haise reluctantly agreed to follow.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...I’ll stay here."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea said, choosing not to go along.</p>
