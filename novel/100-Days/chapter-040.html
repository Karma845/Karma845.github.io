<p><p>Forbidden Six Labyrinths - Haise’s Journey 1 The desert nation of Dizarra. Blazing sunlight scorches by day, while nights chill to the bone. Fireplaces are a given in every home, where magic stones are burned for warmth. Haise took lodging in Dizarra and gathered information about Delmadrome, one of the Forbidden Labyrinths. He questioned adventurers and researched in the guild library. Ten days of investigation later, he compiled the information. “Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome. Rumor had it as a vast ruin in the desert… and that’s spot on.” To the south of Dizarra lies an enormous ruin in the heart of the desert. Once governed by a demon clan, it was the capital of a great nation. Its treasure vaults, said to hold unimaginable riches from the Demon Realm are rumored to be unparalleled. However, anyone who enters never returns. Even The Count of Monte Cristo's clan, led by their master, one of the Four Great Clans failed to conquer it and had to retreat. To date, The Count of Monte Cristo's clan remain the only team to ever withdraw alive. “I’d like to talk to The Count of Monte Cristo’s master, but…” Haise had already sent a request through the guild to meet the The Count of Monte Cristo’s master upon arriving in Dizarra. Yet, ten days later, there was no response. Haise felt it was time to move on. Gazing out the window, he admired the radiant night sky. As he opened the window, a cold breeze entered the room, causing the fire in the hearth to waver. ◇◇◇◇◇◇ The next day. Haise headed to the Adventurer’s Guild, where the guild master, former S-rank adventurer Chante of the Frost, stood in the center. “You’re here, Haise.” “Uh… yes.” Chante of the Frost. A 29-year-old with ice abilities, she retired from adventuring four years ago to focus on “finding a husband,” earning her a peculiar reputation. She’s often called the “Proposal Chante,” due to her habit of proposing to skilled S-rank adventurers, only to be rejected. Her long, light blue ponytail, sun-kissed complexion, and toned physique make her undeniably attractive. Her full lips only add to her allure. As Chante walked, adventurers cleared the way. At 29, she was at the peak age for adventurers. A time when experience and skill align. Despite her retirement she was undoubtedly in prime condition as an adventurer. “I’ve made contact with the The Count of Monte Cristo’s master. They’re willing to meet you.” “Really?!” “Yeah. Do you know where their clan is?” “Um…” “Figures. I’ll guide you!” “Huh?” Chante grabbed Haise’s shoulder firmly. Nearby adventurers began whispering. “Hey, is it true the Guild Master’s after the The Count of Monte Cristo’s master?” “Looks like it. An S-rank adventurer rarely needs to meet them. She wouldn’t miss a golden chance like this.” “She’s not just Proposal Chante—she’s Hyena Chante too, huh?” The next moment—sharp ice pillars shot up with a crack! Their tips stopped just short of the two gossiping adventurers’ throats. Chante, smiling sweetly, spoke. “Did you say something?” “N-No! We’re sorry!!” The adventurers retreated, bowing deeply. Even Haise felt chills. The shoulder Chante gripped had frosted slightly. “Well, let’s go.” “Y-Yes, please…” Haise resolved to never anger Chante. ◇◇◇◇◇◇ The desert nation of Dizarra. In one corner of the royal capital is the Smithing District where dwarves who make their living as blacksmiths reside. Everyone in this district is a dwarf and an adventurer. In fact, the entire district is home to the The Count of Monte Cristo’s clan. “They made an entire district their clan’s base…” “Technically, Dizarra Kingdom incorporated The Count of Monte Cristo’s clan. A few centuries ago, there wasn’t even a Smithing District in Dizarra Kingdom.” “Huh…” The clang of hammers and iron resounded. Craftsmen bustled about, with workshops, weapon shops, and taverns scattered everywhere. Haise and Chante headed to the district’s oldest and largest building. An ancient sign read Balgan Workshop. “So this is it…” “Let’s go.” “Right.” Chante banged on the door and pushed it open. A wave of heat blasted out, but Chante raised her hand, emitting frost to counter it. Inside, in the forge, stood a man. “Balgan. This one wants to talk to you.” “…” Balgan. Standing two meters tall and weighing well over 100 kilos. His body was muscular, scarred, and his face bore a slash that destroyed one eye. His fiery red hair stood on end, and his single remaining eye glared at Haise. “What do you want?” Straight to the point. His voice was deep and gruff. Behind him, the furnace flames burned yellow, the heat almost unbearable. Yet, Balgan didn’t sweat or seem to notice. Haise had heard he was a dwarf, but he had never seen a dwarf over two meters tall. “I want to hear about your attempt at the Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome.” “Leave.” “…What?” “A kid like you wouldn’t understand.” “…” With that, Balgan turned his back on Haise. “H-Hey, Balgan! Listen to him!” “I don’t waste words on kids. I heard you stopped a Stampede, but… you’re just a brat.” “…Is that so?” Haise turned to leave. “Chante-san, let’s go.” “H-Haise? Are you sure?” “Yes. On second thought, there’s no point in hearing from a coward who fled the dungeon.” “…What?” “I’m heading to the Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome tomorrow. Sorry for wasting your time. Truly, it was a waste of effort.” “You little punk… what did you just say?” “Shut it, coward. Your stories are worthless to me.” “This brat…” Balgan stood, grabbing a hammer nearby. Haise drew his Desert Eagle and fired, shattering the hammer’s wooden handle. “Don’t waste any more of my time. You’re nothing like Ibis, who treated me with respect. I’ve no need to listen to a man who labels me a child from the start.” With that, Haise left the forge. ◇◇◇◇◇◇ “I’m sorry…” “No, it’s fine.” On the way back, Haise apologized to Chante. She’d gone through the trouble of setting up the meeting, only for him to ruin it. If Haise belonged to a clan, this would have been a major issue but as a free agent, he narrowly avoided trouble. “Don’t misunderstand. Balgan knows… how terrifying the Forbidden Labyrinths are. That’s why he pushed you away.” “Felt more like he just dismissed me as a kid.” Haise took a deep breath, calming his anger. “Tomorrow, I’ll challenge the Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome.” “…It’ll take time. Balgan’s team didn’t emerge from the labyrinth for four months.” “I’ll be fine.” He had plenty of supplies. One of the Forbidden Labyrinths, the Infinite Labyrinth of Delmadrome… Haise was ready to pursue his dream.</p></p>
