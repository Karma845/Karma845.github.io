<p>The Time That Won’t Return<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A night when stars twinkle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Geist stood side by side, gazing at the sky, and Geist spoke.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Sasha and the others didn’t know. They had just returned from the Ohara Kingdom and didn’t know that the Black Ancient Dragon used that swamp as its bathing spot.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...You can’t forgive them, can you?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No. After all that, they didn’t even apologize, and it seemed like they had no intention of dealing with me. Maybe they were afraid of me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Could be. Or maybe they were too busy or didn’t know how to face you.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ve grown stronger now. So strong that I don’t need comrades anymore.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...That’s a lonely path.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It feels just fine.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise smiled.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Indeed, after slaying the Black Ancient Dragon, Haise had become incredibly powerful.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He had conquered numerous dungeons, wielding a mysterious weapon called a Weaponto to take down all sorts of dangerous beasts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The weapon, apparently from another world, was beyond Geist’s understanding. But he could see that chunks of metal or explosive projectiles were being launched at high speeds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Well, I doubt we’ll cross paths again. They’ll probably be busy establishing their clan.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“And you?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll continue taking on requests and honing myself. That ancient manuscript... I still haven’t fully deciphered it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I see…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’ll head back for today. See you…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise bowed lightly and left the terrace.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The party venue was still lively… but Haise didn’t return and left the castle.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Loosening his collar, he walked while gazing at the sky, rubbing his right eye.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…It’s just like that night.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After slaying the Black Ancient Dragon, Haise reportedly dragged the dragon’s carcass back to the capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To be honest, he didn’t remember much of it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then he had confronted Sasha for her betrayal, and before he realized it, ten days had passed. Apparently, he had lost consciousness, and Sasha and her group had already left the capital.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No apology. No explanation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After that, Haise became astoundingly strong at a terrifying pace. Using otherworldly weapons like guns and explosives, he defeated countless monsters.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By the time he had taken down two calamity-class danger beasts, he was promoted to A-rank.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By then, the rumors tarnishing Haise’s reputation had vanished, replaced by admiration and offers to join forces.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise rejected all of them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He could no longer trust anyone as a comrade.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He had encountered Sasha and the others a few times afterward, but… there were no apologies, only brief greetings.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It would likely remain that way.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha would gather comrades and aim to establish a clan rivaling the Four Great Clans.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Together, they would challenge the “Unsolvable Dungeons” of this world, the ForbiddenSix Labyrinths.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There were even rumors that she and Reynold were getting along. In ten years, she might retire as an adventurer, marry, and have children… None of it had anything to do with Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Hmm?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On the road leading to the castle’s main gate, someone stood there.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A girl with beautiful hair that glittered under the moonlight.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His childhood friend, once an S-rank adventurer alongside him, is now someone entirely unrelated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What do you want?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise remained wary.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He scanned the surroundings for any signs of Tycoon’s magic or Robin’s sniping.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold might be lurking nearby to protect Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The only one who knew the full extent of Haise’s abilities was Geist, but rumors must have spread.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As Haise calculated whether Reynold could block a grenade launcher’s blast and considered other tactics—<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m alone here.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“And I’m supposed to believe that?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…I doubt you will.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Exactly.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Naturally, he didn’t lower his guard.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha spread her arms wide.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I just want to talk. Please… trust me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Trust you? You tried to kill me. You sent me to that swamp knowing a Black Ancient Dragon would kill me, didn’t you? You couldn’t stand having someone like me on your team, so you planned to get rid of me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That’s not true. I… we really didn’t know.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…And? What do you want?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“To apologize.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Hah… haha… hahahaha! Now? You think I’d spread rumors about you? About how the great S-rank adventurer Sasha tried to kill her teammate Haise by sending him to a black Ancient Dragon’slair? Scary, huh? If the current me, an S-rank adventurer, said that, people might believe it, you know? It might even tarnish your reputation a bit.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I don’t care. You have every right to say it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Don’t mess with me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“‘The right to say it,’ huh? Now, of all times? You think now I have that right? Don’t screw with me! Why apologize now? Why didn’t you do it that day? Was it because I was unconscious? Did you cry and apologize at my bedside? You didn’t, did you? Geist told me—you left for a mission in the Eastern Kingdom the very next day! You never intended to apologize!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I don’t need a hollow apology. Your words mean nothing to me.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Haise…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise began to walk past her. But Sasha grabbed his sleeve.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I’m sorry… I was scared all this time.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I thought casting you out would be better for you. I thought if I achieved our dream on my own, you’d understand…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s meaningless.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What…?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Our dream was ours, but if you achieve it alone, it’s just yours. Don’t use me as an excuse.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“My dream has changed. I’ll become the strongest on my own. I won’t abandon anyone like you did. If I must, I’d rather not have comrades to begin with.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tears streamed down Sasha’s face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise didn’t stop.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“No matter the reason, Sasha… you abandoned me. You abandoned our dream. Never forget that. Your goal of building the strongest team is your decision. And I… have no place in it.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Congratulations on becoming an S-rank adventurer. Goodbye.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Ah…”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her hand slipped from his sleeve.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But she reached out again, gripping it tightly. She felt that if she let go, she’d lose him forever.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“What now? Ha! Are you offering yourself as a bed partner now? The illustrious S-rank adventurer, Brunhilde-sama?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…If that’s what you want.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Don’t disappoint me any further. Right now… you’re pathetic.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Shaking off her hand, Haise vanished into the darkness.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Back at the inn, Haise shed his formal attire and collapsed onto the bed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The creaky sounds of the bed echoed unpleasantly, but as always, he was the only guest, so it didn’t matter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Pathetic, huh. Heh… I guess I’m just a kid too.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There was no going back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They were no longer just childhood friends. They were both S-rank adventurers now.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise removed his eyepatch and gently touched his scarred skin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Might as well head to Everlasting Moon Flower tomorrow.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The sacred Mount Gagazia lay to the east, its entrance in the Forest Kingdom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mentally mapping his route to the Eastern Kingdom, Haise drifted off to sleep.</p>
