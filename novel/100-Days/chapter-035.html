<p>Stampede Battle 3<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Heiberg Kingdom, the royal capital, was shrouded in silence.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Naturally, the residents who should have been present were all ordered to stay at home, while adventurers patrolled the capital to confirm that no one lingered in the streets.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a large number of adventurers gathered in front of the main gate of the kingdom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They were preparing to face the incoming horde of magical beasts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha stood quietly in front of the main gate.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“………”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“It’s quiet, Sasha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold murmured beside Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Equipped with shields of differing sizes in both hands, Reynold glanced at Sasha’s profile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before any major battle, Sasha always maintained a wordless focus.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After this mental preparation, Sasha never lost to any foe.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Let’s win, Sasha.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Yeah.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hey, when this fight’s over… how about we grab something good to eat?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Hmm… sounds good.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“And, well… I know a nice place. How about some fine wine?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Yeah. Let’s do that.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“…Alright!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold laughed, and Sasha smiled too.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha scanned the surroundings.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Many adventurers gripped their weapons, gazing firmly ahead.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Stampede battle. Estimated enemy count: 70,000 magical beasts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>All of them were charging straight at the main gate of Heiberg Kingdom.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The magical beasts spilling out of the dungeon were known as "Stampede Beasts", and each of them boasted strength above the extermination rating.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Nearly all had lost their rationality, relentlessly charging forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They trampled over towns and villages in their path.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If all 70,000 reached the Heiberg Kingdom, it would become nothing more than a ruin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus, they absolutely had to stop them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly—a hawk soaring above Sasha and the others let out a cry.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Stampede Beasts sighted!! Distance, approximately five kilometers!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This was a familiar controlled through a special ability.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then another hawk cried out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Long-range attack squad, prepare to fire!! Begin the attack once they cross the designated line.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Do not let a single Stampede Beast into the capital!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was Geist's voice.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist, the commander-in-chief, issued orders through the hawks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist continued.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[The vanguard will be led by Dark Stalker Haise. Observe…You’ll understand why Haise insisted on taking the lead.]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“...Haise?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha frowned at the unfamiliar name.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“H-Hey!?”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Leaving Reynold behind, she climbed a nearby hill for a better view beyond the main gate.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On the plains stretching out from the Heiberg Kingdom, Haise stood alone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ahead of the long-range attack squad and the frontline forces where Sasha stood.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stood by himself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The vanguard forces gazed at Haise’s back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Tch, Geist… he didn’t have to say all that.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise smirked bitterly, enduring the weight of countless eyes on his back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The vibrations of the ground grew stronger.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The horde of magical beasts was approaching.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Stampede Beasts. Relentlessly charging forward, leaving nothing behind after their passing.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise muttered quietly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Charging forward without looking back, huh… kinda enviable.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They ran without turning back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For Haise, who thought he’d left his past behind, only to feel its weight anew, that single-minded determination was enviable.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Although he chose to fight alone, he felt a twinge of unease.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Standing alone at the forefront, he now fully grasped the terror of his decision.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise turned his head slightly to glance back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And he saw her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“………”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“………”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There she stood, Sasha, at the front of the vanguard.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The silver-haired girl gazed straight at Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Receiving her unwavering gaze, Haise felt a swell of pride.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And, before he knew it, his fear vanished.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Heh...”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a smirk, he spread his arms wide.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Using his ability, [Weapon Master], two massive, rectangular tubes appeared in his hands, positioned to rest on his shoulders.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the same time, the horde came into view.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The ground quaked.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The army of 70,000 drew near.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise aimed the massive tubes at the Stampede Beasts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A hawk above cried out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[We’re counting on you, Haise!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Let’s do thisssssss!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The tubes fired M74 incendiary rockets.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The weapon in Haise’s hands was the M202 FLASH rocket launcher.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Eight rockets flew toward the horde, scattering and exploding on impact.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Orcs, ogres, and ape-like beasts were launched into the air, their bodies torn apart, flesh flying in all directions.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Over 200 beasts were obliterated by the eight rockets.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise discarded the rocket launcher and summoned new weapons in his hands.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Take thisssssssss!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>M134 Gatling Gun.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Originally mounted on "fighter jets," these enormous weapons had been modified for handheld use.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Capable of firing 4,000 rounds per minute, the guns roared in Haise’s arms.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The absurd hail of 8,000 bullets per minute shredded the incoming beasts into mince.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Uoooooooh!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ratatatatatatatatata!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Empty shells piled up like mountains beside Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Alone, he slew over 1,000 beasts.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The incredible display left Geist speechless.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The vanguard forces behind Haise stared in shock.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even Sasha was astounded.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“That… that’s Haise’s ‘ability’.”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When the Gatling guns ran out of ammo, Haise discarded them and alternated between the rocket launcher and Gatling guns, unleashing relentless firepower to decimate the horde.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But—even Haise couldn’t do it alone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When the body count approached 2,000, the beasts entered the long-range squad’s attack range.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Geist!!”<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise yelled, tossing the rocket launcher aside as he retreated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He fired warning shots with an M4 Carbine in hand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist roared out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Commence long-range attack!!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Empowered arrows and magic spells rained down, and the battle against the Stampede Beasts escalated.</p>
