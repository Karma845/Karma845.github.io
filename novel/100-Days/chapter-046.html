<p>Forbidden Sixth Labyrinths - Haise’s Journey 4<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seventy days had passed since Haise entered the Infinite Labyrinth of Dermadrome.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……Tch."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He threw aside his empty assault rifle, which disintegrated into particles.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Immediately readying his grenade launcher, he fired at the SS-rate magical beast Iaia-Hastur, a massive jellyfish-like creature riddled with holes, that fell to the ground.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its viscous bodily fluids, not blood, dripped from its wounds as Haise launched a grenade.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With a loud explosion, Iaia-Hastur was obliterated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh… ouch."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise rubbed his eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The jellyfish hadn’t injured him; it was his overgrown bangs irritating his eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His hair and beard had grown considerably.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even his jet-black coat, crafted from dragon materials, remained undamaged but was now stained with grime.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seventy days.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Relentless progress without a single day's rest.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise crafted two shotguns, slinging one over his shoulder and gripping the other in his right hand as he resumed walking.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Seventy days today, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He pulled out a wooden tag from his pocket.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Each day, he etched a mark. Fourteen sets of “正” indicated seventy days had passed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The depths of Dermadrome’s labyrinth were still out of sight.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What once felt like strolling through a city now had Haise traversing a vast, high-ceilinged corridor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Having descended over 500 floors, Haise had learned a few things.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Five hundred and twenty… getting close, huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Every five floors, he found what resembled a "rest hut".<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A sturdy, square building with one window and one door, indestructible even with Haise's weapons. Inscribed on it in Isekai characters was the word “Container”.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside, it was empty.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, magical beasts ignored it entirely, passing by without entering.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While he couldn’t make a campfire inside, Haise’s well-equipped camping gear made it a minor issue.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As he progressed to the next floor, he finally saw it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"There it is."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A brick-colored, square container.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Entering it, Haise stretched deeply.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He set up a tent, chair, table, and lamp. Then, for the first time in seventy days, he retrieved the mirror he had brought.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Whoa, my hair’s gotten long…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His hair and beard had grown wild.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise chuckled wryly and began shaving with a knife.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He haphazardly trimmed his bangs and tied the back of his hair with a string, unwilling to risk cutting it and accidentally injuring himself.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After a brief pause, he made up his mind.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise decided.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>First, he unpacked seventy days' worth of underwear and clothes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Using one barrel, he started washing them.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Today’s a rest day! The journey’s far from over, and I need to get organized!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seventy pairs of underwear, seventy shirts, seventy pairs of socks… an overwhelming amount.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He set up poles outside, threaded them with lines, and hung everything to dry. Half the day passed just doing that.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With leftover barrel water, he boiled a large amount of hot water and filled the barrel again, creating a makeshift bath.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Stripping down, he plunged into the barrel.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ahhh… this feels amazing."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Though magical beasts lurked outside, the relief outweighed the risk.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After seventy days in the dungeon, even Haise needed stress relief.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Merely wiping himself clean didn’t compare to this sensation.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"……"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Feeling relaxed, his thoughts wandered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…I wonder if she’s mad at me."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The first person to come to mind was Presea.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To Haise, Presea was a "mystifying elf".<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Why did she follow him? What about him interested her? He didn’t understand.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Still… sharing meals with her wasn’t unpleasant.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Next, he thought of Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The Great Salt Lake of Dilolomans, wasn’t it? She should’ve entered it by now. How far has she progressed? Reynold’s group is with her, so they should be fine, but…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She might have even surpassed him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Shaking his head vigorously, Haise splashed water onto his face.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He scrubbed his hair until the water turned black with grime.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After drying off in the container, donning fresh underwear, and lying in his tent, exhaustion overtook him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…Well, for now, it’s all about clearing the dungeon."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise closed his eyes and slept soundly for about ten hours.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When he woke, his body felt lighter, and his mind was refreshed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Stepping outside the container, he gathered the laundry, folded it neatly, and stored it in his item box.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After a breakfast of vegetable sandwiches and some light stretches, Haise felt rejuvenated.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright! Let’s keep moving!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Leaving the container, he pressed onward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The path looked as monotonous as ever, but Haise didn’t stop.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Armed with an assault rifle, he descended further.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise remained unaware—he was the first adventurer to reach the 550th floor of Dermadrome’s labyrinth.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ten days later, he arrived at the 600th floor… where the scenery completely changed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh…?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Upon exiting the rest floor into the 601st level, he was stunned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before him lay a residential area.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The houses were built in an unfamiliar style, but Haise somehow understood they belonged to the Isekai people.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Simple two-story homes, single-story houses, garages for vehicles, doghouses, paved roads, utility poles, and even motorcycles.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise pulled out an ancient text and flipped through its pages.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There, Nobunaga had drawn a sketch with accompanying notes:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[My homeland looked something like this. Roads lined with houses, garages, utility poles, family cars, and motorcycles… ordinary Japanese neighborhoods. There were also apartments and condos. I don’t remember it well anymore, but I miss it…]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was convinced.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Dermadrome labyrinth—this place—was:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Could this be… Isekai?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Nobunaga was a person from Isekai.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Perhaps this entire area had been transported from Isekai.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise shook his head.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ridiculous. Makes no sense… This is the Dermadrome labyrinth, one of the Forbidden Six."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Approaching a relatively new car, Haise peered inside.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ugh…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside was a skeleton seated in the driver’s seat, wearing a shirt with a chest pocket.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Noticing something in the pocket, Haise reached through the half-open window and retrieved a leather case.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside was a card.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Driver’s… license? This picture… is it this skeleton?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A "highly detailed drawing" of a young man was printed on the card.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thanks to his study of ancient texts, Haise could decipher it somewhat.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"‘Wada Yuji’… Is this his name? Cause of death… there’s a hole in his shirt. The windshield’s also pierced, so something must’ve struck his chest and killed him."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Glancing into the backseat, Haise spotted a slender metal rod.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then… his eyes narrowed sharply.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Raising his assault rifle, Haise turned forward.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On the rooftops of the houses, a group of figures awaited.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They were humanoid goblins… the apex of goblin-type magical beasts: Chaos Goblins.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[Heh heh heh, a fresh morsel at last—!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bang!<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A Chaos Goblin’s head exploded, leaving the rest stunned.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise was already firing his assault rifle in a frenzy, slaughtering them one after another.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Magical beasts could talk?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Why were they here?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Did they have anything to do with the skeleton?<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise didn’t care.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His only goal was clearing the dungeon—nothing else mattered.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Within two minutes, the Chaos Goblins were nearly wiped out.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Only one, missing its right arm, scrambled backward in fear.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise aimed his Desert Eagle at it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[W-wait! Listen to me, adventurer!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don’t care about anything but clearing this place."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[I have information! Listen to me!]<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"…"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Lowering his pistol, Haise stared at the Chaos Goblin, which trembled violently.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It couldn’t believe such a human had appeared in their hunting ground.</p>
