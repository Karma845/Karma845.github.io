<p>Arrival<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and the others finally enter the road where the Holy Cross Adramelech Divine Kingdom comes into view.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina opens the window of the carriage, sticks her face out, and exclaims, "Whoa~!" in amazement.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is that the Holy Cross Adramelech Divine Kingdom?! Mmm~, just like the rumors say, it's a huge cross!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A cross?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What's that?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Hijiri tilt their heads in confusion as they look at each other.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise opens another window to observe the outside, and Hijiri forcibly shoves her face into the window Haise opened. Their bodies press close, and Hijiri's unexpectedly large chest squishes against him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Wow, so that's what a cross is!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"H-hey, get off me!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Relax, it's fine... Whoa!?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, Hijiri disappears.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha pulls Hijiri's arm, dragging her to her side, and opens her own window.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This one's open too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Y-you're kinda scary, you know... okay, okay."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise looks out the window.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A large cross... a pure white cross is visible. It doesn't stand within the kingdom but outside of it. The material it's made of and why it stands there are unknown.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And then, the Holy Cross Adramelech Divine Kingdom. Even from a distance, you can see several slender buildings. The largest one is likely the Cathedral, where the Leader resides.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise closes the window and returns to Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"So that's the Holy Cross Adramelech Divine Kingdom... What about that huge cross?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's the 'Graveyard of Ruin.' The cross is a 'barrier' created by the priests of Adramelech using their abilities. It prevents demonic beasts from invading the town."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's also a graveyard, and you can go as far as the deepest part before it becomes a dungeon. However, no one seems to venture into the deepest part, the SSS-class dungeon Graveyard of Ruin."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"In the deepest part, there's information about the Forbidden Six Labyrinths..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise gazes at the cross.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The Holy Cross Adramelech Divine Kingdom isn't ruled by a monarchy but by the Supreme Leader and the Twelve Priests, a group of twelve priests. The Seifert Knights of Crossford are also based in that country."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Not four, but five great clans..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Well, don't worry about the politics. Barbaros also said he'd get us permission to enter the Graveyard by the time we finish our temporary instructor duties."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Understood."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise sinks deeply into the driver's seat and stares at the cross once more.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Perhaps bored by the scenery, Hijiri pulls her face back inside.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Sasha sticks her head out next, she indeed sees the large cross.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But what catches her attention more than the cross isn't the scenery.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Over there, the Seifert Knights... I wonder if we can go greet them."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The clan of Crossford, the Sword Saint, whom all sword-wielding ability users once aspire to join.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha, too, once aimed for it. But... she chose to create her own clan rather than join someone else's. Still, the admiration remains.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is there somewhere you want to go?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? Oh, yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea, who had been sleeping, wakes up.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha pulls her face back in and speaks to Presea, who sits beside her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"The Seifert Knights... the pinnacle of sword-wielding clans."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don't you have anything you want to do?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Not really. Well, the town looks pretty, so maybe some sightseeing."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, want to hang out together?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eat some good food, explore the town, do some shopping. Sounds fun, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...With me?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. I kinda like you, you know."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Eh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha is surprised.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She never expected Presea to say something like that.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then Hijiri forces herself between the two.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, if you're talking about something fun, count me in!! What, what? Going to eat something delicious?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. You're a bit noisy, but you're just right for us."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I don't get it, but if there's food, I'm in!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Suddenly, Sasha thinks.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...It's like we're friends."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh? Aren't we? Sasha and I are friends, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Eh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Friends, huh. Well, that kind of relationship is fine too."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Friends.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reynold and Piasola are 'comrades.' The clan members are also comrades... but the concept of 'friends' is fresh and new to Sasha.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her heart pounds, and her face turns red.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"F-friends..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Why are you turning red?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Fufu... How cute, miss."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Guh, I-I'm not red!! Ugh, stop teasing me!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This looks fun!! Let me join too!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina joins in, and the carriage becomes noisy.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Arriving at the main gate, Geist hands a document to the gatekeeper and shows his adventurer card for Girmas.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then the carriage sets off, moving through the town.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It's a beautiful town..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. How should I put it... it's white."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise speaks, and Sasha responds.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Most of the buildings are white-themed. White bricks, white street lamps, white fountains—white makes up about sixty percent of the town's color palette.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even the townspeople wear mostly white clothes. Though adventurers, of course, don't seem to care much about the color.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina grins and says.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"With all this white, it'll be easy to spot Haise-san."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise is all black. His coat, boots, hair, and eyepatch are all black.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sasha bursts out laughing, and Haise glares at her.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"S-sorry. Fufu..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Do you even know what you're apologizing for?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then, the carriage stops.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist gets off the carriage and addresses everyone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We'll be staying at this inn for a while starting today. Let's go."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As they step off the carriage, the inn's staff takes it to the back.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and the others look up at the inn. It looks like a pure white 'fortress,' a magnificent brick building.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Its height alone makes it clear that it's a high-class inn.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Looks expensive..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Whoa!! I can't believe we're staying at a place like this!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise, who isn't fond of high-class inns, and Mina, a commoner, have completely opposite reactions.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inside, they're greeted by a spacious entrance hall. The staff are all in white uniforms, and the hall is adorned with chandeliers and luxurious sofas. Nobles and ladies reading newspapers are seated here and there.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist checks them in and hands out room keys.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The keys are silver with intricate designs. And each person gets one.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Rooms are on the second floor. You can eat out or use the restaurant in the basement. If you need anything, buy it at the shop or in town. The guild covers the inn fees, but meals outside and supplies are on you. Oh, meals at the inn's restaurant are covered by the guild. The lectures at Adad start in ten days, and we'll go greet them three days before. Starting today, you have seven days of free time. Any questions?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No questions.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Starting today, they have seven days of free time.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise is about to head to his room when...<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Alright!! Sasha, Presea, Mina, let's go eat!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, yeah. Sounds good."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yay!!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Since all their luggage is in their item boxes, the four girls head off to eat without even going to their rooms.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise is a little surprised.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"When did they get so close?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Fufu, you're such a worrywart, but I wasn't watching. That's so like you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Huh?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Haise. How about just the two of us grab some food and drinks?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, sounds good. We had some drinks in towns along the way, but they were all noisy with everyone around."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise and Geist also leave the inn without going to their rooms.</p>
