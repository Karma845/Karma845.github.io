<p>Awkwardness<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sigh..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise-san, you don't seem too lively today."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hmm, perhaps it's because he met Sasha earlier."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In a tavern in the castle town, a favorite spot of Geist.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>They rented a private room, ordered drinks, and toasted. Haise let out a deep sigh.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina poked at Haise’s arm repeatedly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Even though you met Sasha after such a long time, you two seemed... off."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Good grief. Even though you're an adventurer who conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths, you're still just a 17-year-old kid."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......Ugh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist sipped his ale and bit into a skewer of grilled chicken.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina opened the door of the private room, raised her mug, and called out to a server:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Excuse me! More drinks, please!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise stabbed a piece of stewed meat with a fork and put it into his mouth.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"We parted normally before the journey. We agreed to meet as adventurers who had conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths... but when we met after half a year, I couldn't say anything."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, I see. Oh, I’ll take a skewer... munch munch... excuse me! More skewers, please! I kind of get it now."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mina munched on a skewer and then pointed it at Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"To put it simply, you're embarrassed, Haise-san!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I've felt the same way before. You see, I’m from a farming village west of the royal capital. I have a childhood friend there. When I got accepted to be a guild receptionist in the royal capital, he was so happy for me. But after six months as a receptionist, I went back on vacation, and that childhood friend was so awkward and fidgety—it was gross. I think it’s because he suddenly saw me as a 'beautiful girl' and got that adolescent fear of talking to girls."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Geist-san, should I order another round for you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Sure."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, don’t ignore me!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Regardless of Mina’s opinion, it was true that interacting with Sasha felt difficult.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She and her group had tricked Haise, nearly costing him his life.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even after learning the truth, accepting Sasha’s apology, and knowing it wasn’t intentional, the fact remained that he’d been betrayed and almost killed. Forgiving her easily was impossible.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>No matter how they reconciled, Haise’s lost right eye would never return.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Still, Haise acknowledged Sasha as an adventurer and as a 'comrade' chasing their respective dreams.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yet... after half a year, when they greeted each other again, his voice wouldn't come out naturally.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It seemed Sasha felt the same.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Yes?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You and Sasha are really clumsy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Is it so hard to honestly acknowledge each other?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ha... do as you like. I won’t meddle in your and Sasha’s matters anymore."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"True, you two have been through a lot. From leaving the countryside together, becoming adventurers under my training, forming a team, and gradually drifting apart to a decisive breakup. You rejected Sasha, and she, consumed by guilt, couldn’t figure out how to approach you. But little by little, you’ve started closing the distance again... perhaps because you've both conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths and now stand as equals."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist looked at Haise with fatherly eyes.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>More skewers arrived, and Mina eagerly ate while Geist reached for one too.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But... others won't see it that way."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Others...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You're both 17, still growing. Sasha will likely encounter new opportunities for relationships. So will you."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...Me too?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. People won’t leave you or Sasha alone. If you keep your relationship undefined, the distance between you might naturally grow. Haise, what do you want with Sasha? Do you want to return to being childhood friends?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"That's impossible. I’ve already severed ties with her. Now, the only connection between us is as comrades who conquered the Forbidden Six Labyrinths."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Then, that’s fine."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...What?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"If that’s the relationship you want with Sasha, so be it. No matter how Sasha feels when approaching you, you should walk with her at your own pace."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist’s words left Haise conflicted.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He felt a strange mixture of clarity and uncertainty.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When they left the tavern, Mina excitedly suggested, "Second round! Let’s go to a second place!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Geist, however, reminded her, "You’ve got work tomorrow," and escorted her home.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise wandered through the nighttime castle town alone.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Although he could’ve returned to the inn, he felt like drinking more, so he decided to find a quiet bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......Oh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On his way to the inn, Haise noticed a small bar.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A sign with a coiled snake design hung outside. The building was made of brick, with a sturdy-looking door.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When Haise opened the door, a woman behind the counter smiled warmly.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Welcome."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Please take a seat at the counter."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The young woman appeared to be the bartender.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The interior was smaller than Haise expected—just four counter seats and two two-person tables.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Behind the bartender was a large tank filled with water where a light blue snake swam gracefully.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Next to the tank was a shelf stocked with various liquors.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What's the matter? You’re a customer, aren’t you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, yeah..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise sat at the counter.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The bartender placed a transparent dish of cooked beans and a small wine glass in front of him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A welcome drink. This is 140-year-old Snake Blood."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s wine. Not a fan?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Well, I’m not good with strong drinks..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It’s fine. Think of it as juice for a welcome."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Encouraged, Haise took a sip of the wine.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"───...!"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was sweet and refreshingly smooth.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The beans, when paired with the wine, created a dessert-like flavor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The bartender smiled at his reaction.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Tasty, right?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah. Amazing... I can’t believe I never noticed this place."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Really? It’s right on your way, though."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...On my way?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Heh. I know who you are. You’re the S-class adventurer staying with Hohenheim, aren’t you?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hohenheim.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise recognized the name of the shabby innkeeper.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nice to meet you. I’m Helmine, the master of Bloodstark Bar. As you can see, I’m a half-Naga, half-Succubus."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The bartender introduced herself with a charming smile.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>◇◇◇◇◇<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Helmine.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She had long black wavy hair tied up with an elegant hairpin.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her features were undeniably beautiful, likely in her early twenties.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Being half-Naga and half-Succubus, she explained, meant inheriting traits from both races.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Nagas had snake-like lower bodies, while Succubi were women with bat wings and tails. Both were rare races akin to Elves or Dwarves.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Helmine rolled up her sleeves.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Don’t worry. I only inherited a small patch of scales on my arms from my Naga father. My lower body is human. As for my Succubus side, I didn’t get wings or a tail. And I eat normal food, not life energy."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Ah, I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In other words, she appeared mostly human.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Pleased with her explanation, Helmine asked Haise:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What will you have?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Something light. Your choice."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Got it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Just then, the bar door opened.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To Haise’s surprise, Presea walked in.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seeing him, her eyes widened.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Haise, what are you doing here?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Oh, Presea, you know each other?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. Helmine, I’ll have something to eat."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Got it."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea sat next to Haise, glaring at him.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Leaving without waiting for me? That’s harsh."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, I never promised to wait."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A triangular glass filled with clear fruit wine and a cherry appeared in front of Haise.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re a regular here?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>He sipped the wine.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was sweet with a faint tartness. As he drank, a dish of salted fish was served.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes. I like Helmine’s cooking. I didn’t expect to see you here, though."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It was just convenient on my way back."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I see."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Presea received a salad platter and a meat sandwich.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Hey, Haise."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yeah?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’ve heard incredible stories about you in the desert kingdom. Conquering the Forbidden Six Labyrinths alone..."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"......Well, yeah."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"You’re really amazing."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"What’s with the sudden praise?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Nothing. Oh, right... are you attending the party in the Heiberg Kingdom?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Party?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Yes, to celebrate conquering the Forbidden Six Labyrinths."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"I’m not going."<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"But the guild master in the desert kingdom said, 'Since we couldn’t celebrate here, make sure it’s a grand occasion in Heiberg Kingdom.'"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"...What?"<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next day.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Haise received an invitation to the royal celebration.</p>
