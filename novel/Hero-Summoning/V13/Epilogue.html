<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she disappeared from sight while watching Kaito as he walked back to Vier and Neun again, Alice pondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;&#8230;There&#8217;s no &#8220;sign of movement&#8221; yet. No, I suppose it&#8217;s not decided that something will happen at the Six Kings Festival huh.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While enjoying the Six Kings Festival, Alice continued to be on the lookout for certain things. For before the Six Kings Festival, she heard a story from a certain person&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time goes back, a few days before the Six Kings Festival. Alice&#8217;s clone, who works as the storekeeper of her general store, is visited by an unexpected person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[This would be the second visit to this store, yes?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eden-san? Kaito-san isn&#8217;t here today, you know?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I know that my child is not here. The reason I&#8217;m here is that I want to talk to you&#8230;&#8230; Alice.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Seriously, what turn of events could possibly&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;!? A barrier? You&#8217;re talking about something that you wouldn&#8217;t want others to hear huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eden&#8217;s words came as a surprise to Alice. Alice had thought she understood Eden to some extent. However, she couldn&#8217;t understand why she would go to the trouble of visiting Alice, as she should have been someone who perceived all beings other than the ones she called her own child as trash.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1800279074"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1874651084"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Even though I am such a person, I have some evaluation for you. You are worth far less than my child, but you are still someone worth remembering your name. You are far better than any other talking piece of flesh.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Well, thank you for that&#8230;&#8230; So, what do you need?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8220;Shallow Vernal will soon make her move&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ ! ? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Eden announce the name of the God of this world with a serious expression on her face, Alice looked astonished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Beware of Shallow Vernal&#8217;s movements. That is, if you don&#8217;t want to &#8220;lose&#8221; my beloved child&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[W- What are you&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I can tell you nothing more. It goes against the contract I had with Shallow Vernal. I can&#8217;t speak directly to my child about anything regarding this matter, but I&#8217;m sure Shallow Vernal thought that I perceived all the inhabitants of this world as nothing but trash&#8230;&#8230; There were some holes in our contract. Making use of that, I&#8217;m conveying it all to you.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Contract?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I can&#8217;t give you the concrete details&#8230;&#8230; but in the not-too-distant future, my beloved child will have to face a God.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-6766695"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-14118438"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wha!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words Eden said without hesitation were something that Alice could never ignore. However, she couldn&#8217;t talk about the details. As if to say that she had said what she needed to say, Eden turned away and began walking to the exit of the general store. Alice, still feeling dumbfounded about what she heard, only watched her departing back, but Eden suddenly stopped in front of the door and muttered without turning around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;What an interesting turn of events. She was once called the &#8220;Destruction God of the Apocalypse&#8221;, but now, she&#8217;s being called the Creator God. What the future holds really is unknown.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But even with that change in name, does that really change her nature? She still stands at the end of the story.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;What do you mean?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;Epilogue : The End of the Story&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; That is what the being named Shallow Vernal is. I don&#8217;t know her true motives either. However, I guess it&#8217;s just like that question&#8230;&#8230; Which do you think came first&#8230;&#8230; Was it the chicken or the egg?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What exactly are you talking about?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;Did Miyama Kaito come to this world because of the Hero Summoning&#8221; or &#8220;was the Hero Summoning created in order for the being named Miyama Kaito to come into this world&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; In the first place, &#8220;who was it&#8221; that made the magic circle for Hero Summoning in the Human Realm&#8230;&#8230; I think that would be something worth investigating.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2834878"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-105275005"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[My child, oh my beloved child, &#8220;are you really a being of miracle that everyone just so happened to meet&#8221; or &#8220;are you a being that someone who could see the future wanted to meet&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; I wonder which is the true prologue of the story?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Telling these words to no one in particular, Eden left the general store. Leaving a big question within Alice&#8217;s mind&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After leaving the general store, floating far above in the air, Eden&#8230;&#8230; Makina, who was operating Eden, was lost in thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;&#8230;To be honest, this is as far as I can go. If I could, I would have told her I&#8217;m Makina, and helped her with more things&#8230;&#8230; but that would be difficult.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Makina came to give advice on the matter between Kaito and Shallow Vernal, but she was limited to giving hints in a very roundabout way. The reason is that, in the event of a fight between Kaito and Shallow Vernal, Kaito&#8217;s side will definitely need a cornerstone&#8230;&#8230; The brain of operations, which would be Alice. In addition to her battle capability as an individual, her intellect which is second to none would clearly be a target of caution for Shallow Vernal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, Shallow Vernal will definitely be wary of Alice&#8217;s future movements. This being the case, Shallow Vernal will complain if Eden cooperates with Alice too much. It&#8217;s necessary for her to keep her actions within the limits of her contract with Shallow Vernal, all for the sake of her beloved Kaito, whom she dearly calls her own child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;&#8230;Well, even with just that few hints, Alici&#8230;&#8230; Alice should be able to arrive at the correct answer with no problem.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After thinking that much, she quietly moves her gaze. The God Realm, which should have been so far away that one can&#8217;t possibly see it, and the being at the center of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(This matter involves not only my child, but also those around him&#8230;&#8230; I have a feeling that this is going to be a big event for Shallow Vernal herself. As for whether this battle involving the whole world could end with a happy ending&#8230;&#8230; That would depend on my child.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After pondering on her thoughts, a small smile appears on Eden&#8217;s lips as she disappears from that place.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-322975112"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1160888490"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Still, there&#8217;s still some time before the beginning of the end. That&#8217;s why, you must nurture your wings well while you still can&#8230;&#8230; Do your best, my child. Mother will always be rooting for you.)</span></p>
