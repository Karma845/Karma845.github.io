<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After seeing off Kuro and the others as they get ready for the Opening Ceremony of the festival and killing some time, I decided to head out as well. The Opening Ceremony itself will be held in the plaza where the Central Tower is located, so I could easily attend the ceremony by just going outside. I was actually planning to meet up with Lilia-san and the others, as even though you could only attend this festival if you have an invitation, I heard that quite a few people had gathered. It seemed like it would be difficult for us to meet up though, so Lilia-san sent me a hummingbird saying that we should decide on a place we could meet up afterward. Therefore, I decided to watch the Opening Ceremony alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After teleporting through a magic circle, I found myself outside the Central Tower&#8230;&#8230; standing before an amazing sight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the plaza stands a huge number of participants&#8230;&#8230; Some of them were several meters tall, while some were as small as Fairies. The crowd before my eyes is far more than in that temple we had visited to receive our blessings. But well, now that I think about it, this festival is being held in this entire city, so it would make sense that it would look like this when all the participants are gathered in one place. However, when I looked closely, there were not many people near the Central Tower. I mean, could it be that this place I was in is off-limits for them?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Let&#8217;s quickly move away from here.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Realizing that I was standing in a place where people were clearly avoiding, I tried to head for the crowd a few distance away, but at that moment, I heard a familiar voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kaito-san!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Lilia-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, I saw Lilia-san approaching me while waving her hand.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1221220254"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1982561038"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Arehh? I thought it&#8217;s gonna be hard for us to meet up&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, that&#8217;s the thing. Apparently, the rank of the invitation determines where you can attend the Opening Ceremony.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Is that so?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. It seems that the area around this Central Tower is only for those with Gold-rank or higher invitations, while their companions and those with lesser invitations aren&#8217;t allowed to enter before that flag stands.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">From what Lilia-san told me, this huge plaza was acting as a ward itself, and that the invitations restrict where we could enter. I see, that&#8217;s why there are so few people near the Central Tower&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So, I&#8217;ve left Luna and Sieg in charge over there, and I&#8217;ve come to meet up with Kaito-san.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you. To be honest, I was worried that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to find anyone I knew&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was really grateful that I was able to meet up with Lilia-san, and her presence makes me feel calmer. Just as I was about to express my thoughts to her, I heard someone&#8217;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Mhmm? That youth over there&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ehh?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-393797444"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1462610525"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked in the direction of the voice, there was a Mermaid with marine blue hair&#8230;&#8230; The same person who had helped me with Dr. Vier&#8217;s matter a while ago, Her Majesty Laguna.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh! As I thought, it&#8217;s young Lilia and Kaito!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If it isn&#8217;t Her Majesty Laguna.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh, young Lilia. We haven&#8217;t met since that time, right? Well~~ I&#8217;ve thought of it back then, but you&#8217;ve gotten a lot stronger, haven&#8217;t you? If I get negligent, young Lilia might just take the title of the strongest of the Human Realm away.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, no, I&#8217;m still inexperienced. I&#8217;m still no match against Her Majesty Laguna.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Her Majesty Laguna saw us, she approached us with a happy smile on her face and exchanged a few words with Lilia-san.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;I mean, arehh? Did I ever tell her my name? No, well, even though it wasn&#8217;t my intention, I apparently became famous for all sorts of things, so I guess it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising that she knows me? W- Well, anyway, now that we&#8217;ve met&#8230;&#8230; I guess I should give her my thanks for her help back then.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Errr, Her Majesty Laguna. It&#8217;s nice to meet you, my name is Miyama Kaito. Thank you very much for your help the other day.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? What, don&#8217;t worry about it! &#8220;We&#8217;re quite close&#8221;, so helping you that much is nothing&#8230;&#8230; Rather than that, I&#8217;d like it if you stop talking to me like a stranger. Just call me Laguna.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ehh?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1462852085"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-962656998"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arehh? Somehow, doesn&#8217;t it feel like Her Majesty Laguna&#8230;&#8230; No, Laguna-san&#8217;s reaction is strange? This should be the second time we&#8217;ve met, but she&#8217;s acting all familiar&#8230;&#8230; or rather, it&#8217;s as if we&#8217;ve already met before. Lilia-san&#8217;s eyes narrowed in response to Laguna-san&#8217;s words, but I hurriedly shook my head. No, seriously, I wasn&#8217;t hiding it from you, Lilia-san! Even I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s saying either!!!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I conveyed this to Lilia-san with gestures, it seemed like she understood, making her tilt her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Errr, Her Majesty Laguna? Can I ask if you&#8217;re acquainted with Kaito-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh! That&#8217;s right, we even fought together against a formidable enemy&#8230;&#8230; he&#8217;s my comrade-in-arms, if you will! Well~~ I&#8217;ve always thought he was a good man, but now, I like him even more! Hey, Kaito. &#8220;As I had asked you before&#8221;, how about you become my husband?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Huh? Eh? N- No, wait a moment! Your Ma&#8230;&#8230; Laguna-san&#8230;&#8230; Didn&#8217;t we first meet at that time with Dr. Vier?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;What? O- Ohh, come to think of it, that&#8217;s right!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really didn&#8217;t understand what Laguna-san was saying, so when I hurriedly asked her that, she puzzledly looked at me&#8230;&#8230; and a few moments later, she clapped her hands as if she noticed something.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That was the case, right? My bad, my bad. I certainly didn&#8217;t have this appearance back then&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m the old man who fished with you back in the Hydra Kingdom!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well~~ I forgot that I had a different appearance at that time!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-822872185"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1031748809"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eeeehhhhh!? Y- You&#8217;re that grandpa from that time!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Umu!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The grandpa I chatted with almost every morning while fishing during my stay in the Hydra Kingdom. He seemed kind of important, so I thought he was a senator&#8230;&#8230; So, he was just Laguna-san who had changed her form&#8230;&#8230; Ahh, I see&#8230;&#8230; When she said that we fought against a formidable enemy together, she was talking about that fish.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Kaito-san. Where should I direct these feelings now? I understand that Kaito-san wasn&#8217;t lying to me but&#8230;&#8230; in the end, you met her&#8230;&#8230; With this, you&#8217;ve met all the top of the three realms&#8230;&#8230; Kaito-san&#8230;&#8230; you&#8217;re scary.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, how should I say this&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m really sorry.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unnn. As it turns out, Lilia-san&#8217;s fears were completely correct. No, it isn&#8217;t a situation where she could get angry at me. But well, even so&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; I&#8217;m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a king, Laguna-san seemed to be planning to attend the ceremony as well, so she left after a short chat. After that, as I was waiting for the ceremony to be held with Lilia-san, the people who had been crowded together a short distance away suddenly split apart. The crowd that split in two looked like one giant road. Right after that, a loud shout rang out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[S- She has come! Creator God-sama!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as that person shouted, as if in unison, all the people gathering in this place kneeled down and lowered their heads. Matching our surroundings, Lilia-san and I also got down on our knees, bowing our heads and got into a prayer position. However, I slightly moved my eyes to see what was going on. When I saw Chronois-san&#8217;s appearance in the temple before, I thought it was like a white wave of humans&#8230;&#8230; but this is on a different level. Shiro-san&#8217;s invitation rank was definitely black. Hence, she must have brought almost all the Gods with her. This was definitely quite a tremendous sight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gracefully walking in the lead was Shiro-san, the Creator God. The three Supreme Gods lined up behind her, and further behind them, dressed in white vestments, the Gods followed in perfect order. They were truly like the pinnacle of this world, and those standing before them felt overwhelmed with their presence. Even I, who was used to interacting with Shiro-san to some extent, was overwhelmed by their presence, so the tension might have been even greater for the others.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1507173540"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1764583284"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that Lilia-san next to me was slightly trembling was proof that they were feeling a lot of pressure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiro-san continued on her way at a steady pace, and on the way, all the Gods except the Supreme Gods stopped. It seems that even the Gods must observe the entry restriction. After a certain amount of time, Shiro-san stopped, and the people who had been bowing their heads began to stand up, to which Lilia-san and I followed suit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;She&#8217;s amazing. Creator God-sama, I mean. Her presence is just so&#8230;&#8230; divine&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I never thought I&#8217;d see her outside of the Festival of Heroes&#8230;&#8230; Praise God for gracing us with her presence&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost as soon as I heard that voice, Shiro-san glanced at me and slightly waved her hand. Could you stop that!? I&#8217;m talking about that reaction as if you&#8217;ve found someone you know! No, I&#8217;m certainly someone she knows, but she&#8217;s just drawing too much attention! The moment Shiro-san waved our way, all the surrounding eyes immediately turned to us. No, seriously, give me a break&#8230;&#8230; Lilia-san is already ghastly pale, you know? She&#8217;s going to faint soon, you know?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The buzzing around us gradually became noisier and cold sweat began to run down my back, but luck still hasn&#8217;t given us up yet. Before our questions could be put into words, a loud sound rang out from the Central Tower.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked over there, I saw a part of the Central Tower sticking out like a stage, and on top of it came out Kuro and the others&#8230;&#8230; the Six Kings. Though I say that, Magnawell-san couldn&#8217;t get on the stage, so he&#8217;s just sticking out his head near the Central Tower&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The Opening Ceremony is going to start soon.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Oi, what are you doing here? Aren&#8217;t you supposed to be over there?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Alice, who appeared next to me as if it were a matter of course, and after breathing out a light sigh, she told me why.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-598287103"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-56832787">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, even though I&#8217;m reluctant about this&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;The one beside you today is a clone&#8221;.

This newly created &#8220;Perfect Clone Alice-chan&#8221; is created by canceling out &#8220;18000 of my clones&#8221; scattered around the world, so this clone&#8217;s performance was almost equal with the main body! I&#8217;ll do my best to protect Kaito-san!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I- I have lots of things I want to tsukkomi about. 18000!? You have that many clones!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I certainly knew that she had quite a number of clones, like the one in the Hydra Kingdom and the one tending the store but&#8230;&#8230; 18000!?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, well, most of them are Alice-chan clones disguised. The reason is that the clones are responsible for transmitting the information gathered by my subordinates to the main body, so they were deployed here and there.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I see&#8230;&#8230; Even so, that&#8217;s quite a lot, 18000 clones&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, no, if it were clones without autonomous thinking or information control abilities, the main body could operate at least &#8220;a million&#8221; but&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unnn, this won&#8217;t do.

However, if we keep going like that, the Human Realm would be left out. That&#8217;s why we asked for their cooperation. The three realms are equal after all.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I see.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I nodded my head in response to Alice&#8217;s explanation, Kuro broke off her speech. Slowly looking around the crowd for a moment, she opened her mouth again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well then, before we announce the opening of the festival, we&#8217;d like to show everyone a little performance.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;A performance?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, just relax and enjoy the sight.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;re having a performance. When Kuro announced this, the first person to move was Magnawell-san. Pulling back his neck that had been leaning over towards the plaza, he slowly turned it towards the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uwooooohhhh!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magnawell-san let out a tremendous roar that seemed to split the air, but there was no shockwave reaching our location. Kuro and the others must have put up a barrier. Even with the barrier though, I could still feel a tingling sensation as Magnawell-san&#8217;s roar seemed to shake not only the air, but the earth as well. Then, some distance away from the city where the venue is located&#8230;&#8230; The earth rose up, forming a huge mountain range that surrounds this city. Looking at the mountain range of rocks as huge as Magnawell-san, reaching thousands of meters high even when I look at them from a distance&#8230;&#8230; The people gathered here were astonished by the power of Magnawell-san, who created this with just one shout.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1054287232"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-501246859"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as if it was obvious, it didn&#8217;t end there. Next, jet-black magic power gathered around Kuro, and like a conductor of an orchestra, Kuro raised her hands&#8230;&#8230; and the donut-shaped mountain range that had surrounded the city immediately floated up into the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;A- Amazing&#8230;&#8230; Without any chants or magic circles, for her to lift up such a  large mass&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard Lilia-san&#8217;s voice as she dumbfoundedly muttered, but I didn&#8217;t have the room to look in her direction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming that the mountain range had risen quite high, Megiddo-san thrust out his right arm, which was clad in crimson flames, towards the sky. Thereupon, a tornado of flames that seemed to burn the heavens was released from his fist, shattering the floating mountain range with a huge explosion. Just as I was admiring the tremendous amount of firepower Magnawell-san had, before I knew it, in the center of the explosion&#8230;&#8230; Isis-san appeared, pushing away the smoke from the explosion. Then, as Isis-san&#8217;s body spun around as if she was a fairy dancing in the air, not only the shattered pieces of the mountain range&#8230;&#8230; but she also &#8220;froze the flames&#8221; blazing brightly, and a huge number of ice lumps appeared in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the ice lumps slowly falling down to the ground, the thought that the ground would be turned into a hellscape because of this rain of huge ice lumps popped into my mind&#8230;&#8230; but that didn&#8217;t happen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if to enclose the city, &#8220;three trees&#8221; appeared, and their branches extended out at a startling speed, catching the falling ice lumps as if these trees had a will of their own. I&#8217;m sure that the one who did was Lillywood-san&#8230;&#8230; Those three huge trees which don&#8217;t look inferior compared to the World Tree, seemed to show how powerful Lillywood-san was. Then, as a finishing touch, Alice, clad in her black robe, leaped high into the air. And then, Alice&#8217;s body blurred out as if it was going through static&#8230;&#8230; before a tremendous number of clones appeared, filling my field of vision. If the main body controls them, I heard that she can create a million clones but&#8230;&#8230; actually seeing them was quite an amazing sight to behold. Alice&#8217;s clones run like meteors through the branches of the trees in all directions, before they return back to Kuro and the others&#8217; side as one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Just a few seconds had passed. That&#8217;s all it took&#8230;&#8230; for the entire scenery to suddenly change.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three trees surrounding the city were gorgeously and beautifully decorated with &#8220;multicolored ice&#8221; and the three trees were connected by &#8220;flames trapped in ice&#8221;, forming like a ring around it. And carved on these three trees were the words &#8220;Human&#8221;, &#8220;Demon&#8221;, and &#8220;God&#8221;, the name of each realm. I see, the three trees are the three realms&#8230;&#8230; I guess that means that the ice ring that encloses fire, giving off a shimmering light, is showing that the three realms are connected huh&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be simple if they just said it. However, this decoration that surrounded the city&#8230;&#8230; To be able to create such a thing so easily, the Six Kings really are amazing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As admiration and astonishment could be heard from everywhere, Kuro spoke again.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-764783021"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2056786528"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;This year marks exactly a thousand years since the Treaty of Friendship was signed between the three realms. The three realms have carved out their history by standing close together and helping each other. We are proud that this Treaty stands for a millennium, and we are proud that we were able to hold the first Six Kings Festival on this day. And in the future, I hope that for another millennium&#8230;&#8230; No. I hope that these days when we walk hand-in-hand with our dear neighbors will continue forever&#8230;&#8230;. Leaving these words, I hereby declare that the Six Kings Festival to be held!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the plaza was engulfed in a round of applause.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amazing, amazing!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;They&#8217;ve even changed the terrain itself in an instant&#8230;&#8230; As expected of the Six Kings!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, for such amazing Six Kings to call us dear neighbors. We should act in a manner which we wouldn&#8217;t be ashamed to call ourselves as such.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes! We may not be able to compete with them in terms of power, but the Humans have their own strong points, just like the Demons and Gods do. Let&#8217;s do our best to help each other!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh, of course!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here and there, words of praise for Kuro and the others, and words of pride for the Treaty of Friendship rang out. And then, as if it were a matter of course, we heard voices telling us not only to help others, but also to help each other out. Ahh, this world really is&#8230;&#8230; a good world. Everyone is trying to look forward to a better future, doing what they can do without feeling spite towards others. This should have been a really difficult thing to do but&#8230;&#8230; the beautiful scene of Humans, Demons, and Gods smiling and cheering together everywhere is a sight that will show the many races living in this world that even though we look different&#8230;&#8230; we would always be close neighbors.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><p></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dear Mom, Dad&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; I thought to myself once again, that I was glad to have come to this world. I could feel the warmth of the atmosphere around us, uniting our hearts. I can also feel that little by little, I&#8217;m also becoming part of everyone&#8230;&#8230; Somehow, just like the others&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; I also felt really proud.</span></p>
