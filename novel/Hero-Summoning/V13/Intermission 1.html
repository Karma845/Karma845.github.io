<h3>Intermission &#8211; Lillywood ~~ To the Ordinary and Special You ~~</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first time I met you, you weren&#8217;t anything special. I could understand that you are a kind-hearted person. I recognized you as a person with a strong heart. But still, you could be described as ordinary.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;You were an ordinary being.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;You were someone insignificant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;You were a child.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;You weren&#8217;t anyone special. However&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first time I heard of the existence of Miyama Kaito was from my precious family, my little sister, Isis&#8217;s mouth. To be honest, even if it was my family telling me about him, I couldn&#8217;t believe that someone like Kaito-san exists. There was no way that a being without strong power could resist Isis&#8217; magic power of death. I thought that there was no way that someone as weak as him could hold her hand. But then, I heard your name come out of the mouth of Kuromueina, she who I consider my mother. I wonder what was it that I felt at that time? I think it was a mixture of anxiety and anticipation, as if an unknown entity had appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was in the Spirits&#8217; Forest in the Human Realm that I first met the human named Miyama Kaito. I am the oldest spirit in the world, and all the spirits existing in the world are her followers. From my point of view, the human being called Kaito-san is&#8230;&#8230; so anticlimactically &#8220;ordinary&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You were but a young being who hasn&#8217;t lived a few hundredth&#8230;&#8230; No, even a thousandth of my life, holding no great strength or magic power. A very ordinary person. It seems like you&#8217;re able to use rare magic called &#8220;Sympathy Magic&#8221;, but I could also use magic like that. It wasn&#8217;t a particularly unique ability. Although you were blessed by Shallow Vernal-sama, making you loved by nature&#8230;&#8230; Still, Kaito-san himself can be categorized as an ordinary human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not making fun of Kaito-san by any means. In fact, I had a very good impression of you when I talked to you. I could tell that you had a gentle personality, and I also got a good impression that you cared about nature. However, I still couldn&#8217;t see why Isis and Kuromueina consider you a special being.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-528672181"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-998401011"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, you have easily surpassed my imagination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You were liked by the overbearing Megiddo, gained the interest of Magnawell, and even Shalltear&#8230;&#8230; recognized you as someone special. You were certainly someone ordinary&#8230;&#8230; but you were still unafraid to challenge the extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, you have dispelled the darkness in Kuromueina&#8217;s heart. You&#8217;ve done what neither I nor the other members of the Six Kings could do, accomplishing it as if it was something so easy. &#8220;It was truly amazing&#8221;, is what I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s right. I think by that time, I had begun to think of you as someone special.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it the atmosphere around you? If Isis&#8217; magic power of death keeps others away, it is as if the atmosphere around you attracts others. You don&#8217;t fear me, one of the Six Kings, treating the Spirit of the World Tree&#8230;&#8230; A tree like me just like any other person. There are two main types of emotions that are usually directed at me by people outside of my family. From the spirits, fairies, elves, and plants&#8230;&#8230; They who are connected to nature, praise and believe in me as if I were a God. The rest of the world treats me with awe as one of the Six Kings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the emotions you directed towards me were neither of these. It was pure affection&#8230;&#8230; The kind of warmth you would feel for someone standing next to you. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like it. In fact, I feel happy instead&#8230;&#8230; However, how should I say this&#8230;&#8230; I still can&#8217;t seem to get used to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;re not my family. You&#8217;re not my follower. Our race and age are different. You are supposed to be someone very distant toward me. However, it&#8217;s quite strange. When I talk to you&#8230;&#8230; I feel as if the thought of you being by my side seems so natural to me. Perhaps, that gentle air that makes you so &#8220;special&#8221; is something that can only be understood by being around you. When I&#8217;m talking to you, I feel as if it&#8217;s natural that I&#8217;m not the World King, but as Lillywood Yggdrasil, your equal. I wonder what this is? This feeling&#8230;&#8230; It feels ticklish, but very pleasant. It&#8217;s not the same as the feeling I had when I&#8217;m with my family or when I&#8217;m talking with my friends&#8230;&#8230; Unfortunately though, I can&#8217;t find the words to describe it well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though I say that, that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m in a hurry to find it. I don&#8217;t have any basis for this, but somehow&#8230;&#8230; I feel that if I stay with you from now on, I will be able to find the answer to this unfamiliar feeling. I&#8217;m kind of really looking forward to knowing what this feeling is. Oh my? It&#8217;s really strange. When was the last time I felt excited about the changing future? The longer I lived, the more conservative I have become about change but&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe you are helping me to do this without me even realizing it. To a future that makes me smile even more than now&#8230;&#8230; If that&#8217;s the case, are you special enough to bring change to others?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;No, I don&#8217;t need to think about that.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-922468008"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2080257381">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether you&#8230;&#8230; Kaito-san is special or not, the feelings I have for you will not change. Kaito-san is kind and warm&#8230;&#8230; Someone special to me&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s enough for me. At least, for now that is&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have to think about anything else, I can just go back to my childlike innocence once in a while&#8230;&#8230; Just enjoy the time I spend together with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaito-san&#8230;&#8230; Objectively thinking, you aren&#8217;t so special. Yes, that&#8217;s if I look at you alone&#8230;&#8230; and I&#8217;m sure that when you&#8217;re with someone, it is when your existence shines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;You were an ordinary being. However, both of your feet stand in an extraordinary position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;You were someone insignificant. However, you have accomplished significant things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;You were a child. However, you changed the things that hadn&#8217;t changed in many years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;You were an ordinary human, not anyone special.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;However, because you didn&#8217;t stop right there&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;I believe you have managed to become &#8220;special&#8221; to the extraordinary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;I love the special and ordinary you.</span></p>
