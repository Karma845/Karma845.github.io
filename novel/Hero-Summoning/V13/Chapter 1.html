<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; War King's Festival</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crowd cheered at the announcement of the festival&#8217;s opening, and after waiting for the cheers to subside, Kuro spoke again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;The Six Kings Festival lasts for seven days. For the first six days, each of the Six Kings has planned their own festivals for everyone to enjoy. The order is&#8230;&#8230; War King, World King, Dragon King, Death King, and then mine. In other words, a festival planned by the War King Megiddo will be held today.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here, Kuro announced the order of the festivals&#8230;&#8230; However, I already knew the order of the festivals in advance, as it was written on the invitation. It didn&#8217;t really matter much for people like me who would attend all seven days, but for people like Dr. Vier, who had difficulty attending all seven days, they would have to look into the schedule and choose the days they would attend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Incidentally, this order is drawn by lottery.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;The Six Kings really are close friends. As I nodded in assent upon Alice&#8217;s additional information, Kuro stepped back on the stage and Megiddo-san came forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Alright. Let me take over the explanation here.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since today&#8217;s festival was planned by Megiddo-san, it was quite natural that Megiddo-san would be the one giving the explanation. However, hmmm&#8230;&#8230; The festival that Megiddo-san planned, no matter how I think about it, I can only see it as something battle-related, so I&#8217;m quite anxious about it&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The theme of my festival, well, as everyone had guessed, is &#8220;battle&#8221;!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it. Rather, if that isn&#8217;t the theme of his festival, I would be surprised instead.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-420876426"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-56355398"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, though I say battle, that doesn&#8217;t mean you need to put yourself on guard. This day is basically a festival. It&#8217;s a day where everyone should have fun!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmmm. Well, in spite of his appearance, Megiddo-san is a pretty considerate person, so I don&#8217;t think the festival he prepared would be that violent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s a bit of a hassle to explain all the details, so I&#8217;ll keep it simple. I&#8217;ve prepared a variety of attractions throughout the city. Each attraction has one of my subordinates in it. If you clear the conditions they give you, you can get a stamp&#8230;&#8230; As for the stamp card, it will be given to you at the first attraction you visit.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmmm. I&#8217;ve never been there, so it&#8217;s just a guess but&#8230;&#8230; could it be that it&#8217;s like a stamp rally at amusement parks? It would still depend on what attractions they have here, but I think this festival would be pretty fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, don&#8217;t worry. The attractions aren&#8217;t all about physical combat. There are also quizzes and sports. They&#8217;re designed so that even kids can enjoy the festival. The stamps you collect can be exchanged for prizes at the exchange point in this plaza. You can certainly exchange one stamp for something, but obviously, the more stamps you collect, the better the prize. Do you understand? Not like I would explain everything again though.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What should I do? That sounds like something I can normally enjoy&#8230;&#8230; Collecting stamps from sports and quizzes, then you can get prizes accordingly. Unnn, if I just ignore the physical combat&#8230;&#8230; then even I can enjoy this festival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, the fact that my subordinates are in charge of the attractions&#8230;&#8230; That obviously means that it includes the &#8220;War King&#8217;s Five Generals&#8221;. The attractions of my Five Generals are &#8220;combat only&#8221;, but of course, there will be handicaps depending on the strength of the participants. If you win against any of the Generals, you will receive an extra-large stamp. Collect all five of these stamps&#8230;&#8230; Well, that is to say, if you win against all of my five Generals, come to the central tower! For you will receive the right to &#8220;battle against me&#8221;!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were wild cheers from everywhere, but well, it didn&#8217;t really matter to me. I mean, I&#8217;m exactly the type that could fight against others. According to Megiddo-san himself, I&#8217;m only as strong as a slime. That&#8217;s why, it has nothing to do with me at all&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh, I almost forgot! Oi, &#8220;Kaito&#8221;! You especially, have to defeat them all and come fight me, okay!? That will be my revenge match!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-240241826"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1968243451"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oooiiiiii!? Why the heck are you pointing me out by name, you stupid gorilla!!! I&#8217;m getting a lot of attention now, you know!? No, even more than that&#8230;&#8230; What kind of unreasonable thing are you saying!? Are you telling this slime-like me to defeat all your confidants!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Go to Bacchus&#8217; place first! I&#8217;ve already talked to him about it. You understand, Kaito? You definitely have to come!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Whoa there, I got off track. Well, that&#8217;s about it. Other than the attractions, there will obviously be stalls. Have fun to your heart&#8217;s content!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Megiddo-san&#8217;s words, the people around me were filled with loud cheers once again but&#8230;&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t even thinking about it anymore. With my mouth still opened wide, I just stood there in a daze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Megiddo-san&#8217;s explanation, each of the Six Kings explained their plans in turn, and the Opening Ceremony was over. Then, Lilia-san and I met up with the others but&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;As expected of Miyama-sama. To be directly called out by War King-sama, how enviable.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;In that case, I will gladly swap roles with you, so you can have it, Lunamaria-san.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hahaha, surely you jest.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s really lively today, this useless maid&#8230;&#8230; You really think that my misery is funny&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1066333567"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1486271432">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kaito-senpai, good luck! Aoi-senpai and I are going to play in the normal sports area.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I pray for your safety, Kaito-san.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I see that both of your faces have been thicker huh.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My own compatriots immediately cut themselves away from troublesome matters&#8230;&#8230; The growth of my two kouhais brings tears to Older brother&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Errr, according to Phantasmal King-sama&#8217;s guidebook&#8230;&#8230; The place where Bacchus-sama should be&#8230;&#8230; is up north of this plaza.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well then, why don&#8217;t we all go over there for the moment?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sieg-san informed us while looking at Alice&#8217;s guidebook, to which Lilia-san suggested that we all head there. I was almost relieved that we could all go there together, but things didn&#8217;t work out that way. When Fia-san and Rei-san peered into the guidebook from behind Sieg-san, they looked as if they had noticed something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wait a moment, Sieg-chan. There&#8217;s a warning written here&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Let me see&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;Only those who have collected at least 10 stamps can challenge War King&#8217;s Five Generals. However, those with a black rank invitation can unconditionally challenge them.&#8221; or so it said.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1671414234"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1163102066"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They placed a restriction!? Moreover, they&#8217;ve thoroughly exempted me from that rule!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Hmmm. Well then, how about we just go around and collect some stamps?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Milady. This is just a suggestion, but why don&#8217;t &#8220;Miyama-sama check out Bacchus-sama&#8217;s place first&#8221;?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Luna?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Since War King-sama went to the trouble of designating Bacchus-sama first, I think he must have some explanation or message to give him. It would be rude to keep him waiting too long, so I think it would be better to have Miyama-sama go ahead and just listen to what he has to say. He can also just check out first and challenge him later.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see&#8230;&#8230; What do you think, Kaito-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunamaria-san&#8217;s words certainly make sense. Since Megiddo-san specifically mentioned going to Bacchus-san&#8217;s place first, there must be something there. I think it would be best to go there first and wait for Lilia and the others to come after collecting the necessary amount of stamps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yes, I&#8217;ll do that. Well then, I&#8217;ll be going first.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Master? I don&#8217;t have to participate in the attractions, so if you don&#8217;t mind, would you like me to accompany you?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s alright. Since we&#8217;re at a festival, you should also have some fun, Anima.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1137331955"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1870442644">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I understand. If Master says so.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I agreed to go alone, Anima worriedly asked me if she could go with me. I was really happy to know that she was concerned for me, but I told her that I wanted her to have a good time, and that it was okay if I went alone since it isn&#8217;t like I would be suddenly eaten alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Parting ways with the others, I headed to Bacchus-san&#8217;s attraction where he was waiting for me.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh, there you are, Miyama Kaito! Long time no see!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Long time no see, Bacchus-san. Are you fully healed already?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Umu, I&#8217;m fully recovered.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the guidebook, I arrived at my destination, which looked like a large arena of sorts. There were no seats for spectators though, so it seemed to be a place only for fighting only. Bacchus-san was waiting for me in front of the arena and greeted me with a hearty smile, but after exchanging greetings, he puzzledly looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? Even so&#8230;&#8230; Did you come here alone?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, everyone else has gone to collect the stamps needed for the challenge.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-601648718"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-251765484"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Nhnn, I should have known&#8230;&#8230; I was going to explain it to you when you all got here but&#8230;&#8230; I see&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. So, I thought I&#8217;d at least ask you about it first&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, alright. I&#8217;ll give you a brief explanation.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Bacchus-san heard what I said, he nodded his head once and took out a large crystal ball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[We are going to have a battle in this place, but of course, there is a handicap depending on the challenger&#8217;s ability. This crystal is a tool that determines that&#8230;&#8230; How about you try it out? Touch it.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Bacchus-san urged me to touch the crystal ball, some kind of glowing number appeared in the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[This is a &#8220;Magic Tool that measures the strength of the person&#8221; that touches it based on their magic power&#8230;&#8230; Though I say that, it can&#8217;t exactly show one&#8217;s talent, so it just gives us a rough idea.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Fumufumu.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Miyama Kaito&#8217;s strength is&#8230;&#8230; fumu&#8230;&#8230;. 3 huh. Stronger than a slime, but weaker than a goblin.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1874872189"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1048611370"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m really weak! N- No, but this time, I was told that I&#8217;m stronger than a slime! That&#8217;s progress, I&#8217;m telling you! &#8230;&#8230;Even if it&#8217;s a lie, I would have liked it if it showed that I&#8217;m stronger than that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[In this case, the handicap that I&#8217;d give you is that &#8220;I won&#8217;t attack, I won&#8217;t use both of my hands, one of my legs, magic power, and my movements are limited&#8221;. In that state, if you can touch me even slightly, you win.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;T- That&#8217;s a tremendous handicap.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, even in that state, I won&#8217;t lose so easily.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unnn, how should I say this&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m just glad that there was that clause that he won&#8217;t attack. Well, seriously, I&#8217;m just glad that he won&#8217;t attack. In all sorts of meaning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Incidentally, the time limit is 20 minutes, and you can only try once&#8230;&#8230; That means if you lose, you&#8217;ll never reach Megiddo-sama.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Hmmm. Why is Megiddo-san even doing this&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hmmm, it seems to me like Megiddo-sama has something &#8220;he really wants to teach you&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Something&#8230;&#8230; he wants to teach me?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Umu, I don&#8217;t know about it but&#8230;&#8230; I hope you can live up to Megiddo-sama&#8217;s expectations.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-536964392"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-198611795"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I- I will do my best.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hahaha, that doesn&#8217;t mean I will be cutting corners though.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still don&#8217;t know what Megiddo-san&#8217;s true intentions are when he told me that I should definitely challenge him, but just as Bacchus-san told me, I want to live up to Megiddo-san&#8217;s expectations if I can. Well, if I wasn&#8217;t able to meet his expectations&#8230;&#8230;. At that time, I will just apologize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, I forgot to mention that you can also have a &#8220;proxy&#8221; participate in the challenge.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Is that so?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Umu. However, the person who can act as your substitute is limited to &#8220;the companions you invited&#8221;. In that case, we will measure their strength again with this magic tool and will battle with the corresponding handicap.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I see. I understand.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hahaha. Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter who your proxy is, I won&#8217;t let you win so easily. I&#8217;m one of War King-sama&#8217;s Five Generals. I can&#8217;t just let you see me in the same unsightly state as back then.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Proxy huh&#8230;&#8230; Even if it&#8217;s limited to my companions, I could have Anima as my proxy, so I think the odds of winning are pretty good&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I said that I will wait for the others before challenging him&#8230;&#8230; Someone&#8217;s silhouette appeared before me. Pure white wings on her back, beautiful blond hair&#8230;&#8230; and this overwhelming pressure&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eden-san, who appeared as if it was a matter of course, nodded and touched the crystal that was held out to her&#8230;&#8230; and it shattered to pieces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Bacchus-san looking really motivated with a great axe in hand, I recovered from my confusion and reflexively shouted. Run away! Seriously, run away! After all, Eden-san completely intends to kill you!!!</span></p>

Very well, I shall teach this fool a lesson in reality.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sight of Bacchus-san holding his great axe without any hint of hesitation made me think of a warrior who had fought in many battles. However, this isn&#8217;t the time to care about that. No, no, this isn&#8217;t the time to act cool! Bacchus-san, run away immediatelyyyyyy!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Listen here, Eden-san. Be gentle, okay? Gentle. Be as gentle as you would pluck a flower&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I understand. If that&#8217;s what my child wishes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Does she really understand what I&#8217;m saying? I&#8217;m really worried about that.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of me, half-resignedly offering my prayer for his sake, Bacchus-san took a strong step forward. The impact cracked the ground, and Bacchus-san&#8217;s magic power raged like a storm.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-748869218"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-162928934"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With his vigorous speech, Bacchus-san powerfully kicked off the ground, and his figure immediately disappeared&#8230;&#8230; and before I knew it, &#8220;his upper body was stuck like a dart in the wall behind him&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ba&#8230;&#8230; Bacchus-saaaaaaannnn!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s already unconscious or not, but as Bacchus-san was stuck against the wall, a helplessly awkward silence fell around the arena.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;It was an unpleasant incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I asked Eden-san to heal Bacchus-san&#8217;s wound. Well, it seems that Eden-san took it easy on him, so the damage he received wasn&#8217;t that serious&#8230;&#8230; After he regained consciousness, I received a stamp from Bacchus-san and went outside the arena to wait for Lilia-san and the others.</span></p>

I won&#8217;t be able to meet up with Lilia-san and the others like this. As I&#8217;m unceremoniously teleported to a position quite far from where I was before, I thought for a moment. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to move without a thought. I&#8217;ll just explain the situation here with a hummingbird and meet up with Lilia-san and the others over there. After gathering my thoughts, I quickly sent a hummingbird to Lilia-san.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After hearing Alice&#8217;s words, Pandora-san finally stops moving, and in front of her is the slumped Kong-san, bound by a large number of chains that have appeared from the void.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, Alice&#8217;s command stops Pandora-san, and soon, Kong-san recovers with Alice&#8217;s magic. I was worried about his mental health after being tortured like that, but he seemed to be fine as he cheerfully said &#8220;I won&#8217;t lose next time&#8221;. After receiving the second stamp from Kong-san, I felt like my stomach was aching as I walked out of the arena.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After parting with Pandora-san, I headed to a stall a short distance from the arena. I know that it was a bad idea to move around while waiting for Lilia-san and the others, but right now, I needed something to soothe me. After all, for the second time in a row, a very dangerous person came to help me&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;m starting to get worried that another dangerous person would appear next time too. Please, can someone decent&#8230;&#8230; come next time&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing a familiar voice, I turned around to see Anima running toward me from a short distance away. Wearing a black jacket with a starry sky pattern on it and pants of the same color, clothing that I prepared for her for the Six Kings Festival, Anima ran up to me with a gentle smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m late. I&#8217;m glad that I could meet u&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; Fueehh!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Anima!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[M- Ma- Master!? W- W- W- What are you&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn&#8217;t particularly conscious of it, but when I saw Anima&#8217;s face, I reflexively hugged her. I could clearly see the blush on Anima&#8217;s face, but she doesn&#8217;t resist and fits into my arms, which looks very cute and soothed my depressed heart. A battle maniac who won&#8217;t listen to me when I tell him to run away, and the God of Earth who is trying to make him vanish from the world. A gorilla who I can&#8217;t converse with, and the Phantasmal King&#8217;s subordinate who fights so cruelly that it would even make the devil turn pale&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, there comes Anima, refreshing my weary heart&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Errr, Anima. Ummm, sorry. I got a little carried away&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if she lost herself because I hugged her or not, but I apologized to Anima, who was as red as a boiled octopus while looking at me with her mouth opening and closing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No! Master is tired after all, so it can&#8217;t be helped. Y- You don&#8217;t have to mind about me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Anima heard my words, she immediately shook her head, but her face was still red.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1571815496"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1764170004"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;E- Errr&#8230;&#8230; Speaking of which, aren&#8217;t Lilia-san and the others with you?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;No, I came here by myself.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Is that so?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. Lilia-dono and the others are still in the process of collecting ten stamps.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumu, it seems like Lilia-san and the others haven&#8217;t finished gathering enough stamps yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I thought that we should head over as soon as I saw Master&#8217;s hummingbird but&#8230;&#8230; Lilia-dono and the others looked like they wanted to take on the War King&#8217;s Five Generals, so I suggested that I head out on my own first.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Fumu&#8230;&#8230; wait, arehh? Is Anima fine with that though?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. I&#8217;m not interested in fighting against them. I thought I would need ten stamps to help Master, but after seeing Master&#8217;s hummingbird, I decided that I didn&#8217;t need the stamps if I act as Master&#8217;s proxy, so I came here.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the&#8230;&#8230; So, there are also angels walking on land huh&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m really glad that Anima is thinking well of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, thanks.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-551188501"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1761755780"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, as Master retainer, this is something natural! Ahh, Eta and Theta were about to head this way too but&#8230;&#8230; They are Bacchus-sama&#8217;s former subordinates. I thought they might have something to talk about with him, so I ordered them to stay behind at my own discretion&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn. I&#8217;m fine with that too.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How should I say this&#8230;&#8230; Well, it&#8217;s kind of charming that she seems to be completely comfortable with her position as my retainer. As I reached out my hand and stroked Anima&#8217;s fluffy hair, she narrowed her eyes in comfort. Stroking Anima&#8217;s head for a little while, when I took back my hand, she nodded once before speaking again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;So, what do we do now? It will take some time before Lilia-dono and the others arrive. Shall we challenge the second arena first?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, no, I&#8217;ve actually already cleared that.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[R- Really!? T- To have defeated two Count-level Demons in such a short time&#8230;&#8230; As expected of Master!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, it&#8217;s not like I was the one who fought them&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t stand Anima&#8217;s respectful gaze toward me, but when I thought of the actual tragedy that occurred, being looked at with that gaze makes me unable to sit still. After that, I recounted the events up to this point before going back to the topic of what we will do now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Hmmm. I don&#8217;t really want to rush Lilia-san and the others, so now that Anima is here anyway, why don&#8217;t we head to the next arena first?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes! It&#8217;s alright! As Master&#8217;s proxy, I will definitely seize victory!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-469244733"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1793663391"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[U- Unnn. I&#8217;ll be counting on you. Well, since we&#8217;re here anyway, why don&#8217;t we look at some of the stalls along the way.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soothed once again by how adorable Anima&#8217;s salute is, I checked the guidebook for the location of the next arena and moved on. I&#8217;ve also sent a hummingbird to Lilia-san and the others that I was going to the next arena with Anima, so there should be no problem there either. Or rather, I frankly just want to see the stalls. Since it&#8217;s a festival, let&#8217;s just take it easy on the way to the next arena, since I&#8217;ve only been seeing violent scenes today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Speaking of which, Anima. When you said that Lilia-san and the others were still collecting stamps, I guess they were going to fight against someone huh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, there were different kinds of things they could do&#8230;&#8230; but it seems like most of them were sports. I don&#8217;t know much about them, but there&#8217;s that ball game called &#8220;squash&#8221;, then there&#8217;s that &#8220;bowling&#8221; game.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;The heck is that, that sounds fun&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s weird, isn&#8217;t it? What I experienced just now was certainly a refreshing change of pace, but you know, I would have preferred playing those games, you know!? N- No, there&#8217;s no need to panic just yet. The Six Kings Festival has only begun&#8230;&#8230; We could also just go around now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Anima.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hahh!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[From here to the next arena&#8230;&#8230; Let&#8217;s go on a date.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hahh! &#8230;&#8230;Hwoehh?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-911768882"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-21505857"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Alright, let&#8217;s go!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[M- M- M- Master! W- What are you saying? G- Going on a date&#8230;&#8230; Awawa, w- wait a moment!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s quite a distance to the next arena, so let&#8217;s play at the booths and facilities where we can get stamps in the meantime. It would be a shame to just walk straight to the arena with such a cute Anima by my side. Probably because of the backlash from what I have felt until now, but I was feeling a bit excited as I walked towards the stalls, pulling the flustered Anima&#8217;s hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tension heavily dominates the place. Wiping away the sweat on my shoulder with my arm, I turned my gaze back to the being I&#8217;m facing. It was a close battle, and one could say that I was being pushed into a corner. However, I&#8217;m not the only one cornered in this fight&#8230;&#8230; One more strike&#8230;&#8230; If my one single strike connects, it will be my win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I don&#8217;t have much time left. If I miss here, it will be my loss&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s indeed a paper-thin battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Master&#8230;&#8230; Do your best.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wishing for my victory behind me, Anima cheered me on. As if she could feel the same tension I&#8217;m feeling now, I could feel her voice tremble. However, the words I received did indeed bring courage to my heart, and surrendering my body to the heat of the moment, I prepared my stance. Feeling as if time was accelerating, I felt as if the scenery around me seemed unusually clear, and with a step forward, I unleashed my final strike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eat thhiiiiiisssss!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if responding to my thoughts, the white trajectory that was released from my hand sharply burst forth and successfully caught its target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Well, even with all the bullsh*t I said, I&#8217;m actually just playing target practice&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-44043964"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1793966602"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Congratulations! You have scored five points and will receive a stamp.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You did it, Master! Amazing!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the attendant told me I&#8217;ve met the requirements with a smile, she placed a stamp on my stamp card. As I returned to her side with a smile, Anima looked so happy as if it were her who had won. This was one of the attractions that Anima and I stopped by on our way to the third arena. You throw a ball at a target with nine boards, and if you score five or more points, you get a stamp. Well, to put it bluntly, it&#8217;s just like those target practice games using a baseball back in my world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, Anima has also tried it out, but she wasn&#8217;t able to clear it. Anima can throw a very powerful fastball, but her control isn&#8217;t so good. The speed of my ball throws may not be that great, but my control is pretty good, so I somehow managed to clear it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, after such a violent start to the day, playing something normal like this feels fun. It seems like Megiddo-san&#8217;s words that he had prepared a variety of attractions were true, as I have seen quizzes and card games before we joined this booth. It would have been great if the battle against the War King&#8217;s Five Generals were something like this&#8230;&#8230; I seriously don&#8217;t know what Megiddo-san&#8217;s planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these thoughts in mind, I left the booth and walked down the street with Anima. As we leisurely made our way to the next arena, moving our gaze around the considerable number of stalls, Anima suddenly turned her attention to one stall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Unnn? Salt-grilled fish huh&#8230;&#8230; Should we have some?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, n- no!? I&#8217;m alright! I- It just happened to be in my line of sight&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see. But seeing it now, I&#8217;m tempted to try it out, so let&#8217;s eat together.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Uuuuu&#8230;&#8230; Yes.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-466127218"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2089649233"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anima eats meat too, but she prefers fish&#8230;&#8230; She may think that she&#8217;s hiding it, but it&#8217;s easy to tell because her eyes sparkle when she looks at fish dishes. Well, with Anima&#8217;s personality, she&#8217;s probably thinking that she can&#8217;t stop me just because of her own desire&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s better to invite her a little forcefully like this. I bought two pieces of salt-grilled fish and gave one to Anima. As usual, Anima insisted on paying for the fish herself, but I used my position as her master to make her shut up. When I tasted the salt-grilled fish, I found the texture of the crispy skin and the soft white meat. And this right amount of saltiness&#8230;&#8230; Unnn, this is tasty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[How is it, Anima?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- It&#8217;s delicious!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, want some more?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No! I&#8217;m already fu&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Excuse me, can I have another one?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Master!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anima finished one quickly and told me how delicious it was with a cute expression on her face, but it was obvious that she hadn&#8217;t eaten enough yet, So, I ignored Anima&#8217;s objection, bought more, and handed it to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;T- Thank you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tends to be reserved, so a hint of forcefulness like this is just right. I think I&#8217;m getting to know Anima better now. As a side note, the long coat-like outfit that Anima is wearing now&#8230;&#8230; it actually has a similar design to my clothes. However, my clothes are embroidered with golden threads in many places, while Anima&#8217;s clothes are not. Also, the design of Anima&#8217;s clothes looked a little more modest. I guess this must be playfulness on Alice&#8217;s part, as she deliberately made Anima&#8217;s clothes more modest than mine, as if she&#8217;s using our position of master and retainer as the motif.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1303951218"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1510621974"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Receiving her clothes, Anima was greatly praising it. She seems to be proud to be my retainer, and she&#8217;s really happy to be dressed in a way that makes her instantly recognizable as my retainer. Well, that &#8220;pride&#8221; can be a bit of a problem for me too&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, I&#8217;m not that much of an idiot. I&#8217;m aware that Anima has feelings for me that go beyond that of a servant to her master&#8230;&#8230; To be honest though, I&#8217;m happy she feels that way about me. It&#8217;s just that, unnn&#8230;&#8230; Anima, on the other hand, is completely oblivious about her own feelings. Rather, she thinks that her feelings are simply affection for her Master whom she respects. Should I say that she&#8217;s too loyal to realize that she holds feelings beyond loyalty? This is very difficult. Even now, when I&#8217;ve gone out of my way to declare that we&#8217;re on a date, she&#8217;s too serious and tries to keep her position of being my retainer at every moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Hmmm. Should I be a bit more forceful?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Did you say something?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? Well, errr&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m actually just admiring how cute Anima is.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Fueehhh!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Now then, I guess it&#8217;s about time we head to the arena.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? M- Master!? P- Please wait a moment&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, well, I guess I don&#8217;t have to be in that much of a hurry&#8230;&#8230; I was bewildered when she first came, but I think Anima has already become&#8230;&#8230; someone I can&#8217;t imagine without by my side. Unless she gets tired of being by my side, we&#8217;re going to be together hereafter&#8230;&#8230; Moreover, Anima is a former black bear. Her age as a human is much younger than mine. Or rather, she isn&#8217;t even a year old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess we should take our time and make progress one step at a time huh? With that thought in mind, I smiled at the confused Anima as we walked side by side, down the road to the arena.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1793002044"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1458876440"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dear Mom, Dad&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; To be honest, after I&#8217;ve lost you two&#8230;&#8230; I thought that I would never be able to feel the warmth of a family again. However, unnn&#8230;&#8230; I really don&#8217;t understand this whole master-retainer thing, nor do I know if this feeling is really the same as my love for my family. However, unnn. I wonder why though? Thinking about Anima as my family, how should I say this&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; It strangely fits just right.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arriving at the third arena, It looked more like a dojo rather than a colosseum.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like it takes quite a while to gather ten stamps for the challenge, and there were still no other challengers in sight yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walking into the quiet arena with Anima, I looked at the person sitting on a seiza in the middle of the area.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was sitting down, so I couldn&#8217;t see her clearly, but she looked to be about two meters tall. It was a blue-haired woman wearing clothes similar to a kimono.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve come, Miyama-dono.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Quietly speaking in a voice that held a hint of coldness, it felt like she was the exact opposite of King from the previous arena.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman slowly stood up and turned to me and Anima.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[My name is Epsilon&#8230;&#8230; I am known as Epsilon of the &#8220;Absolute Ice&#8221;.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Epsilon-san took out the same crystal ball that I had seen at Bacchus-san&#8217;s arena.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stepping in front of me, Anima touched the crystal ball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Fumu, you have a power level of &#8220;800,000&#8221; huh&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s quite something. I&#8217;d say you&#8217;re around Viscount-level huh.]</span></p>

Errr, compared to the me whose power level is &#8220;3&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; Anima is 200,000 times stronger&#8230;&#8230; Well, there are also those unreasonably strong people in the world that can break that crystal ball&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well then, let&#8217;s establish the rules. If you can hit me with even a single strike, you win.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anima quietly listened to what Epsilon-san was saying. It seems that she will have a considerable handicap, but she doesn&#8217;t seem to have any complaints about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Anima finished listening to Epsilon-san&#8217;s explanation, she came to me once and muttered.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1396835406"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1616538203"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In many ways, she is the opposite of Kong-san. Not making fun of Anima for being weaker than her, Epsilon-san took out a naginata from out of nowhere and held it in one hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Master, I will be off. I&#8217;ll definitely bring you victory&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Anima, do your best&#8230;&#8230; However, don&#8217;t push yourself too much, okay&#8230;&#8230;?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hahh!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Filled with determination, Anima faced Epsilon-san with both of her hands held up. Then, after making sure that I had moved out of the way&#8230;&#8230; The battle has begun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I may have underestimated the War King&#8217;s Five Generals in a corner of my mind. The two battles so far have ended in overwhelming victories because one of them fought Pandora-san, the strongest of the Count ranks, and Eden-san, one of the strongest beings in the world. I thought I had clearly understood how strong the Generals are&#8230;&#8230; but seeing the sight in front of me astonished me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Guhh&#8230;&#8230; Hahhh&#8230;&#8230; Hahhh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Epsilon-san, who hadn&#8217;t moved an inch from her starting point, stood in front of the heavily breathing Anima, who was down on one knee. The difference in ability between them is so obvious that I can see it with my own eyes&#8230;&#8230; And she was being overwhelmed. No matter how many attacks Anima made, Epsilon was able to handle them all with the naginata she&#8217;s holding in just one hand. She had said she could use magic to defend herself, but Epsilon-san had never used any magic so far. Perhaps, the difference in skill and magic power between them is just too great, as every time Anima lunges at her, she is flung away and tumbled on the ground. Viscount and Count&#8230;&#8230; There seems to be just one level difference between them, but it seems like there&#8217;s so much difference between their strengths&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2123378767"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1360296141"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Epsilon-san did not attack Anima. Even so, it can be said that Anima was already in tatters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was flung away and sent crashing to the ground&#8230;&#8230; This was repeated over and over again, and blood is already flowing down her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Anima! Stop it already&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I&#8217;m alright! I can still&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, rather than winning or losing, I just couldn&#8217;t stand to see Anima get hurt anymore, so I tried to tell her to stop and that it was fine to lose, but her strong voice interrupted me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Anima told me such, Epsilon-san spoke to her with an expression as cold as ice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Going any further is futile. I am already fully aware of your abilities. You are too young, too inexperienced&#8230;&#8230; In which case, your blade won&#8217;t reach me at all.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Guhh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;ve been holding back all this time.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Epsilon-san&#8217;s words, Anima hung her head in frustration. Perhaps acknowledging her movement as acceptance of defeat, Epsilon-san quietly lowered her naginata. But immediately after, a quiet, yet strong-willed voice was heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;All my days have just been spent stealing, killing and eating&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Epsilon-san, who was about to turn her back away from her, stopped moving at her words and turned her gaze to Anima.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;One day, I fought &#8220;a lone human&#8221;. Compared to myself, his body was extremely fragile. He had no claws nor fangs, and yet, he challenged me with his weak and fragile body alone.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Anima.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t even have to think about who those words are referring to. She was talking about the time I encountered Anima and fought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Protecting someone on his back, there was a strong light in the eyes of this human, even though he was challenging someone much more powerful than him&#8230;&#8230; Seeing those eyes, I thought that they were strong.

Even when I serve the person I admire, all that stands out is my weakness. There are many people stronger than me, and many more people smarter than me. And yet!

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With those words, Anima put all of her strength on her body to stand up and raised her arms at ready again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[To serve Master, to pave the way for Master&#8217;s path&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m proud of!

I will just keep trying until I do!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With an unyielding will, Anima took a step forward. Looking at her, Epsilon-san exclaimed in admiration&#8230;&#8230; but she didn&#8217;t raise her stance. A few moments later, Epsilon-san made the naginata in her hand disappear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[How splendid&#8230;&#8230; You win. I&#8217;ll give you a stamp.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words Epsilon-san suddenly said seemed to have caught Anima off guard. I guess that should be obvious. The atmosphere they had just now feels like this is just where the battle begins&#8230;&#8230; What the heck is going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[W- What are you talking about!? I can still&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;The next attack of yours will reach me. That is something I&#8217;m sure of.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1013051085"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-974297654"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wha!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[There&#8217;s no doubt that your next attack will hit me. But it will be an &#8220;attack at the risk of your life&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t think Miyama-dono would want you to be seriously injured. I am not confident that I can handle that blow without hurting you. This is just simply&#8230;&#8230; because I&#8217;m not capable enough.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A- Anyway, does that mean the battle is over? In that case&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Anima!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately ran over to the stunned Anima and took out as much of Fruits of the World Tree as I could from my magic box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Anima, we need to treat your injuries!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? M- Master!? I- I&#8217;m just slightly injured&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Just eat it!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Y- Yes!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overwhelmed by my menacing look, Anima hurriedly ate one of the Fruits of the World Tree. seeing that the small wounds here and there were healing, I breathed out a sigh of relief. Then, as I was checking Anima again and again to see if she still had any other injuries, a faint smile appeared on Epsilon-san&#8217;s lips.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-814080691"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-266286107">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like your master cares about you very much&#8230;&#8230; What a lucky woman you are.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Uuuuu, aauuu&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Now then, Miyama-dono. Your stamp card.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Epsilon-san prompting, I took out my card and a stamp was placed on it. When it was done, Epsilon-san turned to Anima, who was looking down with her face blushing red, and quietly spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;If you aren&#8217;t satisfied with the outcome of this battle, &#8220;let&#8217;s have a rematch in a thousand years&#8221;. You are young and full of talent. A thousand years from now, I think we should be able to fight each other evenly without me having to give you any handicap.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I understand. Epsilon-san, I will challenge you again in a thousand years.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I will be looking forward to it, future warrior.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Epsilon-san bowed to me once and then went back to the center of the arena, where she sat on a seiza and closed her eyes, just as how she had been when we first entered this place. How should I say this&#8230;&#8230; She&#8217;s a cool one. Unnn, totally different from Kong-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Anima was fighting though, I thought about how I&#8217;ve always been helped with all these battles. Eden-san, Pandora-san, Anima&#8230;&#8230; Leaving everything to proxies, and then facing Megiddo-san like that&#8230;&#8230; Would something like that really be alright? Even though her body was in tatters, Anima still did her best. Then, I should also do the same&#8230;&#8230; Even if it&#8217;s at least once&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- I think I should also fight.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1530815377"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2082535138"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I currently have three stamps&#8230;&#8230; and in front of us is the fourth arena. After getting a stamp from Epsilon-san, we had a quick bite at one of the stalls along the way, and arrived at the arena, which seemed a little smaller than the previous three. However, it was quiet around here. It was so quiet that I almost forgot that we were in the middle of a festival&#8230;&#8230; I mean, it was also the case for the previous three arenas, but aren&#8217;t there any other challengers beside me? Are they simply too lazy to collect enough stamps, or do they think it&#8217;s silly to challenge the War King&#8217;s Five Generals&#8230;&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With those questions in mind, I walked into the arena&#8230;&#8230; and found another strange person in there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Hmm? Ahh, Miyama-kun, welcome. I&#8217;ve been waiting for you]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, Ozma-san.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who was waiting for me in this arena was Ozma-san, whom I had met in Rigforeshia before, and with whom I have been in contact since. Thinking about it again, it should only be natural that Ozma-san is there because he&#8217;s one of the War King&#8217;s Five Generals, and since I&#8217;ve gone through three of the War King&#8217;s Five Generals so far, the only ones left should only be Ozma-san and Agni-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a gentle smile on his lips, Ozma-san approached me and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Can I take a look at your stamp card for a moment?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh, you&#8217;ve already passed through three of the War King&#8217;s Five Generals. Especially Epsilon-chan, even though she&#8217;s so strong, only somewhat weaker than Agni-chan, you did amazing. You seem to be doing well&#8230;&#8230; but you don&#8217;t look happy. Do you have something in mind?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-756113562"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-675994706"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of Ozma-san, he must have sensed that I have a lot of things in my mind. Faced with this question, I softly asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ve actually been able to leave everything up to this point to my proxies, but I thought I myself should at least try to fight&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[M- Master, but that&#8217;s just&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Anima heard my words, she was about to say something, but stopped mid-sentence. She was probably about to reflexively stop me, but guessing my feelings, she probably hesitated to speak. Hearing my words, Ozma-san nodded once and held a cigarette in his mouth. After lighting it and taking a light puff, he calmly spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I see. I&#8217;d like to say that there are things people just aren&#8217;t good at, and you don&#8217;t have to try them yourself, but I wonder if Miyama-kun feels guilty about standing before Master when you were carried by people around you?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yes.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I think that&#8217;s all good. It&#8217;s alright for a young child to be a little forward. Above all, I think Master will be more pleased if you stand before him when you yourself are convinced of what you achieved. Anima-chan must be worried about Miyama-kun, but I think you should respect his feelings and support him here.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While affirming my thoughts, he also sent advice to Anima, who had a worried look on his face. As I thought, I think Ozma-san is a dependable adult, and I also feel that it&#8217;s easier for me to take on a challenge if I&#8217;m against someone I know. Although she still looked worried, Anima listened to Ozma-san&#8217;s words and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Well then, let&#8217;s go over the rules. Uncle couldn&#8217;t attack Miyama-kun, nor am I allowed to use magic. I&#8217;m also prohibited from using one arm and one leg&#8230;&#8230; Then, there&#8217;s also movement restrictions. Let&#8217;s see&#8230;&#8230; How about me being unable to get out of this circle?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Ozma-san draws a small circle with a radius of about two meters on the ground and asks me if I&#8217;m fine with it.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-988264898"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-810771402">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s fine with me.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then, my movement speed&#8230;&#8230; I won&#8217;t move at a speed Miyama-kun can&#8217;t react to. Well, that&#8217;s about it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ozma-san then showed me that he was moving as I was while he leisurely walked on one foot. It seemed pretty slow, but I guess he looked confident enough to handle me huh? I nodded and told him that the conditions were too favorable for me to have any problem with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Miyama-kun&#8217;s only victory condition is to touch Uncle with even a finger&#8230;&#8230; The time limit, hmmm. How about I give you half an hour?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s a good response. Well then, let&#8217;s do some warm-up exercises so we don&#8217;t get hurt before we begin.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nodding at the words Ozma-san said with a gentle smile, I did some light warm-up exercises. I&#8217;m clear about this myself. Even with such a massive handicap, this isn&#8217;t going to be easy. However, there&#8217;s no doubt that I have the advantage, so let&#8217;s just give it our all.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Fumu, Kaito-san&#8217;s opponent is the &#8220;Peaceful Sky&#8221;, Ozma-san huh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Is he strong?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1301815739"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-260437300"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hmmm.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were two shadows high above the arena, overlooking the people below and they were quietly conversing with each other. At the end of their gaze was Kaito challenging Ozma.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Relaxedly exchanging words, as if they had known each other for a long time, the two shadows disappeared from the area.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a large amount of handicap in my favor&#8230;&#8230; Ozma-san at least wouldn&#8217;t move at a speed I couldn&#8217;t see and his range of action is only within a circle of four meters in diameter. So, to be honest, somewhere in the back of my mind, I was thinking that &#8220;I can do reasonably well on this&#8221;. However, after 15 minutes, half of the time limit, had passed, I realized how naive my thoughts were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Hahhh&#8230;&#8230; T- This is tough&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hmmm. You sure can move a lot, Miyama-kun~~ Are you exercising regularly?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I heavily breathed out, Ozma-san stood in front of me with an aloof smile on his face. I- I can&#8217;t reach him&#8230;&#8230; I can&#8217;t reach him at all. I mean, it doesn&#8217;t feel like I would be able to reach him. Ozma-san&#8217;s movements were slow and relaxed, but they were exquisite and as slippery as a specter. Just as Ozma-san declared though, he was indeed only moving at a speed I could react to. However, his movements were exquisite&#8230;&#8230; Even if I could react, my body wasn&#8217;t able to keep up, or he&#8217;d exploit blind angles that make it difficult to see his movements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if he was a leaf gently falling from a tree slipping through my hand when I tried to catch it. In that case though, I thought of opening my arms wide to block his escape route and tried to collide my body with his, but he quickly jumped over me with one foot. Well, Ozma-san may have actually been seeing my movements as if they were in slow motion, so it was easy for him to avoid them. However, it&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t have any cards left. I guess it&#8217;s time for me to use my trump card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh, a magic circle&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s important to try things out and find the way you could breakthrough.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ozma-san was still as calm as before with his gentle smile on his face. However, this magic would be able to break that smile of his&#8230;&#8230; Or rather, if this doesn&#8217;t break his smile, I don&#8217;t think I have any chance of victory at all. For a man with little magic power and no aptitude for combat, I could only rely on my only trump card &#8220;Auto-Counter&#8221;. However, it&#8217;s a passive kind of magic, and isn&#8217;t something suitable for initiating. The magic I&#8217;m going to use now is an improved version of my Auto-Counter&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s a magic that makes my body act through movements that I&#8217;ve established beforehand, at a really fast speed that just barely breaks my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few minutes of setting up the magic circle, I activated it.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-116196236"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1920763833"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Autopilot!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Whoa!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the utterance of the magic name acting as a key, I lost control of my body. The attack I&#8217;ve set up this time&#8230;&#8230; Is to make use of my body to attack at Ozma-san at the fastest and shortest distance possible. As the distance was originally close, I quickly reached Ozma-san and swung my fist at him, but he nimbly turned his body to the side and evaded my attack. However, this is where the true essence comes in. My body quickly reacts to Ozma-san&#8217;s movements and swings my fist to the side. However, this was also avoided by leaning his upper body behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I could even realize that my fist attack had been evaded though, my body immediately crouched down and my foot sweeped his. So to speak, Autopilot is something like a super reflex. It eliminates the process between thinking and acting, and executes predetermined goals at the level of a spinal reflex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This should have been&#8230;&#8230; making my body exert its maximum performance but&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ozma-san did a backflip with one foot to avoid my foot sweep, and easily avoided my fist that was continuously thrown in the air, and then spun around again with one hand on the ground to avoid my follow-up attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Good gracious, you&#8217;re quite fast, aren&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s going to be hard for Uncle to avoid them.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite saying all these things, Ozma-san evaded all of my attacks with relative ease, as if he knew in advance where my attacks would come from. F- For him to be this powerful&#8230;&#8230; This is bad. Autopilot is certainly easier to use than Auto-Counter, but I still don&#8217;t know how much this magic consumes. In the next few minutes&#8230;&#8230; If I can&#8217;t catch him&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-434789649"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1947676262"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Autopilot lost its effect, and I fell down on one knee. As for the time limit, there&#8217;s already less than 10 minutes left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Guhh&#8230;&#8230; Hahh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Master!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Autopilot would disregard my body&#8217;s fatigue while in effect, but one of the drawbacks is that when the effect wears off, the fatigue rushes in. To be honest, I&#8217;m so tired I just want to lie down right now&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While watching the exhausted me lying down on the ground, Ozma-san held a cigarette in his mouth and spoke to me without lighting it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Miyama-kun, can I give you one piece of advice?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Hahh&#8230;&#8230; Eh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That magic isn&#8217;t really effective against Uncle, you know? That&#8217;s probably some magic that allows you to attack in the most efficient way, right? In that case, for opponents like Uncle here who have already lived useless amounts of years, &#8220;not only would we be able to figure out where and how someone&#8217;s going to attack&#8221;, &#8220;we can even control your movements by purposely creating gaps&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ghh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that he mentioned it, I can somehow understand it&#8230;&#8230; The Autopilot uses the most efficient movement to launch an attack. So, for someone as good as Ozma-san, it wouldn&#8217;t be any different from using telephone punches&#8230;&#8230; Ughhh&#8230;&#8230; This is hard.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-288234628"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2035835200"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, you did a great job. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses after all&#8230;&#8230; So, isn&#8217;t it enough that you tried?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Even though Master Megiddo told you that, it&#8217;s not like you really have to do that. In this world, it&#8217;s important to know when to give up. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s your fault that you lost here. There&#8217;s no need to force yourself to do something that&#8217;s hard, you can just retire here&#8230;&#8230; You can just go have fun with that girl over there at the festival.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I guess you&#8217;re right.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to Ozma-san&#8217;s words, who was speaking to me as if he was gently persuading me, not mocking me for my weakness, I nodded once&#8230;&#8230; before I held down my trembling legs and &#8220;stood up&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Even still, you&#8217;re going to stand up? You don&#8217;t have to work so hard, do you? Do you really want to live up to Master Megiddo&#8217;s expectations that much?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[There&#8217;s that too&#8230;&#8230; But well, more than that&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why am I seriously working so hard? The reason&#8230;&#8230; I think there are a lot of them. I don&#8217;t want to waste the thoughts of the people who helped me get here, and I also want to live up to Megiddo-san&#8217;s expectations. Those are definitely reasons for not giving up. But I&#8217;m not that good of a person, so if it&#8217;s only that, I won&#8217;t be trying this much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, the reason why I&#8217;m working so hard now is actually quite simple&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m also&#8230;&#8230; a man&#8230;&#8230; So sometimes, I just wanted to &#8220;show off my good side to a cute girl&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1095448639"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-782318184"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Hahaha, I see. With such a reason, there&#8217;s no way that you can just not work hard, right? It&#8217;s Uncle&#8217;s mistake. Alright then, bring me all you got.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Alright!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I have very little energy and magic power left. That&#8217;s why&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ve only got one chance left. Running towards Ozma-san, I swung my fist. But of course, the strike is avoided. However, what I&#8217;m aiming for is this moment&#8230;&#8230; Through my Sympathy Magic, I conveyed my emotions. What I&#8217;m using now is that magic that stopped the fight between Chronois-san and Ein-san before. Forcefully transmitting my strong desire to not lose&#8230;&#8230; I jumped on Ozma-san, whose movements slightly slowed down in surprise. This tactic is effective because it&#8217;s a surprise attack. However, there won&#8217;t be a second time&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s why, reach him!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I desperately reached out to Ozma-san, who took evasive action even though his reaction was a bit delayed. It was actually just the tip of my finger&#8230;&#8230; but my outstretched hand did indeed touch Ozma-san&#8217;s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Guh!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Whoa, you alright there?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was about to fall to the ground, Ozma-san quickly caught my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Master! Are you alright!? Did you get injured?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Anima? I- I&#8217;m alright&#8230;&#8230; Just a little tired.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Ozma-san&#8217;s support, I smiled at Anima who ran up to me, to which she let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-234270006"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2056362490"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Good gracious, that&#8217;s splendid. You managed to catch me~~]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- Thank you&#8230;&#8230; very much.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re tired, so why don&#8217;t you get some rest? I&#8217;ll give you the stamp later.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yes.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well then, I&#8217;ll go brew some coffee. Young lady over there, can you help me with bringing the cups?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Okay.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming that Anima nodded at Ozma-san&#8217;s request for help, I sat down, leaning against the wall of the arena. I somehow managed to win just in time. My whole body feels so weary, but at the same time, I feel a sense of accomplishment&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; This feeling doesn&#8217;t feel so bad.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On their way to where they&#8217;re making coffee, a distance away from Kaito, Anima spoke to Ozma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;On those last moments&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;Why did you let him touch you on purpose&#8221;?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1630537536"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2124662012"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oya? As expected, you noticed it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Anima&#8217;s words, Ozma leisurely muttered and kindly smiled. At that time, Kaito&#8217;s plan certainly caught Ozma off guard. But even if that&#8217;s so, it was an easy task for Ozma to slip through the hand of Kaito, whose body was riddled with wounds. However, the fact was that Kaito&#8217;s hand actually reached Ozma&#8230;&#8230; because toward &#8220;a position that is just barely within Kaito&#8217;s reach&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Rather, from the beginning, I had intended to give a stamp to Kaito even without challenging me. I&#8217;ve known Miyama-kun quite a bit already, and even without having to test him, I thought he was well qualified to fight Master.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s just, doing that won&#8217;t make him accept it, right? I suppose it was more like I was responding to his challenge?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying this, Ozma glances towards Kaito&#8217;s direction and smiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Though I say that, once I accepted his challenge, I didn&#8217;t intend to just let myself lose. At least, if Miyama-kun hadn&#8217;t tried so hard&#8230;&#8230; He, who was aiming for what&#8217;s in front of him, desperately reached his hand to the goal, but in the end, he was held back by the difference in ability&#8230;&#8230; Uncle doesn&#8217;t like that kind of development. Well, in the end, it was a victory for Miyama-kun who made Uncle here think it was okay to lose.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Allow me to say my thanks on Master&#8217;s behalf.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, I don&#8217;t need it. Rather than that, you should just praise Miyama-kun for his hard work. Tell him that he did a great job&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yeah.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-618689141"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1008400883"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Good gracious, it&#8217;s so nice to be young~~ I&#8217;m so jealous. Uncle is getting so old now&#8230;&#8230; But well, I guess it&#8217;s the elders&#8217; privilege to be able to smile at the efforts of straightforward children.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he said this, Ozma lit the cigarette in his mouth and serenely smiled.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I finished drinking the coffee that Ozma-san brewed for me, I stood up after recovering from my fatigue to some extent. Just as I was about to leave the place after thanking Ozma-san&#8230;&#8230; he opened his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah~~ Miyama-kun.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t think I expressly have to say this since you should already know this by now, but the fact that so many people would lend you their strength and become your ally is definitely your strength.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unless you&#8217;re an Omnipotent God, there&#8217;s only so much you can do on your own.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is probably advice also for the challenge to Agni-san after this. Advice he gave me after knowing I was worried about various things.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1492484760"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-247586385"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yes. Thank you, Ozma-san.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn. Well, don&#8217;t get so worked up about stuff, just take it easy and have fun. I&#8217;ll be rooting for you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lightly bowing my head to Ozma-san who was lightheartedly waving his hand at us, I left the place with Anima, aiming for the next arena.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Together with Anima, I proceeded to the fifth arena. On the stamp card in my hand, there were four oversized stamps, proof that I had defeated the War King&#8217;s Five Generals. I don&#8217;t count the stamps from the attractions we participated in along the way since they weren&#8217;t counted in Megiddo-san&#8217;s place&#8230;&#8230; The next one is the fifth, the last stamp I needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Master, a hummingbird arrived&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? Oh, it&#8217;s from Lilia-san.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was somehow feeling deeply moved that I&#8217;m finally close to gathering all the stamps, a hummingbird from Lilia-san arrived at that moment. It said that Lilia-san and the others had finished challenging Bacchus-san&#8217;s arena, and they were challenging the Five Generals in an opposite order from me&#8230;&#8230; After they challenged Bacchus-san, it seems like they were now heading to Agni-san&#8217;s arena. She then ended it with a question asking if we should meet there. Her timing was actually just right, so I sent a reply that we were also on our way to Agni-san&#8217;s arena and decided to meet up with them there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since we were going to meet up there, I thought of walking faster, but I felt someone discreetly holding the hem of my clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh? Anima?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, m- my apologies! I just&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1405632155"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-861276975"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, it&#8217;s alright but&#8230;&#8230; Is something the matter?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, ummm&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her, tilting my head to the side if there&#8217;s something she wants, Anima blushed and turned her head to the side, murmuring in a voice that was unusually soft for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I- I know that this is rude of me but&#8230;&#8230; errr&#8230;&#8230; ummm&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I&#8217;d like it if&#8230;&#8230; we could be &#8220;alone&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; for a little&#8230;&#8230; u- ummm&#8230;.. M- My apologies! It&#8217;s nothing!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was very unusual, no. Perhaps, this might be the first time since I met Anima&#8230;&#8230; that she had spoken out about her small, modest selfishness. She didn&#8217;t finish her words, but I still understood what Anima was asking for&#8230;&#8230; and to be honest, it made me happy. That&#8217;s why, asking Anima to raise her head that was deeply bowed, I smiled as gently as I could and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m actually hungry from all the moving around I did earlier. I want to get something to eat. I&#8217;ll let Lilia-san and the others know that we&#8217;ll be a bit late, so can you go along with my selfishness?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Master&#8230;&#8230; Y- Yes! Gladly!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1300999621"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-632075218"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well then, it seems like there are food and drink stalls over there, so let&#8217;s go.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes! Ah, ummm&#8230;&#8230; Master.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Thank you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Smiling at her modest words of thanks, I headed to the area lined with stalls together with Anima. Anima&#8217;s small selfishness. No, I don&#8217;t really think&#8230;&#8230; I call that selfishness huh. That is&#8230;&#8230; Yes. The thing asked by this girl, who holds no desires for herself, for the first time was a cute request.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I said that we were going to eat, we didn&#8217;t want to keep Lilia-san and the others waiting too long, so we decided to eat at a stall instead of going into a restaurant. I mean, I noticed this when we were searching for what to eat but&#8230;&#8230; There&#8217;s also normal restaurants here huh. I don&#8217;t know if I should say that it&#8217;s to be expected from an outrageously large place or not&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had already eaten earlier, but for Anima, who loves fish, I bought some salt-grilled fish and a few other items from the stalls, and sat down with Anima on a bench a few distance away from the stalls. As soon as I took a bite of the grilled fish, from beneath its crispy skin, the white flesh that goes well with salt became visible and its taste gently spread out in my mouth. This fish is lightly seasoned, but it goes without saying that salt and white fish go extremely well together. It&#8217;s very tasty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn. Tasty&#8230;&#8230; wait, Anima? Are you not going to eat it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, n- no, I &#8216;ll eat it.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1888306787"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-395403595"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning my head to the side, I saw Anima staring at the fish skewer with a listless expression on her face for some reason. When I called out to her, Anima flusteredly took a mouthful of the salt-grilled fish, but after taking a bite, she stopped moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Did it not taste good?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, it tastes great&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anima&#8217;s expression feels somewhat strange. It&#8217;s kinda hard to explain&#8230;&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t seem like she&#8217;s depressed or anything like that. How should I say this&#8230;&#8230; It feels more like she&#8217;s confused. However, I couldn&#8217;t figure out what she was confused about. While I was unable to continue the conversation, Anima remained silent for a while before she muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Master.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ummm, my apologies. For being selfish&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is this? Anima really seemed to be confused about something, and the confusion I felt from my Sympathy Magic became stronger with her mumble just now. However, it&#8217;s not like I can use my Sympathy Magic to read minds. This magic can only read the surface emotions and even if I could tell that Anima was confused, I still wouldn&#8217;t know why she was confused. As this unanswered question came to my mind, the answer immediately came out from Anima&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I just&#8230;&#8230; I- I just don&#8217;t know why I did such a thing&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-562244167"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-940331821"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ehh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m a subordinate serving Master&#8230;&#8230; Someone who has sworn her absolute loyalty to Master&#8230;&#8230; I should have sworn this but&#8230;&#8230; why? Even though I shouldn&#8217;t have meddled with Master&#8217;s actions for my own selfishness&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Anima.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can understand the reason for Anima&#8217;s confusion by what she just said. Perhaps, just a bit, just a really bit&#8230;&#8230; Even if she couldn&#8217;t properly say what she&#8217;s feeling, she noticed it. It exists in her heart. An emotion for me different from loyalty&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why Anima is so confused right now. Because she can&#8217;t properly tell the true identity of this emotion budding within her heart, and the reason why she has acted differently from the way she has in the past&#8230;&#8230; She could understand the loyalty within her heart, but this other emotion&#8230;&#8230; For Anima, it feels as if her loyalty has been shaken, and she has become worried because of it. However, even if that&#8217;s so&#8230;&#8230; I can&#8217;t tell her what emotion she&#8217;s feeling here. This is because this emotion is still budding within Anima, and is not yet solidified&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If, for argument&#8217;s sake, I told Anima the answer before she could figure it out herself or confess my feelings&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sure Anima will be confused, but she will force herself to accept it. She will most probably say that &#8220;because Master said it, then it must be right&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; Before she could even properly understand what she&#8217;s feeling, she will instead think that this is how it should be. Then, it will all be pointless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Anima.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Y- Yes!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;What the heck are you saying? Anima is the one &#8220;going along with my selfishness&#8221;, you know?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, but&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-346577724"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-861424350"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? Or is it that Anima did not want to eat with me?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s not the case!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why, what I should be doing is giving Anima time to calm down and look into her own heart. I don&#8217;t know what kind of answer she&#8217;ll end up with as a result of my decision. Would she put her loyalty first and push down these feelings&#8230;&#8230; Or would she accept these feelings and change&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hey, Anima? Is Anima happy to eat with me?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes! Ummm&#8230;&#8230; Strangely, I feel like it tastes better than usual?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see&#8230;&#8230; Then, there&#8217;s no problem, right? I&#8217;m happy to eat with Anima, and since we&#8217;re both happy&#8230;&#8230; It was a rather good choice we made, wasn&#8217;t it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is just a guess but&#8230;&#8230;. If Anima properly accepts her feelings&#8230;&#8230; I think she will grow up much, much greater than she is now. I&#8217;m not talking about physically, but mentally instead&#8230;&#8230; Yes, I think Anima will become an even more charming girl than she is now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Master.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1837851732"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-890851106"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Errr, ummm&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s delicious, isn&#8217;t it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why, I won&#8217;t say anything right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Master.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ummm, I&#8217;m just wondering what this is?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anima probably haven&#8217;t noticed it. Before she knew it, one of her hands held the salt-grilled fish skewer in one hand&#8230;&#8230; While her other hand was placed next to my hand&#8230;&#8230; With her pinky finger slightly touching my hand&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Master.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-401387203"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1774924957">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Thank you.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[For what?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I don&#8217;t know.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, yes, I guess I&#8217;ll patiently wait. Wait for the day this girl who is content with &#8220;following behind me&#8221;, would wish &#8220;to stand by my side&#8221;. I&#8217;m looking forward to such a future&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slow it may be, Anima is starting to change. At the moment, she is still very confused, but there is no need to rush. We can just continue to spend our time together in this peaceful way&#8230;&#8230; and little by little&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; I think we can get closer to each other.</span></p><
