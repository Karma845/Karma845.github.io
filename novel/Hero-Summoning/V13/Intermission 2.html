<h3>Intermission &#8211; Shallow Vernal ~ ~ Diverted Future</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It happened in the 1020 years after the signing of the Treaty of Friendship&#8230;&#8230; the year of the 102th Festival of Heroes. The Summoning of someone from another world has already been repeated more than 100 times. Each country does this on a rotating basis, and this year, where the Archlesia Empire was the one in charge&#8230;&#8230; The first irregular summons occurred. Two otherworlders appeared from the Hero Summoning, which would normally summon only one person. One of them was definitely this year&#8217;s hero, but the other one was an Irregularity in every sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, the Hero Summoning Magic Circle has been adjusted to summon otherworlders close to the age of the First Hero when she was summoned, so the otherworlders who visit should have been in their late teens. However, the other person who appeared was &#8220;23 years old&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; A being that was originally shouldn&#8217;t have been possible to summon. His name is &#8220;Miyama Kaito&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; The first clear irregularity since the Treaty of Friendship&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Marquis of Archlesia Empire, who was in charge of the Hero Summoning this year, was puzzled by the presence of this Miyama Kaito. This was an unprecedented situation, and he didn&#8217;t know how to deal with it. Even though he was an irregularity, they couldn&#8217;t treat a person from another world, someone from the same hometown as the First Hero, without respect. However, they didn&#8217;t know how to treat this being which is clearly unusual. As a result, Kaito was prudently sheltered by that March as if he was some sort of tumor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may sound good when one hears how he is being cared for. By no means did they treat Kaito unfairly. Rather, he was treated so hospitably to the point that it felt like Kaito was an important patient in a hospital. Perhaps, was that the reason why? He was suddenly thrown into a strange world, and suddenly being treated like a tumor deeply hurt him. He isn&#8217;t being treated unfairly. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they welcome his presence. This environment, which made him aware that he was an Irregularity, made the loneliness in his heart grow larger and larger. The most ironic thing is that he had a great talent for a magic called Sympathy Magic, even though he didn&#8217;t realize it yet&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even though he was unaware of his magic, he still found out&#8230;&#8230; that he wasn&#8217;t welcome here&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He found out&#8230;&#8230; that they&#8217;re not happy with his presence here&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He found out&#8230;&#8230; that he had no place here&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, Kaito confined himself to his room in the mansion and rarely went out. The Marquis, who was in charge of him, pretended to be unaware of this matter, thinking that it would be better if he could live through this year without any trouble. Just like that, Kaito endured and spent the year with painful loneliness&#8230;&#8230; isn&#8217;t what happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, there was a being who found Kaito, who had almost already become a hikikomori in the March, and took an interest in him. It was the Creator God, Shallow Vernal. She took an interest in the irregularity, Kaito, and invited him to her Sanctuary&#8230;&#8230; Or rather, she forcibly kidnapped him and drank tea with him. Then, perhaps on a whim, Shallow Vernal made a suggestion to Kaito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you wish for power, I will give it to you&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; she asked.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1111786784"><div style="float: left; " id="foxaholic-325895116"><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js" type="677e73e8f61dd1383432a749-text/javascript"></script> <ins class="adsbygoogle"

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to this suggestion, the weak-hearted Kaito reached out his trembling hand, turning his imploring eyes to Shallow Vernal&#8230;&#8230; but still, he &#8220;refused&#8221; her suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He himself didn&#8217;t know the reason. But somehow, he felt that if he accepted it, he would never be able to get what wanted. However, the change that the answer brought to Shallow Vernal was dramatic. Shallow Vernal, who liked the way Kaito&#8217;s mind worked, made another suggestion to Kaito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you stay here in the God Realm?&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; she asked. Although her suggestion was sudden&#8230;&#8230; Kaito accepted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, Kaito was puzzled by Shallow Vernal&#8217;s lack of expression and intonationless voice, but for better or worse, he thought of Shallow Vernal as an airhead. The unreserved way in which she stepped into his mind was extremely comforting to him, who had been treated like a tumor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, since he began to stay in the God Realm, Kaito has gradually started changing. As someone invited by Shallow Vernal herself, the Gods treated Kaito with a certain amount of courtesy, but it wasn&#8217;t excessive. The three Supreme Gods were especially concerned of him and were friendly to him as he was caught up in the Hero Summoning. And above all, in the days he spent with Shallow Vernal, who was somewhat absentminded, but showed straightforward affection for him, Kaito&#8217;s heart, which had been stuck in his shell, was saved. Shallow Vernal became more and more fond of the changing Kaito, and when she was alone with him, a smile would sometimes appear on her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At some point, Kaito became &#8220;special&#8221; for Shallow Vernal, and Shallow Vernal also became &#8220;special&#8221; for Kaito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaito, who had completely blown off all his worries and regained his original strength of mind, also came into contact with the Six Kings and the Human Rulers through Shallow Vernal&#8217;s introduction, and began to bring change to many of them. Even though the number of people who liked him increased and the days he spent in this world became full of happiness for him, Shallow Vernal&#8217;s presence still remained in the deepest part of his heart.</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">And&#8230;&#8230; Standing next to Kaito, who had decided to stay in this world after conveying their emotions with each other, was Shallow Vernal who had a soft smile on her face, as if the fact that she had been expressionless before was all a lie.</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;This is the future that they should have arrived at&#8230;&#8230; the future that someone had wanted to arrive at.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, this was what should have happened. She should have moved to reach such a future.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-401221753"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1253806521"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, destiny &#8220;moved the needle forward through the intervention of a third party&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The misaligned cogwheels changed the future they were supposed to arrive in, derailing to a future far different from what it should have been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First&#8230;&#8230; Miyama Kaito wasn&#8217;t the &#8220;only irregularity&#8221;, but one of the three people caught up in the Hero Summoning. The fact that there are others who are in the same situation as him brought great relief to his mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Second&#8230;&#8230; Lilia Albert, the one who happened to summon him, was a noble who doesn&#8217;t act like one, but a kind-hearted woman. She never treated Kaito as a tumor, but took the initiative to talk to him like a friend, confronting him with sincerity. This greatly alleviated the loneliness he felt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Third&#8230;&#8230; The one who saved Miyama Kaito was Kuromueina, not Shallow Vernal. There was nothing she could do. That&#8217;s because when Shallow Vernal finally noticed Kaito&#8217;s arrival in this world, he had already been saved.</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Central Tower standing tall over the city, the venue of the Six Kings Festival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing at the top of it, Shallow Vernal gazed at the figure of Kaito walking towards the Central Tower. She wished for it multiple times&#8230;&#8230; She wished for it a hopelessly large amount of times&#8230;&#8230; She had been moving to make her wish happen&#8230;&#8230; She wanted&#8230;&#8230; to become Kaito&#8217;s ――.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, everything is too late now. The future that Shallow Vernal wanted&#8230;&#8230; left her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Kaito-san. Why can&#8217;t you&#8230;&#8230; just appear&#8230;&#8230; 20 years in the future?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-428029993"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1486254240"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttering in a voice that no one could hear, Shallow Vernal disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The future she saw wasn&#8217;t all that different from the future they&#8217;d arrived in. In fact, even in this future they&#8217;ve arrived in, Kaito still won Shallow Vernal&#8217;s interest. However, there are some things that are definitely different. And for Shallow Vernal, it&#8217;s something she can&#8217;t give up&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one noticed it. No, there&#8217;s no one who can notice it. This is because she had only spoken &#8220;those words&#8221; to Kaito&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaito couldn&#8217;t notice it either. No, he wasn&#8217;t able to understand. What Shallow Vernal had always been telling him&#8230;&#8230; The nuance of her usage of the words &#8220;Just Kuro is unfair.&#8221;, and how she had only ever said it when Kaito appeared in this world&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; Miyama Kaito has become Shallow Vernal&#8217;s ――.</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">However&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; Shallow Vernal&#8230;&#8230; couldn&#8217;t become Miyama Kaito&#8217;s ――.</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">For standing in position she wanted to be in&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; &#8220;was her own Half-body&#8221;.</span></p>
