<h3>Short Story &#8211; Serious-senpai's Room</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, in the usual waiting room, Serious-senpai is reading the 13th Volume of &#8220;I was Caught up in a Hero Summoning, but That World is at Peace&#8221;. A little further away from her, ? ? ? was relaxing with a cup of choccy milk in hand, although it was unclear how she drinks it in her stuffed costume. After concentrating on the book for a while, Serious-senpai closed the book with a grim expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Sweet, spicy. But what&#8217;s most terrifying is that we have yet to hear about his lovers among the Six Kings yet. It rather feels like things are going to accelerate even further from here on out.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Of course, it would. I mean, the Six Kings Festival was originally planned with Kuro-san wanting to go on a date with Kaito-san as a motive, so of course, there would be lots of flirting scenes incoming.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[This sense of hopelessness from knowing what&#8217;s about to come&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Serious-senpai looked up to the heavens, concerned about the future developments, ? ? ? placed a cup of choccy milk in front of her. Serious-senpai isn&#8217;t very fond of sweet stuff, but when offered one like this, she feels uncomfortable refusing, so she holds the choccy milk in hand and drinks it. Of course, ? ? ? knew that Serious-senpai would have a hard time rejecting that choccy milk given to her, so she made it as sweet as she could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Sweet&#8230;&#8230; By the way, the schedule, or rather, the order for the events in the Six Kings Festival seems to have been changed from the Web Novel. If I remember correctly, the Third Day of the festival was originally Isis&#8217; turn, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, that&#8217;s right. The Six Kings Festival arc itself is the longest arc in the entire series, so it seems that they were finding it difficult to find a place to divide it.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh~~ I see, it would be difficult to cut Isis&#8217; story in the middle and continue it to the next volume huh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Other than that, there&#8217;s also that reason for moving Isis-san&#8217;s arc to the next volume. If they&#8217;re going to publish Isis-san&#8217;s festival date, I&#8217;m sure the readers would want illustrations included with it, so it seems like they&#8217;re making adjustments for that as well.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, I guess that&#8217;s the only thing they could do when it comes to the Light Novel, which has page limits&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After continuing their leisurely conversation, Serious-senpai suddenly looked as if she had just thought of something.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That being said, a nice serious flag has been erected! I like the feeling that the Last Boss finally making her move, conducting secret maneuvers behind the sight of others.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Isn&#8217;t that still quite a while away? Time-wise, that would be the end of the year, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If so, that means we&#8217;re getting closer and closer to the precious seriously serious content! I can feel my expectations rising!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;No, I&#8217;m just wondering. For argument&#8217;s sake, if there really were seriously serious developments&#8230;&#8230; What will you do at that time, Serious-senpai?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment she heard ? ? ? &#8216;s words, Serious-senpai stopped moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? You&#8217;re seriously gonna ask such a philosophical question?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Philosophical? No, it&#8217;s just a normal question.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Of course, if things get serious, I, the Incarnation of Seriousness, will be busy, won&#8217;t I?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Serious-senpai&#8217;s answer, ? ? ? put her hand on the chin of her stuffed costume and tilted her head.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-4834261"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1004359032"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;But Serious-senpai.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[There have already been a few serious developments in the past&#8230;&#8230; In the end, you were just complaining in the waiting room when that happened, and weren&#8217;t able to go outside this room, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This room, where Serious-senpai and ? ? ? is currently located, is the &#8220;waiting room for the children treated as unwanted in the main story&#8221;. The fact that she hasn&#8217;t been able to leave this room in the past even when serious development has occurred proves that even if the main story turns out to have serious development&#8230;&#8230; Serious-senpai&#8217;s situation won&#8217;t change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You&#8230;&#8230; Talking about&#8230;&#8230; realistic matters like that&#8230;&#8230; Stop that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Serious-senpai&#8217;s agony still continues&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
