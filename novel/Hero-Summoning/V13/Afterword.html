<h3>Afterword</h3>

 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">For picking up the 13th Volume of &#8220;I was Caught up in a Hero Summoning, but That World is at Peace&#8221;, thank you very much.</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Six Kings have finally begun. The Six Kings Festival arc is the longest arc in the Web Novel, taking up about 200 chapters. For this volume, I have included the first half of the arc, from the First Day to the beginning of the Third Day, but because of certain circumstances, the story that was on the Fourth Day in the Web Novel has been changed to the Third Day. The Six Kings Festival is really very long, and I wanted to summarize the seven days of the festival in three volumes, but if I didn&#8217;t include the Second Day and Third Day in this volume, this arc wouldn&#8217;t be able to fit in three volumes. So, the plan is that I would divide this arc into three different volumes, the first three days for Volume 13, the continuation of the Third Day to the Fifth Day for Volume 14, and the Sixth Day and Seventh Day for Volume 15. In addition, since there are so many new characters introduced in the Web Novel version of the Six Kings Festival arc, I have been gradually introducing them in advance in the previous 12 volumes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From this point on, it seems that Shallow Vernal is starting to make her move. Though I say that, there&#8217;s almost no serious development. Well, there may be some serious-like atmosphere in this arc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, just as she proclaimed, Shallow Vernal is the Last Boss of the first part of the story. Yes, the first part&#8230;&#8230; She&#8217;s the Last Boss of the first part only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, in the Web Novel, this matter with Shallow Vernal is already finished, and the story has moved on to the second part. Well, as I&#8217;m sure the readers know from the development of the story so far, after saying his salutations to the people who had been taking care of him back in his original world, Kaito will move to Trinia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the second part of the story, after moving to Trinia, the one-year limit is no longer in effect, so there&#8217;s not as much seriousness as the first part. Well, I will tell you more about the second part after the story has progressed that far, but in this Six Kings Festival arc, there aren&#8217;t so many additional stories, but there&#8217;s that story related to Funf. Funf is a character who hadn&#8217;t appeared in the Web Novel at this point, so the majority of the stories related to her are original ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, characters such as Ozma and Illness, who have been in the series for a long time, originally made their first appearance at the Six Kings Festival, so it can be said that this arc has the most differences from the Web Novel so far. Of course, we will do our best to make it enjoyable for those who haven&#8217;t read the Web Novel, so we hope you will look forward to future volumes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you for reading to the end. I hope to see you again in the next volume.</span></p>
