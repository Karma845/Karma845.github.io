<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; World King's Festival</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The morning of the second day of the Six Kings Festival. I thought that I would sleep with the trio of Kuro, Isis-san and Alice again, but it seems like they noticed that I hadn&#8217;t slept at all last night, and Kuro suggested that we sleep together every other day. I guess we can&#8217;t just not sleep together huh&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, thanks to her suggestion, I was able to get a good night&#8217;s sleep. I think I&#8217;ll be able to do my best on the second day now. Speaking of which, I wonder where Kuro and the others are? Are they preparing breakfast? As I walked down the huge corridor to the cafeteria, I heard familiar voices coming from behind the other side of the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[K- Kuro-san, I really think you should stop already&#8230;&#8230; That isn&#8217;t a baby castella anymore, that&#8217;s just &#8220;dark matter in the shape of a baby castella&#8221;!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You see&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m always seeking new flavors. I want to be an adventurer.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s with that look of enlightenment on your face!? If Kaito-san eats that, rather than being an adventurer, he&#8217;ll end up going on an adventure to another world, you know!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s quite the frightening conversation you&#8217;re having there, oi! Is it a new creation? Did Kuro make another new creation? This is bad, my sixth sense is letting out quite a terrifying alarm. Let&#8217;s just quietly leave this place before they notice&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Kaito&#8230;&#8230; Good morning.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;G- Good&#8230;&#8230; morning.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, reality is a cruel mistress. Just as I was about to run away, the door in front of me opened, revealing the lovely Isis-san wearing an apron. And then, the two people inside the room would obviously notice me&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, Kaito-kun! Lookie, lookie, I made a new baby castella!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-240331482"><div style="float: left; " id="foxaholic-865611903"><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js" type="9c0a7e023c624e327514ec9e-text/javascript"></script> <ins class="adsbygoogle"

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of Kuro, who had a big smile on her face when she found me&#8230;&#8230; is an &#8220;unknown red-spotted something that glows golden&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; That won&#8217;t do, its color clearly screams that it isn&#8217;t something a human should bring into their mouth. Even Alice is desperately telling me to escape&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;K- Kuro. Its colors look dangerous, doesn&#8217;t it&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- That&#8217;s not the case! This is delicious&#8230;&#8230; I think. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t tasted it myself&#8221;, but I think it&#8217;s delicious.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those few final words clearly sound ominous, you know!? That&#8217;s definitely no good. With the words she said, that definitely doesn&#8217;t taste good at all!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, in the first place, why didn&#8217;t you taste it when you&#8217;re cooking it first&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ehh, but I want Kaito-kun to be the one to taste it first&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The apron-clad Kuro, whose cheeks were slightly blushing red, looked so cute. N- No, but still&#8230;&#8230; They probably used the right ingredients to make it, so at worst, it&#8217;ll just taste bad, right? A- After all, Kuro made it for me&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;If it&#8217;s just o- one bite&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yay~~!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-902128079"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1980667215"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kaito-san, don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;re spoiling Kuro-san too much!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I know what Alice is trying to say, and I am well aware of it. But if I refuse to eat it, Kuro will have a sad look on her face. And that&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t want to happen. If it&#8217;s to protect Kuro&#8217;s smile, I&#8217;ll take on any challenge, even if it means &#8220;dying&#8221;!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, you don&#8217;t have to eat a mouthful,okay!? Don&#8217;t speak about dying, okay!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Now, now, enjoy it while it&#8217;s fresh out of the oven~~]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You&#8217;ll just ignore what he was saying!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Alice&#8217;s tsukkomis in full swing, I pick up one of these frighteningly-colored baby castellas. Uwaahh, even though it has such a color, it&#8217;s this soft&#8230;&#8230; F- Fufufu, the path to challenging the future sure is heart-pounding&#8230;&#8230; the trembling all over my body must be the shivers from excitement. Even the sweat running down my back, it&#8217;s probably just my increasing fighting spirit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- Thank you for the food&#8230;&#8230; Ugghhh!? Agghhhh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the smiling Kuro, I moved my trembling hands and threw the baby castella into my mouth. Along with its soft and squishy texture, an inexpressibly bad taste spread in my mouth. Ah, but this might be surprisingly good&#8230;&#8230; my tongue became numb and eating it was quite the hair-raising experience, but I guess you could call it some sort of delicacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ahh, if it isn&#8217;t Mom and Dad&#8230;&#8230; What are you waving at me for? Hahaha, I can&#8217;t hear what you&#8217;re saying, you know&#8230;&#8230; wait a moment, I&#8217;ll be going there&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kaito-san!? Get a hold of yourself! Wherever they are, please don&#8217;t follow them!!!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-373480441"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1978330056">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Alice&#8217;s voice within my foggy thoughts, my consciousness slowly disappeared.</span></p>
 
 <p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kaito fainted after eating a baby castella, an awkward look appeared on Kuromueina&#8217;s face. The nearby Alice fiercely flared up at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hey, Kuro-san!? Kaito-san started hallucinating, you know!? What did you put in there!!!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[E- Errr&#8230;&#8230; First is &#8220;Golden Frog meat&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What were you thinking when you put frog meat into a baby castella!? Are you the Devil!!!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For once, Alice&#8217;s words are completely correct, and Kuromueina sits in a seiza, curling her body smaller as she receives Alice&#8217;s scolding. Looking at Kuromueina, Alice let out a big sigh before carrying Kaito to the sofa. In the midst of such turmoil, only one person&#8230;&#8230; Isis was the only one who acted as if it had nothing to do with her, as she went to the kitchen to make a lovely bento. Arranging colorful and tasty dishes in a round-shaped container, she then finished it with a cute heart symbol in the center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I hope&#8230;&#8230; Kaito will be pleased.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The morning commotion caused by Kuromueina coming up with a new baby castella. Kuromueina, who was making a bizarre baby castella, and Alice, who struggled to stop her. The result was&#8230;&#8230; Isis, who had made lunch without caring about what these two were doing, was the sole winner.</span></p>
 
 <p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the morning of the second day of the Six Kings Festival, I headed out the tower, leisurely stretching out my body. Even so, it seems like I have slept for a long time. Well, I feel like something terrible happened, but I don&#8217;t really remember. Putting the inconsistencies in my memories aside, Isis-san made a lunchbox for me. I was supposed to go around the festival with Lillywood-san today, but since Lillywood-san doesn&#8217;t eat, Isis-san took care that I have something to eat. Seriously, I feel lucky to have a wonderful girlfriend like Isis-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I walked out of the tower, thinking about such things, I saw that the scenery was completely different from yesterday. I mean, literally different. After just one night, the city, the venue of the festival, was overflowing with plants as if we had entered a forest, with large trees and beautiful flowers growing everywhere. Meanwhile, even the buildings had been changed to resemble log houses, transforming the city into something that resembled the streets of Rigforeshia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I- I&#8217;ve heard that they would change everything every single day, but seeing the change happen in person, I realize that the power of the Six Kings is really quite extraordinary. However, I like this green scenery a lot. It somehow makes me feel calm. I&#8217;m not really an expert about these things, but the term &#8220;immersing yourself in a forest&#8221; exists, so the place may have a relaxing effect. While looking at the flowers swaying in the slight breeze, I moved my gaze to search for Lillywood-san&#8230;&#8230; and found her immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, Lillywood-san&#8230;&#8230; or rather, her form where she&#8217;s one with a tree really stands out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Good morning, Lillywood-san&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, did I keep you waiting?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good morning, Kaito-san. No, I&#8217;ve just finished handing over the operation to my followers.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the first day of the Six Kings Festival, Megiddo-san gave a verbal overview of his festival, which also served as the opening ceremony, but from the second day onwards, it seems like we would receive information about the day&#8217;s festival at our accommodations or at the entrance of the city. The theme of today&#8217;s seemed to be &#8220;Interacting with Nature&#8221;, a theme which certainly seems like Lillywood-san. However, the guide only told me the overview of the festival, saying that we should only look forward to the events, which made me feel curious about it. According to the guidebook I bought from Alice, it seems like they would also be selling decorative plants somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Even so, the place looks amazing. The scenery is beautiful, and I&#8217;m curious to see what kind of festival it will be.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufufu, let&#8217;s see. There are a lot of events here&#8230;&#8230; but today, we will be selling some rare and rarely available plants.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Is that so?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1476706028"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-447636176"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, for example, the plant called Medhvana, which was used to wash Kaito-san&#8217;s body, is only found in some areas of the Demon Realm, so it&#8217;s quite expensive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whoa there, Lillywood-san. Let&#8217;s not dig up what happened yesterday. I&#8217;m the kind of person who likes to look ahead into the future if possible&#8230;&#8230; Or rather, I&#8217;ll remember and start getting conscious again, so please don&#8217;t mention that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[W- Which reminds me&#8230;&#8230; I- I read that I would receive a seedling of the World Tree as a memorabilia, b- but I wonder if that&#8217;s alright? Size-wise, I mean&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a rather forceful topic deviation, but it was actually something I was curious about. The World Tree, Lillywood-san&#8217;s main body, is a huge tree that pierces the sky&#8230;&#8230; That tree is even far taller than Magnawell-san vertically. Of course, I wouldn&#8217;t have the space to grow such a huge tree. When I asked her how long it would take to grow and stuff like that, Lillywood-san calmly explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh, please don&#8217;t worry. The seedling I&#8217;m going to give you has been modified, so you can grow it in a pot.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- Is that so. I&#8217;m relieved to hear that.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The World Tree is said to be a mass of magic power of Healing. A decoction of its leaves is said to cure all diseases, and its fruit can be eaten to heal all kinds of wounds&#8230;&#8230; Well, they were a bit over-exaggerated, but since it always carries a small amount of magic power of Healing, it will help you relax.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps, feeling embarrassed to give an explanation about something that could be said as her own body, Lillywood-san explained to me with a faint blush on her cheeks. When she said that I could grow it in a pot, does that mean I can imagine it as some kind of decorative plant like bonsais? If it&#8217;s that big, I guess I can be relieved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However, there are some negative effects after it was modified&#8230;&#8230; At best, it will only produce one fruit per year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, that&#8217;s enough already. It&#8217;s important, so I&#8217;ll say it again, that&#8217;s enough already. Or rather, it would still bear fruit huh&#8230;&#8230; A Fruit of the World Tree, I mean. For the world&#8217;s rarest fruit to be something you could easily harvest&#8230;&#8230; Well, I&#8217;ve been using Fruits of the World Tree as an energy drink, so I guess I can&#8217;t really say that&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1774643280"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-494596430"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see. I understand. I&#8217;ll take good care of it.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;d be happy if that&#8217;s the case.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I haven&#8217;t had the experience of growing a plant other than the loofah I grew back when I was in elementary school but&#8230;&#8230; It isn&#8217;t something that I can just let die. I&#8217;ll buy a book later and study how to properly raise it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now then, I guess we should get going.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes. Once again, I&#8217;ll be in your care today.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me too. I&#8217;m glad to be going around with you today, Kaito-san.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She really has quite a bad habit of nonchalantly saying such things with a smile. Because of what happened yesterday, I somehow feel like I&#8217;m being strangely conscious of her. A- Anyway, Lillywood-san is going to show me around, so let&#8217;s just make sure we enjoy the day.</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the second day of the Six Kings Festival, having the theme &#8220;Interacting with Nature&#8221;, I walked with Lillywood-san through a path lined with colorful flowers in full bloom. A single flower blooming on the side of the road looks lovely, but seeing a carpet of such beautiful flowers looks wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That reminds me. When Kaito-san first visited the Demon Realm, I was also the one who guided you.&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1317607229"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1673253373"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh&#8230;&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t that long ago, but thinking about that time kinda makes me feel nostalgic.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nowadays, thanks to my Teleportation Magic Tool, I can come to the Demon Realm on my own. However, the first time I went to visit Isis-san&#8217;s castle, Lillywood-san acted as my escort and guide. At that time, we encountered a Behemoth in the Demon Realm and met Magnawell-san. Hmmm, the impact was diminished by Magnawell-san&#8217;s size, but even that Behemoth was as big as a Kaiju. I wondered if Bell would also grow to his size in the future? If it&#8217;s possible, I&#8217;d really like it if he stays at his current cute size but&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, at that time, I didn&#8217;t think that Kaito-san would become this much of a part of my life.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[This much, you say&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t feel like things have changed that much though.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, a lot of things have happened in the past few months since Lillywood-san showed me around the Demon Realm back then. Meeting the Six Kings, challenging the depths hidden beneath Kuro&#8217;s heart, confessing to Isis-san, returning to Sieg-san&#8217;s hometown, settling the incidents in Lilia-san&#8217;s past, reunion in the Hydra Kingdom, meeting Eden-san, Alice&#8217;s past, confrontation with Dr. Vier&#8230;&#8230; I also went to visit the God Realm. Wait, aren&#8217;t the months I spent here a bit too stacked?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufufu, you are someone that I can&#8217;t measure. You are an unexpected and strange person, in all sorts of meanings.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Is that a compliment?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, of course. I greatly admire you. However, this is difficult. I wonder what these feelings I have for you? Trust, friendship, fondness, awe, affection, interest, respect, infatuation, gratitude&#8230;&#8230; I just can&#8217;t find the right words to describe it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leisurely walking, Lillywood-san&#8217;s gaze slightly turned upward as she murmured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;However, I am sure that I don&#8217;t have any negative feelings towards you. If it&#8217;s possible, I hope we can continue to have a close relationship even in the future.&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1044595184"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-808285121"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yes. I also feel the same way.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Fufu, the atmosphere turned a bit strange, didn&#8217;t it? Let&#8217;s pull ourselves together and start going around the festival.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere certainly was starting to make me strangely feel embarrassed, but I don&#8217;t dislike such an atmosphere. However, strangely enough, I felt a little closer to Lillywood-san than before. Just like Lillywood-san, I also don&#8217;t know how to put what I&#8217;m feeling for her into words&#8230;&#8230; But one thing I&#8217;m sure of is that I have favorable feelings for Lillywood-san.</span></p>

 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;A- As expected of Lillywood-sama.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Vier quietly watched Kaito and Lillywood while hiding behind a large tree, Neun called out from behind her with a dumbfounded expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, you see, festivals are so uplifting, aren&#8217;t they?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[H- Huhh&#8230;&#8230; Well, that&#8217;s certainly true&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-805060568"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1465261388"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[How uplifting something is can be a very important factor in love, you know? In other words, the Six Kings Festival is an event that I can&#8217;t miss when I attack Miyama-kun!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;So? For you to go to the trouble of closing your clinic, what exactly are you doing?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Vier&#8217;s passionate words as she clenched her fist, Neun asks her back with a distant look in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn, about that&#8230;&#8230; I haven&#8217;t participated in a festival for a long time, so wouldn&#8217;t I need to study the things I need to do?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;No, I don&#8217;t think you really need to study though?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn, unnn, as one would expect, you can&#8217;t make a great attack without preparation, don&#8217;t you think?

It&#8217;s not stalking if I have received permission from Lillywood-sama!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s with your energetic way of saying that!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Vier was originally a reckless person, and only her energy in doing things is tremendous. Or perhaps, rather than saying that, it would be better to describe her as someone who acts on the spur of the moment. As a result of her recklessness though, Neun got caught up&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1884444186"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-524571845"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[In the first place, rather than ask what I am doing&#8230;&#8230; Aren&#8217;t I supposed to be asking what you&#8217;re doing, Hikari?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ehh? M- Me?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Who else do you think I&#8217;m talking with here!?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overwhelmed by Vier&#8217;s angry look, Neun looked frightened. However, Vier didn&#8217;t mind her reaction at all and continued to speak, grabbing Neun&#8217;s shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Listen here, okay? It&#8217;s exactly because you&#8217;re not lovers yet, that&#8217;s why you have to be aggressive&#8230;&#8230; Since Kuromu-sama is even supporting us, we can&#8217;t just act shy all the time.

No, thank you. I have a bad feeling about this&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Of course, I want to have a good relationship with Miyama-kun, but I&#8217;m also rooting for Hikari&#8230;&#8230; so I&#8217;ll go ask Kuromu-sama for help!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Please listen to me! Please, could you just listen to my opinion a little&#8230;&#8230; Ah, wait, Vier!? She started running already&#8230;&#8230; wait, look at where you&#8217;re running! There are tree roots where you&#8217;re running to&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? &#8212;&#8212;&#8211;Fugyaahhh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Vier vigorously ran off, but as klutzy as usual, she tripped over a root at her feet and dived face-first into the ground.</span></p>
 
 <p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am aware that I am taking a step or two too fast, but I keep going. I wonder if I&#8217;m on the right path or the wrong one&#8230;&#8230; Even if people can predict their future, they can&#8217;t accurately determine what is about to come. It&#8217;s always after you get there that you would find out if the path you&#8217;ve taken was the right one or not. And now, a huge wall was standing in front of me. The wall was supposed to be beautiful, made up of beautiful flowers intertwined together, but for the current me, it only shows how cruel reality is as it blocked my path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly looking back, I saw Lillywood-san with a gentle smile on her face. Even though I say that Lillywood-san had a gentle smile on her face though, I somehow felt like she was teasing me. Sensing that I don&#8217;t have any path but defeat, I opened my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Lillywood-san&#8230;&#8230; Please give me a &#8220;hint&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufufu, I understand&#8230;&#8230; Let&#8217;s see. I suggest that you return back to the third corner behind us, the path with blue flowers.&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1877232440"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-924945497"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ugghhh&#8230;&#8230; I- Is that so&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard Lillywood-san&#8217;s words, my shoulders slumped as I started to walk back to where I came from. This is the third time I&#8217;ve made a U-turn&#8230;&#8230; Hmmm, this is somehow a little harder than I imagined huh? I thought it would be easier for me to reach the goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- This place was much bigger than I imagined.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, this place is one of the main attractions of the festival.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was currently challenging one of the attractions, the &#8220;Flower Labyrinth&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; Just as its name states, it&#8217;s a labyrinth of flowers. This is a huge labyrinth built around a type of flower that has a large growing stem. It&#8217;s an attraction that one can challenge while looking at the various flowers and enjoying their pleasant scent. However, it seemed to be a rather seriously designed labyrinth, and it was quite difficult&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ve been hitting dead ends many times since a while ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Lillywood-san knows the answer to this labyrinth, so she doesn&#8217;t interfere and only gives me hints when I ask for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Speaking of which, the flowers in the blue path have quite the beautiful color, don&#8217;t they?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This flower is called the Blue Moon Flower, and it grows in the western part of the Demon Realm. It&#8217;s a flower that only blooms at night.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s just before noon though?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We&#8217;re using a special magic technique to make the area around this place appear to be night.&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1621996444"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1828982376"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Fumu, I see.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The opportunity to see it under the bright light like this is rare.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deep blue flowers that were circular like the full moon&#8230;&#8230; You apparently don&#8217;t get the chance to see something like this so clearly. When I heard that, I felt like I was having a very precious experience. Let&#8217;s look at the flowers a bit more. In the pathway a few distance in front of me, there was a rare flower with very fine petals that were fun to look at. When I was in Japan, I didn&#8217;t have much of a chance to look at flowers, but looking at them like this is nice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;The labyrinth is difficult, but it&#8217;s fun to see all the different flowers like this. Of course, it&#8217;s only possible since Lillywood-san was explaining about them to me&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear you say that. Well then, let&#8217;s get lost a few more times to find some rare flowers, shall we?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;d really like to look at them while smoothly advancing through the labyrinth though&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufufu.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though the labyrinth was quite a struggle, the banter was fun and the leisurely atmosphere around was very comfortable. As expected, I don&#8217;t want to keep on getting lost and go on a conquest towards all the paths in this labyrinth, but if walking through this labyrinth with Lillywood-san was this much fun&#8230;&#8230; I guess hitting a few more dead ends isn&#8217;t that bad.</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really like to punch the me of the &#8220;two hours back then&#8221; for thinking such a thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;F- Finally reached the goal.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-981970042"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-416351155"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Congratulations. You&#8217;ve walked through almost 80% of the labyrinth huh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, of course, I didn&#8217;t walk for two hours straight, as I stopped to look at the flowers along the way while Lillywood-san explained them to us, but I did get lost quite a bit. Part of it was because the labyrinth was quite huge to begin with, but there were also other reasons why it took so long. I don&#8217;t know who made this labyrinth&#8230;&#8230; but in the latter half of the labyrinth, there were a lot of paths that I walked for a long time, only to end up at a dead end&#8230;&#8230; I think this place was specially made just to tease those who challenge it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I don&#8217;t think this is the case, but the one who created this labyrinth&#8230;&#8230; Was it Lillywood-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t have much experience with such things&#8230;&#8230; So I asked &#8220;Shalltear&#8221; to do it for me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I- Is that so&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They have chosen the worst person to make this labyrinth. I see, Alice huh&#8230;&#8230; No wonder why it&#8217;s so difficult and the damage is so great when one makes a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You must be tired from all the walking. It was just around lunchtime, so why don&#8217;t we have lunch in the nearby plaza?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes. I agree.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Do you have any food prepared, Kaito-san? If not, we can go to the area with the stalls first&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, there&#8217;s no problem regarding that. Isis-san prepared a bento for me.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1789056528"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1297242458"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Well then, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nodding my head at the thankful suggestion, I moved to the plaza with Lillywood-san. Although it was lunchtime, the plaza was relatively empty as most of the participants seemed to have moved to the area with the stalls. Finding a large bench among them, we sat down and I opened the bento that Isis-san had given me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ooohh.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but exclaim. What appeared was a very cute bento set. The onigiri that she prepared knowing that I love eating rice, were in the shape of hearts, and seemed to be filled with various fillings. There were also my favorite mini hamburger steak and some wieners that were cut into the shape of an octopus. It looks very tasty, but more importantly, it took a lot of time and effort to make&#8230;&#8230; Even from just its appearance, I could tell that they were made with a lot of love and care, which somehow made me feel warm inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about cooking, but that looks very beautiful.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling moved about the bento Isis-san gave me, I nodded upon Lillywood-san&#8217;s words.</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">After lunch, I was guided around the festival by Lillywood-san again. From Lillywood-san&#8217;s explanation, it seems like she had chosen to show me around the rare plants, and seeing all the new plants I saw were truly new to me, making me feel thrilled for someone of my age. Then, we went around a few places and came to an area where there were a lot of long, thin trees, about three meters tall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[O- Ooohhh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you think? They&#8217;re interesting trees, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-835441831"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2103865692"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. It feels like they&#8217;re rubber.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tree that Lillywood-san introduced me to this time was very soft and bends when I pushed it with my hand. It seems to be used as a material for cushions and sofas, because of its excellent texture. I kinda want to buy one now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The platform over there is also made from this tree. You can walk on it with your shoes on, so how about you experience walking on it yourself?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Lillywood-san&#8217;s urging, I went to the platform made of soft wood. When I stepped on it, I felt my feet being bounced back, just like that bouncy playground the children played in, and my body moved up and down a bit as I walked forward. Ahh, this is kinda fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Heehhh&#8230;&#8230; This is a lot more flexible than I thought it would be&#8230;&#8230; Eh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s also very comfortable to sit on. Unnn? Is something the matter?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, nothing&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned to Lillywood-san to tell her what I thought, but at that moment, she got on the platform too. Thereupon, what do you think happened? What happened is that Lillywood-san&#8217;s body was moving up and down due to the platform&#8217;s rebound, her bountiful twin hills greatly swaying along. My eyes couldn&#8217;t help but be glued to them. I&#8217;ve heard that women are sensitive to such gazes, so I hurriedly averted my eyes but&#8230;&#8230; Lillywood-san didn&#8217;t seem  to notice at all, as she&#8217;s just looking at me with her head tilting in wonder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Her guard really is too loose. No, but even so, Lillywood-san&#8217;s breasts really are quite big. They were large enough that their size is clearly visible even when wearing loose-fitting ethnic-style clothing. In addition, they&#8217;re beautifully round and weren&#8217;t drooping at all. I admit, slender women are more to my taste&#8230;&#8230; but when they have breasts as beautiful as Lillywood-san&#8217;s, I can&#8217;t help but follow them with my eyes regardless of my tastes. I heard someone say that big is better than small, but I guess this is exactly what they meant.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-610405505"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1860610482"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;No, wait a moment there! What the heck am I thinking!? It would be disrespectful to Lillywood-san to look at her with such dirty eyes. Even if it&#8217;s impossible to not look at them because it&#8217;s in a man&#8217;s nature to look at them from time to time, let&#8217;s make sure that we don&#8217;t think of anything strange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kaito-san? Is something the matter?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, no! I was just happy to have Lillywood-san show me around that I was just a bit absorbed. Now, let&#8217;s move on!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Ah, yes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Embarrassed, I somewhat forcefully moved on from the conversation with Lillywood-san, and headed to the next location. I wonder what this is though? This strange embarrassment I&#8217;m feeling&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t think I had much of a chance to talk with Lillywood-san like this. When I visited the Demon Realm before, I was only being seriously guided and escorted, so Lillywood-san had a serious expression on her face most of the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, yesterday and today&#8230;&#8230; I feel that Lillywood-san is showing me her true self. The gentle and kind part of her was the same as always, but she showed me not only her usual gentle smile, but also her bright, cheerful smile. And now, she&#8217;s showing me a cute gesture of tilting her head. Perhaps, I was feeling strangely embarrassed because she was showing me a feminine gesture instead of her face as the World King. I described Lillywood-san yesterday and today as someone that is too unguarded. However, if I were to describe her accurately&#8230;&#8230; I should rather say that &#8220;Lillywood-san, who never showed an opening before, started opening up to me yesterday&#8221;. It makes me feel that Lillywood-san deeply trusts me, which honestly makes me happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What plants will we see next?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Next will be, let&#8217;s see&#8230;&#8230; How about we go to the area with the carpet of small flowers?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh, that sounds like it would be beautiful just by hearing it. I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-971029288"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1967095301"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A carpet of flowers huh. I can somehow imagine it, but this is something held at a humongous event, the Six Kings Festival&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sure it would be more spectacular than I imagined. I feel my expectations about it suddenly rising. Then, I suddenly noticed that Lillywood-san was staring at my face. Tilting my head, I asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Lillywood-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Do you like nature, Kaito-san?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. Though I said that, I&#8217;m not as knowledgeable as Lillywood-san&#8230;&#8230; All I can say is that nature is beautiful and relaxing&#8230;&#8230; so I like it a lot.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Having knowledge is convenient, but it isn&#8217;t necessary to love nature. The plants are happy just because Kaito-san likes them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thereupon, Lillywood-san paused for a bit, before a smile as beautiful as a fully-bloomed flower appeared on her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Of course, I also like you, who says you like nature, very much.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- Thank you very much.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufufu. Let&#8217;s go then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she told me this in a gentle voice, a small but very beautiful peach-colored flower bloomed on Lillywood-san&#8217;s head, a little above her right ear. I could be mistaken, but that flower on her head&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; It seems to indicate that the fondness Lillywood-san had for me is true.</span></p>
 
 <p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finished visiting some of the main attractions, the sun is about to set. Thanks to Lillywood-san&#8217;s easy-to-understand guidance, I was able to fully enjoy the festival even though I&#8217;m not very familiar with plants. I&#8217;m really grateful for that. And now, Lillywood-san is bringing me&#8230;&#8230; to what could be said as the main event of the Festival&#8217;s second day. It was a huge flower garden that took up the entire area north of the Central Tower. The colorful flowers were lined up like a pattern, creating an unmistakably picturesque scenery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Lillywood-san, it was her &#8220;masterpiece&#8221;, and it certainly was really amazing. It looks like a giant rainbow from some places, while it looks like an intricate ring of colors from another. There was also a small hill where one could find a different kind of beauty. The flower box was like a jewel box, as every time you looked at something, you would find new discoveries. Before I knew it, I found myself sitting side by side with Lillywood-san on a hill overlooking the flower garden, looking at the flower garden, losing track of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the sky began to be dyed in madder red, I could see a different kind of melancholic beauty, and I spoke to the nearby Lillywood-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Speaking of which, Lillywood-san. There&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been wanting to ask you for a while now&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m at it anyway, so may I ask you something now?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Yes, I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no one else on the hill at the moment, probably because the other participants were shying away from Lillywood-san&#8217;s presence. I think it&#8217;s a good time to talk about things since it&#8217;s only the two of us at the moment. That&#8217;s why, I decided to ask her about something that has been bothering me for a while&#8230;&#8230; a certain misgiving I have regarding Lillywood-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ummm, I&#8217;m sorry if this is just my misunderstanding. It&#8217;s just that, Lillywood-san&#8230;&#8230; Could it be that you and Alice&#8230;&#8230; Phantasmal King doesn&#8217;t get along?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Why do you think so?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;When I was advised by Lillywood-san at the Sacred Tree Festival, somehow&#8230;&#8230; I kinda feel that Lillywood-san was &#8220;scared&#8221; of Alice&#8230;&#8230; or something like that?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1244819665"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2039925730"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve always wanted to ask this. However, I never had the opportunity to ask it because of the content of what I&#8217;m asking. Back at the Sacred Tree Festival, Lillywood-san&#8217;s expression while she&#8217;s talking about Alice&#8230;&#8230; the Phantasmal King, it&#8217;s as if she was talking about an unknown being&#8230;&#8230; No, the atmosphere around her was as if she was talking about someone she couldn&#8217;t comprehend. For me, Alice is my best friend and my irreplaceable lover&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s why I wanted to ask this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Lillywood-san heard what I said, she was silent for a while before she let out a light sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m really no match against you, Kaito-san.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Then?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, it is as you said. If it was &#8220;at that time&#8221;, certainly&#8230;&#8230; I was afraid of Shalltear. No, it might not be appropriate to say that I&#8217;m afraid of her&#8230;&#8230; I guess it would be better to say &#8220;I&#8217;m creeped out &#8220;by her.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Creeped out huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gazing at the flower garden dyed in the redness of dusk, Lillywood-san began to talk about the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;She suddenly appeared in front of us one day. As a being of great power, her sudden appearance&#8230;&#8230; that in itself isn&#8217;t the problem. If Kuromueina brought her to us, we wouldn&#8217;t have hesitated to accept her as family.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1544483260"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1906197024"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The cheerful and energetic Shalltear quickly made friends with everyone&#8230;&#8230; Even though she&#8217;s playing the fool with a smile, she still somehow draws a line between us&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s as if there are dark flames hidden behind her smile&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, Lillywood-san faintly noticed the things she was hiding huh. However, she wasn&#8217;t quite sure what it was. This must be why she felt that Alice was so creepy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s as if she was looking at something else while looking at us&#8230;&#8230; It was only about a thousand years after Shalltear&#8217;s arrival in this world that these thoughts became clear to me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Did Alice do something?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;At that time, the Demon Realm was a very chaotic place. There were many powerful beings&#8230;&#8230; Count-rank Demons just about anywhere, each of which were doing as they pleased. The most powerful being in the Demon Realm, Kuromueina, had the power to rule the Demon Realm, but she respected the freedom of each individual, and as a result, you could say that it was a much rougher era than today.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However, that chaotic Demon Realm&#8230;&#8230; was changed by a single person.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;And that person is Alice?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I reflexively asked back, Lillywood-san quietly nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Among the powerful Demons, Shalltear secretly erased those she perceived as unnecessary to the world. She did it so cold-heartedly, in a really clever way that we didn&#8217;t even notice&#8230;&#8230; By the time we noticed it, &#8220;more than 70%&#8221; of those powerful Demons had been erased by her alone.&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-882211203"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1511392102"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However, that&#8217;s not all that she did. At the same time as she did this, she increased the number of subordinates, acting as her limbs, and in just a thousand years, she was able to spread her roots behind the vast Demon Realm. Using her ability to manipulate information, she was able to bring order to the Demon Realm&#8230;&#8230; Constructing ranks like the &#8220;Six Kings&#8221; and the &#8220;Peerage-holders&#8221;.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Come to think of it, Ozma-san told me a story like that.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He had been Megiddo&#8217;s subordinate even back then after all. He&#8217;s one of the oldest ones among the Six Kings&#8217; executives&#8230;&#8230; Going back to the subject, the reason why Shalltear divided the Demon Race was apparently to make it easier to manage information&#8230;&#8230; It was for her own benefit, as she said herself.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;What a selfish person that is. That Shalltear was quite nasty, wasn&#8217;t she? There certainly isn&#8217;t anything wrong with being selfish, but the&#8212;&#8212;- Fugyaaahhh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was some idiot who interrupted our serious conversation, so I reflexively drove my knuckle on her head. I turned back to Lillywood-san to ask her to resume the story that was interrupted by the idiot&#8217;s intrusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ummm~~ Kaito-san, why am I being made to sit in a &#8220;seiza&#8221;?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If you keep on interrupting, the story won&#8217;t go anywhere at all, so just stay there and keep quiet.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You haven&#8217;t been treating Alice-chan well these days, don&#8217;t you think? Alice-chan is your cutie, cute, cute lover, you know? I think it&#8217;s better if you pamper me more! Or rather, please pamper me more! Please give me a hug!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry for that, Lillywood-san. Please continue.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-762769789"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-740409502"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You&#8217;re ignoring me!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The story really isn&#8217;t making any progress at all, so I&#8217;ll just leave the idiot at the side and ask Lillywood-san to continue. Lillywood-san gave an astounded look at Alice, who was making a fuss even while sitting in a seiza, before nodding once and resumed her story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s go back to the story&#8230;&#8230; But before that, let me say this for Shalltear&#8217;s honor&#8230;&#8230; The 70% of High-ranking Demons that she erased were all those who acted unruly, using their power as a shield. They were like the pus of the Demon Realm, tormenting and killing good and powerless Demons, so I think she acted with a certain amount of thought.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I see.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, to be honest, I haven&#8217;t had any doubts regarding that from the beginning. There were certainly times where Alice unemotionally acted upon something, but she isn&#8217;t the kind of person who would kill innocent people indiscriminately. I have some faith in her regarding that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Here! Here! Objection!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;What is it? Shalltear.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Lillywood-san&#8230;&#8230; You don&#8217;t really have to mind the idiot, you know?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My apologies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gentle Lillywood-san couldn&#8217;t ignore the idiot who raised her hand to advocate for herself and reflexively replied. I wondered if she was going to interrupt the conversation again, but I turned to Alice to ask her what she wanted now.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1639759901"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1189084231">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[This is very important, so I&#8217;ll say this&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ve only erased &#8220;60%&#8221; of them! The other 10% were done by &#8220;Pandora&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Pandora-san did?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, well, Pandora, you see&#8230;&#8230; While I was dealing with scum who kidnapped people they had their eyes on and repeatedly conducted perverted experiments on them, I picked her up by chance~~ Then, I raised her! Howe&#8212;-ver, I don&#8217;t know what went wrong, but when we conduct search and investigation of scum Demons, she would torture them so much that &#8220;they would beg to be killed&#8221;, and after that, as we were conducting erasure and destruction missions, she grew up having a &#8220;peculiar fetish&#8221; before I knew it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The heck is that, that sounds really disturbing, you know!? Just when I was thinking that Pandora-san had a painful past, such thoughts were immediately scattered by the latter half of your story, you know!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Not only has she become loyal in a strange way, she&#8217;s &#8220;extremely sadistic, but at the same time, she&#8217;s freaking masochistic to certain people&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; She would even watch me sometimes as I was being scolded by Kaito-san, &#8220;with her fingers in her mouth, drooling&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t want to know! Eh? I mean, I&#8217;m also within those certain people!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Incidentally, after yesterday&#8217;s festival&#8230;&#8230; She even told me &#8220;The moment when Miyama-sama stared at the disgraceful me while I was disciplining that foolish beast was the best&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; Her face completely looked like a woman in heat!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What the heck is going on in her head!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s dangerous, Pandora-san, I mean. She&#8217;s quite the intense one. Perhaps, was she thinking &#8220;For him to scold my absolute superior Shalltear-sama&#8230;&#8230; I wish he could scold me too&#8221; or something like that? If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;m going to acknowledge her now as the most fearsome person in the world, right up next to Eden-san!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8220;W- Well, let&#8217;s just put that aside&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1455693741"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-907093163"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, no, that&#8217;s a big problem for me, so I&#8217;d like it if we don&#8217;t put something that big aside&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Please do your best.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Could you please stop with the unpleasant cheering!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I hang my head while shuddering at such thoughts, Lillywood-san put in an unpleasant follow-up before resuming the story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Well, I also recognize Shalltear&#8217;s skills and achievements in bringing order to the Demon Realm. Although I was a bit dissatisfied with being given the title of being one of the Six Kings without my permission, I rather liked the situation where the weak weren&#8217;t oppressed.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arehh? She surprisingly has a high assessment of her? Then, why was Lillywood-san so wary of Alice?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;However, it seemed that whatever Shalltear wished for did not happen, and the feeling of impatience inside her just grew. I was curious about her situation, so I asked Shalltear once, &#8220;What are you in such a hurry for?&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;and what did Alice say?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;I want to fulfill my goal already so that I can die!&#8221; is what she responded with. There was something dark and freezing beneath the eyes of Shalltear at that time&#8230;&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t understand it. Whether it&#8217;s this goal so that she could die or her motives&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s why&#8230;&#8230; I thought she was creepy.&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1595578830"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-27311022"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh~~ Well, I was in quite a rough shape back then. I&#8217;m sorry for what I did at that time, Lillywood-san.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know what Alice was looking for. She was trying to fulfill Iris-san&#8217;s dying wish, for her to fall in love with someone, bringing the madness inside her so that she could kill herself. That much has been why Alice looked like a person with an unknown character in the eyes of Lillywood-san. And then, Lillywood-san just said that Alice created order in the Demon Realm in only a thousand years&#8230;&#8230; but for Alice, that thousand years might have been a very long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has come to another world to fulfill her best friend&#8217;s dying wish, but things haven&#8217;t progressed at all. In the Demon Realm of the past, when there was a lot of strife in the Demon Realm, lives must have disappeared one after another before she could even find someone she could fall in love with. And that led to Alice&#8217;s impatience&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Speaking of which, you did say &#8220;If Lillywood-san interferes, I will kill you.&#8221;, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Whoa there! I remembered that I still have something urgent to attend to! I will be excu&#8212;&#8212;- Guehhh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I don&#8217;t intend to say anything about Alice&#8217;s past because I&#8217;m sure that she had her own reasons. However, as for Alice, who tried to run away after hearing that topic, I immediately grabbed her by the scruff of her neck and caught her. Thereupon, seeing our exchange, Lillywood-san smiled somewhat happily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, I could somewhat understand now what you were in such a hurry for. You are&#8230;&#8230; searching for Kaito-san, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Mnhh.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel the darkness and coldness that you had back then anymore.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ll say this now, though it may sound like I&#8217;m just giving excuses, but I was just having some rough time at that time&#8230;&#8230; I also consider Lillywood-san and the others as my family, you know?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-3209823"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-348804366"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at Lillywood-san, who calmly told her that she didn&#8217;t find her creepy anymore, Alice scratched her cheek with a slightly awkward expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know that. I somewhat know that you&#8217;re also doing things for our sake&#8230;&#8230; Like at that time in the Elven Forest&#8230;&#8230; when we were reconstructing Rigforeshia, the reason why the supplies were coming in so well is that you were the one who arranged it, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Well, ummm&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry for taking it out on you at that time.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I don&#8217;t really care about what happened back then. You&#8217;re unmistakably my important family after all.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;T- Thank you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who shyly told her this, may indeed have changed for the better compared to the past.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least, with the conversation they just had, I could feel that the rift between Lillywood-san and Alice was completely gone. As Lillywood-san said, each of us is a being with minds of our own, so there will be times when we disagree with each other. There will be times when you will have to fight with each other. Even if that&#8217;s so, even with all the things they&#8217;ve said, they are still thinking of each other. The two of them&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; They&#8217;re definitely family.</span></p>
 
 <p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second day of the Six Kings Festival was nearing its end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the last event of the second day, and at the same time, the event that Lillywood-san was most confident in, the lighting up of the entire city, was taking place. It seems like they gathered plants that emit light under specific conditions, just like the Light Trees I&#8217;ve seen before, and arranged them in such a way that they look different depending on the luminescence cycle and height difference. Indeed, looking at them like this, one will never get bored with their vivid colors and flashing lights.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-667876497"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-240682958"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you think? It took a lot of care in arranging the patterns in that area. It would be great if Kaito-san likes it&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes. I think it&#8217;s very nice&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s just that, ummm, I have some things I&#8217;d like to ask&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[First of all, this is a pretty good spot for viewing this sight, isn&#8217;t it? Why is it that there&#8217;s no one else here?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, Lillywood-san and I are on a small hill at the southern edge of the city where the event will be held. This is a spectacular spot where we can see the entire city and enjoy all the lights. However, when I looked around, I couldn&#8217;t see anyone other than myself and Lillywood-san on this hill, which was supposed to be quite large. I couldn&#8217;t believe that they would just miss out on such a great place, so I asked Lillywood-san about it, and she &#8220;looked down&#8221; towards me with a charming smile on her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I abused my authority as the organizer for a bit. I wanted a quiet place to view this sight so&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see&#8230;&#8230; Well then, I have one more question. Or rather, this is the most important question I have.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, what is it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Why am I&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;being held in Lillywood-san&#8217;s arms&#8221;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lillywood-san is now as tall as she was when I first met her, as her body became one with a tree. A chair has been morphed in the lower part of her tree, and I am sitting on it. It was all good so far. When I was given a tour of the Demon Realm, the position I am now in was in a similar fashion. The biggest problem is&#8230;&#8230; Currently, for some reason, Lillywood-san&#8217;s hands were loosely placed in front of my chest, and soft and elastic things were clinging to the back of my head.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1110140076"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2022598491"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, well, in a nutshell, Lillywood-san is hugging me from behind me, and I have no idea why I&#8217;m in this state! Eh? Where is it? Where did this flag leading to the soft heaven rise? I don&#8217;t think such a flag rose for an event like this to happen&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Do you dislike it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, that&#8217;s not it&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s just, errr, I could feel your breasts touching me&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh, that&#8217;s &#8220;on purpose&#8221;. I was hoping that Kaito-san would feel the desire for me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Lillywood-san, don&#8217;t you think your personality changed!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? This is weird&#8230;&#8230; Was Lillywood-san someone who exudes a mysterious charm? No, she isn&#8217;t. She&#8217;s supposed to be more of the homely type, the one that heals your heart with her presence. W- Why is she being so aggressive? C- Could it be that she&#8217;s drunk or something?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufufu, I guess so. To be honest, I&#8217;m not really sure why I wanted to do this either&#8230;&#8230; Perhaps, I was just feeling envious.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;E- Envious?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8230; Just like those who changed after they met you&#8230;&#8230; I also want to change.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pausing there for a moment, Lillywood-san turned her gaze to the beautiful, glittering city.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1613325561"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-282142956"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;After they became lovers with you&#8230;&#8230; Kuromueina now had a much nicer smile on her face than before. Isis began to have a sincerely happy expression on her face, something that I had never seen before. And Shalltear, as I mentioned earlier, seemed to have regained her original smile as the darkness beneath them disappeared.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I would certainly feel envious of them. How could these women, who had lived so many years, having personalities that were almost completely set already, to have changed like that&#8230;&#8230; How enviable.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Lillywood-san.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s easy for me to forget, but Lillywood-san and the other members of the Six Kings have lived far more years than I have. Their personalities have certainly matured already, and change may not be as easy for them to accept as it used to be. And exactly because they have spent so many unchanging years, that they yearned for change. Even I, who have spent years hiding in my shell for a long time, can kind of understand that feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s quite strange, isn&#8217;t it? Wishing for change&#8230;&#8230; Feeling envious of other people&#8217;s change&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t even know when was the last time I thought of such things.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[However, wishing for change&#8230;&#8230; It would also mean you&#8217;re wishing for something to improve, which I think is a good thing.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I guess so.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Wait, Lillywood-san.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lillywood-san nodded, as if she was telling something to herself, before hugging me a little tighter than before. Smelling the soothing scent of wood, I felt myself being enveloped in her soft touch and her ascertainable warmth.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-401169143"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1012828623"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I still have my doubts about my ability to feel love. However, how should I put this&#8230;&#8230; Perhaps, I might want to &#8220;try to fall in love&#8221;.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However, I&#8217;m still not sure how to do such a thing. I&#8217;m afraid that I might just baffle someone, just like how you are right now. But even so, will you still be my friend?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Of course. N- No, well, I think I would certainly feel bewildered about some things&#8230;&#8230; but there&#8217;s no way that I could ever dislike you, Lillywood-san.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Thank you. I feel strange though? Even though I don&#8217;t feel like the temperature around us has changed, I feel warm. How strange&#8230;&#8230; really strange. However, fufufu, it feels kind of fun.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, the most beautiful smile I&#8217;ve ever seen appeared on Lillywood-san&#8217;s lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kaito-san, I may be ignorant but once again&#8230;&#8230; Please continue to look after me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes. I will also be in your care too&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Change is something easy to say, but difficult to do in reality. However, I think Lillywood-san would be fine. After all, Lillywood-san, who wishes for change and looking forward to change&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; looked so radiant.</span></p>
