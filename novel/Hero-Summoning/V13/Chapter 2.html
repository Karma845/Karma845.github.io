<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Wine of Victory</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the meal with Anima, we finally arrived at the fifth arena. This arena isn&#8217;t so different from the previous ones, but it looks very intimidating for me right now, especially when I think that I&#8217;m finally standing before the last and strongest of the War King&#8217;s Five Generals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I wonder if Lilia-san and the others are inside?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I think so. They may have challenged her first.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a quick look around the entrance, but I couldn&#8217;t see Lilia-san and the others. So, I assume that they were challenging Agni-san first, and entered the arena with Anima. As we continued a little further, we heard cheers and what seemed to be the sounds of battle, and saw everyone near the entrance of the large arena.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oya? Kaito-san. Good work out there.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sieg-san! I&#8217;m sorry to keep you waiting&#8230;&#8230; Is someone challenging now?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Sieg-san spotted me, she called out to me, so I slightly bowed and met up with everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes&#8230;&#8230; Soon, all of us, including My Lady, will have &#8220;failed the challenge&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eeehhh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard what Lunamaria-san said, I immediately moved my gaze to the center of the arena&#8230;&#8230; There, I saw Agni-san standing leisurely, and Lilia-san brandishing her large sword above, about to swing it down.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1916612614"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2082781274">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lilia-san, who boasts tremendous power, strikes with her might from above&#8230;&#8230; This is a sword strike that had the same power from the strike of a Count-rank High-ranking Demon, but Agni-san doesn&#8217;t move from her spot and easily catches Lilia-san&#8217;s sword with &#8220;one hand&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s a good attack. However, there is still unevenness in the distribution of magic power in your body.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Guhhh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an overwhelming sight. When Lilia-san unleashed a series of strikes, she caught all of them with one hand without taking a single step, and when Lilia-san unleashed a tornado-like magic, Agni-san dispersed it with just a casual wave of her hand. Even if Lilia-san attacked with a speed that I couldn&#8217;t perceive, Agni-san didn&#8217;t consider her strikes as a threat and easily dealt with Lilia-san&#8217;s attack without any change in her expression. It was an overwhelming difference in ability that even I, an amateur, could understand&#8230;&#8230; This is the strength of the Head of the War King&#8217;s Five Generals&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, Agni-san was able to handle all of Lilia-san&#8217;s attacks without taking a single step, and Lilia-san failed in her as time ran out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;That wasn&#8217;t a bad match. I look forward to our next match.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Y- Yes&#8230;&#8230; Thank you&#8230;&#8230; very much.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Breathing heavily, Lilia-san comes back looking tired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Lilia-san, are you alright?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kaito-san&#8230;&#8230; Yes, Agni-san, the Head of the War King&#8217;s Five Generals&#8230;&#8230; Even with a handicap, I still couldn&#8217;t do anything against her.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-46515965"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-951013482"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I mean, we watched the other challengers while waiting for Miyama-sama&#8230;&#8230; and it seems like &#8220;none of them managed to clear it&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Seriously&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Agni-san, how relentless can you be? For no one to have managed to clear it&#8230;&#8230; Shuddering at what Lunamaria-san said, I spoke to Anima who was standing next to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Anima, are you confident you can win?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Frustrating it may be&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t see any chance I can win. Compared to Epsilon-san&#8230;&#8230; Agni-san is in another dimension.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Agni-san is so strong that even Anima said that she couldn&#8217;t win against her even before trying. She&#8217;s definitely the strongest of the Five Generals I&#8217;ve met so far&#8230;&#8230; To be honest, if even Lilia-san can&#8217;t win, then the only ones who I can ask to win on my behalf are Eden-san or Pandora-san&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Agni-san finished repairing the areas broken after Lilia-san&#8217;s challenge, she came up to me and greeted me with a deep bow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If it isn&#8217;t Miyama-sama. Welcome to my arena.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes. Hello&#8230;&#8230; Errr, I will be intruding here.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1725265693"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1424167754"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you for your courteous greeting. I have already received reports from my subordinates that you already have four oversized stamps&#8230;&#8230; As expected of Miyama-sama.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- Thank you.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[However, I have also been entrusted with this spot by Megiddo-sama. Please understand that I won&#8217;t be cutting corners.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Y- Yes!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How should I say this&#8230;&#8230; It may be rude to say that this is unexpected, but Agni-san seems to be a person who uses honorifics when she should. I mean, most of the Five Generals don&#8217;t seem to be muscleheads huh&#8230;&#8230; Well, Kong-san is a different type of musclehead though&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, looking straight into my eyes, Agni-san quietly continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Miyama-sama, please excuse my rudeness but I want to inform you something.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Ah, yes. Please tell me&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry, Miyama-sama, but even with the maximum handicap, you cannot beat me. I recommend that you have a proxy challenge me.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I understand.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-294221459"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1301677577"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I was originally planning on doing that but&#8230;&#8230; What should I do? If I want to beat Agni-san, the only proxy that I could really send is Eden-san and Pandora-san. However, Pandora-san seemed to be busy and I didn&#8217;t want to interrupt her work too much. That said, asking Eden-san is&#8230;&#8230; In her case though, I&#8217;m afraid that she might accidentally kill Agni-san or something. I&#8217;m worried because Eden-san really thinks of the inhabitants of this world as nothing more than insects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, hmmm. If I need to rely on one of them in the end, I guess I can call Eden-san, who I can call right away huh? As for asking her to hold back, I&#8217;m sure I can manage to ask her to do that if I ask hard enough&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking about it, I heard an unfamiliar voice from behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Then, let me be your proxy.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning around at the sound of the voice, the first thought that popped into my mind was &#8220;Who?&#8221;. Her semi-short hair is black on the inside and gray on the outside, and her eyes are purple like an amethyst. She&#8217;s rather short, around 140cm, but the way she walks up to me with her arms crossed is truly imposing. On the chest of her outfit, which looked like a skirt-type military uniform that had been modified to look like formal wear, was a black badge that indicated that she was my companion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Seriously, who the heck is she? I don&#8217;t recognize her at all&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mysterious woman walked straight up to Agni-san and quietly staring at her, she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I owe this man a great debt that I can never repay. I don&#8217;t think I can repay even ten percent of it with something like this&#8230;&#8230; I won&#8217;t be able to keep my thoughts out of it if I don&#8217;t at least pay the interest. Therefore, I will act as his proxy&#8230;&#8230; Do you have any objections?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[E- Errr&#8230;&#8230; W- Who are you?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1522310962"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-568486684"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Mnghh!? That idiot&#8230;&#8230; She didn&#8217;t explain to you about me huh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman who had calmly declared that and asked for my confirmation stiffened when she heard my question. A little while later, letting out a big sigh with one hand on her head, she astoundedly muttered before turning towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[My name is Iris&#8230;&#8230; Iris Illuminus. Well, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d understand who I am if I say &#8220;I&#8217;m that big idiot&#8217;s partner&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A mysterious woman suddenly appeared in my challenge with Agni. I&#8217;m pretty sure I have never met her before but&#8230;&#8230; Her name sounded familiar, or rather, if I&#8217;m not mistaken, this person, Iris-san, was&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; Alice&#8217;s best friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprised by the appearance of Iris-san, who should have been deceased, I was left speechless. Iris-san didn&#8217;t seem to mind though, as she looked at me with a slight smile on her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Can you hear me?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? What&#8217;s this? A voice echoes in my head just like when I&#8217;m talking to Shiro-san, is this Iris-san&#8217;s voice?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(It&#8217;s a kind of magic called Telepathy. There are some topics that are a little troublesome for other people to hear about. You may not be able to reply to me, but I will just give you a brief explanation.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that unlike Shiro-san, Iris-san can&#8217;t read my mind. So, since I haven&#8217;t mastered Telepathy magic, this will be just a one-way conversation. I don&#8217;t really mind about that, but talking about the explanation&#8230;&#8230; I guess Iris-san was talking about herself huh?</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1664927984"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-860741864"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(You must have been surprised that I suddenly appeared without any explanation from her, right? First of all, I&#8217;d like to apologize on behalf of that idiot. I&#8217;m sorry.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Her tone sounds haughty, but unlike Alice, she is extremely courteous or rather, she has the image of someone with good character. She particularly looks like someone who would give me a good explanation for this kind of unexpected situation&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(As you&#8217;ve probably heard to some extent, I&#8217;m someone that should have been dead already. Though I said that, the fact that I appeared in front of you like this is proof that I have not completely disappeared. Well, as for the current me, I guess you could say that &#8220;I&#8217;m some kind of Spirit&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmmm. The way she phrased it, it doesn&#8217;t sound like she came back to life huh? As I recall, Alice told me that Iris-san had put her spirit into her Heart Tool and had been living inside Alice&#8217;s heart for a long time&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I suppose it’s more like my body is made up of magic power&#8230;&#8230; With the heart tool as a core, I manifested in Alici&#8230;&#8230; Alice&#8217;s &#8220;clone as the vessel&#8221;. Well, it might still be early to say this, but the &#8220;experiment&#8221; that idiot mentioned earlier is about my manifestation.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumu, so the reason why she went to the trouble of creating that Perfect Clone Alice, by deactivating several of her clones here and there, was to use it as a vessel to materialize Iris-san. And then, the experiment seems to be a success and Iris-san was able to materialize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know much about the details, but I guess I could understand now why Iris-san is here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I might be rushing through my explanations, but I hope you could understand a little about me. Next, as to why I am here, acting as your proxy&#8230;&#8230; I asked Alice to let me do this.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Iris-san will be explaining about my other doubts as well as she continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I owe you a debt of gratitude for saving my best friend. I&#8217;ve asked Alice several times for an opportunity for me to repay this favor&#8230;&#8230; and I&#8217;ve decided to take this opportunity to do just that. Again, I apologize for startling you. I hope you will understand that I am on your side.)</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1609680298"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-499554726"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unnn, it really feels like she&#8217;s an adult who has experienced a lot. She&#8217;s really different from that big idiot, Alice, who didn&#8217;t explain anything important to me. After Iris-san finished explaining some things and confirming that I nodded in understanding, she turned to Agni-san and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sorry to keep you waiting&#8230;&#8230; Now then, should I use that crystal ball to measure my power level?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, that won&#8217;t be necessary.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Houu&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Iris-san tried to touch the magic tool for measurement, Agni-san lightly shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I can tell that you are powerful by your overflowing magic power. The magic tool won&#8217;t be able to measure those who possess too much magic power&#8230;&#8230; I think you wouldn&#8217;t need any handicap. However, &#8220;if you really want a handicap&#8221;, I&#8217;m also fine with that.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;A handicap is something a strong person bears when fighting the weak. This is the first time we&#8217;ve met. Thus, we still haven&#8217;t judged who is more powerful than the other. At this point, it would be irrelevant to determine which of us has to give the handicap, wouldn&#8217;t it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Can I take that as a sign of your confidence?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I should be the one asking that instead. If I don&#8217;t hold any confidence, do you think I would challenge you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kinda feel like sparks were flying between Agni-san and Iris-san. They were exchanging words that quietly contained their fighting spirit, but I couldn&#8217;t feel any dangerous atmosphere between them. They both perceive each other as strong, but doesn&#8217;t it feel like they&#8217;re provoking each other?</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-807361598"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-888508583"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;re strong. Miyama-sama.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Yes.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[May I ask you to move to the audience area? It seems like I won&#8217;t be able to take it easy, so there&#8217;s a possibility that you will be injured. Please move to the spectator seats, where the World King-sama has placed a protective ward.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I understand.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anticipating a fierce battle, Agni-san asked me to take refuge in the audience area. Not wanting to go against her words, I obediently nodded and started moving away. Thereupon, Iris-san looked at me and gently smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll bring you victory without any problems.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Declaring your victory even before the battle starts huh&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s a bad idea for you. You&#8217;ll just embarrass yourself when you lose, you know?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t intend to lose but&#8230;&#8230; Well, let me apologize first. It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve been in a battle, so I&#8217;m afraid I may make a mistake in the amount of force I can use. My apologies, but you&#8217;ll have to defend yourself to the death.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, thank you for your advice&#8230;&#8230; However, in this place&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;ll make sure you&#8217;ll regret &#8220;underestimating&#8221; me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two warriors&#8217; sharp fighting spirits clashed with each other, as if the air itself had turned into a blade. I- I have a feeling this is going to be a great fight.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1320920651"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1580417612"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[E- Errr&#8230;&#8230; Good luck, Iris-san!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Umu, I&#8217;ve certainly received those words. I&#8217;ll definitely offer this victory to you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After conveying my words of support to Iris-san, I headed for the spectator seats with Lilia-san and the others.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The five Count-rank Demons known as the War King&#8217;s Five Generals, just like the War King Megiddo, have their own aesthetics for battle&#8230;&#8230; they have things they&#8217;re obsessed upon. For example, Bacchus, one of the War King&#8217;s Five Generals, prides himself on coming forward before a battle and not turning his back on his opponent, no matter how strong the opponent is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Agni, the Head of the War King&#8217;s Five Generals places a high value on proper decorum in battle. Even though many of the War King&#8217;s subordinates are considered to be lawless, she has placed strict rules upon herself. In a fight, she will allow her opponent to make the first move if she fights someone weaker, and if she&#8217;s the weaker one, she will make her move first. In her own words, &#8220;The challenger should get the first move&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And for this battle, facing Iris, Agni kicked the ground as the battle began. This is evidence that Agni is aware that Iris is superior to her, and that she is aware that she&#8217;s the one weaker here&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Agni&#8217;s fighting style is very simple. She uses her extremely strengthened body in a physical battle. Closing the distance between them in an instant, Agni swung her fist, clad in burning flames, at Iris. As Iris took a large leap to the side, Agni&#8217;s fist cut through the air, hitting the ground and creating a huge crater in the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;&#8230;She&#8217;s fast. But&#8230;.. why? Why did she evade that greatly just to dodge my strike? What&#8217;s the point of doing that?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had expected Iris to evade her punch, but noticing how different the way she evaded from what she expected, Agni thought for a moment. Whether Iris was aiming for something&#8230;&#8230; However, Iris didn&#8217;t seem to be trying to do anything, and she looked rather surprised instead. After a moment&#8217;s thought, Agni approached again and swung her fist, to which Iris greatly evaded.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1915898924"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-367525128"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After several rounds of exchanges, Agni felt something was amiss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Her physical abilities don&#8217;t match up with her movements? With her speed, it wouldn&#8217;t have been surprising if she had counterattacked several times already but&#8230;&#8230; What in the world is this?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Up to this point, Iris had completely surpassed Agni in terms of speed&#8230;&#8230; But all she does is evade and isn&#8217;t fighting back at all. With a dubious look on her face, Agni stopped in her tracks and looked at Iris as she was being swung around by her own body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Almost as if she doesn&#8217;t know what her own body is capable of&#8230;&#8230; How is this possible for someone of her caliber? No, that isn&#8217;t likely at all&#8230;&#8230; Then, is that strange movement a condition for activating some kind of special magic?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking that Iris&#8217; overly exaggerated evasion has some kind of reason behind it, Agni became more cautious but&#8230;&#8230; her prediction that she dismissed as impossible was actually the right answer. Yes, Iris was currently being swung around by her own body. That&#8217;s because&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(What the heck is this idiotic physical ability!? That big idiot, what kind of nonsensical specs did she put on my vessel!?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice has prepared a clone that is almost as powerful as her real body&#8230;&#8230; And thus, her vessel&#8217;s physical abilities were too great for Iris to control. Even if the body she controls has the world&#8217;s strongest specs, it has been tens of thousands of years since Iris, the one piloting this body, last fought. In a sense, it was inevitable that her movements would be awkward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;In the first place, I&#8217;m not very good at melee combat.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Mnhh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I guess I really shouldn&#8217;t fight in ways I&#8217;m ill-suited for&#8230;&#8230; Well, I&#8217;m worried if I&#8217;m able to properly hold back with this body, but let&#8217;s just return back to fighting in the way I&#8217;m used to.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1783649928"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-133238434"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ ! ? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a large distance from Agni, Iris quietly announced&#8230;&#8230; before a vast number of magic circles appeared in the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Heed my royal decree. My army, my swordsmen, gather, line up, and destroy the fools who stand before me! Calamity Doombringer!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Tsk!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her chant, the magic circle emitted strong light, and from it, swords formed with jet-black magic power were released all at once toward Agni. The swords, each one formed with an enormous amount of magic power, rained down on the area like a carpet bomb, and an explosion that filled one&#8217;s vision enveloped the surroundings. However, Agni is a strong woman who has fought in many battles. When a sword was released from the magic circle, she immediately started running and avoided the attacks that were pouring down on her. She immediately saw that the magic had the property of tracking the target to some extent, so she ran around the arena while avoiding the rain of swords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only that, she also tried to approach Iris to attack her through this rain of swords, but Iris didn&#8217;t move from her spot, only turning her palm in Agni&#8217;s direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hill of fools, jet-black earth, blades lurking in the shadows, seeking flesh and blood&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Like I will let you!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trying to stop her from chanting again, Agni powerfully kicked the ground and headed for Iris&#8230;&#8230; but&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wh&#8230;&#8230; at&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-116730296"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1886577958"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she charged toward Iris, Agni&#8217;s fist was blocked by a solid wall more than a big step away from Iris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(A spherical barrier made with magic power!? What the heck is this idiotic strength!?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Iris Illuminus&#8230;.. Her specialty in combat can be said to be very simple, just like Agni. She uses a large amount of magic power to create a magic barrier that blocks the opponent&#8217;s attacks, and then crushes them with wide-range magic possessing high firepower. In the past, when she was a human, Iris&#8217; best friend described her with one word&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;Fortress&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Before my finger stands the Sacrifice. Devour, Gluttony Shadow Edge!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Guuhhhh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the completion of her chant, thousands and thousands of jet-black blades shot out from the ground and filled the arena, piercing Agni&#8217;s magical barrier and nicking her body in wounds several times, causing her to fall on one knee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A spherical omnidirectional barrier that blocks even the fists of Agni, the Head of the Five Generals. A firepower so wide that there is no place to escape and powerful enough to crush Agni&#8217;s defenses. It&#8217;s simple&#8230;&#8230; but this simplicity makes it difficult for someone weaker than her to defeat her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m slightly getting accustomed to my body. I&#8217;m going to increase the firepower even more now&#8230;&#8230; I think you should tread with caution!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Kuhhh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The figure of Iris, who was gently floating up with her magic barrier deployed, as she kneaded her magic power in her hands&#8230;&#8230; It was truly like a moving fortress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">10 minutes passed from the start of the battle between Iris, Kaito&#8217;s proxy, and Agni, the Head of the War King&#8217;s Five Generals&#8230;&#8230; and the battle has stopped in a standstill. In terms of simple ability, Iris, who has almost the same power as the Phantasmal King, outperforms Agni by a considerable margin. With such a power difference, the battle wouldn&#8217;t have been prolonged. In fact, if Alice herself had been fighting, Agni&#8217;s consciousness would have sunk into the darkness within seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the reality is that the battle between Iris and Agni stopped at a standstill. The main reason for this is that Iris couldn&#8217;t completely control her own body. Before she died, Iris was originally one of the best in her former world&#8230;&#8230; but it was only within the realm of &#8220;Humanity&#8221;. This isn&#8217;t the case with Alice, who has spent tens of thousands of years and has completely mastered her monstrous physical abilities. What Iris is feeling now is that when she regained consciousness, her body was suddenly much stronger than it used to be. In addition, Iris has been out of practice for tens of thousands of years, so in other words, she’s like an amateur who was suddenly made to ride a g*ndam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now, Iris couldn&#8217;t move&#8230;&#8230; Unable to control her own body, she could barely fight as a fixed turret, which was what she was good at before her death. Even so, if it had been against an ordinary warrior, she would have won immediately. However, even if her strength is incomparable to the Six Kings, Agni was still one of the best in the world and she had a vast amount of combat experience. She also knows how to fight against opponents more powerful than her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of blows striking against the barrier Iris put up&#8230;&#8230; Just as Iris thought Agni&#8217;s fist would collide with her barrier, Agni took a large distance away before Iris could even look at her. Hit-and-run&#8230;&#8230; Deploying a powerful barrier consumes a certain amount of magic power. It was a standard practice to keep exhausting the magic power of a constantly deployed barrier, and Agni had the power to do it. Of course, Iris wasn&#8217;t going to sit back and just let her attack. Unleashing Maximum Magic so that Agni won&#8217;t be able to run away&#8230;&#8230; a counterattack that affects the entire attack. A jet-black ball of magic power flew from the heavens as if to crush the arena, but Agni concentrated her magic power to the utmost limit in her fist and evaded it by punching out a section of the magic ball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Iris couldn&#8217;t use Chantless Magic, Agni had more than enough time to knead her magic power, and thanks to that, she had been able to handle Iris&#8217; attacks so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;&#8230;Excellent. What a refined warrior she is. If I had fought with her with my body back when I was alive, I would have been killed in a blink of an eye.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gazing at Agni&#8217;s efficient fighting style, Iris admires her skill in her mind. And at the same time, a faint smile began to appear on Iris&#8217; lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You call yourself Agni, right? A well-trained body and the skill to make full use of her strengths&#8230;&#8230; I give you my generous praise.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Thank you. You&#8217;ve got a lot of power, but you don&#8217;t seem to be used to fighting huh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s been an incredibly long time since I last fought.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Agni is not an opponent that can be pushed out by the difference in physical ability alone. After nodding to Agni&#8217;s words, Iris slightly tugged her chin and bowed her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I don&#8217;t have anything to refute. I have certainly underestimated you&#8230;&#8230; Thinking that &#8220;I don&#8217;t need to be serious to win&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; My apologies.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Did I hear you correctly?

And now, I&#8217;ll be going at it at full strength!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ ! ? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A fierce smile appeared on Iris&#8217; lips, soon after, black magic power began to spin around her body like a vortex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Awaken, Tyrannical Beast sleeping within mine heart&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; Rip the earth with thy black claws, devour the sky with thy black fangs&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; Thou are the predator, the Beast of the End, bringing ruin to the heaven and earth&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Another chant magic? No, what in the world is this&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice that seemed to echo through the space came out of Iris&#8217; mouth, and in response, her magic power blew like a storm, gradually converging on a single point.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-911689444"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2056363119"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the powerfully uttered words, the black magic power takes on a definite shape. It was a huge staff, more than twice Iris&#8217; height&#8230;&#8230; Looking at it, one could see its black, sinister shape looking like sharp fangs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[A magic that creates a weapon? However, this dreadful amount of magic power&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the staff covered with overflowing dense magic power, Agni muttered in astonishment. Her body, with its vast amount of combat experience, was fiercely warning her&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- That the thing Iris was holding is dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Now then, with this unleashed, I won&#8217;t be able to hold back anymore&#8230;&#8230; Show me how you would struggle to survive!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Guhh!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The twilight bell tolls, listen to the song of destruction as the Beast of the End roars.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ability of Iris&#8217; heart tool, Apocalypse, is very simple. Apocalypse explosively increases the amount of magic power poured into it. Increasing the tremendous amount of magic power hundreds and thousands of times&#8230;&#8230; The strongest attack that can be unleashed with this staff, a Bombardment-type Maximum Magic bearing such a name, is truly a tyrannical blow that swallows up and obliterates everything in its path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Swallow, Tyrannical Beast&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- Apocalypse!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A flash of black light filled everyone&#8217;s field of vision from the giant staff in Iris&#8217; hand. Seeing the incoming attack, Agni&#8217;s eyes widened and stiffened.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1482854316"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1524018340"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(What&#8230;&#8230; is this&#8230;&#8230; this abnormal magic destiny&#8230;&#8230; Defend against that? Impossible. I would be obliterated without even the slightest resistance. &#8230;&#8230;Evading &#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s no good. Exposed before this magic power, my body won&#8217;t move&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll die&#8230;&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the face of the oncoming bombardment of the Maximum Magic, Agni was convinced that she was going to die&#8230;&#8230; but that didn&#8217;t happen. Alice, who suddenly appeared in front of Agni, caught the incoming magic bombardment and &#8220;flipped it into the sky&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After making sure that the blow, which had completely scraped the ground of the arena, subsided, Alice shouted to Iris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What are you doing, idiot Iris!? If you shoot it with your current magic power, it will &#8220;vanish everything beyond the horizon&#8221;!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;S- Sorry. I also didn&#8217;t expect it to be this powerful&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Alice&#8217;s words, Iris obediently apologized. Even she didn&#8217;t expect it to be so powerful, and she thought she had killed Agni the moment she shot her blast, so she had no words to argue. Well, part of the reason why this happened is Alice, who prepared a vessel with an abnormal amount of magic power&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hahhh&#8230;&#8230; Errr&#8230;&#8230; Agni-san.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Alice apologized to the still stunned Agni, Iris also approached Agni and bowed to her.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1593786505"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1713768888"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>

I almost ended up killing you&#8230;&#8230; I apologize from the bottom of my heart.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;No, there&#8217;s no need to apologize. If I had been killed by that blow, it was only because I was inexperienced. It is not your fault. Rather, &#8220;you can say that the real battle starts when I die once&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; Well, as far as this battle is concerned, the rules state that when I die once, I lose.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Peak Count-ranks are basically immortals. Agni is no exception to this rule, as even if she were vaporized without a trace, she would still be able to revive herself in a few seconds. Battles for beings of their level would take several days or months to finally settle, but this is an event with a set of rules in place, so in the event of death, it will be Agni&#8217;s defeat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Anyhow, that was a great battle. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Thank me?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, it made me realize that I&#8217;m still inexperienced. I never intended to be arrogant, but I had somehow become conceited. For there to be people I don&#8217;t know to be this powerful&#8230;&#8230; F- Fufufu, my blood boils at the thought. After the Six Kings Festival ends, I&#8217;ll start training from scratch again.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I see&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As War King&#8217;s subordinate, Agni is just like Megiddo, having the thought that those who hold the power are right. With fire blazing in her eyes, Agni held out her hand for a handshake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Iris-dono, for the great fight, I give you my heartfelt gratitude&#8230;&#8230; You have won this time. However, I will train myself again and one day, I will definitely challenge you again. When that time comes, I hope you&#8217;ll fight me with all your strength again!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[U- Umu&#8230;&#8230; Got it.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-761400026"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-900610882"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you! Ahh, today is a great day! To be able to meet a strong person like this is my greatest fortune!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she felt slightly bewildered because of Agni&#8217;s sweltering excitement, Iris nodded her head and shook her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Oi, Alici&#8230;&#8230; Alice! Is this something normal for War King&#8217;s subordinates!?)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;&#8230;To be honest, most of them are like this&#8230;&#8230; They&#8217;re all battle junkies. That&#8217;s why our Pandora doesn&#8217;t like War King&#8217;s subordinates. She doesn&#8217;t like how they&#8217;re excited about battle&#8230;&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, the battle between Iris and Agni ended with Iris&#8217; victory. However, Agni&#8217;s fighting spirit was ignited by this, and she will be challenging her quite often in the future&#8230;&#8230; But well, that&#8217;s a story for another time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After stamping my stamp card, Agni-san told me that there were some things I needed to take note of.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-492489456"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-133871841"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. In challenging Megiddo-sama&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;You won&#8217;t be able to send a proxy&#8221;. This will be a one-on-one match between the one possessing the stamp card and Megiddo-sama.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;E- Errr&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But you don&#8217;t have to worry&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;m sure Miyama-sama is well-aware of Megiddo-sama&#8217;s principles, but Megiddo-sama will not play a game that his opponent has no chance of winning. I&#8217;m sure that Miyama-sama will be presented with a method of victory that even Miyama-sama has a chance of winning.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of which, that would certainly be the case. Whenever Megiddo-san engages in a match, he always fights in a way that his opponent has a chance to win. That&#8217;s also why I was able to win our previous match&#8230;&#8230; the drinking contest. In that case, I guess I can be relieved that we won&#8217;t be having a fistfight&#8230;&#8230; Unnn, seriously, I&#8217;m relieved that wasn&#8217;t the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Now then, if you will excuse me, I will accept the challenge of another challenger. Miyama-sama, I wish you good luck.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes. Thank you very much.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bowing to me once, Agni-san moved on to take on the next challenger. After confirming this, I moved to where Lilia-san and the others were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[With this, Kaito-san can now challenge War King-sama, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Milady, according to Phantasmal King-sama&#8217;s guidebook, we can watch the battle against the War King-sama. What do you think? How about we all watch Miyama-sama&#8217;s gallant figure&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Lunamaria-san, it seems like you&#8217;re really having fun huh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1181125475"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-132971356"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like Lunamaria-san is very lively after all the things happening. Does she really want to see me suffer? No, well, it&#8217;s certainly&#8230;&#8230; just like Lunamaria-san huh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Lu-chan &#8220;loves&#8221; Miyama-san after all, so she wants to be close by to cheer you on~]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Mom!? What the heck are you talking about!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Am I wrong?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- Isn&#8217;t that obvious!? W- Why should I be cheering for Miyama-sama&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But Lu-chan always actively teases &#8220;the one you love&#8221;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; Mghuuu!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wha! Could you just shut up for a moment!!!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noir-san started to leisurely say something, but Lunamaria-san flusteredly covered her mouth with her hand and I couldn&#8217;t catch the latter half of what she said. However, unnnn. Let&#8217;s not tell anyone that I was a little embarrassed by the contents of the things I heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was watching their exchange, Iris, who was talking with Alice at a little distance, approached me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, Iris-san. Thank you very much!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1629667790"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-474581094"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Your thanks is unneces&#8212;&#8212;- No, I guess it&#8217;s polite to accept it huh&#8230;&#8230; Anyway, Kaito. Can I talk to you for a moment?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Ah, yes. I&#8217;m fine with it.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s not something I really want others to hear about, so come with me&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, Iris-san began to move away, and I followed her after notifying Lilia-san and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walking a few distance towards the back of the arena, when we reached an unpopulated area, Iris turned to me and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;d like to introduce myself again. I&#8217;m Iris Illuminus.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, errr, I&#8217;m Miyama Kaito.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Umu&#8230;&#8230; Well, in that telepathic conversation, I was the only one speaking so&#8230;&#8230; I guess there are things you&#8217;re wondering about?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Iris-san had moved to a place like this where there were no other people to answer my questions. She certainly was rushing about explaining things at that time, and there were also things that she couldn&#8217;t say because Lilia-san and the others were nearby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Errr, you&#8217;re Alice&#8217;s best friend&#8230;&#8230; right?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-124669069"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1030877159"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, well, yes&#8230;&#8230; Being her best friend certainly brings me some headaches, but you&#8217;re not wrong.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Iris-san&#8217;s voice sounded gentle as she affirmed my words with a somewhat dumbfounded chuckle, and I could tell that she cared about Alice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Iris-san&#8230;&#8230; Errr, did you come back to life?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, I wouldn&#8217;t describe it as coming back to life&#8230;&#8230; You could say that I&#8217;m a being of magic power residing in a heart tool. Let&#8217;s see, if I were to define myself based on your world, I guess you could say that I&#8217;m a tsukumogami. My body would still be&#8230;&#8230; the Heart Tool Apocalypse.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I see&#8230;&#8230; But you should be able to act like a normal human like this&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Actually, there&#8217;s still a problem regarding that~~]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Alice?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Iris-san gave me a brief explanation, Alice appeared and shook her head with a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;A problem?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hmmm. Well, I still have some assignments to research&#8230;&#8230; Iris, I guess it&#8217;s still no good huh?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-469678449"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-137757222"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, it&#8217;s no good. &#8220;I really won&#8217;t be able to recover my magic power&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; I can certainly treat the magic power used to prepare this vessel as my own, but I can&#8217;t seem to generate new magic power.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh~~ I knew it huh. Even if you&#8217;re using that clone as your vessel now, that body is still considered as mine huh&#8230;&#8230; I guess that&#8217;s my assignment from now on.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Iris-san hasn&#8217;t completely resurrected yet. From what I heard from the two of them, Iris-san is unable to generate her own magic power. As she consumes magic power, the lesser the magic power in her body is, and when her magic power runs out, she will not be able to maintain her body. In other words, they&#8217;re looking for a way to charge her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, I&#8217;m fine with just swapping out bodies though&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But in that case, it was just being patient with something of a lesser quality&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s not very efficient in terms of magic power conversation, and if we&#8217;re going with that method, I think it would be better if we just pseudo-convert the magic particles in the air&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But then, along with the consumption needed to convert magic power, the amount that can be recovered is actually very small, isn&#8217;t it? What about absorbing it instead? However, would that be too much for the vessel&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, particle substitution&#8230;&#8230; No, super generation is&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have any idea what the heck they&#8217;re talking about. At any rate, I kind of understand that it will take some time for Iris-san to be completely resurrected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I mean, I know that you&#8217;re actually smart&#8230;&#8230;. but hearing Alice talking like a smart person feels kind of weird.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-564367746"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-329506449"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wait, Kaito-san!? You&#8217;re speaking out your thoughts, you know!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like I had unintentionally said what I was thinking, and Alice reacted very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;ll be saying this for your information, but Alice-chan is super smart and is totally an intellectual! When I wear my glasses, it would be quite a disaster, you know? I won&#8217;t be able to stop my intelligence from overflowing!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;You&#8217;re acting like an idiot now.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Like an idiot!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s because she is an idiot.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Shut it there, flattie.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You do realize that the body I&#8217;m using is your clone, right!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s acting like the usual Alice&#8230;&#8230; Maybe it&#8217;s because Iris was here, but she somehow seems to be enjoying herself more than usual. I guess that&#8217;s really because they&#8217;ve been best friends for so long after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, that aside&#8230;&#8230; It seems that you really can&#8217;t use the specs of that body, so I guess I&#8217;ll make some adjustments.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-334359872"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-155263239"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, that would be better. Adjusting to this body is too difficult. What would have happened if the battle earlier had been a real one?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If it had been a real battle, Iris would 100% lose that battle. Agni-san is &#8220;holding back quite a lot&#8221; after all.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Is that so!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a tremendous battle almost invisible to me, but with the atmosphere they had, I kinda felt like Iris-san was dominating. However, Alice sounded as if she was saying Agni-san was stronger than Iris-san. And Iris-san herself seemed to be somewhat convinced by those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I did feel like that was the case. I was fighting with all my might, but her&#8230;&#8230; I think she&#8217;s probably fighting on the basis that &#8220;she doesn&#8217;t destroy the venue&#8221;. Am I right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You&#8217;re about right. Although she&#8217;s a battle maniac, she&#8217;s the type of person who separates public and private matters, and this time, she was only performing within the limits given to her by Megiddo-san as part of her job. Well, with Agni-san&#8217;s character, she would probably say &#8220;Even though restrictions may have been in place, if I fought as hard as I could under those conditions and lost, I was undeniably defeated&#8221;, but in a real fight, the current Iris has no chance against her.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, if you think about it, Iris-san is a former human. Of course, she was probably strong beyond comparison for people like me, but still, Count-ranks are just on a different level. No matter how physically fit Alice&#8217;s body is, she probably isn&#8217;t someone you can deal with by just having that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The current Iris is currently rated as a mid Count-rank in terms of physical ability and magic power alone. Of course, that counts you as one of the best in the world, but that doesn&#8217;t make you able to fight a serious battle against any of the Six Kings&#8217; executives until you learn various things regarding high-level battles.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Fumu, well, I&#8217;ll learn more about that in time.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After nodding to Alice&#8217;s words, Iris-san looked as if she suddenly remembered something and asked.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-369209309"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1961940648"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;By the way, Alice. There&#8217;s something I need to ask you.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? What is it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Why did you hide about me from Kaito?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, I&#8217;m wondering about that too.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice had mentioned the word &#8220;experiment&#8221; at the Opening Ceremony, so I guess she had already decided to give Iris-san a physical body by that point. If that was the case, she should have told me beforehand so I wouldn&#8217;t have been so surprised&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[After all&#8230;&#8230; This way is far more interesting! Also, to be honest, &#8220;I&#8217;m the one who instigated Pandora&#8221; !]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well~~ Kaito-san&#8217;s surprised face really is the best&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- Fugyaaahhh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, unnn. Alice really is the same as always&#8230;&#8230; In that case, a scolding it is.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1466125894"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-537935493"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[K- Kaito-san. Y- Your eyes look scary, you know? L- Look~~ It&#8217;s your cute lover~~]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So you&#8217;re the reason why Pandora-san is like that huh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kaito, let me help you with that&#8230;&#8230; This idiot&#8217;s character needs a good beating.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you, Iris-san.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? What is that sense of solidarity&#8230;&#8230; N- No way~~ It&#8217;s just a bit of mischievousness&#8212;&#8212;- Migyaaahhh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Iris-san joined in on scolding her, Alice clearly began to break out in cold sweat. Thus, having gained the common goal of scolding Alice, I felt an inexplicable sense of friendship between us as Iris-san and I began to lecture the idiot.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In one of the Teleportation Magic Circles set up in the Central Tower&#8230;&#8230; A magic circle that can only be used by those who have collected five oversized stamps. Watching as Lilia-san and the others make their way to the adjacent auditorium by the magic circle, I nervously stepped on top of the magic circle. Closing my eyes from the sudden burst of dazzling light, when I opened my eyes&#8230;&#8230; I was met with a tremendous sight. It was a huge arena, just like a dome stadium. There were many people in the audience seats and the air even seemed to tremble from their enthusiasm. And in the middle of the arena, Megiddo-san, with his overwhelming presence, was waiting for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Now, wait a moment there, why the heck are there so many spectators here!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn&#8217;t that strange? I mean, I only finished collecting the oversized stamps about 30 minutes ago, and it was obviously unnatural for so many people to be here. No, in the first place, where the heck did these people get their information&#8230;&#8230; wait, I guess I didn&#8217;t have to think about it too much&#8230;&#8230; There is only one person who can communicate information to so many people in such a short time. That f*cking idiot&#8230;&#8230; What the heck is she doing!?</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-682764287"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1705337974"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the me who&#8217;s stunned by the sheer number of spectators, Megiddo-san happily smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You&#8217;re here! Kaito! I&#8217;ve been waiting for you! I knew that you would definitely come!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- Thanks&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if Megiddo-san isn&#8217;t as big as a building, he&#8217;s still as big as a two-story house, and facing him like this, I realized once again how intimidating he is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hahaha, I&#8217;m looking forward to our match! Alright, let&#8217;s get things started!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Y- Yes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if in response to Megiddo-san&#8217;s fighting spirit, the blazing red flames all over his body rose and the magic power released from his body was shaking the air. H- Hey, you&#8217;re really going to make it so that I can win this battle, right? You&#8217;re making it sound like we&#8217;re having a serious battle, but we&#8217;re not really going to hit each other, right?</span></p>

No, no, wait a moment&#8230;&#8230; I was just a &#8220;2&#8221; in art back in high school&#8230;&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t look like I can win in this battle at all, you know!?<br /> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N: In Japanese high schools, they use numbers 5 to 1 as a grading system, with an excellent 5 as the highest and a failing 1 as the lowest.)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well then, here are the rules! Both of us have one hour to make a &#8220;clay sculpture&#8221;, and the theme will be &#8220;living creatures&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; The judges will be my subordinates. You don&#8217;t have to worry, for they will be judging fairly.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unnn, no, well, I don&#8217;t think Megiddo-san would ever cheat in matches&#8230;&#8230; but that&#8217;s not the point, you know!? Clay sculpture? W- Well~~ This is impossible, don&#8217;t you think? I can&#8217;t do anything three-dimensional. Making a three-dimensional here&#8230;&#8230; the only result I could see is me having to face my greatest embarrassment in front of everyone here, you know!? I mean, isn&#8217;t Megiddo-san good at art too!? I&#8217;ve seen him make that amazing sculpture before&#8230;&#8230; Seriously, do I really stand a chance in this match? Hey, do you really think so?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the dumbfounded me, Megiddo-san transformed into a human form, probably so that he could work on the small details of his sculpture. As the clay and tools were brought in front of us, I heard a voice resounding from what seemed to be Loudspeaker Magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now, the match is finally about to begin. The challenger, Miyama Kaito will be facing the War King Megiddo in a three-game match&#8230;&#8230; I, &#8220;The Phantasmal King, No Face&#8221;, will be giving live commentary. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the heck is that idiot doing now!? Why are you just nonchalantly doing live commentary there? Are you an idiot? &#8230;&#8230;I guess she was unquestionably an idiot huh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; And then, the analysis will be provided by the &#8220;God of Fate, Fate-san&#8221;. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;Hey? This is really troublesome, so can I go home already? &gt;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-607888613"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-954878678"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;Ummm, Fate-san? The match has just begun, you know? No matter how lazy you are, isn&#8217;t that a bit too fast? &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s a complete mistake of personnel you&#8217;ve chosen there, don&#8217;t you think!? Why, of all people, did you choose Fate-san to do something!? That person would definitely not give any commentary!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now then, the first match was an art battle. And so, Analyst Fate-san. What do you think of this match? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;Hey, Shallt&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;No-chan&#8221;? Can I sleep here? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; You can eat your cookies there, so please just try a little harder! &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Haahhh&#8230;&#8230; Even though I was lured by the &#8220;1 / 1 Kai-chan doll&#8221;, it&#8217;s still troublesome&#8230;&#8230; Well, I guess you really need to work for it if you want to get the good stuff huh? &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oi, wait a moment there&#8230;&#8230; Why do I feel like I heard an item that I can&#8217;t ignore? After this battle, I guess I will need to have a long talk with Alice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Wait, Fate-san. Could you please stop right there&#8230;&#8230; Didn&#8217;t I tell you that information about that secret item is confidential!? You&#8217;ve just raised a death flag on top of my head, you know!?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, can someone please stop those two? Fate-san too, this is not the time for you to be waving at me with a smile, you know!? Even though this is a match whose odds are totally against me&#8230;&#8230; Before the match even began, I&#8217;m already receiving quite the mental damage here!? Seriously&#8230;&#8230; Can anyone please help me&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Eh? Arehh? &#8220;Kuro-san&#8221;? Eh, wait&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;re asking me to go there? &#8230;&#8230; N- No, I&#8217;m doing the live commentary here&#8230;&#8230; Eh? If I don&#8217;t quickly go there, you&#8217;ll grind me to pieces&#8230;&#8230;? I- I- I understand. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Underworld King!? I&#8217;m totally different from her! I&#8217;m honestly an earnest person, okay!!!? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Wait, Fate-san!? You traitor&#8230;&#8230; &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;Erhem. Now then, since the Phantasmal King is brought out of the room, I&#8217;ll take the lead for a while. The theme for this match is living creatures&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s a pretty broad topic, so it&#8217;s going to be important to decide what to make. However, they don&#8217;t have much time either, so if they were to choose a complicated creature, that will be a great failure. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kuro, thanks. For taking out the most troublesome of them all&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because she was afraid of Kuro or not, but Fate-san also began to seriously explain, which made me feel relaxed for a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Alright then, Kaito! Let&#8217;s get started!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Y- Yes&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll be in your care.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[In that case, let the games begin!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, the three-game match between Megiddo-san and I began.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fifty minutes had already passed since the clay sculpture competition with Megiddo-san had started. It seemed that our workbenches were designed in a way that the people outside can&#8217;t see what we were making, so neither Megiddo-san and I can see what the other is making. In the arena, perhaps to pass the time, several performances were shown and the crowd was very excited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The clay sculpture I&#8217;m working on now&#8230;&#8230; The theme is about &#8220;living creatures&#8221;, so I chose a &#8220;dog&#8221; as my subject. To be honest, I think that if an amateur tries to make something too elaborate, they would obviously fail. So, I chose a subject that was as simple as possible, and spent my time improving the sculpture&#8217;s quality. I think it&#8217;s a good decision I made back then. With only 10 minutes left, I looked at my sculpture, which was nearing completion, and one thought came to my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;What the f*ck is this? This&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;creepy creature&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Skin as lumpy as crags&#8221;, &#8220;legs that looked like a squashed fruit&#8221;, &#8220;face that is so close to the ground for some reason&#8221;, &#8220;a tail&#8230;&#8230; that doesn&#8217;t look like a tail at all, looking more like a weird stick stuck on clay&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; What the heck am I even making? No matter how I look at it objectively, it looks like a creature that doesn&#8217;t live on Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unnn. Well, I knew it&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m really no good at making three-dimensional objects. I don&#8217;t know what the heck I was thinking when I created this thing&#8230;&#8230; this sorrowful monster. I guess it really was a bad idea to &#8220;lump more clay over my work&#8221; so that I could adjust the shape huh. It was about 20 centimeters at the beginning, but now, it has swollen to about &#8220;5 times&#8221; its size&#8230;&#8230; Adding up too much unnecessary stuff also ends up in failure. Well, I feel like a typical amateur but&#8230;&#8230; If I knew what I was doing while I was making it, I wouldn&#8217;t have had any trouble. The end result of my actions&#8230;&#8230; is &#8220;some kind of weird rock-like creature&#8221;. Let&#8217;s declare it now. Unless the eyes of all the judges are rotten, there&#8217;s no way I can win with this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now then, we have 5 minutes left. This is everyone&#8217;s beloved Phantasmal King-chan, finally back at last. To be honest, there&#8217;s a scary person still watching me behind my back, so I&#8217;m going to give a serious Live commentary here. Well then, Analyst Fate-san, would you tell us your predictions on who will win? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Hmmm. The War King is also quite famous for his art. It is rumored that his sculptures are especially great, so I think the War King has the advantage here based on his experience&#8230;&#8230; B- By the way, can&#8217;t you do something about&#8230;&#8230; that scary person behind us? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; That&#8217;s impossible. She&#8217;s completely watching over me with eyes that tell me &#8220;the next time I mess around again, she&#8217;ll crush me to pieces&#8221;, so we don&#8217;t have any choice but to do this seriously. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who had returned back from Kuro&#8217;s severe scolding before I knew it, told us how much time we had left. Apparently, Kuro is keeping an eye on them in the back, which is very reassuring. However, unnn&#8230;&#8230; 5 more minutes huh&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything I can do about this anymore. No matter what I do, I can only see a future where this thing would look worse than it already is. Isn&#8217;t there any way I can win this match?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I waited, thinking about this, I heard the sound of a bell announcing that the time of making the sculpture had ended.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1869559303"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1876909225"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Times~~ up~~! Thank you for your hard work. Well then, let&#8217;s start showing off to everyone what you made! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;I already lost this match, so can we just go to the next one without having to show this monstrosity to the public?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Well then, first up would be from War King, Megiddo-san! &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing the announcement of the Live commentator Alice, Megiddo-san removed the boards that were hiding his work. Thereupon, what appeared from there was&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Whoa!? Isn&#8217;t that quite the beauty! Glossy jet-black scales, sharp fangs&#8230;&#8230; &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s a Night Metal Dragon. Mhmm, that&#8217;s amazing. It looks just like the real thing. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Megiddo-san created a dragon about 30 centimeters long&#8230;&#8230; As if every single scale had been carefully polished, its entire body seemed to glow a dull shine, and the sculpture&#8217;s intensity was so great that even I, who had never seen the original creature, felt overwhelmed. Well, this is no good. His sculpture is just too great&#8230;&#8230; Even with all the muscles loaded in your hands, you did such delicate work!? Seriously, Megiddo-san&#8217;s amazing. I knew it, there was no way I could win in this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What do you think, Kaito!? I&#8217;m pretty confident with what I made today!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- It&#8217;s amazing&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-944477943"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-443307421">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no, you can&#8217;t even consider this a match, you know!? It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re putting a kindergartener&#8217;s school project next to a master&#8217;s work of art, you know!? I knew I really shouldn&#8217;t exhibit my work&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now then, the next one would be the challenger Kaito-san! Please show everyone what you did! &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kinda don&#8217;t really want to though. Showing this monstrosity before the eyes of everyone in this place&#8230;&#8230; However, now that it&#8217;s been declared, I can&#8217;t not publish it. As my hands trembled, I fearfully removed the blinds covering my work&#8230;&#8230; and revealed to everyone this tragic, or perhaps, this laughable creature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Oh? Hmmm? This is&#8230;&#8230; &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice of the live commentator sounded bewildered&#8230;&#8230; Unnn, just go kill me already. Feeling an inexplicable sense of shame, I fearfully looked at my opponent, Megiddo-san&#8230;&#8230; and saw him staring at me with his eyes widened. Is he astonished at how badly I did it? Just as I was thinking that, Megiddo-san fell on his knees for some reason and put his hands on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Megiddo-san declared his defeat and several Demons who seemed to be judges rushed over to him. Unnn, what they&#8217;re asking is right.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, this is actually&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s Kaito for you. The thoughts you put into that work&#8230;&#8230; They certainly touched my heart! Giving wings to the flightless Gun Rock Dragon and letting her fly into the sky&#8230;&#8230; You put &#8220;dreams and possibilities&#8221; into that work&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s my complete defeat.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1959125815"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1399491852"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I&#8217;m not showing any thoughts in that sculpture, you know!? Heck, I don&#8217;t even know what I was thinking when I made that! Eh? The heck is happening? They&#8217;re applauding&#8230;&#8230; Is the result already decided? Am I going to win in a way I&#8217;m unsatisfied about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Hmmm. Art is a difficult aspect, isn&#8217;t it? I actually thought that you were &#8220;trying to make a dog, but failed&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fate-san! You&#8217;re right! You&#8217;re totally right!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; There are several types of expression in art. Some, like Megiddo-san, faithfully reproduces the real thing, while others, like Kaito-san, &#8220;who challenge themselves to break through their previous shell&#8221; to give it a broader interpretation and message. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Hehh~~ Sounds really deep. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Yes, such works tend to be complex, but Kaito-san seems to have expressed and grandeur by increasing the size. As expected of Kaito-san. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Fumufumu. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oi, don&#8217;t put in unnecessary follow-ups. I&#8217;m getting more and more embarrassed here, but I can&#8217;t even say they&#8217;re mistaken because of the atmosphere&#8230;&#8230; If I tell the truth here, Megiddo-san will be very embarrassed. If he looks that satisfied after declaring his defeat, and then turns out that he was mistaken, his dignity will be severely damaged&#8230;&#8230; I- I can&#8217;t say it&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, are you seriously not joking around, and this thing really resembles that Gun Rock Dragon? From how Alice sounds like, it does sound like this resembles them&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; And thus, the challenger Kaito-san has splendidly won the first match! Everyone, please give him a big round of applause! &gt;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-565717720"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-935063595"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Please get me out of this place&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard from somewhere that Art is in the eye of the beholder, and the others can have interpretations that are unimaginable to the average person. But well, as for this matter&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- This isn&#8217;t just on the level of going against the creator&#8217;s intentions, you know!?</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m having a three-game match against Megiddo-san&#8230;&#8230; After a ten-minute break, the next game we&#8217;ll be having will be the second match.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now then, the challenger won the first match, contrary to the prediction in favor of the War King&#8230;&#8230; Analyst Fate-san, this is an unpleasant development for Megiddo-san, isn&#8217;t it? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; You&#8217;re right. I think winning the first match is pretty big for both of our participants. With his defeat, War King couldn&#8217;t afford to lose in the next match anymore&#8230;&#8230; On the other hand, Kai-chan can still lose once, so mentally speaking, he can still be composed for the moment. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m actually damaged mentally pretty much, you know&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to fight anyone in an art competition ever again. A new black history has been created at this moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Hmmm. If this were a story, this would be the time where Megiddo-san wins the match and leads it to the final match. As the live commentator, that situation would be more exciting for the audience, so I&#8217;d like to see this lead to the final battle if possible. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Hmmm. For me though, the sooner this event ends, the better~~ &#8230;&#8230;By the way, No-chan? That art sculpture Kai-chan made earlier&#8230;&#8230; Can I have that? &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fate-saaaaaan!? Stop that! Seriously, please stop that! Why the heck are you trying to have my black history for take out!? No, that&#8217;s a big no!</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-647473755"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1515346091"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Ahh~~ About that, there are actually a lot of people requesting it&#8230;&#8230; After their match ends, a &#8220;rock-paper-scissors tournament&#8221; will actually be conducted, and the winner can get that item. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oiiiiii! Why the heck did you turn that monstrosity into a prize without my permission!? Oi, the red gorilla over there&#8230;&#8230; What&#8217;s with the thumbs up? Stop with those eyes that seem to say that &#8220;there are a lot of people with eyes for good things here&#8221;! I mean, who the heck would even want something like that!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Ehh~~ Incidentally, the people who have announced their participation would be&#8230;&#8230; Underworld King, Kuromueina-san and Death King, Isis-san&#8230;&#8230; It seems like World King, Lillywood-san is also joining&#8230;&#8230; Well, it seems like she&#8217;s just brought along by Isis-san. There&#8217;s also God of Life and God of Space and Time&#8230;&#8230; It seems like these two have been told to join by Creator God-sama. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; By the way, I was just thinking about it, but No-chan, you just called me by my name earlier, didn&#8217;t you? Well, it isn&#8217;t actually that much of a problem but&#8230;&#8230; &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; I was careless. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;ll go treat you to something next time. Errr, continuing what I was saying earlier. There&#8217;s Archlesia Empire&#8217;s Emperor Chris-san, Hydra Kingdom&#8217;s King Laguna-san, a Duchess from Symphonia Kingdom, Lilia-san, and many others. Also, it seems like a &#8220;mysterious angel that has a 90% chance of killing someone just by being talked to&#8221; is also joining&#8230;&#8230; Fyuu~ Those are quite the big names I mentioned there. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;Amazing. It&#8217;s as if they came here to join a world-ending boss rush. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were so many of them!? Wait&#8230;&#8230; What in the world are all of you doing&#8230;&#8230; Just thinking about how that thing is going in the hands of someone I know makes it feel like I&#8217;m in hell, you know!? Also, Eden-san!? What the heck are you doing!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;Well, we&#8217;ll get to those details later. Let&#8217;s get started on the second match! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;How the heck did this happen? No, unnn. Let&#8217;s just think about it later&#8230;&#8230; Or rather, let&#8217;s just participate in that rock-paper-scissors tournament later. I need to stop any negative legacies from falling into the hands of others at all costs&#8230;&#8230; As I turned my eyes away from the cruelty of the world, Alice urged us to play the second match, and Megiddo-san, who heard her, took out a huge board(?) out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Alright! The second match will be&#8230;&#8230; a game decided by &#8220;how we read each other&#8217;s thoughts and the strategy to make use of it&#8221;! We&#8217;ll be playing the &#8220;Double Color&#8221; game!!!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-68260219"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1673757109">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Double Color?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? Yeah, it&#8217;s just a simple game. Even a kid can play it. However, it&#8217;s a game so deep that it deserves to be our game!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumu&#8230;&#8230; In front of me and Megiddo-san, there is a large board with squares&#8230;&#8230; This should mean that it&#8217;s a board game huh? There are two stones in the center, one red and one blue, and they should be used in the game&#8230;&#8230; Hmmm. This somehow looks very familiar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The rules are simple. I&#8217;m red, Kaito is blue&#8230;&#8230; Then, we would take turns placing stones on the board. And when you place a stone, the opponent&#8217;s stone or stones in between your stones will change to your color. Repeating this process, the player with the most stones of his color wins!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Ah, I see&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s &#8220;Othello&#8221; huh&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was about four times the size of the Othello board I knew, but other than that, the rules were almost the same. It seems to be a magic tool that automatically swaps the color of the stones that were interposed between pieces, so it&#8217;s like a convenient Othello.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Do you understand the rules? Then, let&#8217;s start! Let&#8217;s have a burning hot game!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I will be in your care.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so began the second match between Megiddo-san and I&#8230;&#8230; a huge-sized Othello game. The fearless smile on Megiddo-san&#8217;s face was not that of a man driven to a corner. Burning with fighting spirit, he faced me. However, there was one thing that he overlooked. No&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; There&#8217;s a secret that Megiddo-san didn&#8217;t know.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1114083898"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-527387204"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>




<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Kaito and Megiddo began to confront each other, and after a while, Alice and Fate began to give commentary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Well then, we&#8217;ll now start giving live commentary&#8230;&#8230; Our voices basically won&#8217;t reach Kaito-san and Megiddo-san. Otherwise, they&#8217;ll probably get some hint to something that they might have missed&#8230;&#8230; Now, let&#8217;s look at their openings. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; I don&#8217;t see any big moves in their openings. But as far as I can see, doesn&#8217;t the War King seem to be in the lead? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; You&#8217;re right. The important thing in this game isn&#8217;t to change the color of as many stones as possible, but to make it difficult for the opponent to play their turn next&#8230;&#8230; I like that move by Megiddo-san. It&#8217;s got quite a wide angle, making it easy to take over other pieces. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While watching the magically displayed images in the sky above the arena, Alice and Fate explained the early stages of the match.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;In that case, that move by Kai-chan is a bad one, isn&#8217;t it? With that, the War King has a big lead&#8230;&#8230; &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Hmmm. I suppose I should praise Megiddo-san for that move. There&#8217;s hardly anyone who wouldn&#8217;t be tempted to place at that square. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; I see&#8230;&#8230; I guess that means Kai-chan should have held back there and placed his piece in the lower right corner instead. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; That&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8230; Well, even though he made a mistake, it was still the early game, so it was still possible to turn things around but&#8230;&#8230; Hmmm. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; What&#8217;s the matter, No-chan? You kinda have a complicated expression on your face, you know? &gt;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-398870984"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-294838274"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;No, I mean, errr&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll be honest with you. Even though I&#8217;m still doing all these live commentary, &#8220;I already know the result of this match&#8221;. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Eh? What do you mean? &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Alice told her that she already knows the outcome, even though the game is still ongoing, Fate curiously asked her. Thereupon, Alice&#8217;s expression became even more complicated and turning to Fate, she murmured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; N- No&#8230;&#8230; You see&#8230;&#8230; In fact, Kaito-san&#8230;&#8230; He&#8217;s &#8220;very weak&#8221; at these kinds of board games that doesn&#8217;t involve luck. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;Is that so? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Y- Yes&#8230;&#8230; No, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m saying he&#8217;s stupid or that he can&#8217;t read what his opponent is going to move next&#8230;&#8230;. You know there are things we aren&#8217;t good at, right? How should I say this&#8230;&#8230; Kaito-san&#8230;&#8230; He has a fatal lack of sense in board games of this kind&#8230;&#8230; According to him, he would lose 90 percent of the time at board games. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;T- There&#8217;s still the 10 percent&#8230;&#8230; s- so it should be alright&#8230;&#8230; &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; I- I guess you&#8217;re right! Let&#8217;s look forward to the future development of the match! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, Alice knew about it. She often played together with Kaito, and had played board games with him before. However, Kaito was bad at strategy-type board games like chess. He was so bad at it that Alice became concerned about him instead&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that was also true for Megiddo who was currently playing against him.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-397303747"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-726187861"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(O- Oi, oi, Kaito!? You shouldn&#8217;t place a piece at that square! Heck, why are you putting your stone over there!? If you place it there, everything in the upper left corner will be&#8230;&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Megiddo was currently on the edge with each of their moves. However, it wasn&#8217;t because of the board&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(You idiot! One more square to the right and it would have been perfect! You can&#8217;t connect to the next move with that at all, you know!? &#8230;&#8230;K- Kaito&#8230;&#8230; My bad. I see, so you&#8217;re&#8230;&#8230; really bad at playing Double Color huh&#8230;&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without realizing that Megiddo was beginning to feel pity for him, Kaito had once again placed the stone in a completely wrong square.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second match of the three-game match against Megiddo-san. The Othello matchup went back and forth, and finally, the board was approaching the end game. It was a close match&#8230;&#8230; or so, I would like to say but&#8230;&#8230; Unnn. The board is already filled with so much red that there&#8217;s nowhere for me to place my stones. I- It seems like I lost. Why can&#8217;t I win at these kinds of board games? I even lost on that game of shogi against Alice when she only had &#8220;her king and a knight&#8221; on her side&#8230;&#8230; Alice was also bewildered at that time&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;I- Is there even any better handicap than this&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; or so she said&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">W- Well, we all have our strengths and weaknesses. E- Even I have things I&#8217;m not good at and things that I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m just not very good at board games&#8230;&#8230; I- I&#8217;ll have you know that I&#8217;m super good at Rubik&#8217;s cube! Just so you know, my personal record in solving one is 12 seconds!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; It&#8217;s settled. The winner of the second match is the War King, Megiddo. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;What a sad battle it is, isn&#8217;t it? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;Yes, I&#8217;ve never seen Megiddo-san wondering he should have &#8220;held back in a battle&#8221; like today. &gt;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-751085854"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-704674845"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? You&#8217;re going to go that far!? Am I seriously that weak!? I&#8217;m so bad at it that you&#8217;re calling it a sad battle!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kaito&#8230;&#8230; Ummm, I&#8217;m sorry.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Let&#8217;s go with the third match.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yeah.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t endure the atmosphere anymore. Even Megiddo-san has a sad expression on his face&#8230;&#8230; Unnn, let&#8217;s just get to the next match. The atmosphere is very unpleasant now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Alright! Let&#8217;s pull ourselves together and get to the third match! This will be the final battle!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Looking good, Kaito. Well then, let&#8217;s get things ready!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Wha!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Boldly smiling, Megiddo-san snapped his finger, and the scenery of the arena changed with the sound of the earth shaking. A series of devices that looked like amusement park attractions at first glance appeared one after another, forming what seemed to be a race course that circled the large arena&#8230;&#8230; Oi, wait a moment, could this be&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-616264652"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-612818811"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The last match will be an &#8220;Obstacle Course&#8221;! As expected, the finale should be a physical match!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something that I can&#8217;t win at all appeared!? What the heck are you expecting from the slime-like me, Megiddo-san!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, don&#8217;t worry, of course I&#8217;m not going to have Kaito fight a match that you can&#8217;t win. I&#8217;ll be giving you a handicap.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;A handicap?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh! I&#8217;m going to compete with &#8220;a body with the same physical abilities as Kaito&#8221;. I&#8217;m not going to move in ways that are impossible with your physical abilities, nor will I move at speeds that are impossible for you&#8230;&#8230; Well, there&#8217;s still a difference between our stamina, so &#8220;Kaito can use magic, while I could not&#8221;!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Fumu.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, that certainly makes it possible for me to win. If Megiddo-san has the same ability as me, then we would be even in terms of speed&#8230;&#8230; Megiddo-san still has the advantage in stamina and skill though, so he&#8217;ll adjust that by having me the only one who can use magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;What about stuff like Body Strengthening Magic?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, I&#8217;m not going to use it. Kaito can use it though.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2060395768"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2137082901"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I could also use Body Strengthening Magic. My Body Strengthening Magic is quite shabby, only increasing my physical ability by 30% at best, but it is still enough of an advantage. That means I have better maximum speed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Incidentally, Fate-san and I will be judging this race. When Megiddo-san performs a move that is impossible with Kaito-san&#8217;s physical abilities, it will automatically be Megiddo-san&#8217;s loss&#8230;&#8230; Is that alright? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve heard that the Live commentator and analyst will also serve as the referee, but I don&#8217;t think Megiddo-san would violate the terms he himself decided. That&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t doubt a single bit. The conditions aren&#8217;t bad&#8230;&#8230; In fact, I could even say that I have a significant advantage against him. I can even use Autopilot&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The problem is that the race course looked quite complicated and long&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m worried about my stamina, but I&#8217;ve also been running with Hina-chan a lot, so I think my stamina has gotten better than when I first came to this world. Nodding my head in agreement with Megiddo-san, we headed to the starting point together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stood at the starting point, I noticed the first obstacle waiting for me. About a hundred meters ahead of us were footholds&#8230;&#8230; things that looked like stepping stones jutting out from a pool of water. Beyond that was a steep slope. It wasn&#8217;t so steep that it would rather be called a wall, but it is still quite steep&#8230;&#8230; Mhmm, it&#8217;s hard to see every obstacle from where I am, but it seems like it would have lots of ups and downs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Incidentally, the one who designed the obstacle course is me. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uwaahhh&#8230;&#8230; The one who actually made these troublesome obstacles was her huh. T- This is going to be tough without some solid strategy&#8230;&#8230; Especially for my autopilot. It&#8217;s a powerful magic that provides me maximum performance with minimal movement, but it is difficult to use. It&#8217;s impossible for me to keep it active throughout the race, and it takes time to prepare because I have to set it up while moving, so I need to plan well when to make use of this magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now, with both our players standing side by side, the final battle is about to begin! Analyst Fate-san, what do you think of this match? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Hmmm. There are so many obstacles to cross, so I think it&#8217;s a matter of how they will get past them. Kai-chan seems to have an advantage in terms of conditions, but with his experience&#8230;&#8230; The War King had an overwhelming advantage because of his ability to handle situations. I think the key that will allow Kai-chan to win would be when he would use his magic huh? &gt;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1023170387"><div style="float: left; " id="foxaholic-357875038"><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js" type="f8684621122810eb4ba22494-text/javascript"></script> <ins class="adsbygoogle"

Well then, are both of you ready? Let&#8217;s start the count! Three, two, one, start! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Alice&#8217;s signal, Megiddo-san and I dashed forward. As expected, I was faster than him with my Body Strengthening Magic, and I made it to the first stepping stone first. It doesn&#8217;t feel like each stone was that wide, so if I leap forward while slowing down a bit&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking that, I tried to jump to the first stepping stone, but Megiddo-san, who had caught up with me, leapt without slowing down at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eeeeehhh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he jumped to the first stepping stone, leapt to a stepping stone quite a distance away, and as he arrived on that stepping stone with his hands on the ground, he pushed forth, jumping to the next stepping stone. With acrobatic movements as if he&#8217;s a gymnast, he quickly broke through the first obstacle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Astonished by his movements, I reflexively turned my attention to where the commentators Alice and Fate-san sat&#8230;&#8230; but they judged his movements as clear. Eh? Seriously? He can do that? It was possible for him to move like that even with my physical abilities!? E- Even with the same physical abilities, there would still be a difference depending on who operates that body huh&#8230;&#8230; This is going to be a tough fight.</span></p>
 
 <p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The third match between Kaito and Megiddo. In the final match, an Obstacle Course, Megiddo took the lead. Currently, Megiddo is only using the same physical abilities as Kaito, and simply put, Kaito, who can use Body Strengthening Magic, should have been faster and more powerful than Megiddo. However, Megiddo still currently has a large lead&#8230;&#8230; One of the reasons for this is the difference in stamina. Megiddo is certainly running with the same physical ability as Kaito, but Megiddo is able to maintain Kaito&#8217;s maximum speed until the goal. However, Kaito had to run while adjusting his stamina, and as a result, there was a gap of about two obstacles between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, bluntly speaking, &#8220;Megiddo had predicted for a development like this to occur&#8221;. Or rather, it might be better to say that this was inevitable. Even if two people drove the same car that have the same performance, the difference between the abilities of an F1 racer and an amateur driver can be clearly seen. It was natural that Megiddo would take the lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, that&#8217;s why&#8230;&#8230; Megiddo asked &#8220;Alice to be the one creating these obstacles&#8221;.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1785988222"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1917987574"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now, Megiddo-san is fast! He has already dashed through the first half of the race course. He has slightly opened up a distance with Kaito-san! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After glancing at the Live commentator Alice, Megiddo grinned and turned his attention back to the race course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I know&#8230;&#8230; The real deal is about to come now, right? Shalltear, you&#8217;re extremely partial towards Kaito. That’s exactly why I asked you this! If it&#8217;s you, &#8220;you&#8217;d make a race course that would give Kaito a good chance of beating me&#8221;, even under these conditions, right? It wouldn&#8217;t be any fun if you don&#8217;t! Now, what have you prepared?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a smile on his face, he arrived at the next obstacle. Before him was a small cube placed on the desk. Seeing this cube, Megiddo slowed down and tilted his head in wonder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;&#8230;What&#8217;s this?)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now, Megiddo-san has reached the turning point of the first half of the race course. The obstacle in front of him is called a &#8220;Rubik&#8217;s Cube&#8221;! A toy from another world. The explanation is posted on the desk~~ &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Megiddo, seeing the Rubik&#8217;s Cube for the first time, quickly looks over the instructions on the desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I see&#8230;&#8230; So it&#8217;s a puzzle huh&#8230;&#8230; Fumu, I thought I knew some things about toys from another world, but I&#8217;ve never seen this before&#8230;&#8230; Well, this is just about making this toy&#8217;s six sides have the same colors, so let&#8217;s get this over with.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Megiddo moves the cube around, checking the combinations&#8230;&#8230; Even though it was the first time he had used this toy, it was simple to play and he was able to match the colors smoothly. A minute or so after Megiddo arrived at this obstacle, Kaito finally caught up with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now then, it seems like Kaito-san has also arrived at the same obstacle. This item is a toy from another world, which should be advantageous for the otherworlder Kaito-san&#8230;&#8230; Would he be able to turn the tables here? &gt;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-303204162"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1089224040"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;&#8230;You&#8217;re being naive, Kaito certainly may have been accustomed with this toy&#8230;&#8230; but I&#8217;ve already solved three sides. After a minute here, this will be an easy victory&#8230;&#8230; Unnn?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking that he won&#8217;t be able to turn the tables here, Megiddo glanced toward Kaito&#8230;&#8230; He held the Rubik&#8217;s Cube in his hand and looked at it from various angles for about 10 seconds. And then&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[W- Whaaaaaat!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterward, Kaito&#8217;s hands moved without any hesitation and arranged all six sides in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Kaito-san&#8217;s amazing! He passed through that obstacle in the blink of an eye! The tables have been turned!!! &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T- That&#8217;s impossible! What the heck was that just now? It only took him 20 seconds&#8230;&#8230; no, less than 15 seconds to complete it!?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Kaito, Rubik&#8217;s Cube is one of his few specialties, but Megiddo, who has no idea about such a thing, is so astonished that his hands stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I- It&#8217;s as if he knows the procedure all along&#8230;&#8230; Could it be that Shalltear taught him that? No, that&#8217;s not it. There&#8217;s no way that she would blatantly use such a method&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty sure she made this course in favor of Kaito, but it&#8217;s really hard to tell&#8230;&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, Megiddo considered the possibility that Alice had leaked the answer to Kaito, but he quickly dismissed it in his mind and returned to the task of aligning the Rubik&#8217;s cube. However, he wasn&#8217;t just lightly shaken, he was feeling somewhat flustered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;&#8230;The first obstacle, stepping stones were large and closely spaced. The second obstacle, the slope, was also made of non-slip materials&#8230;&#8230; They had been adjusted so that even Kaito who wasn&#8217;t used to moving his body could easily break through. Yes, Shalltear&#8217;s help should be just that&#8230;&#8230; Anything more than that wouldn&#8217;t convince Kaito that she isn&#8217;t being biased towards him. That means what happened just now was just Kaito&#8217;s ability? However, how could he solve it that fast&#8230;&#8230; No, wait a moment?)</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1526272672"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-982687022"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to Kaito&#8217;s speed, which could be described as overwhelming, Megiddo tried to calm his agitated mind and regulated his thoughts. At that moment, Megiddo had also arranged all six sides and continued to think as he ran to catch up with Kaito who was ahead of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Kaito looked at the cube for about 10 seconds in the beginning&#8230;&#8230; Could it be&#8230;&#8230; He saw through the steps to solve it in those ten seconds!? T- That&#8217;s outrageous&#8230;&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Megiddo realized how good Kaito was at Rubik&#8217;s Cube, he slightly shivered, and after his shoulders shook once&#8230;&#8230; he viciously smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[H- Hahaha! That&#8217;s right!!! Now this is what I&#8217;m talking about!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Whoa there, Megiddo-san roared! He&#8217;s now breaking through the obstacles with a tremendous speed! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Megiddo, competitions are the best&#8230;&#8230; Megiddo is a genuine battle maniac who is more motivated the stronger his opponents are. And now, his fighting spirit was ignited. Although he was still adhering to the limits of physical abilities they&#8217;d arranged, his movements were even leaner and sharper than before. His momentum was so strong that he immediately caught up with Kaito and overtook him&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; T- The tables have turned yet again! It&#8217;s a burning hot battle!!! &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;Hey, No-chan? I have some questions here&#8230;&#8230; &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Unnn? What&#8217;s the matter? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just me&#8230;&#8230; but I feel like Kai-chan is &#8220;unfocused&#8221; since earlier. &gt;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1731617903"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1750558848"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Ahh~~ You&#8217;re right. There&#8217;s a little bit of waste in his movements. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;I guess he&#8217;s doing something huh? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;I wonder? I can already predict what he&#8217;s doing, but I guess it would be better if we wait and see, isn&#8217;t it? &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Megiddo, who was running with a burning fighting spirit, was gradually pulling away from him, the expression on Kaito&#8217;s face did not change. And then, he quietly muttered something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;With this&#8230;&#8230; Setting up for the end game is complete&#8230;&#8230; Just&#8230;&#8230; a few distance more&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaito is quietly but surely making his preparations&#8230;&#8230; Even as the gap widened between them, there was still not a trace of resignation in his eyes. There are now three obstacles of a difference between him and Megiddo&#8230;&#8230; Even so, he&#8217;s still &#8220;within range&#8221; so&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
 
 <p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">It hurts&#8230;&#8230; As my breathing becomes more and more ragged, I feel an unpleasant pain in my side. The course was a lap around a large arena, and with so many obstacles to overcome&#8230;&#8230; I was exhausted by the time I reached the end of the halfway point. I was able to turn the tables once when there was a Rubik&#8217;s Cube challenge, but that turnaround only ignited Megiddo-san&#8217;s fighting spirit and he turned the tables again, and now, I&#8217;m way behind him. However, he&#8217;s still barely&#8230;&#8230; within range&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the start until now, I&#8217;ve been running with my eyes on the end of the course. What obstacles would be there, and which route would be the shortest&#8230;&#8230; With those things in mind, I constructed my magic technique. To begin with, Megiddo-san and I have different basic stamina. I may be able to run faster than him, but I don&#8217;t have the stamina to maintain that speed from start to finish. That&#8217;s why, yes&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;I knew that this was going to happen&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Megiddo-san is ahead of me, and I&#8217;m following behind him. For me to achieve victory&#8230;&#8230; there&#8217;s only one chance. Autopilot&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m the only one who can use magic in this match, and this is my most powerful trump card. This is the only card I have that has a chance of beating Megiddo-san. However, this trump card of mine is a double-edged sword&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s difficult to say this, but the amount of magic power I have isn&#8217;t that great. No matter how much I squeeze out, I couldn&#8217;t keep Autopilot running for even half of the race course. That&#8217;s why it was crucial to get to the endgame of this race with a gap that I&#8217;m able to catch up with&#8230;&#8230; and that would be the turning point of this match.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1641162122"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1320305384"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now, with less than a third of the race course remaining, we&#8217;re finally in the endgame of the race! Megiddo-san is now in the lead. He has pulled apart quite a distance from Kaito-san! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s here. This is the moment! The distance between Megiddo-san and I is just barely enough to catch up with him, but whether my magic power will hold on&#8230;&#8230; That would be difficult to say. However, all I need to know is that I have a chance of winning with this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Autopilot.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I said the keywords, my body slipped out of my control and I sped up. The fatigue I was feeling doesn&#8217;t go away, and I still feel some of the pain from it. However, Autopilot ignores all of that and forces my body to work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Whoa there!? Kaito-san abruptly accelerated! He&#8217;s heading for the next obstacle in one breath! And what awaits him is the&#8230;&#8230; Stepping stones Version 2! &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; You like stepping stones that much, No-chan? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Stepping stones are the staple of Obstacle Races after all. However, the stepping stones this time are much bigger and more complicated than before. Even Megiddo-san had taken quite a while in there too! Let&#8217;s see how Kaito-san would fare with this&#8230;&#8230; wait, oh my God!? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; What is it? &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used Hina-chan as a reference for my running form. As for how to break through this obstacle&#8230;&#8230; I had the best model running ahead of me. Stepping on the second stepping stone&#8230;&#8230; My body jumped to the stepping stones without hesitation and I broke through, using my hands as well as my feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; W- Wasn&#8217;t that Megiddo-san&#8217;s movement just now!? N- No, because of his superior physical strength thanks to magic, Kaito-san&#8217;s movement is even faster than Megiddo-san!!! &gt;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2069282385"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1811714002"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;I guess he was using War King&#8217;s movements as a reference. Well, since the War King  would be using the same physical ability as him, with his vast athletic experience, he would certainly be a great reference&#8230;&#8230; but it ain&#8217;t that easy. &#8230;&#8230;I guess this means that Kai-chan is getting serious huh? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Whoa there, he climbed up the next obstacle, a tall wall, at an insanely fast speed! Amazing! He&#8217;s getting closer and closer to Megiddo-san! At last, the cornered herbivore has bared his fangs on the carnivore!!! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Herbivore&#8230;&#8230;? No, well, if Megiddo-san is the carnivore, that means that I&#8217;m the herbivore but&#8230;&#8230; At that moment, Megiddo-san, who had been compared to a predator, looked at the running me. As an intense smile appeared on his face, he loudly shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kaitooooooo! That&#8217;s great! That&#8217;s a great speed you have! Isn&#8217;t that just great! Come! Let me see you sink your fangs on my neck!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the fact that I was catching up on him, Megiddo-san didn&#8217;t seem to be flustered at all. In fact, he looked as if he was having fun. He&#8217;s really a battle maniac by nature&#8230;&#8230; but, well, putting the act of biting his neck aside&#8230;&#8230; I still intend to overtake him. My legs are screaming. I&#8217;m so out of breath that I&#8217;m feeling suffocated. Still, my body doesn&#8217;t stop, and keeps on forcing me to bring out my peak performance. Even though my body is adjusting so that it won&#8217;t break down, the pain I&#8217;m feeling is still hard to bear&#8230;&#8230; While my body continues to move, various thoughts come to my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How could I be working so hard? Isn&#8217;t it enough already? Even if I continue like this, I might not be able to catch up with Megiddo-san. In the first place, it&#8217;s strange for me to try to beat Megiddo-san, one of the Six Kings. It&#8217;s fine for me to lose.&#8221; &#8230;&#8230;Frantically pushing those thoughts out of my mind, I continued to activate Autopilot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the beginning, this was not a game that I could not lose. This was all just a game, so I let myself get carried away by the situation and joined their game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now, Megiddo-san has crossed the final obstacle, &#8220;walking on a tightrope&#8221;, and the rest would just be a straight line to the finish line! Kaito-san too, has reached the final obstacle but&#8230;&#8230; Would this distance between them be too much for him? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; The last straight line is quite long, but with the difference between Kai-chan and the War King&#8230;&#8230; I guess it would be difficult. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, yes&#8230;&#8230; There are many people who have helped me reach this place. Eden-san, Pandora-san, Iris-san&#8230;&#8230; and lastly&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-591699171"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1189437987">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Master! Do your best!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in the arena filled with heated cheers, I could still strangely hear her voice. With her cheers, I somehow felt like my legs, which should have been moving automatically, gaining strength. Her voice, and the glimpse to Anima, gave me the courage to bring out my true final joker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Breaking through the tightrope obstacle, despite being greatly outdistanced, I reached the final straight line. At that moment, I deactivated Autopilot once and at the same time, reactivated it with the new keywords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Autopilot&#8230;&#8230; Limit Release!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t want to use this if it&#8217;s possible. After all, using this hurts like hell&#8230;&#8230; But my opponent is Megiddo-san. He isn&#8217;t someone I can win against without taking any risks. Limit Release&#8230;&#8230; It is a keyword that removes the Autopilot&#8217;s restriction of &#8220;moving while making sure that it will not destroy my body&#8221;. It&#8217;s the same power I used when I fought Anima when she was a Black Bear&#8230;&#8230; It was a magic that allowed my body to exhibit an extraordinary amount of power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; W- What a great surprise! Kaito-san dashed forth with an explosive speed! He&#8217;s fast! Lightning fast!!! &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With my limiter removed, my body kicks the ground with tremendous force, and I start running at more than twice the speed I was before. When he saw me rapidly closing the distance between me and Megiddo-san, even Megiddo-san was astonished as he exclaimed in surprise. However&#8230;&#8230; This freaking hurts! Ouchingly hurts! I&#8217;m also hearing some kind of tearing sound coming from my feet, which definitely doesn&#8217;t sound good at all! I mean, I&#8217;m pretty sure my bones are broken too! Well, even if my  bones are broken, magic power would still force my legs to move!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh, but as my body screamed in pain, trying to catch up with Megiddo-san&#8230;&#8230; I also finally understood why I was working so hard. Of course, there&#8217;s also the fact that I can&#8217;t lose and waste Anima and the others&#8217; help towards me&#8230;&#8230; but perhaps, a reason even more important than that&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; The goal is only a few distance before them! There&#8217;s hardly any distance between them anymore!!! &gt;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-890956958"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-925257540"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Megiddo-san is really amazing. There were many obstacles in this race that were in my favor. The best example for this is that Rubik&#8217;s Cube obstacle. It must have been the first time he had seen a Rubik&#8217;s Cube too. Even so, Megiddo-san was able to clear that puzzle and overtake me. I&#8217;ve been watching Megiddo-san&#8217;s movements as a reference for Autopilot&#8230;&#8230; and I was moved by how refined his body movements are. Megiddo-san is not only powerful, he is also knowledgeable and skilled&#8230;&#8230; A real warrior who polishes himself without compromise. I think he&#8217;s a really great person&#8230;&#8230; And now, for whatever reason, I am fighting against him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if that&#8217;s the reason why&#8230;&#8230; The reason why I wanted to win. His blazing fighting spirit seemed to have ignited my heart as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because Megiddo-san is an amazing person, a warrior who I can truly and undeniably respect&#8230;&#8230; I want to win against Megiddo-san. It&#8217;s not like when we first met, where I somehow won with Shiro-san&#8217;s blessing&#8230;&#8230; I want to win against Megiddo-san with my own power!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Guhhh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overtaking Megiddo-san, we are almost to the finish line&#8230;&#8230; but at that moment, the magic power in my body is about to run out. As strength slowly loses strength, I feel like I&#8217;m seeing things in slow motion while my body collapses. No, not now&#8230;&#8230; Just a few more steps&#8230;&#8230; From within my body, squeeze every ounce of magic power out! I will win!!! I will win against Megiddo-san!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling magic power passing through my crumbling legs again, I regained my footing and ran.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Goooooaaallll! Now, in a fierce dead heat, Kaito-san has reached the goal!!! Eh&#8212;&#8212; Wha!? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Kai-chan!? &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reached the goal. I beat Megiddo-san! As soon as such feelings come to my mind, Autopilot is completely deactivated. When that happens, I would be met with a terrible situation where &#8220;my legs would suddenly stop while I&#8217;m running my maximum speed&#8221;, and my body would be thrown forward. I guess this could only end up with my face smacking on the ground huh&#8230;&#8230; That would definitely hurt&#8230;&#8230; Well, it was a suicide mission knowing that I have Fruits of the World Tree with me to begin with, so I was prepared for such a situation&#8230;&#8230; but I definitely wish for an alternative way where it doesn&#8217;t hurt&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Closing my eyes, I prepared for the moment when my face hit first to the ground. However, what I felt immediately after was not the pain of my face hitting the ground, but the feeling of being softly and gently hugged.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-660489435"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-498963084"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haahhh&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;re being reckless again&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Kuro?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Geez, Kaito-kun really won&#8217;t change, aren&#8217;t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, Kuro was holding me in her arms, and with an amazed expression on her face, she brought her hand over my legs. Thereupon, my legs were enveloped in light, and the pain I had felt earlier completely disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;But well, congratulations. You really did great.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Thanks.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;But that doesn&#8217;t mean you can escape from my scolding later.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Kuro held me in her arms, I slowly moved my gaze backward and saw Megiddo-san standing at the goal, clapping his hands with a gentle smile on his face.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1395951598"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1533760026"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Go on, Kaito-kun. Megiddo and the crowd are waiting for you&#8230;&#8230; Go ahead. Show your confidence as today&#8217;s winner.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yeah.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Megiddo-san took it very easy on me, and the race course was in my favor. It may not have been a complete victory, but a great feeling still welled up from within me. I&#8217;m sure that it&#8217;s because despite all the help I&#8217;ve gotten&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; I think it&#8217;s because I was able to grab this victory with my own power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moving away from Kuro and arriving at the goal where Megiddo-san was waiting for me, I was greeted with loud cheers. A storm of voices shook the air, many of them in praise of me. It feels kind of strange, itchy, and yet, heartwarming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s my loss, Kaito. It was a good fight. I give you my thanks.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, it&#8217;s me who should be thanking you instead. Thank you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shaking hands with Megiddo-san who is in his humanoid form, we praised each other for the good fight. Somehow, I kinda like this kind of thing&#8230;&#8230; After giving it your all, you shake hands with the person you fought against. I didn&#8217;t belong to an athletic club in junior high and high school, so this was just my imagination, but maybe this is what they call youth&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m already 21 though&#8230;&#8230; No, I guess I&#8217;m rather young in this world huh&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Speaking of which, Megiddo-san. I heard from Bacchus-san, but &#8220;what is it that you want to teach me&#8221;?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah~~ that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;ll tell you all about it&#8230;&#8230; a little later at the party.The party starts at 8 pm &#8230;&#8230;Until then, enjoy the festival again.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[H- Huhh&#8230;&#8230; I understand.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1832178037"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1069923209"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, it seems that I will know Megiddo-san&#8217;s intentions at the evening party&#8230;&#8230; I mean, that party, is it already decided that I will be attending? I guess it&#8217;s already decided huh. Yes, yes, I know already. Well, I was first in line thanks to the perks of being a Black-rank, but there might be others that will challenge Megiddo-san, so I guess it&#8217;s sort of reasonable that he would say it later. As I was thinking about this, the race course that had been prepared for the arena disappeared and the arena returned back to normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; It was quite the heated three-game match. Congratulations for the splendid victory, Challenger Kaito-san! Well~~ That was a wonderful fight, wasn&#8217;t it, Fate-san? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Kai-chan was so hot and cool at the end there~~ Kai-chaaaan~~! It&#8217;s me! Raise me!!! &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; A- Ahaha&#8230;&#8230; Errr, well then, let&#8217;s give a big round of applause to our challenger, Miyama Kaito-san! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Fate-san, you just don&#8217;t change at all. Even so, could you stop saying that line with Loudspeaker Magic!? It&#8217;s super embarrassing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now then, a battle had just ended but&#8230;&#8230; there&#8217;s still a big battle ahead. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s about to begin huh. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Unnn? Arehh? What&#8217;s with this tense atmosphere?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now then, the battle that is about to occur&#8230;&#8230; I suggest that all weak-willed people evacuate. You might really die if you remain in the premises when it occurs. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;This is bad, the rising killing intent is different from the battle just now. &gt;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-984123100"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1905893886"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the sound of rumbling earth, explosive magic power blasted out from everywhere, shaking the arena. As if an earthquake was happening, cracks began to appear all over the arena. Eh? Wait a moment? The heck is this&#8230;&#8230; What the heck is about to occur!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;Well then&#8230;&#8230; The &#8220;rock-paper-scissors tournament with Kaito-san&#8217;s Clay Sculpture as the prize&#8221; starts!!! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, a number of shadows flew out into the arena.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kuro, with black smoke-like magic power leaking out of her body, Isis-san, with her bluish-white magic power of death spreading around, and Lillywood-san with a tired expression on her face. There&#8217;s also Shiro-san, quietly making her entrance, but her body is clad in her shimmering magic power, Chronois-san, who has the same expression as Lillywood-san, and Life-san, who has a serious expression on her face. In the midst of this arena, looking like a cage filled with fierce beasts, Chris-san and Laguna-san fearlessly entered too. Eden-san also descended from out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;No, wait a moment there! Isn&#8217;t everyone being too serious!? Oh no, this is really going to destroy the world&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Everyone is quite motivated. The tournament is also open for the general public but&#8230;&#8230; it&#8217;s seriously dangerous, so please participate with caution. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Hey? No-chan. I&#8217;d like to join too&#8230;&#8230; &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; We will be participating here, Fate-san. I will also be participating in the tournament while giving my Live commentary. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; I see, got it! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no, seriously, wait a moment there! Everyone&#8217;s being so motivated&#8230;&#8230; The prize is just that &#8220;sad creature&#8221;, you know!? Or rather, please give me a break&#8230;&#8230; Why the heck are all of you fighting for my black history? Wouldn&#8217;t it all be hellish no matter who wins it&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1871792972"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2047720595"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Ah, yes, yes. What about you, Kaito-san? Are you going to participate? &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;..I&#8217;m participating.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this case, I don&#8217;t have any choice but to win at all costs and recover my black history myself&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; &#8230;&#8230;Is that alright? You need to be able to &#8220;change your hand for at least a thousand times per second&#8221; at the very least to be able to compete with the others&#8230;&#8230; &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;The heck is that, that&#8217;s scary.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was rock-paper-scissors really such a monster competition? Or perhaps, it&#8217;s just that the participants are abnormal? As I was stunned by Alice&#8217;s words, out of the corner of my eye, I saw Kuro and Isis playing rock-paper-scissors, as if they were practicing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;It feels kinda strange though? Why does &#8220;the tip of their elbow disappear&#8221; when they are about to swing their hands down? Why the heck does playing rock-paper-scissors &#8220;make a crater in the ground&#8221;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh&#8230;&#8230; That sounds like a great game! Alright, I will also jo&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Megiddo?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ah, no.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Megiddo-san, who was a battle fanatic, tried to join in the match but&#8230;&#8230; after Kuro glared at him, he immediately sat up on a seiza. It seems like Megiddo-san is very obedient only to Kuro. No, putting him aside&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Well then, I&#8217;d like to get the tournament started but&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;d like to warn everyone that &#8220;anyone that makes a move that wipes the arena&#8221; will be disqualified, so please take note of that. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve never heard anyone making such a warning in rock-paper-scissors before though!? No, I guess what&#8217;s abnormal is that there are so many people here who can do exactly that! And thus, the battle with Megiddo-san ended&#8230;&#8230; and the rock-paper-scissors tournament of monsters began. A problem came right after one ended&#8230;&#8230; It may not exactly be fitting, but I didn&#8217;t expect that an outrageous situation like this would happen. Moreover, the thing they&#8217;re fighting over for, that&#8217;s my black history, you know!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a scene that could be seen straight out of an apocalypse. With a roar, the earth cracked, the air swirled, and people ran for cover&#8230;&#8230; With those descriptions, did you think that I&#8217;m talking about a war? No, I&#8217;m talking about a &#8220;rock-paper-scissors tournament&#8221;. Right in front of me was an arena full of craters, littered with places that were on the verge of collapsing, but the place was somehow able to maintain its original shape. Can you believe this? Everyone was just playing rock-paper-scissors, you know? Moreover, it all started just because of a badly-made clay sculpture that I made&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no way that an ordinary person like me could intervene in the battle called rock-paper-scissors, which had completely become some kind of ultra-dimensional sport&#8230;&#8230; I just prayed to God that my black history would not fall into the hands of someone troublesome.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, my wish was scoffed at by the God I prayed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Now then, the one who had won the fierce battle of rock-paper-scissors is&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;Creator God Shallow Vernal-sama&#8221;!!! Creator God-sama really was strong!!! &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most troublesome person in the world got her hands on it! For the airhead Shiro-san to acquire it, that was almost the worst event of all. The worst thing that could have happened was for it to fall into Eden-san&#8217;s hands, but this was still the second worst situation of all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt;As expected of Shallow Vernal-sama. If Shallow Vernal-sama is the one who got her hands on it, I wouldn&#8217;t complain about that either. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Hmmm. It was also close for Kuro-san, who she fought against in the finals. &gt;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-477502897"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-695055100"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; The Underworld King just didn&#8217;t have the best luck. She had to fight Shallow Vernal-sama right after her fierce battle against that &#8220;Mysterious Angel&#8221;, so she was exhausted. &gt;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&lt; Well~~ I wonder who that angel is? As soon as she lost, she disappeared as if she had no interest in any other thing anymore&#8230;&#8230; &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and Fate-san are still doing their shameless live commentary and analysis, even though the audience has already fled. The only ones left here are only the ones I know. But then again, I&#8217;m feeling complicated only because of what they&#8217;re fighting about&#8230;&#8230; but it was a really fierce battle. Well, I couldn&#8217;t see anyone doing attacks or defends at all, but I could hear the explosions and the ground being gouged out. Kuro beat Eden-san in the semifinals, but she seemed to have worn herself out and lost to Shiro-san in the finals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiro-san&#8217;s opponent in the semifinals was Fate-san, but Fate-san forfeited, and Shiro-san managed to win without tiring herself at that match. Well, it was really as Fate-san said. Kuro was just not blessed with luck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Errr, thank you. Lillywood-san.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m just glad that Kaito-san is uninjured.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, Lillywood-san protected me, Lilia-san and the others, so we didn&#8217;t get injured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Shiro-san? I know you can hear me, right? I&#8217;d really like it if you promptly hand over my black history back to me, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(On one condition.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; I feel like I&#8217;ve extremely lost. It seems that Shiro-san is fixated on the situation where I ask her out, that she would even shamelessly lead the conversation to that&#8230;&#8230; What a frightening person she is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(If the date turns out to be a fun one, I might even give this clay sculpture to Kaito-san.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A surprising new fact just came out! What the heck are you trying to do!? I mean, such a battle happened without my knowledge!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Mnhh.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she was cutely sulking, that&#8217;s something I couldn&#8217;t let pass, so I had to devote my efforts to persuading Shiro-san for a while after that.</span></p>
 
 <p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the game with Megiddo-san was over, I went around the various attractions with Lilia-san and the others. Even though most of the attractions were like sports games, we still had lots of fun going around&#8230;&#8230; but to be honest, my scores weren&#8217;t so good. I don&#8217;t know if I was feeling listless after my victory over Megiddo-san, or perhaps, I still haven&#8217;t settled down the joy I felt from winning against Megiddo-san, but I wasn&#8217;t able to concentrate on the attractions. It was the first time I had fought to the death in front of such a large audience, so it was probably inevitable that the realization that I did such a thing would come to me late. After visiting the attractions until evening arrives, I was able to gather 22 stamps. I then went to the Central Plaza to exchange the stamps for prizes. I thought for sure that it would count as me having 22 stamps but&#8230;&#8230; Each of the Five Generals&#8217; oversized stamps is worth ten stamps. The colossal stamp, which is the sign of my victory over Megiddo-san, is calculated as 100 stamps.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-738437264"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-656516758"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, I had collected 172 stamps and I was able to get the top prize, &#8220;a pair of gloves made from Megiddo-san&#8217;s mane&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; H- Hmmm. It seems that they can handle extremely high temperatures, and if you put these gloves on, &#8220;you won&#8217;t feel the heat even if you touch magma&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; However, &#8220;the parts other than the gloves would still be burned though&#8221;. How should I say this&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s a very difficult item to use. I at least don&#8217;t think I would ever face an instance where I would need to touch magma in the future&#8230;&#8230; I mean, I don&#8217;t want to be anywhere near magma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Can&#8217;t I just use them as a substitute for working gloves or as mittens? I guess not. Unnn, this thing would certainly be very expensive&#8230;&#8230; Well, I&#8217;ll just leave figuring out how to use this for the future me. The hectic first day of the Six Kings Festival comes to an end at 8 p.m., and the participants are now returning back to their accommodations. However, since Lilia-san and I were invited to a party by Megiddo-san, we didn&#8217;t return to our accommodations, but moved to the Central Tower where I challenged Megiddo-san.</span></p>
 
 <p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Isn&#8217;t this strange? How the heck could this have happened?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were currently many people in my line of sight, and I was standing on a platform overlooking them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh! It seems like everyone has gathered!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And standing beside me was Megiddo-san, who had returned to his original form and was nodding in satisfaction at the sight of the gathered people. I&#8217;ll just ask again, how the heck could this have happened? As soon as we arrived at the assembly hall, I was separated from Lilia-san and the others, and for some reason, I was brought to the stage set up in the center with Megiddo-san. No matter where I look, I can only see people, people, and people&#8230;&#8230; I could feel eyes silently looking from all directions. I feel really restless here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if to say that he doesn&#8217;t care about my feelings, Megiddo-san proceeded to loudly speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The people I&#8217;ve called here tonight are my subordinates and those who performed well at today&#8217;s festival! We all had a good fight! Today was a great day!!! As a thank you, I&#8217;ve prepared plenty of food and drinks for everyone. Go and have all the fun you want!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Megiddo-san&#8217;s shout, a loud cheer rang out. As I was feeling overwhelmed by the atmosphere of the huge party, Megiddo-san picked me up and put me on his shoulder. What the heck is going on!?</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-818348951"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1633406739"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But before we start the party, I want to introduce someone to all of you! &#8220;This is the only person who has defeated me&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; Miyama Kaito!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after that, loud cheers rang out again. O- Oohh&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Alice told me on the way here, the number of people who have managed to defeat Megiddo-san&#8230;&#8230; or rather, the number of people who have managed to challenge Megiddo-san is just one. That&#8217;s because it seems like Agni-san, who was originally already strong, was completely fired up after she got defeated by Iris-san&#8230;&#8230; After I got a badge from her, night had fallen without any other person managing to win against her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Listen here! Kaito beat me. That means he&#8217;s better than everyone at this party right now! Ora! Here comes the strong warrior!!! Get excited, you lot!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the crowd broke into cheers&#8230;&#8230; U- Uwoooohhhh&#8230;&#8230; This feels kind of amazing. It feels like I&#8217;m shivering in excitement. Or rather, n- no matter how I look at it, lifting me up is a bit too much&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the loud cheers subsided, Megiddo-san announced the start of the party. Most of the people here are Megiddo-san&#8217;s subordinates&#8230;&#8230;  In other words, there were people who were used to parties, so no one got bewildered when a noisy party started. Looking down at the scene of people everywhere shouting &#8220;Cheers!&#8221;, I felt an indescribable emotion welling up in my heart. There was this itchy&#8230;&#8230; embarrassment, but I&#8217;m also feeling a different kind of excitement, making me reflexively clench my fist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After slowly lowering me down, Megiddo-san took out a large cup out of nowhere and handed me one of them before pouring me alcohol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Here. Look here, Kaito.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You&#8217;re better than anyone here today&#8230;&#8230; and no one&#8217;s complaining.

This scene was something you have definitely won.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s there again. Another indescribable itch budding in my chest&#8230;&#8230; Ahh, I see, I understand what this feeling is now. This is called &#8230;&#8230; &#8220;a sense of accomplishment&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I realized this, I felt joy surging from within me. That&#8217;s right&#8230;.. It had been an unrefined battle. Maybe it was because luck was on my side, or maybe it was because Alice was supporting me from behind the scenes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I certainly won&#8230;&#8230; It was my victory&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had won&#8230;&#8230; against Megiddo-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Come on, Kaito. Drink up, it&#8217;s a celebration!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes! Thank you for the drink!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was savoring the feeling of victory that had finally come over me, Megiddo-san called out to me and made a toast. And then, I gulped down the alcohol&#8230;&#8230; entering my mouth, down my throat and into my stomach&#8230;&#8230; The taste of the delicious alcohol seeped into my entire body.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-44454072"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1799386015"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;This is very delicious. Is it an expensive drink?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, it certainly was a relatively good alcohol, but it&#8217;s not that rare of a drink.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;..Is that so. However, this tastes delicious. I think it&#8217;s one of the best I&#8217;ve ever had&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see. Hey, Kaito. My bad, for having you deal with my selfishness today.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Ah, no&#8230;&#8230; Rather than that, in the end, what was it that Megiddo-san wanted to teach me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While having a somewhat peaceful conversation, I took another sip of alcohol before asking Megiddo-san. What Megiddo-san wanted to teach me&#8230;&#8230; He said he would tell me about it at this party, but in the end, what was it all about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? Ahhh&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s right. Hey, Kaito. Today was quite a rough day, wasn&#8217;t it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, errr&#8230;&#8230; Yes.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hahaha, I guess so. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had a tough day, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re tired&#8230;&#8230; but what do you think? You fought like hell and won&#8230;&#8230; and after that, drinking alcohol. Isn&#8217;t it the best?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ehh? &#8230;&#8230;Yes!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1776968502"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1154685052"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Remember this Kaito. The alcohol you drank there is called a &#8220;Wine of Victory&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Wine of Victory&#8230;&#8230; Could it be that that is&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is that what Megiddo-san wanted to teach me? Just as I was about to ask that, Megiddo-san drank all the alcohol in his cup at once, turned to me and heartily smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, there&#8217;s certainly that too but&#8230;&#8230; there&#8217;s still one thing I want to tell you. Kaito, you&#8217;re a great guy. But you also have a flaw. It&#8217;s that you have &#8220;low self-esteem&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ugghhh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s this? So you&#8217;re well aware of it huh&#8230;&#8230; Then, you better start learning how to fix that. I&#8217;ll tell you again, you&#8217;re a great guy&#8230;&#8230; Otherwise, there&#8217;s no way I would lose against you twice. So, well, how do I say this&#8230;&#8230; You need to be a little more composed and confident. You&#8217;re not a pathetic person who&#8217;s always needing someone&#8217;s help. You&#8217;re someone who can seize glory on your own.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Megiddo-san.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words of affirmation felt like a powerful push behind my back. How should I say this&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m really quite blessed. There was someone who would warn me when I was wrong, someone who would scold me when I was being reckless&#8230;&#8230; and someone who would push me forward. They are truly a blessing in disguise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;That was quite unlike me. Come, let&#8217;s drink again! We&#8217;re going to drink a lot today!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-160929522"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-826861285"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was bewildered, tired, and struggled, and yet, I still desperately grasped for victory. I&#8217;ll probably never forget this day for the rest of my life. Feeling this rewarding joy of standing up with your own two feet&#8230;&#8230; Megiddo-san taught me&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; The taste of the wine of victory&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The party hosted by Megiddo-san kept going on in a lively manner. Only the people who collected the most stamps on the first day and Megiddo-san&#8217;s subordinates participated in this party, so Kuo and Alice weren&#8217;t here. Well, I guess they could easily join if they wanted to, but it seems like they read the mood around here and probably won&#8217;t barge in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about this, Megiddo-san loudly put down his cup and shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Speaking of which, oi, you b*stard! Ozma!!! For only your place to have an 80% pass rate, what does this mean!? Look at Agni&#8217;s place, she hasn&#8217;t let anyone but Kaito through!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah~~ You see, everyone was working so hard to win against me. &#8220;I&#8221; can&#8217;t just ignore their hard work~~]<br /> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N: Ozma usually refers to himself as &#8220;Ojii-san/Uncle&#8221;, but he uses &#8220;Ore/I&#8221; here.)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Responding with those words, Ozma-san, holding a small cup in one hand, looked as lax as ever as he approached our way. Even so, it seems like he would still be using honorifics when talking with Megiddo-san, and his tone has changed but&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hahh&#8230;&#8230; You never change&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;re still always drinking cheap alcohol&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well~~ I don&#8217;t really like the taste of expensive alcohol&#8230;&#8230; Ya, Miyama-kun. Good work out there.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes. Thank you very much!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Calmly calling out to me, Ozma-san then sits down across from Megiddo-san.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2121897986"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-378103699"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It seems like Master is having fun. Isn&#8217;t your drinking pace faster than usual?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, today&#8217;s match was fun. The alcohol afterward is also great!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, that&#8217;s great&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking as if Megiddo-san&#8217;s happiness was his own, Ozma-san snapped his fingers and made a giant bottle of alcohol appear. Then, leisurely holding it in one hand, he poured alcohol into Megiddo-san’s cup, to which Megiddo-san drank without saying a word. Filled with this somewhat friendly mood, or perhaps, a gentle atmosphere, I suddenly wondered about something and voiced out my question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ummm, Ozma-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? What is it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Only Ozma-san calls Megiddo-san &#8220;Master&#8221; instead of adding &#8220;-sama&#8221; in his name, is there a reason for that?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hmm~~ Well, it&#8217;s just an old habit. There isn&#8217;t any deeper reason for that.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ozma has been my subordinate the longest. He became my subordinate before I was called the War King, so I guess that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s calling me that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Ozma-san was Megiddo-san&#8217;s first subordinate.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1219575516"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-365877013"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hehh&#8230;&#8230; Speaking of which, I&#8217;m sorry if this is something I shouldn&#8217;t ask. Why did you become Megiddo-san&#8217;s subordinate, Ozma-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oi, oi, Miyama-kun. There&#8217;s nothing to be gained from knowing about Uncle&#8217;s past, you know?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry. It&#8217;s just that I thought that the atmosphere around Ozma-san was different from the other Five Generals&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hahaha, you&#8217;re being told off, Ozma. You gotta have a bit more ambition.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, I&#8217;m not saying that much though!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It certainly as Megiddo-san said, Ozma-san doesn&#8217;t seem to have any ambition&#8230;&#8230; Or rather, I don&#8217;t think I feel the &#8220;fighting is the best&#8221; thinking that the other Generals have. This is the reason why it feels easy for me to talk to him though&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahaha, no, well, Uncle was also quite mischievous back then. That&#8217;s also the reason why I ended up punching Master Megiddo the first time I met him.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eeehhh!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, I got really beaten up after that though&#8230;&#8230; I completely lost.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[How the heck can you say that after &#8220;we fought for seven days and seven nights&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;? I think &#8220;we were evenly matched&#8221;, you know?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1237724720"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-41087644"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, I still lost in the end. Master is strong, and I was weak.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? He fought Megiddo-san evenly for seven days and seven nights? Ozma-san is that strong!? No, I certainly haven&#8217;t thought of him as just an ordinary person&#8230;&#8230; but perhaps, could the strongest of the Five Generals is Ozma-san&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[In those days, the Demon Realm was much bleaker than it is now. An era where losing meant death. However, Master Megiddo didn&#8217;t take the life of this defeated Uncle, but asked me to become his subordinate.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh~~ That brings back memories.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But back then, I guess you could say that Uncle was experiencing his youthful folly, and but anyway, I had quite the bad temper back then. Even when Master asked me to be his subordinate&#8230;&#8230; I snarled at him, saying &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare insult me! If you take me in as your subordinate, I will make sure to cut your head off the moment you turn your back on me!&#8221; or something like that.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[O- Ohhh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ozma-san scratched his cheeks, looking somewhat embarrassed, and talked about what he had told Megiddo-san a long time ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What do you think Master said in response? Looking like he was really having fun, he told me &#8220;Ohh, that makes it fun! Then, I&#8217;ll leave my back to you!&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[H- How should I say this&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s just like Megiddo-san.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though he hates doing surprise attacks, he likes it when he is surprise attacked&#8230;&#8230; That certainly feels like Megiddo-san.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-450526375"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-807994708"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I feel like I was being reminded how big Master&#8217;s heart is.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that somewhat happily, Ozma-san took out a cigarette and held it in his mouth. Calmly lighting it up, he looked at Megiddo-san with a respectful gaze, as if he was feeling somewhat nostalgic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh, speaking of which, you still haven&#8217;t stabbed me from the back yet, have you? When are you going to do it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahaha, I don&#8217;t feel like doing it anymore. I was charmed by Master Megiddo&#8217;s way of life. I just want to watch your large back&#8230;&#8230; For me, the only king is Master&#8230;&#8230; When I die, &#8220;it will be while protecting Master&#8217;s back&#8221;. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve decided before Master even became the War King.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I see.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, things have become so peaceful these days that it seems difficult to die. Well, that&#8217;s why I will just leisurely serve Master in moderation until the end of my life&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Good grief, that last part was unnecessary&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;re still the same lazy bastard.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahaha.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether it&#8217;s Megiddo-san who told that in an amazed manner, or Ozma, who laughed while scratching his shaggy hair&#8230;&#8230; Both of them looked somewhat happy, and I could tell that they had a strong trust in each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though they had left out a lot of details about it, I was able to learn a little bit about Ozma-san&#8217;s past. As he said that Megiddo-san was the only king for him, Ozma-san&#8217;s expression looked radiant, while Megiddo-san seemed happy to hear what he said&#8230;&#8230; Somehow, of all the master and servant relationships I&#8217;ve ever seen, that was the most dazzling scene I&#8217;ve ever seen.</span></p>
