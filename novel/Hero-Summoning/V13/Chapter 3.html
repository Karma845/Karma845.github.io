<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Not Apology, Gratitude</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though they were having a party, the Six Kings Festival had still just begun, so I decided to leave at an appropriate time and returned to my accommodations. Well, I heard that Megiddo-san and the others were going to drink all night long, but as expected, drinking along with them would affect tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though I say that, it&#8217;s still a little early. I have already had my dinner at the party, and all I had to do now was to take a bath and go to bed. As I was thinking about doing something to pass the time if Kuro and the others were already back in our room, when I came back to the Japanese-style castle, which I still am not used to seeing even though I&#8217;ve already stayed a night in it&#8230;&#8230; I saw someone familiar in front of the castle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman with long golden hair dressed in suit-like clothes is definitely Funf-san but&#8230;&#8230; How should I say this&#8230;&#8230; She&#8217;s acting kind of strange. It doesn&#8217;t seem like she was going to enter the castle, but instead seemed to be pondering something as she walked back and forth near the entrance gate. And as I approached, I could hear Funf-san mumbling to herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Would I be a nuisance if I were to do this? Around this time, they should have about finished his dinner, so there shouldn&#8217;t be any problem but&#8230;&#8230; I guess it would be better if I go after the day change? I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s tired after everything that&#8217;s happened today, so I might just be a nuisance for coming to visit.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Are you here to see someone?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I came to see Kaito, but I was thinking if it would be better to not come today.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You came to see me?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn, I came to&#8230;&#8230; Unnn?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Funf-san, who seemingly didn&#8217;t realize I was the one talking to her at the beginning, stopped mid-sentence and turned to me with a surprised expression on her face. Thereupon, the color of Funf-san&#8217;s hair changed to pink, and her expression changed to flusteredness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[K- Kaito!? W- Why are you here?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2018707740"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1525872965"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;No, even if you ask me why, I can only say this is where I&#8217;m staying&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, I should be the one asking why she&#8217;s here&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- That&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8230; E- Even though my heart still isn&#8217;t ready yet&#8230;&#8230; Unnn, but this is alright. I&#8217;ve already thought about this beforehand.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Funf-san seemed to be flustered, but after she mumbled something to herself in a small voice, she calmed down and her hair returned to its golden color. Then, after taking a deep breath, she looked me straight in the eyes and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kaito, can you &#8220;lend me your ugly mug&#8221; for a bit?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh? Did I do anything to offend you, Funf-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A line of dialogue that seemed to deviate from her image was suddenly spoken by Funf-san, making me feel like she took that out of a delinquent manga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Arehh? That&#8217;s a slang you say in the other world when you want to bring someone outside, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Well, you aren&#8217;t completely wrong. It&#8217;s just, I might be being prejudiced here&#8230;&#8230; but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s really used in a very positive way.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Is that so?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1966039626"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1544727421"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It kinda feels like someone wants to pick a fight with you and wants to bring the fight outside.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, it&#8217;s not that I had unknowingly been rude to her, it&#8217;s more like she tried asking me out in a way that suited where I&#8217;m from and failed. Upon hearing what I said, Funf-san&#8217;s face became pale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- That&#8217;s not it, okay!? I didn&#8217;t come here because I have a problem with Kaito, and instead, it was the opposite&#8230;&#8230; Errr, I have something I want to talk to you about, but not here where the Six Kings and other such people are so close by. I was hoping we could change places.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Talk? Yes, I have time, so it&#8217;s alright.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, it would be better not to mention Funf-san&#8217;s blunder too much and just let it slide. If I were to follow up with her about this, it would probably make her feel embarrassed or depressed, so it would be better to just not be bothered about it. Well, I don&#8217;t actually particularly care about it, so it&#8217;s not a problem at all. In fact, I&#8217;m relieved that I didn&#8217;t offend Funf-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- Thanks&#8230;&#8230; Then, let&#8217;s go outside for a bit.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I understand.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she has regained some of her composure at my response, and the flusteredness on Funf-san&#8217;s expression disappears. However, judging from the emotions conveyed by my Sympathy Magic, she still seems to be nervous. No, is this really nervousness? The atmosphere around her seemed to be that of someone who has something to say, but is reluctant to say it. Enveloped in that somewhat delicate atmosphere, without many conversations with each other, we went down to the ground floor of the Central Tower and went outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, the night of the Six Kings Festival&#8230;&#8230; is more like a normal festival with stalls around us. During the daytime, there were many attractions organized by Megiddo-san, but some of them have been closed and replaced by restaurants, while some family-oriented attractions are still being used as amusement facilities where visitors can pay to play in. Even so, this area around the Central Tower left some impression on me because I saw it on the way back, but I have a feeling that the whole building has changed quite a bit. No, well, it seems that they change the facilities for each of the seven days, and it may be possible for them to switch them out like day and night, but it&#8217;s confusing when I actually see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That aside, hmmm&#8230;&#8230; Funf-san is still not talking. The two of us are just walking side by side, me being clueless where we are going. Maybe I should talk to her, but I don&#8217;t really know what Funf-san is up to, so I don&#8217;t know how to talk to her&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-968536058"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1864236255"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about this, one of the stalls suddenly caught my attention. It wasn&#8217;t a particularly unusual stall, but it was a good opportunity to strike up a conversation with Funf-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Funf-san, would you like to eat some of those?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh? A skewer stall?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, look, didn&#8217;t we eat some skewers together before in the Symphonia Kingdom?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh~~ That did happen. Even though that was just a while ago, remembering that makes me feel nostalgic.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I met Funf-san by chance in Symphonia&#8217;s royal capital before, we ate skewers together. If I&#8217;m not mistaken, I should have eaten Forest Bull skewers or something like that. Perhaps Funf-san also remembered that moment, as her slightly stiff expression softened and a faint smile appeared on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If I remember correctly, didn&#8217;t Funf-san order mixed seafood skewers?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Right. Well, I don&#8217;t particularly like seafood, but the seafood skewers they had back then looked really good.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh~~ Seeing fish and shellfish being grilled on skewers or over the grill certainly makes you crave for some.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Right, right! Shellfish tastes great, don&#8217;t they? Kaito is from the other world, so you may already know this, but the shellfish just tastes so delicious with the soy sauce that was introduced from your world.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-114674858"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-625588694"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I know what you mean&#8230;&#8230; Talking about it makes me feel hungry. I&#8217;ll go order for us two.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, in that case, I will&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, this will be my treat.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Telling that to Funf-san, whose mood was getting better, I made a short run for the stall. Unfortunately, it wasn&#8217;t as big as the one in Symphonia&#8217;s royal capital, and the only skewers available were barbecue-like vegetable and meat skewers, but they looked incredibly delicious in a place like this. After buying two skewers, I returned to where Funf-san waited for me and ate them together in an area a little off the street. I guess the atmosphere of the festival makes the skewers very tasty. I had just eaten dinner a little while ago, but I was able to eat it in one bite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing the skewers, I looked at the people walking along the street a short distance away. Although the Six Kings Festival is limited to invited guests and their companions, there seemed to be a considerable number of people participating, and as far as I could see, there seemed to be quite a lot of traffic in this area. Even though we were only a short distance away from the busy street where the stalls were, the place where Funf-san and I were was quiet and isolated from the hustle and bustle of the festival. In such an environment, Funf-san was holding the leftover stick from the skewer she had just finished eating and was silent, not speaking a word. Although she wasn&#8217;t as stiff as earlier, I now got the impression that she wasn&#8217;t sure how to start the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no point in rushing her, so I decided to use this time to think about Funf-san&#8217;s purpose. She seemed quite nervous at first, so there&#8217;s no doubt that what she&#8217;s looking me for is quite important for Funf-san. I also heard that she wasn&#8217;t here to complain about something to me or anything like that. While that may be true, it isn&#8217;t like she&#8217;s here to confess to me either. The feelings of guilt and confusion conveyed through my Sympathy Magic are as if she was about to confess for her sins&#8230;&#8230; Unnn? Arehh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh, I think I might have figured it out. It&#8217;s just a guess, but I think Funf-san might have come to apologize to me. As for what she was about to apologize for, needless to say, it must have been about Dr. Vier. Ahh~~ I see, I feel like all my questions have been answered at once. The incident back then had been very important for Funf-san, so I can understand why she&#8217;s nervous. The reason she found it difficult to speak is probably that she&#8217;s not sure how to broach the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;However, hmmm&#8230;&#8230; I have a few thoughts regarding that incident, so I can&#8217;t just accept this apology of hers. As I had such thoughts in mind, Funf-san, who had remained silent for a long time, turned to me with a determined expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;K- Kaito, you see! What happened back&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Please wait a moment, Funf-san!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-207420999"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1151502302"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-Kaito?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I interrupted her mid-sentence, and thrown off track, she dumbfoundedly tilted her head. Facing such a Funf-san, I spoke with a serious look on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Please don&#8217;t apologize.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I think I somewhat understand what Funf-san was about to say. It&#8217;s probably an apology for what happened at that time with Dr. Vier, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[U- Unnn&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems my prediction was right on target, as Funf-san nodded her head with a slightly puzzled expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If that&#8217;s the case&#8230;&#8230; I can&#8217;t accept that apology. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m holding a grudge or anything like that, it&#8217;s just that I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary for you to apologize for that incident.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[B- But I had&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Are you repenting for what happened? Were you thinking that it was wrong of you to try to take Dr. Vier&#8217;s side?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-444793030"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1319807676"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- That&#8217;s not it! It&#8217;s just, I was&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[In that case&#8230;&#8230; I really don&#8217;t think apologies are appropriate here.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ ! ? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, I don&#8217;t need an apology for that incident. It&#8217;s not like Funf-san and I had a falling out because of that or that either one of us was wrong or mistaken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[At that time, both Funf-san and I thought and acted according to our ideas, and as a result, we came into conflict with each other. I think I clashed with Funf-san for that incident because Funf-san&#8217;s way of thinking is something I can allow&#8230;&#8230; In that case, I think that both of our ways of thinking were definitely right.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Kaito.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s only one answer to everything, and even if both sides are right, they can still have disagreements. I won&#8217;t resent Funf-san for that, and Funf-san wouldn&#8217;t resent me for that either, right? If that&#8217;s the case&#8230;&#8230; I really don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any need for an apology.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think of myself as being hostile to Funf-san regarding that incident, nor am I quarreling with her for that. Of course, I wouldn&#8217;t condemn her for what happened&#8230;&#8230; and to be honest, as long as she didn&#8217;t visit me like this, I wouldn&#8217;t have cared about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Let&#8217;s just say that both sides are right&#8230;&#8230; and for the time being, why don&#8217;t we leave it without any apologies or anything like that?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Unnn&#8230;&#8230; I guess you&#8217;re right. That is indeed the case&#8230;&#8230; It certainly isn&#8217;t right to apologize.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-368744893"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-752747810"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After she muttered this, seemingly trying to digest her thoughts, her shoulders relaxed and a gentle smile appeared on Funf-san&#8217;s lips. And then, Funf-san slowly turned her gaze toward the night sky and began softly speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I have talked about her to you, didn&#8217;t I, Kaito? I didn&#8217;t mention Vee&#8217;s name, but I mentioned how I had a family that I grew up with, like sisters.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, that&#8217;s Dr. Vier, isn&#8217;t it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Unnn. I have always been regretting about it for a long time. At that time&#8230;&#8230; I haven&#8217;t been able to help Vee when she called herself the Demon Lord and fought against the world&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like that, Funf-san began to talk about her memories of the past&#8230;&#8230; Her past together with Dr. Vier and her regrets for not realizing what was inside Dr. Vier&#8217;s heart, tormenting herself for what she had done. She was unable to reach out immediately to the slight weakness that she had shown only to herself&#8230;&#8230; and when she was ready to reach out, her hand couldn&#8217;t reach Dr. Vier&#8217;s. She has always regretted that, and regardless of the outcome, it seems that being able to fight for Dr. Vier in that incident was a good opportunity for Funf-san to settle her past regrets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, when she finished talking about the past, Funf-san turned her face toward me and quietly spun her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hey, Kaito?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You said you won&#8217;t accept my apology&#8230;&#8230; but then, will you accept this?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What is it?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-425468566"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1143411746"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you for helping Vee&#8230;&#8230; Thank you for saving my family.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What she told me wasn&#8217;t an apology, but thank you. It was difficult to understand how much emotion was put into those short words&#8230;&#8230; but it felt like a big juncture for Funf-san. That&#8217;s why, the choice of not accepting it doesn&#8217;t exist, so I nodded once and responded to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, you&#8217;re welcome.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we finished that exchange, Funf-san looked very refreshed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Well, I spoke like what I did was that big of a deal, but I only got help from a lot of people, and there&#8217;s not much I myself had done.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That may be so. However&#8230;&#8230; The trigger wasn&#8217;t anyone else, it was Kaito. Certainly, you may have had the cooperation of many different people when you saved Vee. But still, there&#8217;s no doubt&#8230;&#8230; that &#8220;the one who took the first step&#8221; was you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she said this, a really gentle smile appeared on Funf-san&#8217;s lips. Her expression, illuminated by the lights of the Illumination Magic Tool set up all around the venue, honestly looked so beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s what I think. I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s so great about Kaito.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s so great about me?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn. Following the path made by others is pretty easy. You just trace the road that they had already made. However, to create a path of your own&#8230;&#8230; Even just taking the first step to change something takes a lot of courage. In fact, me, Kuromu-sama, and everyone else couldn&#8217;t take that first step. However, Kaito took that step forward. I think that&#8217;s why Vee, Neun, Kuromu-sama&#8230;&#8230; and I were able to change.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2068053240"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-516832059">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was unsparing praise, which somehow made me feel a little itchy, but at the same time happy. I was somewhat worried about whether what I had done back then was really the right thing to do or not, but I&#8217;m very happy to say that in the end, it turned out to be the best ending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Seriously, I think it&#8217;s really cool that you can do that&#8230;&#8230; Even though when I first met you, I thought you were still just a child.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Funf-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Fufufu, I mean Kaito is cool.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was astonished by her sudden surprise attack, Funf-san gave a mischievous smile.</span></p><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-92728 size-full" src="https://www.foxaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/embed0009_HD.png" alt="" width="1307" height="1920" srcset="https://www.foxaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/embed0009_HD.png 1307w, https://www.foxaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/embed0009_HD-204x300.png 204w, https://www.foxaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/embed0009_HD-697x1024.png 697w, https://www.foxaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/embed0009_HD-768x1128.png 768w, https://www.foxaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/embed0009_HD-1046x1536.png 1046w" sizes="(max-width: 1307px) 100vw, 1307px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">T- This feeling of being toyed with, although it&#8217;s frustrating&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it was her older sister-like atmosphere or not, or perhaps, I was just glad that she was back to her normal routine, but I didn&#8217;t feel any anger. I just wasn&#8217;t sure how I should respond, and as I&#8217;m finding it difficult to speak any further, Funf-san suddenly grasped my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kaito, do we still have time?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Yes, I still have a few hours.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Alright, since we&#8217;re at it, why don&#8217;t we go around the area?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I suppose so. Shall we go then?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn, unnn! With that decided, let&#8217;s go!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wait!? Funf-san!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like that, Funf-san pulled my hand and started walking away. Eh? We&#8217;re gonna walk while holding hands? Or rather, isn&#8217;t her grip so strong!? H- Hmmm&#8230;&#8230; Well, seems to be having more fun than ever, so I guess it&#8217;s alright?</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While pulling Kaito&#8217;s hand a little forcefully, Funf walked without looking back at Kaito&#8230;&#8230; so that Kaito doesn&#8217;t see &#8220;her face turning red&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m just kidding&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;at the moment&#8221;, that is.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within her mind was the conversation she just had with Kaito. Kaito&#8217;s words as he stopped Funf from apologizing for the trouble she had caused him, and how he told her that she had made the right choice as well&#8230;.. made her irrepressibly happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I&#8217;m still just finally able to shake off the past and walk forward. I&#8217;ve discovered a lot of things in this one incident, and I have to do my best about various things again&#8230;&#8230;)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these thoughts in mind, realizing that her feelings were facing forward, Funf tightened her grip on Kaito&#8217;s hand just a little bit more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(And someday, when I&#8217;m confident enough&#8230;&#8230; It might be good to tell him what I said earlier&#8230;&#8230; not as a joke, but for real&#8230;&#8230;)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the turbulent first day, tomorrow&#8217;s second day will be the festival organized by Lillywood-san. It seems that Lillywood-san is planning a festival based on the theme &#8220;Interacting with Nature&#8221;, so unlike the first day, it doesn&#8217;t seem like it would lead to a battle. I somewhat like peacefully walking around the forest, so I&#8217;m looking forward to tomorrow. And thus, the second day of the Six Kings Festival is&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m going to wash your back today, Kaito-kun!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I will&#8230;&#8230; wash your back.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2140152449"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-978604807"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[H- Hmmm.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;But before that, it seems that I have to face the same ordeal as the night before the event&#8230;&#8230; Can&#8217;t we just do a time skip like in those novels and head straight to the second day!? Wouldn&#8217;t it be possible where we end it with just the words &#8220;before I knew it, the day passed&#8221; or something like that!? I&#8217;m a little tipsy right now, so I&#8217;m worried that I can&#8217;t hold on to my reasoning, you know!? Also, why the heck are you here, &#8220;Lillywood-san&#8221;!?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N- No, I don&#8217;t have any idea either&#8230;&#8230; Ein just suddenly brought me here&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ein-san did?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The trio currently in front of me, Kuro, Isis-san and Alice are having a frightening discussion about who will wash my back. Well, their discussions aside&#8230;&#8230; No, well, it&#8217;s not like I can really ignore what they&#8217;re discussing now&#8230;&#8230; As more importantly than that, why is Lillywood-san here? She at least shouldn&#8217;t have been here yesterday. When I looked at Ein-san, who seemed to be the cause of the problem, she nodded once for some reason before going closer to where Kuro and the others were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kuromu-sama, I don&#8217;t mean to be rude, but I have a suggestion to make.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? A suggestion?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. Kaito-sama only has one body. Of course, there is the option of having the three of you washing his back at the same time but&#8230;&#8230; I suggest that we set up a rotation schedule instead.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[A rotation schedule?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-386895722"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2132216883"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whoa there, why do I feel like she suddenly started saying ridiculous stuff? I at least know that these words weren&#8217;t meant to support me. In fact, I have a feeling that what she&#8217;s saying is going to make things even worse&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kuro asked back while tilting her head, Ein-san bowed her head once and continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. In this Six Kings Festival, I heard that each of you will be walking around with Kaito-sama on the day you are in charge&#8230;&#8230; How about &#8220;the person who goes around with Kaito-sama tomorrow may monopolize Kaito-sama for the night and bathe alone with Kaito-sama&#8221;?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ [ [ ! ? ] ] ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kuro and the others heard Ein-san&#8217;s outrageous words, they froze with faces that seemed like they&#8217;d just seen the truth of the world&#8230;&#8230; W- What should I think about this? Is it better than going in with all of them? Or perhaps, is this going to have more destructive power because a single person is focusing their destructiveness on me? I- I&#8217;m not really sure. I was stunned by Ein-san&#8217;s sudden suggestion, but there was another person who had the same expression on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Is it just my imagination? Given that I&#8217;m being brought here&#8230;&#8230; I feel that Ein&#8217;s statement &#8220;included me in this&#8221; as if it&#8217;s a matter of course?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What a coincidence. That&#8217;s how it sounded to me too.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exchanging glances, Lillywood-san and I exchanged words with each other. But oblivious to our confusion, Kuro and the others started thinking with serious expressions on their faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;ll have more time alone with Kaito-kun!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;T- That would certainly make me feel a little less embarrassed, so I guess I&#8217;m rather in favor of that suggestion.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-202936217"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-196563444"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ein&#8230;&#8230; Genius.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Why does it feel like the suggestion would be accepted? W- What do I do now? Should I throw out my objection here? Thinking about Lillywood-san, I think I should stop them here&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure yet if Lillywood-san is included in their count or I would be able to take a bath alone tonight&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then, it&#8217;s Lillywood&#8217;s turn today!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Unnn.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I guess so.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They included her too!? No, no, you can&#8217;t do that! Putting Kuro and the others aside since they want it themselves, but Lillywood-san wouldn&#8217;t want&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wait, everyone, that is&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please wait. That&#8217;s something I can&#8217;t accept.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was about to complain to them, Lillywood-san interrupted me and spoke up first. Unnn, I knew Lillywood-san wouldn&#8217;t like that, so it&#8217;s better if Lillywood-san tells them herself&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;I don&#8217;t really mind&#8221; if that were the case, but wouldn&#8217;t Kaito-san dislike that?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Arehh? Why do I feel like I heard words that I wasn&#8217;t expecting? I somehow feel like I heard Lillywood-san say something like she doesn&#8217;t mind taking a bath with me. I guess I misheard her huh&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s right, I obviously heard it. There&#8217;s no way that the modest Lillywood-san would ever say such a thing&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, what do you think, Kaito-kun? Do you dislike taking a bath together with Lillywood?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Unnn? No, it&#8217;s not that I dislike that but Lillywood-san wouldn&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then, there&#8217;s no problem!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. If Kaito-san doesn&#8217;t mind, then certainly.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Arehh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">T- That&#8217;s weird? Why the heck am I still hearing things? I somehow feel like I heard Lillywood-san say &#8220;certainly&#8221; or something like that&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[L- Lillywood-san!? A- Are you sure about that? We&#8217;re going to be taking a bath together, you know!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I don&#8217;t really think Kaito-san would enjoy bathing with a &#8220;tree&#8221; like me but&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-279632151"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1067055840"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Huh? Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tree? Arehh? Could it be that for Lillywood-san&#8230;&#8230; Could it be that as a tree spirit, she considers herself as someone more like a tree rather than a living being, so she doesn&#8217;t care about things like that? T- This is bad! Even if Lillywood-san thinks that she is a tree, I can only see Lillywood-san as a beautiful woman, so I think I should find a way to somehow move this suggestion out&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However, I&#8217;m glad to hear that Kaito-san doesn&#8217;t mind. I also wanted to deepen my friendship with Kaito-san, but I couldn&#8217;t find the time to do so&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m really happy to have an opportunity like this.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, i- is that so&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">W- When she smiles with such heartfelt joy on her face, there&#8217;s no way I can say that I want to stop this now&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Guhh&#8230;&#8230; There&#8217;s no way I can make Lillywood-san, who was this delighted, to be dejected. In that case, I&#8217;ll just have to do my best to endure it&#8230;&#8230; Well, I guess it would be alright huh? Lillywood-san is a proper, mature woman. She&#8217;s ladylike, so there&#8217;s no way that she would do anything strange. Unnn, I think it would rather be easier for me to maintain my reasoning with her rather than when I&#8217;m taking a bath together with Kuro and the others. With that in mind, I agreed to take a bath with Lillywood-san. What I didn&#8217;t realize though is that my naivety in perspective would come back to haunt me as a terrifying penance&#8230;&#8230; which I didn&#8217;t know at that time&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Going into the bathroom first, I lightly poured warm water over my body before soaking in the hot spring, waiting for Lillywood-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Why did the &#8220;scenery here become so different from yesterday&#8221;? What kind of arrangement did they place here? The trees were dazzlingly green and lined with leaves, making me feel as if I was taking a bath on an onsen in the middle of a forest. This feels cool and refreshing, so taking a bath here is great.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1334518571"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-920930660"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to keep you waiting.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, no&#8230;&#8230; Huh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about this, I heard Lillywood-san&#8217;s calm voice call out, making me reflexively turn towards her&#8230;&#8230; and stiffen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[W- W- Wha&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is something the matter, Kaito-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Lillywood-san appeared, her white skin, which is usually hidden by her poncho-like ethnic-style clothing, was unsparingly exposed and even seemed to glow. And the most eye-catching things are those huge twin hills that look like melons, boasting their overwhelming presence&#8230;&#8230; and those well-shaped protrusions at their peaks&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Why the heck are you &#8220;barenakeeeeeed&#8221;!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hurriedly turning my gaze away from Lillywood-san, I shouted. I- I was completely caught off guard&#8230;&#8230; I had an uncomfortable feeling ever since I agreed to take a bath together with her, but Lillywood-san&#8230;&#8230; Don&#8217;t you have any shame at all!? I mean, her stance was that she was a tree, so she&#8217;s probably thinking that I won&#8217;t be lusting after her if I saw her naked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I- I never expected that Lillywood-san, who I thought was the safest, was the most unguarded of them all&#8230;&#8230; I felt like I&#8217;d been corkscrewed even though we just started bathing together. Especially her tremendously destructive body. It was completely burned into my brain. T- This is quite dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well then, I&#8217;ll be entering the bath too&#8230;&#8230; As I recall, &#8220;it&#8217;s proper manners to not soak your towel in the bath&#8221;, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, you can&#8217;t!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Today&#8217;s onsen isn&#8217;t a murky one, so you definitely can&#8217;t do that!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;E- Errr&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Please enter the bath with the towel still wrapped around you.

I&#8217;m begging you!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1255161433"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-556169379"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I- I understand&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this point, I don&#8217;t care about the etiquettes of entering an onsen anymore. If I keep seeing Lillywood-san&#8217;s amazing body, I feel like my reasoning would be smashed to pieces. Even though she was confused why I looked at her menacingly, Lillywood-san nodded and soaked in the onsen with her towel wrapped around her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Haahhh&#8230;&#8230; This feels great. It&#8217;s nice to soak in warm water once in a while, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[E- Errr, do you not usually soak in hot water?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I usually only take a cold bath. That bath would also be my meal&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Lillywood-san, a tree spirit, basically doesn&#8217;t eat solid food and only drinks water. Being careful not to look at Lillywood-san&#8217;s direction as much as possible, I try to distract myself by continuing the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even so, fufufu&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve bathed with someone like this. I&#8217;ve only bathed with Isis and the others a few times, you see.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Is that so&#8230;&#8230; I know it&#8217;s a little late to ask this now, but are you really sure you want to be in a bath together with me?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m glad to be able to deepen my friendship with you, Kaito-san.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2042611312"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1728369552"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t have any intentions. She doesn&#8217;t have any intentions. She doesn&#8217;t have any intentions&#8230;&#8230; Calm down, don&#8217;t have any strange delusions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Rather, isn&#8217;t it me who should ask if it&#8217;s alright with you to take a bath together with me, Kaito-san? A tree like me wouldn&#8217;t only add up to the scenery at best, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, rather&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t think of Lillywood-san as a tree at all. You look like a normal woman in my eyes.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Really? But look, my hair is just a bundle of leaves, you know?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m not talking about something like that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lillywood-san&#8217;s hair is certainly made up of layers of green leaves, but to be honest, that&#8217;s the only thing tree-ish. The rest of her body looked like the body of a female human&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s impossible for me to think of her as a tree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, there are also other parts&#8230;&#8230; Look at this.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wha!? W- What are you doing!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ehh? No, as I was saying, my &#8220;feet are actually roots&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Could you please not spread your legs!? I can see it, you know!!!?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-247846312"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1147576881"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You can see it? Ahh, you mean my &#8220;genitals&#8221;? That certainly was quite indecent of me. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Could you please say such things out loud!? Also, that&#8217;s not the point, you know!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">H- Hey, isn&#8217;t she seriously too unpredictable and unguarded!? Doesn&#8217;t she realize that she&#8217;s a beautiful woman!? Also, does she even understand that I&#8217;m a man?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;H- Huhh&#8230;&#8230; However, even if Kaito-san sees the body of a tree like me, it&#8217;s not like Kaito-san would get sexually aroused&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I will get aroused! I am sexually aroused!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Ehh? I- Is that so? H- However, I am&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No matter what Lillywood-san thinks of yourself, I can only see Lillywood-san as a beautiful woman!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I shouted these things, feeling as if my face was almost boiling hot, Lillywood-san looked at me in a daze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I- Is that so&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;re a strange person.&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2071080682"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1615914515"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Lillywood-san was really surprised that I was feeling aroused by the sight of her body, as she stared at me with her eyes wide open.No, I&#8217;m pretty sure my reaction is more normal. I mean, Lillywood-san, you&#8217;ve probably only shown your body to people like Isis-san, haven&#8217;t you? Lillywood-san probably doesn&#8217;t know this, but I&#8217;m sure other guys would have the same reaction as me&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few moments of silence, just like a blooming flower, she smiled beautifully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;You&#8217;re a really strange person. However, being told by you like that&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t know the reason why, but I guess I, &#8220;who feels happy about that&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;. am also strange.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;E- Errr.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;ll make sure to behave like a woman in front of you, Kaito-san.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, y- yes. I&#8217;ll be thankful for that.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, fufufu&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chuckling for a bit, Lillywood-san straightened her posture and looked at me with an elegant smile on her face. I wonder why? Was it because of the conversation we had earlier&#8230;&#8230; but my heart is strangely pounding so fast. I- I didn&#8217;t see this one coming&#8230;&#8230; It seems like this mixed bath together with Lillywood-san isn&#8217;t going to be easy.</span></p>
 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I was pushed into a corner by a shocking no-guard strategy, I succeeded in persuading Lillywood-san with a game-changing move. Of course, I still received an enormous amount of the damage, but it seems like the tough fight would still continue. Well, putting that aside&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s my imagination or not, but why does it seem like there&#8217;s something on Lillywood-san&#8217;s hair&#8230;&#8230; or rather, in her hair-like leaves? Lillywood-san originally had long hair, but her hair is now even longer than before&#8230;&#8230; I mean, doesn&#8217;t it seem like it&#8217;s increasingly encroaching on the bathtub!? It&#8217;s increasing! It&#8217;s definitely increasing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ummm, Lillywood-san?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-484435044"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-30742688"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s just that, your hair&#8230;&#8230; I mean, your leaves, they&#8217;re increasing, you know?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh, my apologies. I was just feeling comfortable&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I pointed this out, Lillywood-san apologized and returned her hair to its original length&#8230;&#8230; I wonder if she can change it as she wants just like Raz-san? Rather&#8230;&#8230;. Does that mean Lillywood-san&#8217;s hair gets longer when she&#8217;s feeling good? Ahh, come to think of it, her hair withered when she was tired before&#8230;&#8230; It appears that Lillywood-san&#8217;s hair changes depending on her condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Speaking of which, we&#8217;re on an onsen, right? I don&#8217;t bathe in an onsen that much, but how do Humans enjoy their time here?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hmmm. Let&#8217;s see. Of course, you can enjoy the scenery while washing your body, but you can also drink while soaking in the onsen.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8230; I can prepare some &#8220;fruit wine&#8221; right away, would you like some?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Ah, yes. I&#8217;d certainly love to have some if it&#8217;s alright with you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve never drank fruit wines that much before&#8230;&#8230; Or rather, I&#8217;ve never drank anything but beer in my original world, so I&#8217;m interested. I&#8217;m also looking for a way to change the mood, so her suggestion was a welcome one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well then, please wait for a moment&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-78076919"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-747832933"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she said this, a branch grew out of Lillywood-san&#8217;s hair and a Fruit of the World Tree that I&#8217;m so familiar with appeared. The fruit then changes shape, as if it is being squeezed by an invisible hand, and the juice that was being squeezed out is poured into a wooden cup that had been prepared before I knew it. After squeezing the juice from several fruits, Lillywood-san held up her hand and the wooden cup was enveloped in a faint light, which subsided after a few seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Here you go.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Thank you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if it&#8217;s a matter of course, a fruit wine was made in front of me&#8230;&#8230; Making use of Fruits of the World Tree feels a bit too luxurious, but I guess that&#8217;s what makes it look incredibly delicious. The scent is very strong, but it&#8217;s not sharp, feeling soft and natural instead. Well then, since this is freshly-made, let&#8217;s have a&#8230;&#8230; wait, arehh? I know it&#8217;s strange for me to question this now but&#8230;&#8230; since Lillywood-san is the World Tree&#8230;&#8230; Which means that the Fruit of the World Tree is made from Lillywood-san&#8217;s body, so to speak&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Arehh? That means that the alcohol in this cup was also made from Lillywood-san&#8217;s body&#8230;&#8230; In other words, one can think of this as &#8220;something that was part of Lillywood-san&#8217;s body&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; and I&#8217;m going to put that into my mouth? T- This is bad, the weirdest thought popped out of my mind! W- W- W- What should I do? This is bad. After what happened earlier, I&#8217;m being completely conscious about things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">H- However, after asking for the drink myself, I can&#8217;t just say I&#8217;m too embarrassed to drink it&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Kaito-san?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ ! ? T- Thank you for the drink!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she called out to me, I panicked and took a sip of the fruit wine. As I took a sip, the mellow aroma filled my mouth and stimulated my brain with its tremendous taste. I would have liked to say that this is tasty, as to be expected from a luxurious item, but because of my weird thoughts, I felt giddy with each sip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking that just taking sips was a bad idea, I drank all the alcohol at once and called out to Lillywood-san. As for what strategy I will use to divert my mind&#8230;&#8230; I forgot all about it, but let&#8217;s just run away from this place and reorganize my thoughts.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-985910929"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1145922033">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[L- Lillywood-san&#8230;&#8230; I- I&#8217;ll go wash my body now!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was saying this, that&#8217;s when I noticed something. That it was a stupid thing to say&#8230;&#8230; I was going to run away, but I stupidly cut off my own path of retreat. After I said this, just as I had expected&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh, then I will wash your back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;She didn&#8217;t let me escape. Hey, isn&#8217;t the Six Kings&#8217; blocking ability too great? Is it that? Is that also the same logic as to why you can&#8217;t escape from a boss fight?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, there&#8217;s no need for Lillywood-san to bother&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, please let me help you. Kaito-san has always been a help to me after all.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Y- Yes&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her 100% pure smile, thoughts of refusing sunk down. To be honest, I don&#8217;t remember taking care of Lillywood-san at all, even though she was the one who had always been taking care of me&#8230;&#8230; but I can&#8217;t say anything when people show such pure good will for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">W- Well, calm down&#8230;&#8230; It should be fine now. Lillywood-san has agreed to hide her body, and with her serious nature, there is no need for me to worry about her breaking her promise. Then, I&#8217;ll just have my back washed like normal. Of course, I will feel nervous while that is happening, but there won&#8217;t be a problem&#8230;&#8230; or so I thought. However, as if to mock me as I stepped out of the onsen with such thoughts in mind, I heard Lillywood-san&#8217;s voice from behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm&#8230;.. K- Kaito-san.&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1172344068"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2035004201">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Y- Yes?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Making sure that I won&#8217;t look back when Lillywood-san called, I replied&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s just, the towel is too small and won&#8217;t wrap around my chest&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. It seems that her towel, which isn&#8217;t that big, though it isn&#8217;t as small as a face towel, isn&#8217;t enough to cover Lillywood-san&#8217;s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Would it be alright if I just grow my hair out to hide them instead?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be that I have been rude to the God of Bath or something like that in a previous life? Otherwise, why am I always in a predicament like this when I enter a bathroom&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bathroom should be a place where we wash our mind, a place where we heal ourselves. It&#8217;s not a place where we play a mental chicken game, nor is it a place for one&#8217;s reasoning to strain to the point of boiling over. Behind me, currently sitting on a wooden chair, is the &#8220;almost naked&#8221; Lillywood-san. The only thing hiding Lillywood-san&#8217;s body is her hair-turned leaves&#8230;&#8230; Arehh? What is this? I didn&#8217;t see her body firsthand, but thinking about how she&#8217;s hiding her important parts with her hair is a little too erotic&#8230;&#8230; Or rather, in the first place, I wonder if Lillywood-san&#8217;s melon-like breasts can really be hidden just by her hair. I mean, even if her breasts were hidden, with their size, I would still be able to see everything underneath&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kaito-san.&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-845727724"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-665700135"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Eh? Why did you suddenly apologize?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, n- no! It&#8217;s nothing!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Calm down, stop being so excited. The more I imagine strange things, the more I&#8217;m strangling myself. Empty my mind, free myself from obstructive thoughts&#8230;&#8230; Unnn? Arehh? Why is there a &#8220;tree growing next to me&#8221;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[E- Errr, Lillywood-san? If I&#8217;m not seeing things, it kinda feels like a tree growing next to me, you know?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, The fruit of this tree is soft and suitable for washing the body.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I see.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;A loofah? No, a tawashi huh&#8230;&#8230; After listening to Lillywood-san&#8217;s explanation, I touched the fruit growing on the tree and felt its squishy and soft elasticity. Its skin is a little rough, but that&#8217;s why it feels like a sponge, looking easy to use.<br /> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N: Both are vegetables used to scrub.)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well then, I will start washing your back, okay?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I will be in your care.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1161212896"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1589575921"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t have much experience in doing this, so please let me know if I missed anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Lillywood-san calmly said this, the fruit she was holding was pressed against my back and she slowly scrubbed my back with her gentle hands. Hmmm. It has a nice elasticity and feels pretty good. It also feels like it&#8217;s foaming well. This plant is pretty good&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about this, I surrendered myself to the comfort of having my back rubbed&#8230;&#8230; but for some reason, the elastic things that were against my back had &#8220;increased&#8221;. Arehh? I wonder if Lillywood-san decided to use another sponge? The new sponge feels smooth and soft. However, something kind of strange though? It was barely moving, you know? No, they were moving up and down a little bit, but she wasn&#8217;t using it as much as the other sponge. Also, it seems to be &#8220;a lot bigger&#8221; than the sponge she used first&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ummm, Lillywood-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes? Are you feeling itchy somewhere?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, no, I didn&#8217;t mean that&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry if I misunderstood. However, ummm&#8230;&#8230; Is your &#8220;chest touching my back&#8221; by any chance?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sorry about that. I can&#8217;t really change the size of my body like Kuromueina or Shalltear&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt the blood rush to my head at once when she nonchalantly said those words. Eh? That means, errr, this&#8230;&#8230; T- The smooth and elastic thing touching my back is hair-turned leaves&#8230;&#8230; a- and Lillywood-san&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Errr, where&#8217;s the container for washing the body&#8230;&#8230; there it is. Ah, excuse me.&#8221;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-207967359"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-509275311"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ ! ? ! ? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lillywood-san reached out to pick up a wooden bucket that was placed a short distance away from us, and something squishy pressed against my back. Aaaahhhh!? They&#8217;re pressing against me! Those extremely soft lumps of elasticity are being squashed against my back!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well then, I will wash it down, okay?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yesh.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Kaito-san?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m owrite.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothingness! Keep your mind into nothingness! Don&#8217;t think about anything! The things pressed against my back are probably just &#8220;soft volleyballs&#8221;! They&#8217;re definitely not breasts!!! Assumptions are something immensely powerful. Just keep persuading yourself, keep fooling your thoughts! Once you&#8217;re clearly aware of it, you&#8217;re done for! A certain part of me will bring me in quite the trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A- At a time like this, I think I should do that. I think I should imagine something scary. Picture the object of your fear!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;My beloved child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Al&#8230;&#8230; right. That calmed me down a bit. No, I don&#8217;t mean to be rude to her, but the first thing that pops into my mind when I think of someone scary is Eden-san with her switch turned on. But thanks to that, I felt like I quickly got rid of the blood rushing to my head and helped&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-729003497"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1940761568"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;With this, I washed your back. I guess &#8220;I&#8217;ll wash the front&#8221; next.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Y- You don&#8217;t have to do the front!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be that reserved.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, no, I&#8217;m not being reserved here, I&#8217;m&#8230;&#8230;. Ah.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just when I thought I had calmed down a bit, I heard words that sounded like a death sentence. I hurriedly refused, but Lillywood-san smoothly moved in front of me. It seems like she had covered her breasts with her hair and wrapped her towel around her lower body, so the scene wasn&#8217;t as shocking as when she first went into the onsen but&#8230;&#8230; the fact that they&#8217;re slightly being covered made it even worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am a man. In a situation like this, no matter how hard I try to calm my mind, a part of my body would still react, whether I want it to or not. Of course, it was covered with a towel. However, it was obvious even from the towel that that part was asserting itself, and Lillywood-san&#8217;s gaze was focused on that extremely dangerous part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ah, n- no, ummm, t- this is&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[U- Ummm, Lillywood-san?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-203616836"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1257045114"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;You really got aroused huh. I thought you were just saying that for politeness&#8217; sake&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing. I&#8217;m sorry. Kaito-san, you will wash your front by yourself, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, y- yes! I will wash it myself!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand. Well then, I&#8217;m going to go back to the onsen first.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not really sure why, but for some reason, Lillywood-san nodded, looking like she understood something before moving behind me with a slight smile on her lips. Then, unlike what she had been insisting earlier, she told me that she would leave it to me to wash my front myself as she went back to the onsen. Not knowing what Lillywood-san&#8217;s intentions were, I was a little stunned, but I just picked up the sponge fruit she had left behind and slowly began to wash myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I see. So this is how it feels like to be embarrassed huh&#8230;&#8230; Fufufu, it seems like I am definitely a woman too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing such a small murmur, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel my head heat up again even though it almost subsided already. Lillywood-san guard was really loose, and my heart was constantly beating so fast. This is probably because she thinks of herself as a tree, and in a way, it is probably unavoidable because of her race.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the words she muttered last&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; seemed very womanly to me.</span></p>
