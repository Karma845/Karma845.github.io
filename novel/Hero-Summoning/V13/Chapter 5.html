<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Third Day of the Six Kings Festival</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking a dip in the large bathtub, I washed away the fatigue of the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a bottle of beer out of my magic box, poured it into a glass and drank it. Drinking cold beer in a warm bath&#8230;&#8230; Hmmm, this is bliss. Kuro and the others have set a rule: the person who would go around with me the next day would be the one taking a bath with me. Following that rule, tomorrow&#8230;&#8230; will be the festival planned by Magnawell-san, and there is no one to whom I planned to go around with. That means I can take a bath alone tonight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking a bath together with Kuro and the others is fun, but sometimes, it&#8217;s nice to drink alone like this&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[We&#8217;ll be intruuuudiiiing~~! Miyama-kun, we&#8217;ve come~~]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Bfuuuuhhh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the sound of the door opening, I heard a familiar voice&#8230;&#8230; of someone who wasn&#8217;t supposed to be here. Perhaps, because I was taken by surprise, I reflexively turned around and saw Dr. Vier with a large bath towel wrapped around her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[D- Dr. Vier!? W- What are you doing here!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ehehe, I came here to see you, Miyama-kun.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her beautiful skin that was normally hidden in her nun habit exposed, combined with her dark gray hair bundled up to a bun, the bashfully smiling Dr. Vier looked different from usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, even if you say that you came to see me&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1953035889"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-699680142"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? Ah, my work is alright. I&#8217;ve entrusted my patients to my fellow doctors, and are closing my clinic for today and tomorrow!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, I guess that&#8217;s great if that were the case but&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m not talking about that. Why are you here in the bath while I&#8217;m here?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well~~ I talked to Kuromu-sama about going around the festival with Miyama-kun&#8230;&#8230; Then, I heard that Miyama-kun might be free on the fourth day, tomorrow. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve directly come to talk to you about going around together. Thereupon, I heard about this wonderful rule that the girl who was going around with Miyama-kun the next day could take a bath with Miyama-kun, so I rushed over!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I- I wonder where I should tsukkomi at? I mean, this is the first time I&#8217;ve heard of that rule even applying to those who want to jump in&#8230;&#8230; No, rather than questioning that, errr, does this mean Dr. Vier wanted to go around with me tomorrow? There&#8217;s nothing wrong about that per se. In fact, Dr. Vier is actually counted as &#8220;my companion&#8221;. I was told that Dr. Vier had received an invitation as well, but she wanted to join me as my companion. I originally visited Dr. Vier with the intention of inviting her, so I just agreed. However, Dr. Vier is a doctor and she has a job she needs to do at the clinic. That&#8217;s why it was difficult for her to participate in the entire Six Kings Festival and she didn&#8217;t come here with us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that&#8217;s why Dr. Vier is nominally my companion, and there&#8217;s no problem with us going around together&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[E- Errr, I certainly hadn&#8217;t decided on going around with anyone in particular tomorrow, so I don&#8217;t have any problem with that&#8230;&#8230; Are you fine with that, Dr. Vier? Isn&#8217;t it better if you go around with Kuro and her family&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Of course, I&#8217;m going to greet everyone in Kuromu-sama&#8217;s family and go around with them on the sixth day.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, you also have other free days huh. I&#8217;m relieved then.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Fufufu, thank you for worrying about me. It makes me happy.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-198572676"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1368738332"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, no&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Vier has started to smile more brightly than before&#8230;&#8230; I guess it&#8217;s really because she&#8217;s connected again with her family huh? I even feel like she resembles Kuro in some ways. Adding her klutziness to that makes her seem like a lovely woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about this, Dr. Vier spontaneously moved near the onsen and I turned my head away. Thereupon, with the sound of her body being washed down, Dr. Vier came into the onsen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Fuuu~~ That feels good~~]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- It certainly does.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know it&#8217;s a little late to say this, but Dr. Vier is an incredibly beautiful woman. She also seems to be the type whose figure is hidden in her clothes, as her breasts are quite large from what I saw earlier. She has the body of a mature lady, and just the thought of taking a bath with her makes me nervous&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Arehh? Hikari is quite late, isn&#8217;t she?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Neun-san? Is Neun-san coming too?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn. I thought it would be nice if Miyama-kun, me and Hikari could go around together, so I asked her to come. Hikari agreed, and so, we came to the changing room together&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have any objection in having the three of us go around the festival with Neun-san. However, the big problem is that special rule about having a mixed bath with me. No, in the first place, I don&#8217;t think that the shy Neun-san would have a mixed bath with me. Just as I was thinking that though, I heard the door open again. No way, she&#8217;s really going here!?</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1133184176"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2039952092"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, you finally showed up, Hika&#8230;&#8230; Eh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Dr. Vier? What&#8217;s the matt&#8230;&#8230; Huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Dr. Vier sounded confused, stopping in the middle of her sentence, so I followed her gaze and looked in the door&#8217;s direction&#8230;&#8230; There stands Neun-san, with a ridiculous get-up. Eh? I mean, is that really Neun-san?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;T- Thank you for waiting.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, that&#8217;s fine and well but&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- Neun-san? T- That get-up is&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of armor clanking and heavy footsteps thudding&#8230;&#8230; Yes, Neun-san had appeared in full body armor that was more than two sizes larger than usual. Isn&#8217;t that too bulky!? It looks like she&#8217;s riding some kind of robot now, you know!? I mean, how the heck can she walk with such heavy-looking equipment!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[This is that. My &#8220;bathing suit&#8221;!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, no, how the heck are you taking such an &#8220;iron golem&#8221;-like outfit in the bath!? I mean, does that armor have any gaps for water to wash your body?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s alright. Vier&#8230;&#8230; I made this so that &#8220;not even a drop of water could pass through&#8221;! It&#8217;s made of magic, so the joints are working fine!]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-177230467"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-234091705">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s no good then! What do you think we&#8217;re going to do in this place, for you to come in that get-up!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I totally agree with Dr. Vier&#8217;s cry. I mean, that doesn&#8217;t look like you&#8217;re about to take a bath, she&#8217;s so heavily equipped as if she was about to go diving into the deep sea. No, I mean&#8230;&#8230; If you&#8217;re so embarrassed about having a mixed bath with me, you could just not come in here&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neun-san, wearing an outfit different from usual, suddenly appeared in front of Dr. Vier and I. Dressed in a heavy jet-black full-body armor, she looked as if she had undergone some kind of &#8220;dark evolution&#8221;. Who would have thought that Neun-san, who was once called the Hero and saved the world, would make her entrance as a black Iron Golem? If the believers of the First Hero saw her, they might tumble down and scamper away. That&#8217;s how shocking her appearance was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, Neun-san who was originally about 160cm tall, has now grown to over 2m, so I&#8217;m sure that her armor is quite thick&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Dr. Vier, please say something.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, Hikari is such an idiot sometimes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Neun-san approaching the bathtub with her heavy footsteps echoing in the bathroom, Dr. Vier and I exchange words with each other, dumbfounded. Neun-san didn&#8217;t seem to mind our reactions though, and coming near the bath, she squats&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;She started washing herself&#8230;&#8230; her armor, before taking a bath&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;No&#8230;&#8230; That doesn&#8217;t make any sense, you know!? It&#8217;s just the armor you&#8217;re wearing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ummm, Neun-san? I&#8217;m not asking you to get naked, but could you at least wear something lighter instead of such heavy equipment&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why the heck am I talking about making someone wear heavy equipment or light equipment in the bathroom? I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s too much power in my words or not, but even I got confused when I myself said it. Once she heard my words, Neun-san stopped moving before she slowly shook her head.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1879085508"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-331272418"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I can&#8217;t. Before I get married, I can&#8217;t afford to unnecessarily expose my skin to gentlemen.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I- Is that so&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">S- She won&#8217;t listen!? She won&#8217;t even listen even when she&#8217;s told that she&#8217;s being too extreme!? I couldn&#8217;t get my head around imagining the unrealistic situation of a giant armor soaking in a bathtub. Thereupon, Neun-san seems to have finished washing her body&#8230;&#8230; her armor, I mean, and slowly began to soak in the onsen. I don&#8217;t think I would have to explain what would happen if Neun-san, who is so heavily equipped that she&#8217;s described as an Iron Golem, got into the onsen&#8230;&#8230; The water was pushed out at once, turning to a small wave, hitting my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Neun-san, can you feel the hot water in your armor?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Please don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s &#8220;completely waterproof&#8221;!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Doesn&#8217;t that make it that bathing here makes no sense at all!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, what the heck is she even here for? I know that I&#8217;ve already said this but&#8230;&#8230; If you&#8217;re so embarrassed about having a mixed bath with me, you could just not come in here&#8230;&#8230; As I was dumbfoundedly thinking about this, Dr. Vier, who hadn&#8217;t spoken a word for a while now, spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hey, Hikari? That armor was something you made from your magic power, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, what of it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;Dispel&#8221;.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-952492824"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-501267529"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ehh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the moment Dr. Vier muttered that word, something that sounded like breaking glass resounded&#8230;&#8230; The full body armor that Neun-san was wearing &#8220;disappeared&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Soaking in the waters with armor on is just plain bad manners. That&#8217;s why, I&#8217;ll forcibly cancel that out&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s try to sort out the information I had here. Neun-san was dressed in a rather thick full-body armor and was soaking in the waters in that state. And this armor is apparently completely waterproof, impervious to even a drop of water. In that case, this armor that kept the onsen water away from Neun-san&#8217;s body&#8230;&#8230; what would happen when this armor suddenly disappears? In other words, Neun-san&#8217;s body, which had been hidden by the armor until then, even though it might be a short time, would be completely exposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And this is the most important part. Because the impact of her armor was just so great&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;My body is currently facing Neun-san&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; And with the disappearance of her armor, the scene was definitely burned into my eyes. Her porcelain white skin exposed, her black hair tied up in a bun&#8230;&#8230; those bulges that indicate that Neun-san is a woman, and the protrusions sticking out on their top. I have seen all of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ! ? ! ? ! ? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of me, who completely stiffened after what I&#8217;d seen, Neun-san&#8217;s face flushed as if she was about to explode, and she let out an inarticulate scream. Then, after her mouth opened and closed, with her face bright red, as if she ran out of oxygen&#8230;&#8230; Neun-san &#8220;sank into the onsen&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- Neun-san!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hikari!? A- Are you alright? T- This is&#8230;&#8230; Hmmm.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1504273081"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2004275476"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Dr. Vier? How&#8217;s Neun-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh. She&#8217;s completely knocked out.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Vier, who had hurriedly rescued the sinking Neun-san, shook her head with a sigh after checking her condition. Apparently, she was so embarrassed that she had fainted. I think I saw another person in that state a while ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Dr. Vier, no matter how I look at it, suddenly casting magic like that on her is&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t expect that she would overreact this much&#8230;&#8230; I think it&#8217;s better if we let her sleep outside for the moment. Miyama-kun, I&#8217;ll take Hikari out, so I&#8217;ll be going first, okay?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, yes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Vier, who was the cause of the problem, didn&#8217;t expect that Neun-san would overreact this much&#8230;&#8230; Too much that she would end up fainting. With an awkward expression on her face, Dr. Vier said that she would go up first and take care of Neun-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m really sorry that it has become quite boisterous. After you get out of the bath, let&#8217;s talk again. All three of us.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I understand. I also have to apologize to Neun-san later.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though what happened earlier was out of my control, I saw Neun-san naked. Neun-san is a woman with a very old-fashioned way of thinking, so seeing her naked body is probably a more serious event than I would have thought. Anyway, I&#8217;ll sincerely apologize when she wakes up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was left alone in the bath after that ruckus with Dr. Vier and Neun-san, but I was worried about the two of them, so I decided to get out of the onsen soon after they left. Hmmm, in the end, I wasn&#8217;t able to take my time and rest&#8230;&#8230; I guess my bath time really is cursed huh? Anyway, I got out of the bath as soon as possible, thoroughly wiped my body and went out of the changing room. However, I didn&#8217;t see Dr. Vier and Neun-san when I got out. I guess Neun-san may have not woken up yet and so, they hadn&#8217;t come out of their changing room yet huh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about this, I took out a bottle of milk from the magic tool that resembles a refrigerator, which is set up in front of the bathroom. It feels wonderful, having cold milk right after taking a bath. It certainly feels like a VIP treatment&#8230;&#8230; Incidentally, I&#8217;m in the Fruit Milk faction. Following the etiquette of Japanese baths, I firmly placed one of my hands on my hip while the other brought the opened fruit milk into my mouth and I tried to drink it all in one gulp&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Miyama-kun!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Bfuuhhhh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw Dr. Vier come running out of the changing room, I spurted out all the milk in my mouth. I&#8217;m very sorry for the mess I made on the floor, but I don&#8217;t think I can do anything about it. The reason for this is because Dr. Vier, who came out of the changing room, was wearing only a calming indigo-colored bra with hardly any unnecessary decorations, but with a sense of elegance in it, and panties of the same color&#8230;&#8230; In short, she rushed out &#8220;in just her underwear&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kerhek, keheok&#8230;&#8230; D- Dr. Vier!? W- What the heck are you doing!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[H- Help me, Miyama-kun!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Help? Ahh, wait, why are you going behind me!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I hurriedly asked her back, flustered by the erotic sight of Dr. Vier, just in her underwear, she didn&#8217;t answer, but instead, walked around behind me and stuck close to my back, as if hiding behind me. Eh? What is this? What&#8217;s going on? Ahh, I kind of felt something soft on my back&#8230;&#8230; Wait, stop thinking about them! What in the world is happening&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was feeling puzzled by Dr. Vier&#8217;s actions, I heard an incredibly angry voice that seemed to be calling out from the pits of hell. Thereupon, from the entrance of the women&#8217;s changing room&#8230;&#8230; a knight from hell came out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Neun-san, looking like a mad warrior, clad in full body armor of flaming crimson, and carrying a greataxe that could chop off the head of a dragon, let alone a human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I&#8217;m sorry, Hikari! I never expected that that would happen&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I won&#8217;t forgive you&#8230;&#8230; How dare you&#8230;&#8230; How dare you do that in front of Kaito-san&#8230;&#8230; If you want to continue where we left off a thousand years ago, then it&#8217;s fine by me! This time, I&#8217;ll cut off your head!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hyiiiiiiihhh, y- you&#8217;re not a Hero anymore, you&#8217;re just a berserker. I&#8217;m sorry already!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No! Today for sure, no matter how much you hide behind Kaito-san&#8230;&#8230; behind Kaito-san&#8230;&#8230; Kaito-san&#8230;&#8230; Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neun-san approached us while overflowing magic power was gushing out from her entire body, but when she arrived in front of me, she stopped for some reason. Then, after a short silence, she slowly lowered the greataxe that was on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[U- Ummm, Neun-san? P- Please calm down.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ah, n-no, this is&#8230;&#8230; a misunderstanding.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to calm Neun-san down, she replied in a very flustered voice before going back to the changing room. A few minutes later, Neun-san returned&#8230;&#8230; dressed in a &#8220;beautiful kimono&#8221; for some reason&#8230;&#8230; And then, walking up towards me, she put three on the ground and deeply bowed. Unnn? What&#8217;s with this situation? Why the heck is Neun-san kneeling in a dogeza?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Neun-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I- I&#8217;m aware that it was an accident.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Errr&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[H- However, n- now that you&#8217;ve seen my naked body&#8230;&#8230; I- I don&#8217;t have any choice but to marry Kaito-san! P- Please, incompetent I may be&#8230;&#8230; Please take me as your wife.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yes?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mind went blank for a moment at her sudden declaration of marriage, but I immediately thought of the reason why. Neun-san is a person who thinks in a very old-fashioned way&#8230;&#8230;.She may be thinking that she should only show her naked body to the person who will be her husband. And even though it may be an accident, I saw Neun-san&#8217;s naked body&#8230;&#8230; Her naked body which isn&#8217;t supposed to be shown to anyone but her husband-to-be&#8230;&#8230; In short, errr, that should mean that&#8230;&#8230; I should take responsibility for that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Listening to her words that held heavy meaning within them, I stayed silent for a while. After thinking about it for a while, I crouched down to make eye contact with Neun-san, and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Neun-san.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-380018441"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1802620380">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yesh!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Errr, it&#8217;s just a suggestion&#8230;&#8230; But why don&#8217;t we just forget what happened tonight?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh?

That&#8217;s why, marrying for this reason is&#8230;&#8230; something that I think Neun-san will regret.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was also responsible for this incident. But even if that&#8217;s so, I felt that marrying Neun-san because of the mere reason of having to take responsibility was just a bit wrong.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s why, I think we should forget about what happened tonight.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I had expressed my intentions, I quietly waited for Neun-san&#8217;s words.Neun-san stared at me for a few moments&#8230;&#8230; and letting out a small sigh, she smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I understand.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After telling me that she agrees with my suggestion, Neun-san shyly blushed and bringing the tip of her index fingers together, she whispered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I- I may never be able to completely forget about this.

I- If that time comes, I will be in your care!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Neun-san has an old-fashioned way of thinking, it was a very important matter for her to be seen naked by me, someone of the opposite gender. We came to the conclusion that we would forget about this matter for the time being&#8230;&#8230; but I wonder why? I feel like I&#8217;ve gotten closer to Neun-san more than ever before.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, I found myself standing in the premises of a Shinto shrine. The sky was dark, indicating that it was nighttime, but there were many lanterns with pale orange glows around me. The scene of many stalls lined up along a cobblestone street made the place look like a bazaar. Strange as it may seem, what would normally be a lively and noisy scene seems completely different when there are no people around, and the light from the lantern only made it seem rather lonely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was puzzled by the somewhat nostalgic scene, I suddenly heard the sound of something being cooked and smelled the delicious aroma of sauce wafting through the air. The sounds and smells led me to one of the stalls&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Welcome, my child! It&#8217;s Mother!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the melancholy I had been feeling earlier was instantly erased as I saw the person, who for some reason, was wearing a twisted hachimaki and a happi coat, cooking yakisoba. Thereupon, I suddenly remembered her name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of that person with one wing of iron and gears is Makina-san, the God who created the world I was in. This is amazing. It&#8217;s true that she did explain to me before how I would forget Makina-san except when we meet in my dreams, but I really did not remember her at all until just now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Makina-san is here though, does that mean that I&#8217;m currently asleep just like before, and only my consciousness was brought here? Well, putting that aside&#8230;&#8230; Why the heck are you sautéing yakisoba, World Creator&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[My child, do you also want to eat some yakisoba? It&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s home-cooked food, filled with her love and green dried seaweed.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-92643936"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1182586299"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- Thank you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dropping the word &#8220;majesty&#8221; in her dictionary somewhere behind, the God in a happi coat handed me yakisoba noodles and disposable chopsticks in a plastic container. It looks delicious. It does look delicious but&#8230;&#8230; I wonder what this incomprehensible feeling is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Makina-san, why are you making yakisoba? Also, isn&#8217;t the atmosphere here too different from before?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s a rather difficult question. It would take a while to explain this&#8230;&#8230; but it may have been because of my desire to &#8220;go around the festival with my child&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That explanation looked rather short though&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her answer was straightforward and even graceful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haahhh, everyone had it nice. I wanted to go around the festival with my child too. I wanted to lick my cute child in his yukata&#8230;&#8230; However, I held myself back. A mother who interferes when her child is in the midst of fun with their friends is the epitome of a mother who isn&#8217;t well-liked. Instead, I&#8217;ve decided to recreate a bazaar and invited my child to join me.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I- I see.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s that, you know? When it comes to this person, let&#8217;s just not bother getting in too deep. With her talking about licking me as if it&#8217;s a matter of course, I tried ignoring her words&#8230;&#8230; At any rate, I have a bad feeling about continuing to expand on this topic, or rather, I feel like such would be an act as if you were stepping into a bottomless abyss, so let&#8217;s switch topics as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Speaking of which, I&#8217;m changing the subject, Makina-san, but thank you very much for your advice before. Thanks to your words, I have successfully resolved the issue.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1299587035"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-734027561"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, that&#8217;s because my child did his best. I didn&#8217;t really care what happened to those talking lumps of flesh, but I&#8217;m glad it turned out well for my child.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did this woman just nonchalantly say something scary like talking piece of flesh? I feel like I kept a straight face for a moment, but how should I say this&#8230;&#8230; I could really feel something dark from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, my intuition tells me that I shouldn&#8217;t think too much when it comes to Makina-san, so I just let things go with the flow and ate my yakisoba. Makina-san, who is eating her yakisoba with a smile on her face, doesn&#8217;t seem to have any evil intentions. She does have a very mysterious atmosphere around her though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, that&#8217;s right, my child.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The next battle is slowly beginning to unfold. And this time, your battle will be completely different in scale from the past. It could be a battle involving the three realms, the Human Realm, the Demon Realm, and the God Realm.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was told to me, as if she was just having small talk, was a shocking story&#8230;&#8230; It was supposed to be a shocking story, but somewhere in my heart, it felt like what she said was something understandable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Does it have something to do with Shiro-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn, exactly.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-552012793"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1266756096"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Makina&#8217;s words, which she easily affirmed with a smile, really made me feel like my guess was spot on. To begin with, there are only a limited number of situations that can involve all three realms. The God Realm especially wouldn&#8217;t move without Shiro-san&#8217;s direction. I think the cause of this matter that Makina-san was talking about was that ordeal Shiro-san said she would give me before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Now then, my child. Here&#8217;s my advice this time!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Makina-san&#8217;s bright voice interrupted my thoughts, and seemingly drawn by it, I looked at her and my eyes met her rainbow-colored eyes. Her eyes that seemed to see not only those before her, but everything in existence. Even though she appeared innocent, I felt that she still had majesty befitting a World Creator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Shallow Vernal will give my child several ordeals. As for the content of these ordeals, only Shallow Vernal would know what they were. But on top of all these ordeals&#8230;&#8230; lies a question. &#8220;What does victory for my child mean&#8221;?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The victory&#8230;&#8230; for me?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Is it your victory if you get through Shallow Vernal&#8217;s ordeals? Is it your victory if you defeat Shallow Vernal? Or perhaps, do you have to accomplish something else to acquire that happy ending?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard those words, something came to mind. In the first place, why was Shiro-san trying to put me through these ordeals? Shiro-san did ask me to show my worth to her, but is that really the only reason? Another thing that comes to mind is the way Shiro-san was acting back then&#8230;&#8230; just after I went to Rigforeshia with Sieg-san, Shiro-san was in an unusually brooding mood. At that time, Shiro-san asked me if &#8220;it&#8217;s wrong to seek something you can&#8217;t have&#8221;. I thought about this at that time, but what is it that Shiro-san can&#8217;t have?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s where I felt like I had the answer to this matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Well, you don&#8217;t have to rush yourself to think about it.  I think my child knows when the battle between my child and Shallow Vernal is going to happen, along with the aforementioned matter, right ? You still have time.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-462091845"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2117601702"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiro-san&#8217;s ordeal will be given when a year passes in this world&#8230;&#8230; This would originally be the time when she returns the person who plays the role of Hero to their original world with their changes reverted a year, to how they were like before they were summoned. That being the case, it certainly means I still have more than enough time to think about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether it&#8217;s something that can be answered by thinking about it is another matter though&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;ll try to remind you again this time when you need it. You understand the situation, right, my child? Shallow Vernal too has a heart. It is obvious, but she has her desires and wishes for something too. Surely, you&#8217;ll get enough material to notice that wish of hers more than anyone else in this world. That&#8217;s why, think hard&#8230;&#8230; What is that the being named Shallow Vernal thinks, what is it that she desires&#8230;&#8230; That would surely be the key to reaching &#8220;true victory&#8221;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Makina-san, do you know the answer to that question?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I wonder, what could the answer to that question be? If I did have the answer to that question, would my child want me to tell you?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, I will figure it out myself.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Makina-san said that she is an Omniscient and Omnipotent God, and since she&#8217;s giving me advice like this, I guess she knows the answer already. However, as to what Shiro-san&#8217;s wish is&#8230;&#8230; Hearing someone just telling me that somehow feels different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiro-san is someone very airheaded who can come up with crazy ideas. I have been pushed around by her many times, and I&#8217;m sure I will continue to be pushed around by her in the future. However, if you ask me if I dislike Shiro-san, without even needing to think about it, I would shake my head in denial. She is a peculiar person&#8230;&#8230; but I really enjoy talking and hanging out with her. I found her smile, which I have only seen a few times, to be very beautiful. That&#8217;s why, I&#8217;d like to think and arrive at the answer to Shiro-san&#8217;s wish on my own. However, to be honest, I don&#8217;t have enough sources to arrive at the answer at this point&#8230;&#8230; but just as Makina-san said, there&#8217;s no need to rush, and it would be best to try to get closer to Shiro-san without thinking too much at this point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;It looks like you&#8217;ve got your answer. Well then, let&#8217;s do it this way.

I think your face seen from the 37° angle to the right is especially very cool. Possessing both cuteness and dignity, this is a precious moment when a child grows into an adult. Of course, appearance is only one of my beloved child&#8217;s charms, and I don&#8217;t think I need to speak about how wonderful my child is on the inside, but as a mother, I couldn&#8217;t help but want to praise you in many ways. However, regrettably, the time I can call my beloved child here is very short, and that is a negative not only for me, but also for my beloved child, who will not be able to spend much time with me. Would it be good if I stretch out time here? No, as expected, doing that would make it easier for Shallow Vernal to notice something amiss&#8230;&#8230; Hmmm, I want to shower my beloved child with love as much as I can, but the dilemma of not being able to do so as I would like is very painful. Still, I want to do everything I can. In the meantime, how about some wholehearted licki&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Makina-san, who started talking in a rather glazed voice with crazy eyes and completely insane lines, suddenly gasped and slammed her fist into her own face. The impact erased all the scenery behind Makina&#8217;s back, but just like a video played back in reverse, it was soon restored to its original state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Phew, that was close, my love for my child almost got out of control and caused a big bang.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Can I just throw a tsukkomi here? Is all that just happened something on the level of &#8220;almost&#8221;? In that case, how dangerous would she have been if she actually went out of control&#8230;&#8230; I shudder to think, once again, that I had caught the attention of such an outrageous person. I mean, when she rambled about that long speech of hers, her eyes were completely dyed in madness. That wasn&#8217;t just on the level where I felt like I&#8217;m in danger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, let&#8217;s get back on track and have a nice chat for 18 minutes and 52 seconds until my child wakes up!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I guess so.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unnn, well, how should I say this&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m really grateful for all the advice she gives me, but I wish she would hide the madness that oozes out of her a bit more. There&#8217;s an unpleasant tension in the air, making me feel as if I were facing a hungry predator. If that switch of hers won&#8217;t just flick on, she would have been a normal, easy-to-talk-to person&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, I can&#8217;t remember who they are, but I&#8217;m also acquainted with &#8220;the her over there&#8221; when I&#8217;m awake, right? Seriously, would I be alright with her around? With me forgetting all the memories I had here, wouldn&#8217;t something outrageous happen here? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unnn&#8230;&#8230; Let&#8217;s just try not to think about it.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Third Day of the Six Kings Festival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s currently 5:00 am&#8230;&#8230; and I have about four hours before I meet up with Dr. Vier and Neun-san. Waking up early in the morning, I used my Teleportation Magic Tool to return back to Lilia-san&#8217;s house. The reason was&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Come now, Bell. Don&#8217;t move&#8230;&#8230; Lynn, thanks for the help.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Gaoo!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kyuui!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, it was to bring my pets, Bell and Lynn, to the Six Kings Festival. This is because pets are allowed on the third day of the Six Kings Festival. The festival was hosted by Magnawell-san and it was apparently about &#8220;Interacting with Monsters&#8221;. That&#8217;s why I came back to pick them up, and while I&#8217;m at it, I came early to brush Bell&#8217;s fur. While I was at the Six Kings Festival, I asked the servants I was close with to take care of Bell and Lynn. Of course, they brush them every day, but I still want to do it myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The key to brushing Bell well is to use several brushes needed for each area and to thoroughly wash her whole body. First, use a coarse brush to remove the dirt from between her bristles, and then wash her entire body. Use a shampoo for monsters that contain a special blend of several ingredients, and wash thoroughly, down to the smallest detail, so that it would be silky smooth when it dries. Then, after drying her fur with a wind-generating Magic Tool, I used a fine brush to arrange everything. The important thing here is to brush her fur when they&#8217;re slightly damp, not when it&#8217;s completely dry. Otherwise, strange curls would keep popping out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kuuu&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bell seemed to love my brushing, as she looked very comfortable, making spoiled purrs, which were very cute. Perhaps because she is a Behemoth, one of the most powerful High-ranking monsters in the world, Bell has a lot of pride. Even though she is friendly to the people in the mansion, partly because I tell her so, but the only ones I&#8217;ve seen her act spoiled around Sieg-san and I.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1291322309"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1447626942"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Alright, finished! Well then, I&#8217;m gonna dry you off now, so sit still.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Gao!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about random things, I finished brushing Bell and let her whole body completely dry off. Bell&#8217;s silky fur is something that I&#8217;m secretly proud of. I wonder if there are any hair masks made for monsters? If there is, I&#8217;d certainly like to have them&#8230;&#8230; I would like to add some finishing touches on Bell&#8217;s fur, to give them a bit more shine. I would also like a finer brush, so that I can brush her fur for the third time, giving her fur a more beautiful finish than they are now. I really feel like when it comes to Bell&#8217;s fur, there&#8217;s still room for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well then, let&#8217;s go to the Six Kings Festival.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kyuuu!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Unnn? Wait, Lynn? What&#8217;s the matter?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kyuii! Kyukuiii!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I finished brushing and was about to lead them to the Six Kings Festival, Lynn suddenly snuck into my clothes. Lynn then wriggles around in my clothes, before only her head out from my chest, looking satisfied. She&#8217;s more pampered than usual&#8230;&#8230; I guess she was lonely because I was only taking care of Bell. Not pulling Lynn out of my clothes, which she had completely crawled into, I gave her a pat on her head with a smile before activating my Teleportation Magic Tool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I arrived at the festival venue, I could see people with their pets here and there. It was now 7:00 am, and we still had about two hours before meeting up with Dr. Vier and Neun-san. As I was thinking that it might be a good idea to take a stroll around the area since Bell and Lynn were curiously looking around, I suddenly heard a familiar voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oya? If it isn&#8217;t Miyama-sama. Good morning.]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-962612807"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1357493811"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Chris-san? Good morning.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking back in the direction of the voice, I saw Chris-san, dressed in a men&#8217;s suit. She looked like a crossdressing beauty just as usual, though at a quick glance, one might mistake her as a normal, slender, prince-like young man. Behind Chris-san, there was a black horse&#8230;&#8230; and it was about twice as big compared to usual horses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Chris-san, is that horse the one you were talking about in your letters, your pet named Nirva?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, this is my favorite horse, Nirva&#8230;&#8230; a monster of the Grateful Horse species.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know about Chris-san&#8217;s favorite horse because she had mentioned her in her letters. Chris-san seemed to enjoy horseback riding, and she seems to take great care of her favorite horse, Nirva. In fact, since it&#8217;s a common topic between us, we have talked a lot about our pets, things like high-end pet stores we visited before and the like. Chris-san lightly introduced her favorite horse, then turned to Bell, who was with me, and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Miyama-sama has a White Dragon and a Behemoth&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ve seen this Behemoth with you before&#8230;&#8230; but isn&#8217;t her fur more magnificent than back then? She looks lovely.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Isn&#8217;t she!!!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of an Emperor, it seems like Chris-san has a keen eye for great things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Wha!? M- Miyama-sama!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Please look here, isn&#8217;t she silky smooth?

W- Why are you touching my shoulder!? P- Please wait for a moment&#8230;&#8230; Well, I did speak to you with an ulterior motive in mind but&#8230;&#8230; this was so unexpected&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Aren’t her horns beautiful too? With Bell&#8217;s horns being black, dirt would really stand out from it. So, I make sure to wipe them at least twice&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ummm, are you listening to me? I&#8217;m the type who is rather susceptible to surprise attacks&#8230;&#8230; so this feels very embarrassing&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m also very particular with the shampoo I&#8217;m using&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;You&#8217;re not listening huh. Yes, I understand&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll make sure to not speak with Miyama-sama about your pets&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll thoroughly remember that. Wait, like I said, your face is too close!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel so happy that she praised Bell, my pride and joy, that I talked about her and Lynn to Chris-san for over an hour. I felt really glad to hear someone praise my cute pet, making me feel very enthusiastic. I&#8217;ve never had a pet back in my previous world, but if I&#8217;d known that they&#8217;re so cute, I wish I had kept one sooner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just so happy that she complimented Bell that I even bragged about Lynn, and we ended up talking for quite a while.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1351391501"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1330262918"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry, Chris-san. I got a little heated and became a bit enthusiastic&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I also got a little heated, though in a different way.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, don&#8217;t mind it&#8230;&#8230; I was just saying that I got a bit careless&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I apologized for making her stay with me for so long, to which Chris-san, for some reason, answered me, breathing heavily with her back turned towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;M- Miyama-sama. My apologies, I&#8217;m afraid I will suffer serious psychological damage if this continues&#8230;&#8230; No, I remembered that I actually had something I needed to do now, so please excuse me.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, no. I&#8217;m sorry for taking up too much of your time.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, something like this isn&#8217;t so ba&#8230;&#8230; Please excuse me, my mind is still a bit confused! Well then, till we meet again.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Y- Yes, see you later.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like Chris-san was in quite a hurry, as after she said goodbye, she quickly walked away. Hmmm. I&#8217;ve done something really bad, haven&#8217;t I&#8230;&#8230; I really tend to talk a lot when it comes to Bell and Lynn. I&#8217;ll try to be even more careful from now on. After seeing Chris-san off, we decided to take a quick walk around the area since we still had a little over an hour before our meeting. If I knew someone, I could kill some time talking with them&#8230;&#8230; but I guess you can&#8217;t just meet someone you know that easily&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1796059770"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1319034301"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned my head to the direction of the voices I heard, I saw three people having a dispute in front of several huge dragon models, each of which was several meters tall.</span></p>

Unnn, I wonder if they didn&#8217;t notice that they&#8217;re gathering quite the crowd? A- Anyway, I didn&#8217;t see anything. Quickly averting my gaze, I somewhat forcefully pulled Bell and Lynn away from the scene.

Getting involved with them would definitely be a really bad idea after all&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about this, I moved quickly and let out a sign when I managed to get as far away from them as I could. If I&#8217;m this far from them, it should be alright.</span></p>

It&#8217;s alright now. Mother will sleep with you, my beloved child. I will envelop you with my endless love, making sure my beloved child sleeps in peace!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">H- Hyyyiiiiiihhh!? Scary! This person really is scary! Why the heck does she know how long I&#8217;ve slept down to the smallest second? Moreover, she started rattling about without letting me speak&#8230;&#8230; Eden-san, with black hearts forming on her eyes, began nudging closer and closer&#8230;&#8230; but at that moment, Kuro&#8217;s uppercut immediately appeared, striking Eden-san&#8217;s jaw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kuro&#8217;s uppercut&#8230;&#8230; It was a strike so powerful that it even cleared up the clouds in the sky. However, even though she was hit by a fist with such power, it only managed to make Eden-san&#8217;s head slightly turn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sparks began buzzing between Kuro and Eden-san. Thereupon, a vortex silently appeared above Kuro, and both of them disappeared within it. Unnn, how should I say this&#8230;&#8230; It isn&#8217;t on the level where I&#8217;m saying that I&#8217;m feeling anxious about the future&#8230;&#8230; I still haven&#8217;t met up with Dr. Vier and Neun-san yet, you know?

 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">After meeting Pandora, Eden-san, and other powerful people, I returned back to the place where I first saw Lilia-san and the others. For some reason, I felt like I would encounter disastrous people every time I moved, so I thought it was best if I just returned back to Lilia-san&#8217;s group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s been about 10 minutes since I moved away from them, but it looks like they&#8217;re still at it. As I approached Lilia-san and the others, Luna-san was the first to notice me, and with a relieved expression on her face, she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[C- Come on, Milady! Miyama-sama&#8217;s looking!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Please let&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Luna-san&#8217;s words, Lilia-san turned her face towards me, her eyes opened wide and she stiffened. Then, after a bit of silence, she began to flusteredly straighten up her hair with her hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Erhem. You&#8217;re right.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be that Lilia-san&#8230;&#8230; thinks that I haven&#8217;t found out about her secret room yet?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Good morning, everyone. That&#8217;s a big model, isn&#8217;t it? Is it a sculpture made by someone famous?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Good morning, Kaito-san. Yes, these are Rondo-sama&#8217;s works&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[She&#8217;s a legendary model maker who has created several sculptures that are highly regarded as works of art.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I regained my composure and asked about the model after a greeting, Lilia-san spoke with a gentle smile on her lips, and Luna-san added a supplementary explanation. However, this legendary model maker&#8230;&#8230; Hmmm. I wonder if it&#8217;s Alice again, messing around like usual? I guess I&#8217;ll ask her next time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sieg-san, good morning.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Good morning. Good morning to you too, Bell-chan and Lynn-chan.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Gaoo!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kyuii!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I often brush and feed them together with Sieg-san, Bell and Lynn are also very fond of Sieg-san. Lynn was a bit timid around her for some time, but now, she is getting along well with the people in the mansion. Bell is very prideful though, and she isn&#8217;t very close with lots of people. The only people Bell is friendly with outside of Sieg is her godmother, Alice.</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-166348998"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2029948589"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div>

Stop that, Bell!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Why is Bell always growling at me&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, of all the people in the mansion, Bell hates Luna-san the most, as she snarls at her every time she encounters her. She had apparently witnessed Luna-san playing a prank on me and recognized that&#8221; she was a bad person&#8221;. Well, I guess she isn&#8217;t wrong with her recognition about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I wonder why? I kind of feel like you&#8217;re speaking ill of me in your mind&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Might just be your imagination.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Briefly telling Luna-san, who was tilting her head in wonder, I then spoke to Lilia-san and Sieg-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Even so, you&#8217;re all quite early huh.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes&#8230;&#8230; Sieg had been hurrying us&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1505720363"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1569775539"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;ve always been looking forward to the third day after all.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, I see&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sieg-san is a staunch animal lover. For such a Sieg-san, today&#8217;s festival must be like heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[According to Phantasmal King-sama&#8217;s book, there&#8217;s going to be a monster market today&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ve brought &#8220;all my savings&#8221; in preparation for that.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I- Is that so?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes. I also want to get a cute child like Bell-chan and Lynn-chan.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s about three million in Japanese yen. Quite a lot of money considering Sieg-san&#8217;s age. Sieg-san is someone who got herself together, so she must have been saving up for a long time. Thereupon, Luna-san looked like she was thinking for a bit before she called out to Sieg-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;However, three gold coins wouldn&#8217;t be able to buy a good monster, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ugghhh&#8230;&#8230; M- Monsters are expensive after all.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Monsters are apparently more expensive than ordinary animals. Bell was also several billion yen, and the rarer the monster, the more expensive it will be. Hmmm. I could buy it for her, or I could even get it for free if I used my Black-rank invitation. But with Sieg-san&#8217;s personality, I&#8217;m sure she will adamantly refuse&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-577630900"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1266255009"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Incidentally, what kind of monster are you trying to buy, Sieg-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hmmm, I&#8217;m feeling indecisive. Magic beasts like Bell-chan are cute, dragons like Lynn-chan are wonderful, while the small ones are just so irresistible.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I- I see&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[For ease of raising, it would be better if I raise a dragon from its egg&#8230;&#8230; but dragon eggs are very expensive&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s easier to grow dragons if you raise them from their egg? Ahh, that imprinting stuff huh&#8230;&#8230; Looking at Sieg-san, who was unusually passionate about monsters, a smile inadvertently rose from lips&#8230;&#8230; When Lilia-san cleared her throat before speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Erhem. Well, I&#8217;m Sieg&#8217;s best friend&#8230;&#8230; Depending on the situation, I&#8217;m willing to lend you money.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Milady just wanted her to buy a dragon, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- That&#8217;s not it. All I want is to help my best friend&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like dragon-loving Lilia-san wants Sieg-san to buy a dragon. It&#8217;s true that she would sometimes whisk Lynn away and affectionately cuddle with her, so I guess she really likes dragons.</span></p>
 
 <p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊　＊　＊　＊</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">After chatting with Lilia-san and the others for a bit, I decided to head to where I would meet up with Dr. Vier and Neun-san. If I headed there now, I would arrive 20 minutes before our meeting time, which should be just the right time to arrive. As I was leisurely enjoying the scenery, together with Bell and Lynn, I suddenly spotted something&#8230;&#8230; no, someone strange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Holding a large wooden staff in hand, they slowly doddered, looking as if they were about to fall. It&#8217;s hard to tell if they&#8217;re male or female because of the dark green robe they&#8217;re clad in. Anyway, they were behaving in a way that didn&#8217;t seem right, so feeling worried, I approached them and called out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Ummm, is something the matter?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;You&#8217;ve come at just the right time, young man. You have a virtuous heart. Splendid, I commend you. If it&#8217;s possible, I would appreciate it if you could help out this foolish me.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Ah, yes. If it&#8217;s something I could do&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When they turned towards me after I called out to them, I saw the person&#8217;s face. She was a girl with orange hair, though I couldn&#8217;t tell because it was hidden under her robe, and green eyes. She is very short, only about 130cm tall, but in this world, I couldn&#8217;t tell a person&#8217;s age based on their appearance. The fact that she calls me &#8220;young man&#8221; also indicates that she must be quite old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, living beings are born unequal with each other. Some species don&#8217;t require to orally assimilate other beings, while others will collapse after a mere &#8220;10 days of fasting&#8221;. Well, I&#8217;m talking about what happened to me.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[H- Huhh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, please don&#8217;t misunderstand. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m a weird worshiper of a religion, nor am I a pervert who likes hurting oneself. No, all scholars and researchers are perverts of some sort, so I guess that makes me a pervert too? Well, whether or not I&#8217;m a pervert is an interesting topic, but it&#8217;s not relevant today.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;E- Errr, what do you mean?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1648392079"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1491752363">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ve been so absorbed in my research that I haven&#8217;t eaten anything for a while now. I tried to find a stall to eat something, but this place was too big and I got lost. I&#8217;d appreciate it if you could show mercy on this poor me and give me some food.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a convoluted way to talk. Ahh, unnn. Why is it that there&#8217;s always something strange with the people I know? Anyway, to sum it all up, it seems like she&#8217;s saying &#8220;she&#8217;s hungry, so feed her something&#8221;, so I took some food out of my magic box and handed it to her. Thereupon, the woman took off her hood and began eating with great gusto. The face that appeared from beneath the hood was definitely that of a beautiful girl. Her deep orange hair is short, but her bangs are long and droop down her eyes, giving her a slightly gloomy look. She has distinctive long ears, so I guess she&#8217;s probably an elf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman finished eating the food I gave her in no time, and after drinking the tea I gave her, she smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well~~ You really help me out here. I give you my thanks, &#8220;Miyama Kaito-kun&#8221;. You are indeed a very nice young man.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? H- How did you know my name&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The food you gave me tasted great, and this tea is also delicious. Fumu, I wonder if the quality of a food&#8217;s taste is affected by one&#8217;s personality?

Well, in my case though, I heard about you from &#8220;my people&#8221; and &#8220;my friends&#8221;, so what I heard might be a little different from the rumors circulating around you within the general public.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[H- Huhh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sure talks a lot&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s as if she&#8217;s a machine gun.

Despite my appearance, I&#8217;m actually the Elven Elder. Well, I prefer secluding myself, so we&#8217;ve never met.

 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person I met by chance was Fors-san, the Sage of the Forest, one of the legendary party members who once traveled with Neun-san. No, I&#8217;m really surprised.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Central Plaza, like its name suggests, is in the middle of the city&#8230;&#8230; and it&#8217;s a place one can easily reach if they just walk towards the Central Tower&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What time are you going to meet up with Laguna-san?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Time? I&#8217;m supposed to meet up with her at 9:00 am.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I just let Fors-san keep talking like a machine gun, we&#8217;ll end up late for our meet-up, so I thought that we should start walking already. However, there was a difference in stride length between Fors-san and I, so I made sure that I didn&#8217;t walk too fast, keeping my pace the same as hers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Good gracious, I&#8217;m sorry for always troubling you. I&#8217;m trying to be polite. I&#8217;ll also make sure that this debt of gratitude is returned.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s not expressing gratitude anymore, that feels more like you want me to receive punishment, you know!? Eyeball cuisines and insect cuisines&#8230;&#8230; They&#8217;re things I don&#8217;t want to eat from the bottom of my heart. I mean, does Fors-san usually eat such things? N- No, well, they say that everyone has differing tastes&#8230;&#8230; But unfortunately, the day when I will be able to relate to her tastes will never come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this in mind, I tried to gently tell her that there was no need to thank me, to which Fors-san&#8217;s expression changed to one of admiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What a humble young man, you are. This may just sound like common compliments to your ears, but you&#8217;re really splendid. Even so, hmmm.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until we reached the Central Plaza, Fors-san&#8217;s machine-gun talk went on and on.</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I reached the wide Central Plaza, I moved around my gaze, but I couldn&#8217;t find Laguna-san. I did easily spot Neun-san and Dr. Vier though. Fors-san was also acquainted with Neun-san, and since she mentioned before about how she hadn&#8217;t seen her in a while, she approached Neun-san and Dr. Vier first before worrying about Laguna-san&#8217;s absence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry, Neun-san, Dr. Vier. I&#8217;ve made you wait&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, it&#8217;s just that we arrived too early.

Who&#8217;s the lady with you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to them, apologizing for making them wait, Dr. Vier kindly replied first, and Neun-san followed with a greeting of her own before turning her attention to Fors-san behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh, Neun! It&#8217;s been a long time! Was it 30 years since we last met? I&#8217;m glad to see you&#8217;re doing well.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fors-san greeted Neun-san with a bright smile, but Neun-san tilted her head in genuine wonder, and her unexpected reaction caused Fors-san and I to tilt our heads as well. Arehh? They&#8217;re friends who traveled together, aren&#8217;t they? With Neun-san&#8217;s personality, I&#8217;m sure she isn&#8217;t joking&#8230;&#8230; What the heck is going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oi, oi, those words are making me sad here. Even I&#8217;m going to be shocked hearing you say that. To be forgotten by the comrade you traveled with and suffered with&#8230;&#8230; Humans certainly are forgetful creatures. The act of forgetting could probably even be said as something that makes many living beings what they are.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Neun-san remembered Fors-san, but it kind of feels like the Fors-san in her mind is different from the person next to me. What does this mean&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[W- Why did you &#8220;shrink&#8221;!?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2113100770"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1835225279"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shrink? Fors-san did?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oi, oi, why do you look that surprised?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, I mean&#8230;&#8230; Isn&#8217;t Fors &#8220;taller and had bigger breasts than me&#8221;!? Why do you look like a child&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahh, speaking of which, that certainly was how I looked back then huh? I completely forgot. I think it was 15 years ago? You see, in large groups of people, there would be that one person who isn&#8217;t anything special and has an awfully thin presence, right? Using that as reference, I thought of creating &#8220;a drug that shrinks down a person&#8217;s presence&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; After that, interestingly enough, rather than my presence, my body ended up shrinking instead. Hahaha!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s no laughing matter!!! Why are you taking such an incomprehensible drug yourself!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What are you saying? I&#8217;ll have you know, I&#8217;m a humane researcher. Isn&#8217;t it obvious that if &#8220;I want to experiment on a Human, it would basically be done on my own body&#8221;? Well, they sometimes end up in failures! Ahh, that obviously doesn&#8217;t apply with life-threatening drugs. I mean, I don&#8217;t make such things&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finally understood why Neun-san was surprised. Apparently, Fors-san was originally an adult woman who was taller than Neun-san. It&#8217;s been a long time since they&#8217;ve met each other, and they now met with her being around 130cm tall. I guess she would obviously not easily know who she is&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230; Or rather, 15 years ago&#8230;&#8230; You didn&#8217;t find a way to return back to your original form?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Nah, I did. I&#8217;ve kept all the recipes for the drugs I&#8217;ve made, so it&#8217;s easy for me to make a drug that returns me to normal.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[T- Then, why is it that&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2083387275"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-549827080"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s just that this form is convenient.

The magic power I had grown for years is still the same&#8230;&#8230; Rather, with those obtrusive &#8220;two lumps of fat gone&#8221;, my stiff shoulders were healed. The only problem now is that it&#8217;s hard to get things that are high up, but that can be easily fixed with a stepladder or using magic. In the end, my body is just a vessel made of flesh, and I don&#8217;t really mind swapping out vessels at all.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Haahhh&#8230;&#8230; You&#8230;&#8230; really are&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking like she got really tired of caring about what Fors-san did, Neun-san&#8217;s shoulders slumped. It&#8217;s no wonder, Fors-san&#8217;s character is just far too strong. Dealing with such a person would certainly feel tiring&#8230;&#8230; However, Fors-san is the same as usual. I&#8217;ve only known her for a short time, but I know that she&#8217;s the type who doesn&#8217;t read the mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Come on, Neun, you should calm down. Surprise is just a temporary emotion, and Humans are creatures that easily adapt. Soon, the sense of unease you&#8217;re feeling will disappear.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;No, well, you&#8217;re still the same as usual huh.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Did you know? I heard that there&#8217;s a saying in another world about how &#8220;leopards can&#8217;t change their spots&#8221;. I don&#8217;t really know what this leopard is, but I heard that it means that one&#8217;s personality formed at a young age doesn&#8217;t change even when you get older. Even if hundreds or a thousand years had passed, as long as I&#8217;m me, my personality won&#8217;t change that much.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haahhh&#8230;&#8230; Well, let&#8217;s just forget that. I give up. It&#8217;s unusual for you to go out, isn&#8217;t it?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps understanding Fors-san&#8217;s personality due to their long relationship, Neun-san quickly gave up and switched the subject. And from what Neun-san said, I guess Fors-san has been quite directionally-challenged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You aren&#8217;t too far off the mark. He had certainly helped me, and I certainly was lost, but the reason he helped me was slightly different. Well, I suppose that&#8217;s not what you were really asking about.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing what Fors-san said, not only Neun-san, but Dr. Vier and I also tilted our heads. After all, it&#8217;s currently 8:50 am, so she shouldn&#8217;t be late yet. And yet, Fors-san said that she was late for the meeting. She also wasn&#8217;t saying that she might be late, but that she was already late&#8230;&#8230; I wonder why? Just as I was about to ask her why, I saw Laguna-san dashing towards our direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[FOOOOOOORRRRRSSSS!]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ohh, Laguna! I&#8217;m glad that we&#8217;ve safely met up&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she saw Laguna-san, Fors-san waved her right hand towards her with a bright smile on her face. However, Laguna-san didn&#8217;t respond to her greeting and leaping towards Fors-san, Laguna-san slammed her knuckle on her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What the heck are you doing, you b*tch!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ghaak!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fors-san, who was struck with a strike that held a tremendous force, was slammed face-first into the ground. Eh? What the heck happened? What&#8217;s going on? As I was stunned by Laguna-san&#8217;s sudden action, Fors-san slowly looked up while holding her head with both hands.</span></p>

Three days had already passed&#8230;&#8230; that can&#8217;t even be called late anymore, you know!? I- I see, it&#8217;s no wonder she was angry. I finally understood what Fors-san meant when she said &#8220;given my current situation, it&#8217;s unclear to me how the time would have any significance of some sort&#8221; before. She was late not just by the time, but even by the date&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haahhh&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s good that I&#8217;ve been coming here everyday, around 9:00 am just in case&#8230;&#8230; And here you are&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, Laguna&#8217;s anger is indeed understandable. In fact, I&#8217;m the one who was late, so I&#8217;ll just obediently apologize. No, I&#8217;m sorry. However, this may sound like I&#8217;m just making excuses, but I&#8217;d like it if you hear my side as well.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;What is it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[In the first place. Isn&#8217;t it a mistake to let me, who has been called the &#8220;most directionally-challenged person in the long Elven history&#8221;, come alone? I can certainly understand that you&#8217;ve been so busy as the king that you haven&#8217;t had time to pick me up, and that&#8217;s a primary factor why I pity you. But the Flying Dragon Services directly flying towards the venue is set up on the gate to the Demon Realm, which means I would have to reach the gate by myself&#8230;&#8230; Incidentally, I&#8217;ll have you know that it took me &#8220;two days&#8221; just to get to the gate near Rigforeshia.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Listening to Fors-san words after apologizing for being late, I whispered to the nearby Neun-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Neun-san. Was Fors-san really that directionally-challenged?]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-681076695"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2123192807">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Yes. To be honest, it was so bad that I once thought that she might have been getting lost on purpose. When I heard what she just said, what I&#8217;m wondering is that &#8220;How in the world did she get to the gate?&#8221;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Fors-san is so directionally challenged that it&#8217;s a bit dangerous. When Neun-san told me about it, I looked back at the two and saw Laguna-san collapsed to her knees, with her hands on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s my fault.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s alright if you understand. However, it still was fundamentally my fault. Even though I was lost, now that I think about it, I still had a way to contact you. This won&#8217;t do. Maybe it&#8217;s because of my temperament as a researcher, but when I concentrate, my thoughts become narrow. I&#8217;ll reflect on this&#8230;&#8230; By the way, I actually found some interesting plants on my way along the Rigforeshia forest. I was so excited harvesting them that I couldn&#8217;t help myself&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You b*tch! Doesn&#8217;t that make it the reason why you&#8217;re late!!!?]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[N- No, that certainly might be one of the factors but&#8230;&#8230; calm down, Humans are beings capable of discussion. Put down that raised fist. If you hit me any harder, I might lose my memory&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Fors-san&#8217;s words, Laguna-san looked exhausted, her shoulders slumping down. As I watched their exchange, I called out to Neun-san again, who was now standing next to me before I knew it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Fors-san is an amazing person, isn&#8217;t she? In more ways than one&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, it&#8217;s just that&#8230;&#8230; Well, there&#8217;s still &#8220;someone worse&#8221; among my party members, so I got used to it&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? Someone worse than her&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-manga-chapter-mobile" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1872001848"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1116151823"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;There is. Hapti was quite an&#8230;&#8230; amazing person&#8230;&#8230; As soon as we arrived at a city occupied by Demons, she went around steal from the flame-ridden houses without a care in the world, negotiated with the inhabitants who had escaped behind our backs for a reward, led us to some ruins with treasures in it, saying that it was some Demon stronghold, and when we arrived at the Demon Lord&#8217;s castle, she tried to ditch all of us and headed straight to the treasury&#8230;&#8230; She was a money-grubbing troublemaker&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[We&#8217;re reassured of her abilities, but about half of the shambles our party went through was because of Hapti.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After listening to the story Neun-san said with an amazed expression on her face, I quietly left her side and called out to a certain someone behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;Come out here, money-grubber.]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">[W- What could you be talking about? I- I&#8217;m just an extremely beautiful shopkeeper of a general store, so I don&#8217;t know who this Transcendental Beauty Phantom Thief Hapti-chan&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- Migyaaahhhh!?]</span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like Alice was hiding it from her, so I won&#8217;t tell Neun-san about Hapti&#8217;s true identity. But that being said, I think I still need to punish her on behalf of Neun-san and the others. With that thought in mind, I turned towards the pale Alice and slowly raised my fist overhead.</span></p>
