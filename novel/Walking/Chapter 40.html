<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 40 &ndash; Intermission &ndash; Part two</h1><p class="calibre2">“…Report. After saying goodbye to the others in the Relay City Physis, the target stayed there for a few days, and it seems he is headed to the Southern Gate City Epica.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…What did he do while in Physis?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems he accepted quests to collect medicinal herbs.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…And the difficulty of those quests?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems it would be difficult for normal adventurers to gather many of them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Aren’t there many who deliver useless weeds? They are just adventurers after all…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes. Thinking about it that way, one must probably need to be very sharp to be able to do it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Hm. And what about the tigerwolf?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems the investigation led to the discovery of a lair deep within the forest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…That’s a problem. Can adventurers deal with it on their own?”</p><p class="calibre2">“They are A ranked adventurers, but several parties seem to be staying there. I believe we can leave it to them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“The distance means it can’t be helped. What about the heroes’ equipment?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…It is currently a work in progress, as we are setting up a discussion with a blacksmith.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Send them on a trial run as soon as the weapons are complete. If there aren’t any problems, send them to the dark forest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“The dark forest? Are you sure?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…It doesn’t have to be the deeper parts. Have them camp on the outer edges and see how they do.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Should we intervene?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Only if the situation calls for it. Continue observing until the very last minute, but don’t lose them. Make sure to remember that.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Understood. What instructions should I give to the commander of the chivalric order?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Mobilize the third order this time. They have been getting soft lately, and could use the stimulus.”</p><p class="calibre2">　◇ ◇ ◇</p><p class="calibre2">“…We have a report from the South Gate City.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Is it about the orc hunt? Did it end without issue?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…”</p><p class="calibre2">“What is the matter?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…It seems the orc hunt is over, and it seems there were superior species among them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Is that how big their scale was? So? Did something else happen?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes. There are reports of a demon attack during the hunt.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Demon?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Did they get it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…It seems the demon got away, and we suffered considerable losses.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I see. We finally confirmed the presence of a demon…”</p><p class="calibre2">“The damage was so severe, that rumors are already circulating in the South Gate City.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I don’t care. In fact, send word to the guilds to contact other countries. That should make them start paying attention.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Understood.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Do you think the heroes can stand up to a demon as they are now?”</p><p class="calibre2">“That seems unlikely, according to the reports we received.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…They had no problem fighting in the dark forest, did they? Would it be impossible even if they accepted it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I believe they wouldn’t stand a chance. It has also been reported that the aforementioned fighting didn’t raise their levels.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…So they have to go deeper if they are to raise their levels…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…The deeper parts are demon king territory. I believe there is a good chance they will encounter demons there.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I know. But then where?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Should we send them to a dungeon?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Dungeon?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. It’s possible to acquire not yet known magic items and weapons in dungeons. I believe it will increase their strength, and fighting various kinds of monsters will be good for them as well.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…And demons won’t appear in dungeons? Look into what dungeon would be best to send them into.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Our connection to Number Thirteen has been cut.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Was it watching that other one?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Is it possible that other one realized he was being watched and fought it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I don’t believe that to be the case. It seems all he can do in terms of hunting quests is hunt wolves. I can’t expect him to get the upper hand in a fight.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Is that your unbiased opinion?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Where is he?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…About that. He heard about damage caused by orcs in the village that put out the quest to hunt wolves, and it seems he fought said orcs.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…No one actually saw him fighting orcs. But we sent adventurers to bring him back, since we waited for days and he never returned, and they found a damaged sword used by him, his guild card, and his blood-stained robe. There were also orc corpses.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Are you saying he defeated them?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I do not know. According to the villagers, there were five orcs, and we found only three. We also found a broken mask.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you saying Number Thirteen intervened because that other one was about to be killed?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…That is possible.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Did Number Thirteen defeat the orcs?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I believe she has the ability to do so, but it would be a bad match. And according to one of the villagers, who is a former adventurer, it’s possible that one of the orcs was a superior species.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Could you confirm their deaths?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…We did not find their corpses. Orcs eat human meat, so…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…So it’s possible that they took them along as food…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Investigate that area. It’s dangerous to leave a superior species alive anyway. Also… Don’t forget to make sure this information doesn’t reach the ears of the other heroes.”</p>
