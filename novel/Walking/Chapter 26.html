<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 26 &ndash; Solo camping and reflection</h1><p class="calibre2">Part of the reason why I want to camp is to raise the proficiency of my Cooking skill.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t cook for myself when I’m in town. I need to ask inn owners to let me use their kitchen, and they don’t always like that.</p><p class="calibre2">And even though they’re not exactly local delicacies, there is food in stalls that I can only eat in specific towns, so I end up eating there too.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m having wolf steak for dinner, and soup made from edible wild herbs I picked on the way here and wolf meat.</p><p class="calibre2">Having things like soup stock powder can really change a meal while camping.</p><p class="calibre2">I boil wolf bones and salt them. Then I throw in wild herbs and wolf meat, and boil it again while managing the fire.</p><p class="calibre2">I cut the tendons off the steak meat, sprinkle some salt and pepper, and grill. Spices and seasonings are expensive.</p><p class="calibre2">As I eat this plain tasting soup, I start thinking. I’m feeling relatively comfortable with my life, so I need to think about what’s next. I guess food is what’s next on the agenda. Just getting to eat good food is enough to fill one’s heart… Or at least it should be.</p><p class="calibre2">And if I can sell it, I won’t have to continue working as an adventurer.</p><p class="calibre2">I can be a traveling merchant if I want to go around to different places.</p><p class="calibre2">Another thing that’s on my mind is this guild card. I carry it with me as a means of identification, but how important is that in this world? I use it to enter towns and villages, and I show it when I accept quests and report that I completed them, but does it contain records of when I used it?</p><p class="calibre2">Now that I think about it, I saw them holding my guild card over some sort of magic item when I entered someplace and showed it to them.</p><p class="calibre2">They said something about checking if I wasn’t a criminal, I think? They didn’t do that in the village.</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve seen guild employees do something with the card when I accept quests or report that I completed them. But from a skeptical point of view, it looks like they’re able to track me.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s fine while I’m here, but when I move to another country, I should probably get another form of identification. I’d be happy if the people of this country just abandoned me because I’m useless and left it at that, but I don’t think they’re going to give up that easily. I need to deal with that too.</p><p class="calibre2">I finish eating, and after a short break, switch gears to something else.</p><p class="calibre2">The topic at hand now is the fighting I did today. It proved to me that the gun is clearly helpful in battle.</p><p class="calibre2">But it’s not without its problems. It’s true that I’m just not used to it, but I can’t stay calm and use it when the enemy gets near. I guess it can’t be helped, since it’s supposed to be a long distance weapon anyway.</p><p class="calibre2">Should I make another one and start using two? Or remodel it so it’s capable of rapid-fire?</p><p class="calibre2">Obviously I’m not going to aim very well with my non-dominant hand, but I have a skill that corrects it, so I think I should be able to do it if I practice.</p><p class="calibre2">The other issue is power. The bullets pierced the wolves’ bodies, but will they do the same with monsters who have tougher skin? I’m particularly thinking about orcs.</p><p class="calibre2">If they don’t work, I can probably work on them to make them tougher and more powerful, but will the gun barrel withstand those without breaking?</p><p class="calibre2">There are a lot of problems. If I’m going to rework the gun, I’m going to need ore used in alchemy too.</p><p class="calibre2">I spread a sheet on the ground, and sleep wrapped with a robe.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s no rush to get back, so I’m going to spend another day walking around the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">I use Appraisal as I walk around. Today’s goal is to look for things that are edible and I can use as ingredients. There are wild herbs, but also other things like berries. I find quite a bit once I actually start looking.</p><p class="calibre2">Some people say nature is a storehouse of food, and I guess they have a point. There are mushrooms too.</p><p class="calibre2">But I have to make sure to always use Appraisal, because some plants are toxic.</p><p class="calibre2">This one has a component that causes paralysis. Can I use this to make something like a paralyzing bullet?</p><p class="calibre2">　◇ ◇ ◇</p><p class="calibre2">After camping for another day, I decide to return to the village because I’m running out of space in my Item Box.</p><p class="calibre2">The gatekeeper is surprised to see me. It’s probably because I told him I was going out to pick medicinal herbs, and he expected me to come back the same day.</p><p class="calibre2">“Did something happen?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I lost track of time while I was picking herbs. Then I came across some wolves and got lost.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Wolves? Where?”</p><p class="calibre2">“North from where I was picking medicinal herbs. There were two of them, so I took them down, but…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. If you have meat with you, we can buy it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I ate some while I was camping, but I can sell the rest. What about the fur?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t you think you can get more money for it if you sell it in the guild?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s less to carry, so I don’t mind. In return, I’d be thankful if you asked the innkeeper to make a nice meal. Especially if it’s something characteristic of this village.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ok. Hold on a second, I have to go call someone.”</p><p class="calibre2">I sell the wolf meat and fur I have on me, and spend the night in the village.</p><p class="calibre2">The food has been bumped up a notch, like I requested, and became a little fancier. Although the innkeeper is still silent and doesn’t show any sign of wanting to be friendly.</p><p class="calibre2">For some reason, I also paid half the price for staying here. The gatekeeper tells me it’s a reward for taking out the wolves for them. I’m thinking it’s less like a reward and more like a token of appreciation.</p><p class="calibre2">The next day, when I leave, I feel like the gatekeeper’s tone is a little softer.</p><p class="calibre2">Damage caused by monsters is probably a serious problem in this village.</p>
