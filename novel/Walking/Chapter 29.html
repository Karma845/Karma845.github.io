<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 29 &ndash; Magic Energy Detection</h1><p class="calibre2">It’s the day after the picking quest.</p><p class="calibre2">I just finished a delivery quest, so I go back to the inn, and dive on the bed.</p><p class="calibre2">My head hurts. It’s throbbing, so I use Water Magic to dampen a towel and place it on my forehead. It probably doesn’t do much, but at least it feels like the pain is getting better.</p><p class="calibre2">This is what I get for having Presence Detection on without ever turning it off. I figured I was pushing myself too much, but I wanted to raise its proficiency.</p><p class="calibre2">Proficiency of Presence Detection is increased by sensing presences. The more I sense, the faster it grows. It grows even faster if I focus the sensitivity on a target.</p><p class="calibre2">But this time I went over the limit and spent all my SP, and my body is feeling the recoil. That’s the state I’m in now. I didn’t know about it at the time, but apparently this could’ve been avoided if I drank stamina potions.</p><p class="calibre2">I lay down for a while and compose my breathing, as the headache slowly gets better.</p><p class="calibre2">After taking a sip of water, I check my skills.</p><p class="calibre2">“Presence Detection LvMAX.”</p><p class="calibre2">I finally raised it to the limit. I’m guessing other skills are also capped at level ten.</p><p class="calibre2">My breathing is in order, so I try activating Presence Detection. There’s a distinction between stronger and lighter reactions.</p><p class="calibre2">Do the lighter reactions come from people with the Presence Concealment skill? That’s hard to check from here. I need to check with my own eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">And then I notice a skill I haven’t seen before.</p><p class="calibre2">New</p><p class="calibre2">‘Magic Energy Detection’</p><p class="calibre2">It’s what it sounds like, a skill to detect a target’s magic energy. How does it differ from Presence Detection? All I know is that since it appeared when I maxed out Presence Detection, it must be related to searching for enemies too.</p><p class="calibre2">I haven’t been using skill points, so I have a few saved up. I want to say it will have some sort of use, but… I need two skill points to learn it.</p><p class="calibre2">In the end, I decide to invest those points in learning Magic Energy Detection.</p><p class="calibre2">I try using it right away, and get a reaction. Since it’s so low leveled, the effective area is pretty small. It only extends around this inn, but I can see bigger and smaller reactions.</p><p class="calibre2">Is it just a skill to check the amount of magic energy? If it is, I feel like Presence Detection would be enough. Did I mess up…</p><p class="calibre2">No no. It’s too early to jump to conclusions. I need to actually test it and raise its level.</p><p class="calibre2">I check my jobs while I’m at it, and see a new one, Scout. I’m guessing it would revise the values of enemy detection skills. I’m going to be working alone a lot for a while, so maybe I’ll change jobs.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, you’re looking better. Are you feeling all right?”</p><p class="calibre2">The innkeeper lady says when I enter the dining hall.</p><p class="calibre2">She knew? Did I look that bad? I guess I probably did.</p><p class="calibre2">“I think I’ve been working too much. I’m thinking of taking it easy today.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You adventurers sure are busy bees. The others haven’t come back from their hunt either. It’s really hurting business.”</p><p class="calibre2">She leaves after saying something I don’t know is a joke or completely serious.</p><p class="calibre2">She’s talking about the ones that went out to hunt orcs. I heard that the chivalric order is leaving today, and taking potions with them.</p><p class="calibre2">Maybe I’ll go watch.</p><p class="calibre2">I eat and head to the gate. There are a lot of people here.</p><p class="calibre2">Everyone’s eyes are fixated on the knights wearing the same equipment and not moving a muscle.</p><p class="calibre2">The person I assume is their commander gives the order, and the knights and wagons head out.</p><p class="calibre2">There are probably about two hundred people there. The noise they make when they all move out at once feels like an earthquake, although that’s quickly drowned out by cheers.</p><p class="calibre2">The uproar continues for a while, until the knights are out of our sight and everyone disperses.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, a horsebus enters the city.</p><p class="calibre2">I stare at it, and see a face I recognize.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, Sora. Thanks for coming to greet me here.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, Gob…”</p><p class="calibre2">I say without thinking, and he comes close very quickly. I don’t want a close-up of a rugged old man.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…It’s been a while, Siphon.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ou, you look well. We just passed by a bunch of knights. What’s happening?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You’ll learn more about it in the guild, but it’s a unit to go hunt orcs.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Orcs? I feel like a whole lot of people just left.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Apparently there are a lot of them, and even a superior species. A lot of adventurers went too, and the inn I’m staying in is almost empty.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Isn’t that lucky? Aren’t you going?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, one of the conditions is prior experience fighting orcs. Ah, and they’re in the direction of the capital, so travel there is suspended.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Seriously? I guess we should go visit the guild.”</p><p class="calibre2">Goblin’s Grief all gather again and head on to the guild.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t follow them, and instead walk around. I mostly look around stalls and the local delicacies. Not everything is good, but it’s not bad at all.</p><p class="calibre2">After I finish eating, I go to a weapons store to ask to do maintenance on my equipment, and continue walking around while checking the prices of ore. I feel like tools in general are slowly getting more expensive, probably because the road to the capital is blocked. Potions have gone up twenty percent too.</p><p class="calibre2">“Orcs…”</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve never actually seen one. Unlike goblins, they’re about two meters tall, and while they’re muscular, they’re also agile. Their skin is tough, and a dull weapon isn’t going to put a scratch on them.</p><p class="calibre2">I want to avoid danger, but part of me also wants to fight. To be more precise, I want to know if I can defeat one…</p>
