<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 36 &ndash; Hunting quest &ndash; Part five</h1><p class="calibre2">The noise stops, and it’s completely quiet. The angry yells, roars, and footsteps are completely gone.</p><p class="calibre2">The orcs all look at their fellow orc on the ground with surprised expressions.</p><p class="calibre2">It feels like time has stopped, and I don’t let this chance get away.</p><p class="calibre2">I get close to one of the baffled orcs without making a sound, and plunge my sword into it.</p><p class="calibre2">This attack from the back with my full weight behind it breaks the orc’s skin, rips its flesh, and pierces through its body.</p><p class="calibre2">It screams, and the eyes that were on the fallen orc turn this way.</p><p class="calibre2">I quickly pull my sword and get away.</p><p class="calibre2">The orc’s body is now supported by nothing, and gravity takes over as it sends it crashing to the ground. That’s two down.</p><p class="calibre2">The scornful attitude of the orcs, like they were ridiculing and harassing something weaker, is gone completely.</p><p class="calibre2">Now they look like they’re ready to fight.</p><p class="calibre2">They drop their stances and ready their weapons. The three orcs keep some distance between each other, so as not to get in each other’s way when they swing at their prey.</p><p class="calibre2">This is where it really starts.</p><p class="calibre2">As I face them, I start thinking. They’re going to be waiting for the move I already used, so I have to pick the right time to use it.</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t get cocky. The difference in numbers is a threat in itself, and the longer this battle drags on, the more the gap in our stamina is going to matter, so I need to keep this short. I can only win a pure physical contest when it comes to walking.</p><p class="calibre2">I use Parallel Thinking to gather my thoughts and ready a spell, a fire spell.</p><p class="calibre2">The remaining orcs are holding a sword, an axe, and a two handed sword. The one holding the axe seems like it would be the easiest to kill. Its handling of its weapon seems a bit slower, and the burden of its weapon makes me want to take it down before the others too.</p><p class="calibre2">I face the one holding a sword and attack. At the same time, I try to move around and use it as a shield to keep the others from attacking. Constantly moving around puts a burden on my stamina, but I have to do it to keep the fight one on one.</p><p class="calibre2">This works for a while, but then the orcs’ movement changes. The other two spread out to the sides, and charge forward.</p><p class="calibre2">I attack the orc in front of me, and could use the momentum of the attack to dodge by its side, but I really don’t think it would let me get away with it.</p><p class="calibre2">However, this is an opportunity. I grab a knife I have on my waist and throw it forward. At the same time, I change direction and run towards the axe wielding orc.</p><p class="calibre2">It stops and gets ready to intercept me, but I raise my sword, and as I get closer, I shoot out my spell.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fire Arrow!”</p><p class="calibre2">The arrow of fire shot out at close range hits the orc right in the face.</p><p class="calibre2">Maybe it’s because its level is too low, or maybe it’s because I’m not used to using it, but it’s not enough to take the orc down.</p><p class="calibre2">But it does succeed in making the orc lose its balance, and I swing down at it with my sword.</p><p class="calibre2">The sword slashes its neck with little resistance. I thought the wound was too shallow, but blood starts gushing, its body shakes, and it falls to the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">I leave it behind me as I turn around and waste no time moving on.</p><p class="calibre2">The orcs just happen to be lined up here, so I close the distance between us, and cross swords with the one in front. It swings down its sword, I ward it off with minimal movements, and use the momentum to use a skill I haven’t had the chance to really use before, Sword Rush.</p><p class="calibre2">This is a sword technique I learned as Sword Master leveled up. It increases the speed of my sword, and more than doubles its power.</p><p class="calibre2">The tip of my sword pierces the orc’s torso and goes in without much resistance.</p><p class="calibre2">The blood stains my robe, and as I swing it off my sword, the skill’s effect runs out. At the same time, I feel like my strength is leaving my body, probably because I used a lot of SP.</p><p class="calibre2">Because of this, I’m slow to react.</p><p class="calibre2">The remaining orc approaches me without me even realizing it, and swings its two handed sword at me with such force that it would destroy even a fellow orc.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t evade in time…</p><p class="calibre2">I use Sword Rush again, although my position means it’s not as fast as before. But that should still mean I’ll just barely make it.</p><p class="calibre2">My sword borrows power from the skill and jumps at the orcs sword, and as they clash violently, the tip of my sword breaks, but I at least succeed in changing its trajectory. The orc’s sword passes by me and sticks to the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">I run away, almost like I’m falling over. My body isn’t moving the way I want it to anymore. I check my status, and see my SP is at zero.</p><p class="calibre2">I face the orc again, as it swings its sword horizontally.</p><p class="calibre2">As I look up at its face, I see it’s smiling, completely confident in its victory.</p><p class="calibre2">I take my gun out of the Item Box, and activate a barrier to protect myself from the incoming slash.</p><p class="calibre2">The barrier manages to deflect the two handed sword, and the orc’s face is painted with shock. Since the shield is transparent, only its user knows it’s there.</p><p class="calibre2">I pull the trigger multiple times, firing every bullet.</p><p class="calibre2">The orc looks like it can’t believe what just happened, and after it slowly falls, it doesn’t move again.</p>
