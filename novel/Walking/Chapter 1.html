<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 1 &ndash; Confirming my current status</h1><p class="calibre2">Before I know it, it’s morning.</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently I fell asleep as I was doing some thinking. I guess the environment change made me more exhausted than I thought.</p><p class="calibre2">I walk to the window, and look at the city again.</p><p class="calibre2">The capital of Elesya spreads out in a circle with its castle in the center. Closer to the middle are many imposing tall buildings, and as we get further from it, the smaller houses stand out.</p><p class="calibre2">I see some clouds slowly floating in the still somewhat dark sky. Last night I looked up and saw two moons, which made me feel like I’m really in another world.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I’m staying in a cheap inn close to the outskirts. It has two floors, and the first floor is a dining room.</p><p class="calibre2">One night is costing me ten bronze coins, breakfast and dinner included. It was originally a bit more, but I got a discount because I paid for ten days straight.</p><p class="calibre2">The owner looked annoyed when I went to pay with a gold coin, but when I told her it was all I had, she gave me the change.</p><p class="calibre2">Some stores don’t like it when people try to pay with gold coins, and I was told that I should have silver coins for stores, and bronze coins or coins with holes in the center for stalls.</p><p class="calibre2">The merchant guild does currency exchange, but there is a handling charge for people not affiliated with it.</p><p class="calibre2">For a second I wondered if two gold coins would be enough to pay for my lodging, but this is a pretty cheap inn.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, it’s good to have money if I’m going to have to live in this world. I never know when I might need something.</p><p class="calibre2">The innkeeper told me there are coins with a hole in the middle, bronze coins, silver coins, gold coins, and platinum coins in this world.</p><p class="calibre2">One bronze coin is worth a hundred coins with a hole.</p><p class="calibre2">One silver coin is worth a hundred bronze coins.</p><p class="calibre2">One gold coin is worth a hundred silver coins.</p><p class="calibre2">One platinum coin is worth a thousand gold coins.</p><p class="calibre2">Platinum coins are used by royalty, nobility, and the richest merchants, and the average person has probably never even seen one.</p><p class="calibre2">I currently have one gold coin and ninety nine silver coins! One gold coin is actually enough for me to live for six months without doing anything. If I don’t waste money of course.</p><p class="calibre2">The innkeeper told me all sorts of things while I ate. One thing particularly important is that I need identification when entering a town.</p><p class="calibre2">Without it, I have to pay every time I go to a new place, and apparently some towns charge a lot.</p><p class="calibre2">The innkeeper had a surprised look on her face when I told her I didn’t know about this.</p><p class="calibre2">She must think it’s strange that I didn’t know, because she figures I must’ve gone through an entrance at some point, if I’m here now.</p><p class="calibre2">“To get identification, you need to join a guild or something.”</p><p class="calibre2">The common one is the adventurer guild. Everyone is accepted as long as they pay, even if they have no special skills.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s also the alchemist guild, chemist guild, merchant guild, mage guild, and more, but they won’t accept people as full-fledged members if they don’t have specific skills.</p><p class="calibre2">I chant status open in my head, and open the status panel.</p><p class="calibre2">After trying some things yesterday, I learned that I don’t have to vocalize that incantation to open it.</p><p class="calibre2">I also walked around town for a bit after coming to the inn, and learned a few things.</p><p class="calibre2">Name &ndash; (Sora Fujimiya ) / Job &ndash; (Jobless) / No Level</p><p class="calibre2">HP &ndash; 40/10 / MP &ndash; 40/10</p><p class="calibre2">Strength…30 (+1) / Stamina…30 (+1) / Agility…30 (+1)</p><p class="calibre2">Magic power…30 (+1) / Dexterity…30 (+1) / Luck…30 (+1)</p><p class="calibre2">Skill &ndash; (Walking lv3) &ndash; Effect &ndash; (User won’t get tired no matter how much they walk) &ndash; (Get one experience point with each step)</p><p class="calibre2">Experience points &ndash; 452/4000</p><p class="calibre2">Skill points &ndash; 2</p><p class="calibre2">Skills learned</p><p class="calibre2">(Appraisal lv2)</p><p class="calibre2">All sorts of things improved. The experience counter is working as described, and the number has been increasing as I walk. When it reaches a certain number, I level up.</p><p class="calibre2">All stats increased by ten when I leveled up, and now it shows (+1). Is that a correction value based on the job? That’s my best guess.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, I can use one skill point to learn the skills in the skill field. I don’t know if I can take these back after I used them, so I learned Appraisal just to check and because it seems useful, and left the rest.</p><p class="calibre2">As for skills I learned, I figure there’s two ways to level them up.</p><p class="calibre2">The first, is to just use skill points. I would have had to use two skill points to bring Appraisal up to level two, and I don’t know if there’s a limit.</p><p class="calibre2">The second, is by increasing proficiency. Proficiency increases as I use the skill, and makes the skill level up when it reaches a certain point.</p><p class="calibre2">I tried leveling up Appraisal like this, and the amount of proficiency it needs also increases with each level up.</p><p class="calibre2">Proficiency didn’t go up when I tried to appraise the same thing multiple times, but it did when I left an hour gap between appraisals.</p><p class="calibre2">Then I checked to see how many skill points it would take to bring it up to level three, since I brought it up to level two with proficiency, and it turns out I need three.</p><p class="calibre2">I guess that means the necessary points are relative to the level.</p><p class="calibre2">But the most notable thing… Is really that I’m jobless.</p><p class="calibre2">When I tried to use Appraisal on my job, it showed me all sorts of jobs I could choose, but they were all gray, just like the skills I haven’t learned, and I can’t pick any of them.</p><p class="calibre2">When I use Appraisal on the gray letters, nothing happens. Is my Appraisal level too low, or is it just that I can’t use Appraisal on them at all?</p><p class="calibre2">It’s too bad, because if I knew what I needed to change jobs, I could learn skills more effectively with that in mind.</p><p class="calibre2">That’s pretty much all I learned yesterday, and now my stomach is growling.</p><p class="calibre2">The sun is rising, and I’m starting to see people walk around on the street.</p></div>
