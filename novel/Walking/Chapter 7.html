<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 7 &ndash; Objective</h1><p class="calibre2">“Thank you for today. Cheers.”</p><p class="calibre2">Says Rurika, and we start eating.</p><p class="calibre2">I haven’t seen any of this stuff, and one bite is enough to surprise me with how good it is.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s simply good. Everything has its own characteristic flavor, and it was clearly made with the enjoyment of the eater in mind.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s good…”</p><p class="calibre2">Those words leak out of my mouth.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s my first time eating something in this world that rivals what I ate in the world I came from.</p><p class="calibre2">At first I eat carefully, but before I know it, I’m wolfing it down.</p><p class="calibre2">I hear laughter, and when I raise my head, I see Chris laughing.</p><p class="calibre2">She undid her twintails, so her hair is flowing down. She looks mature at first glance, but once she starts laughing, she looks young again.</p><p class="calibre2">She notices me looking at her, and flusteredly looks towards Rurika like she’s asking for help.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika starts talking, and she sounds almost exasperated.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m glad you like it. I chose this inn because it’s said to be good even by the standards of the capital. Even though an additional charge must be paid to eat this.”</p><p class="calibre2">It’s probably worth the price, although I’m scared to ask what it is. And I actually wanted to eat more normal food anyway.</p><p class="calibre2">We finish eating, and start chatting.</p><p class="calibre2">First, I hear that they didn’t receive a penalty for failing to complete their honey gathering quest, and then we talk more about their work as adventurers.</p><p class="calibre2">I want to know more about what adventurers do, but I also learn that they came from a different country.</p><p class="calibre2">They were adventurers in their home country until they were promoted to rank D, and then they moved from country to country while accepting escorting quests.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’re from the Republic of Eldo. It was a nice place.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve heard that the Republic of Eldo is a country where humans and demi-humans live together.</p><p class="calibre2">In this world, demi-humans are races like beast people, elves, and dwarves. This really is a fantasy world. Races that were only imaginary where I came from are normal here.</p><p class="calibre2">I haven’t met any yet, but there could be at least one that’s an adventurer.</p><p class="calibre2">There are seven big countries in this world.</p><p class="calibre2">The Borsheil Empire, which touts human supremacy and denounces others as evil.</p><p class="calibre2">The Kingdom of Elesya, where the idea that humans are superior is common.</p><p class="calibre2">The Republic of Eldo, where many races live together.</p><p class="calibre2">The Beast Kingdom of Lath, ruled by the beast people’s king.</p><p class="calibre2">The Holy Kingdom of Frieren, where people worship a goddess.</p><p class="calibre2">The Magic State of Efa, where those who research sorcery gather.</p><p class="calibre2">The Dragon Kingdom of Hafre, a country of people that worship dragons.</p><p class="calibre2">There have been small wars throughout history, but there hadn’t been any major wars between countries in a hundred years.</p><p class="calibre2">But ten years ago, the Borsheil Empire declared war on the Republic of Eldo, and war broke out.</p><p class="calibre2">It wasn’t too large at first, but eventually all seven large countries got involved.</p><p class="calibre2">Attacking countries, defending countries, countries that stuck to neutrality…</p><p class="calibre2">The world was being exhausted, but the war had no end in sight.</p><p class="calibre2">But three years ago, in the Holy Kingdom of Frieren… It started with a holy woman, and then the chief priest received a divine message from the goddess.</p><p class="calibre2">“The demon king has returned. Loved ones, join forces and fight.”</p><p class="calibre2">At first, rulers dismissed this as nonsense, but when well-coordinated monsters started appearing, a ceasefire was called to drive them back.</p><p class="calibre2">They are still coming from a dark forest called demon forest, and attacking nearby kingdoms.</p><p class="calibre2">“Were you born here, Sora? Your equipment is pretty good for a beginner, so were you actually born to a good family?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I came from a place a little far away to make a living as an adventurer. I saved money, learned how to fight, and I want to go around and see the world.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m not really interested in that demon king. It doesn’t even feel real to me, and I have no reason to hate it or anything.</p><p class="calibre2">If I really want to dig for a reason, I guess it’s the demon king’s fault I was summoned to this world. But those people in the castle irritate me the most. I wouldn’t fight even if they begged me.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, it’s not like I don’t want to become powerful in this world.</p><p class="calibre2">I’d be lying if I said I don’t want power. I might actually become powerful one day because of this skill.</p><p class="calibre2">I think part of it is because I want to be better than those people too…</p><p class="calibre2">“See the world… That’s a funny motive.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Is it? I’m pretty serious about it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see I see.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika is staring at me while I talk.</p><p class="calibre2">It feels like she’s sizing me up. Like she’s probing for something.</p><p class="calibre2">“What are you doing tomorrow? I assume you’re going to rest after completing a quest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m probably going to be checking the delivery quests.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Delivery quests? Are you the delivery man people have been talking about?”</p><p class="calibre2">Delivery man?</p><p class="calibre2">I ask her what she means, and apparently adventurers have been talking about this weird person that’s been silently going around doing delivery quests no one wants to do.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s safe here in town, and I’m new here, so I figured it was a good way to remember the streets and paths.”</p><p class="calibre2">Walking around helps me remember where stores are, and remembering paths can be useful if I ever need an escape route.</p><p class="calibre2">“You’ve been doing those hard quests…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Incredible…”</p><p class="calibre2">Their honest praise tickles, but it was partially because of my skill, and also because I wasn’t brave enough to leave the city.</p></div>
