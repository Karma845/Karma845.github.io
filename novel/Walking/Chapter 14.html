I could follow Rurika and Chris, but I learned a few things after raising my Presence Detection level, and I decided that going with them is dangerous.</p><p class="calibre2">But then what should I do? I think about this while checking the skills I can learn.</p><p class="calibre2">Presence Concealment makes it so others can’t detect my presence. Apparently it also depends on their power.</p><p class="calibre2">Alchemy allows me to use materials to create items. Using MP makes the quality of the final product better.</p><p class="calibre2">I think that’s enough for now, but something catches my eye.</p><p class="calibre2">The Cooking skill lets me use materials to make nice food. Is it like an assist feature?</p><p class="calibre2">It won’t be useful in battle, and I don’t know if I can make money with it…</p><p class="calibre2">But, still, however. If I can cook good food and eat it, won’t that lead to an improvement in my life in general?</p><p class="calibre2">I could do a bit of cooking in the other world, but I wasn’t able to do much when I was faced with a wall of ingredients and seasonings. There are a lot of ingredients I don’t know about, and I’m not too knowledgeable about seasonings either.</p><p class="calibre2">After debating it with myself for thirty minutes, I decide to learn the Cooking skill. I’m not going to defeat the demon king anyway, so I might as well make sure I can have a nice life in this world and not die.</p><p class="calibre2">That means I need the appropriate skills for a pleasant life. At least that’s what I tell myself.</p><p class="calibre2">I start thinking that tomorrow I’m going to work hard and walk again, but I end up not accepting any quests in the two days before we leave, and instead buy the remaining things I need, and stay in the inn.</p><p class="calibre2">I feel like it’s a waste to buy medicinal herbs, but I buy them to make potions with alchemy. But in the end, I make potions with low healing power, that say tiny and small recovery.</p><p class="calibre2">I put them away using Storage Magic (which I think I’ll nickname Item Box), and maybe I’ll start selling them eventually. Maybe I can sell them in small villages. But they might not want to pay much, because there’s no way to check for the potions’ quality.</p><p class="calibre2">And in the end, to sell things like potions, I have to register in a guild. But at the very least, I have no intention of doing it in this country.</p><p class="calibre2">To use Presence Concealment, I have to erase my presence by holding my breath, which the skill itself teaches me how to do. If I keep using it, its proficiency will go up. I want to be able to use it naturally, but for now, I can only activate it if I really focus. I’ll have to rely on Parallel Thinking to help me with this one too.</p><p class="calibre2">As for the Cooking skill, I ask the innkeeper to let me use the kitchen, and start testing it.</p><p class="calibre2">At first she watches me from afar, but then she starts teaching me some stuff, and I manage to at least make food that looks presentable.</p><p class="calibre2">But it’s lightly seasoned, and doesn’t taste great.</p><p class="calibre2">Now I have three skill points left.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m thinking it’s also about time I learn a job, and since the Appraisal skill has been leveling up, I’m starting to be able to read what appears when I select a job. I should be able to read everything if I level up a bit more, so I’ll pick a job then.</p><p class="calibre2">I hope I can change jobs after I pick one. If I’m stuck with the first one I pick, I get the feeling I’ll regret it. Actually, is there a temple or something like that in this world where I can change jobs?</p>
