<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 21 &ndash; Goodbye</h1><p class="calibre2">“Good morning. It’s almost time to go, but is everything ready?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Good morning. Unlike you Sora, we have plenty of experience doing this, so we won’t be caught unprepared.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But Rurika, you were up late last night checking everything again and…”</p><p class="calibre2">“He doesn’t need to know that.”</p><p class="calibre2">Both laugh, but it feels a bit forced.</p><p class="calibre2">We eat breakfast like usual, and go back to our rooms. They gather their things and talk to the innkeeper, thanking him for everything and stuff like that.</p><p class="calibre2">I leave with them, and head to where they’re supposed to meet with the others.</p><p class="calibre2">We walk silently. No one opens their mouth, and the atmosphere is kind of heavy. Even Rurika, who is usually very talkative, doesn’t say anything.</p><p class="calibre2">We see some people when we get there. One of the C ranked parties that did the escorting quest with us is here too. One person notices us, raises his hand, and we do the same.</p><p class="calibre2">“Rurika and Chris. This is kind of embarrassing, but thank you for everything. I feel like if I was alone, I’d still be doing delivery quests in the capital. I came this far, saw all sorts of things, and experienced all this thanks to the two of you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“W-what’s that all of a sudden? We managed to go back to when we were just beginners and remember all sorts of things we had forgotten, so it was a win-win.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it was fun. Perhaps inappropriate, but fun.”</p><p class="calibre2">I think the inappropriate part comes from the fact that they feel like teaching me things was a detour that took time away from seriously looking for Sera and Eris, which is what they should be doing.</p><p class="calibre2">They’d probably disagree even if I said that’s not true.</p><p class="calibre2">“This isn’t really a thank you, but I’d be happy if you accepted it.”</p><p class="calibre2">I take out a bracelet and a pendant, and give the bracelet to Rurika, and the pendant to Chris.</p><p class="calibre2">“They don’t have the effect of the spirit amulet, but I’d still like you to keep them. You don’t have to equip them if they’re a bother.”</p><p class="calibre2">Now that I think about it, this is my first time giving a present to a girl. I guess I do have some ulterior motives, and in a way, it’s all shiny metal. Ah, are they going to say no because they’re too heavy?</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Chris goes against my concerns, and bashfully accepts it. She puts it on right away.</p><p class="calibre2">“But why? Are these magic stones? Aren’t they expensive?”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika on the other hand is worried about the cost.</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry about it. I made some money picking medicinal herbs. I hope you take good care of it.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m speaking very quickly, and my heart is pounding fast. My hands are sweaty too. Am I more nervous than I think? I think this contradicts what I said in the beginning, but I’m really not calm.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, thank you. But are you sure you want to give one to me too? You could’ve scored some points if you gave only Chris a present.”</p><p class="calibre2">Says Rurika, seemingly to hide her embarrassment, but without breaking her teasing attitude.</p><p class="calibre2">I say ‘it’s all right’ again.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Are you going to stay in this country for the time being, Sora?”</p><p class="calibre2">“There are still many towns I haven’t visited. For now, I’m planning on going back to the capital, maybe through a different route because that tigerwolf was scary. If that’s the case, I might as well stop by another town.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I get it I get it. Just don’t over-do it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“We will do our best to be able to introduce you to our friends next time we meet.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I’ll look forward to that. And I’m going to continue working as an adventurer, safely and comfortably.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes yes. Don’t over-do it. And don’t work too hard, and don’t forget to rest.”</p><p class="calibre2">It feels like we could talk forever. We never run out of things to say.</p><p class="calibre2">But eventually, the time comes to say goodbye. People board horsebuses one after the other, and when I look around, I see others saying goodbye, and some people getting a pep talk.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well then, I hope to see you soon.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, me too.”</p><p class="calibre2">Both board their horsebus, turn around, and wave.</p><p class="calibre2">I wave back.</p><p class="calibre2">It silently starts moving. They told me they’d reach the Beast Kingdom of Lath in twenty days.</p><p class="calibre2">When will we meet again? I need to take care of all sorts of things, to make sure it’s as soon as possible.</p><p class="calibre2">I watch the caravan until it’s out of my sight, and walk back to the guild.</p>
