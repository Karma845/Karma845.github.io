<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 8 &ndash; Training</h1><p class="calibre2">“It’s probably fate or something that we met, so how about we accept a quest together?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I just became an adventurer, you know? And didn’t you say you’re almost C rank?”</p><p class="calibre2">“We’ll get there once we complete a few more quests. What do you think, Chris?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I think it’s fine.”</p><p class="calibre2">“See? Honestly, the two of us have been completing quests, but it can be a bit tough for two people to handle stuff like what happened today.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m sure there’s plenty of people out there that will join your party.”</p><p class="calibre2">Thinking back, those stares that I got when we entered the guild were all about jealousy.</p><p class="calibre2">“We have been approached, but I didn’t feel the same spark that I feel right now. Not to mention that they all seemed to have ulterior motives, and Chris didn’t feel good about them either.”</p><p class="calibre2">In a way, it can’t be helped. They’re clearly good looking, and after talking to them, it becomes clear that their personalities match their looks.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika is cheerful and easy to talk to, and while Chris isn’t proactive in starting conversations, there’s a strange aura about her that makes me feel at ease just by having her around.</p><p class="calibre2">I might be wrong, because I basically just met them, but that’s how I feel.</p><p class="calibre2">“Also, as your seniors, we can teach you all sorts of things about being an adventurer. And… We can do mock fights to practice fighting. You have a sharp slash, but the way you swung your sword felt off, like the sword was swinging you.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m an amateur when it comes to using a sword. I’m basically using it in a sort of forced way with the skill.</p><p class="calibre2">These conditions seem too good for me. I feel like there has to be a catch.</p><p class="calibre2">But this is also a good chance. I want to know the basics of fighting. I thought about putting out a quest with the guild, but I’d need money for that.</p><p class="calibre2">“All right, I’ll give it a shot. You’re not going to stay in this country forever, are you? Then I’ll be with you for the time being.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, we’re thinking about looking for a nice escorting quest when we reach C rank, and moving. Anyway, give me half your day tomorrow. There’s somewhere I want to go.”</p><p class="calibre2">And so, the plan for tomorrow is to accept delivery quests in the morning, and meet her in the afternoon.</p><p class="calibre2">　◇ ◇ ◇</p><p class="calibre2">I go to the guild early in the morning, and it really is crowded. A lot of people are looking at the quests affixed to the wall, and some are even fighting over specific quests.</p><p class="calibre2">No one’s in front of the delivery quests. I check the details, and take three to the reception. I’m glad it’s not as crowded over here.</p><p class="calibre2">I finish the quests in the morning, just as I expected.</p><p class="calibre2">My Walking skill is level twenty, and I have four spare skill points.</p><p class="calibre2">What should I learn? Healing magic? Offensive magic? I don’t know what kind of magic I can learn, so I should look into it first.</p><p class="calibre2">“Sorry I kept you waiting.”</p><p class="calibre2">I go where we agreed to meet, and Rurika is waiting for me by herself.</p><p class="calibre2">“All right, let’s go. Chris stayed back, because it looks like she’s still tired. She’s not the best at running around like that.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika then takes me to the store where I bought all my equipment.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hello young lady. And the lad that bought all that equipment from me. Is there a problem with anything I sold?”</p><p class="calibre2">“We’re here today because we need weapons for a mock fight. Do you have anything good?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I have swords with busted tips and wooden swords, which one? The wooden swords are cheaper.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Can you adjust the weight? Of course, as a freebie~.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I can’t win against you. A one handed sword and twin swords then?”</p><p class="calibre2">We leave, and head to a training area here in town.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s mostly used by guards, but other people can use it too if there’s room. There’s one in the adventurer guild too, but I guess we would stand out too much there.</p><p class="calibre2">Luckily, there is an open space in the corner, so that’s where we’ll do our mock fighting.</p><p class="calibre2">First, I get a lecture on the basics of how to swing a sword and fight. Then we fight, and she points out what I’m doing wrong, and I repeat while trying to correct it.</p><p class="calibre2">Clashing swords with another person really is better than just doing practice swings. Proficiency increases faster too. One thing that’s particularly good is that when I attack someone instead of just doing practice swings, I have to take my opponent’s movements into consideration, so I’m using my head as well as my body.</p><p class="calibre2">We keep going for a while, and when it’s over, I’m so tired I can’t stand up. Rurika is fine, she’s not even out of breath. Is this because of the experience gap between us?</p><p class="calibre2">We were going at it pretty hard too, so I have a lot of bruises.</p><p class="calibre2">At first, some people looked over here with interest and jealousy, as they saw me training with a girl, but as the exchange of blows intensified, their stares turned into pity.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, you did pretty good for the first day. And don’t forget to carry that with you when you’re going around doing quests. I want to train when you have the time. Ah, but if you don’t want to carry that around, you can use a real sword. Which one do you prefer?”</p><p class="calibre2">A wooden sword, obviously. I’m not brave enough to swing a real sword at another person. A wooden sword can cause a lot of damage too, depending on where it hits, but it still feels completely different.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s go look for a quest tomorrow. I hope there are quests to take down monsters, but if there aren’t we’ll figure something out then.”</p><p class="calibre2">I get up, and use purification magic, both on me and on Rurika.</p><p class="calibre2">At first she’s really happy, and then she sulks because she says it’s not fair that I can use magic.</p></div>
