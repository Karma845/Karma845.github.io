<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 38 &ndash; Chance meeting &ndash; Part two</h1><p class="calibre2">Right away, my focus is drawn completely to this demon, but someone else sees this moment as an opportunity.</p><p class="calibre2">Number Thirteen feels my grip loosening and escapes.</p><p class="calibre2">By the time I notice it’s happening, it’s already too late.</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t help but regret letting him escape, but that problem over there takes precedence.</p><p class="calibre2">I try to act natural as I turn to face them.</p><p class="calibre2">To my left is a demon, and to my right is Number Thirteen. If we drew lines from our positions, they would make a triangle.</p><p class="calibre2">“A slave mask? Humans never change.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon says with cold eyes that look like they’re looking at garbage. Those words make me tremble as they are spat out.</p><p class="calibre2">“But your existence is a bigger problem, isn’t it, otherworlder?”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon’s eyes aren’t moving. It’s not like they’re glaring at me or anything, but those eyes make me shrink back.</p><p class="calibre2">I need to get a grip.</p><p class="calibre2">“How do you know what I am?”</p><p class="calibre2">In a way, isn’t it convenient that an underling of the demon king appeared right in front of me? If we can talk, that is.</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve already heard from people who experienced it first hand just how menacing a demon can be. There’s no way I stand a chance if I were to fight him right now.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmph, I can tell by your skills. Do you understand what that means? Now I will ask a question. What are you doing here?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hunting orcs… And then that attacked me.”</p><p class="calibre2">I say while pointing at Number Thirteen.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hunting? That answer just invites more questions. Is that a reason to leave an otherworlder alone in a place like this?”</p><p class="calibre2">I can tell the demon really doesn’t understand.</p><p class="calibre2">“Why do you feel that way?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Otherworlders are weapons to kill the demon king, correct? I struggle to understand the thought process of today’s kings, if they send one to be wasted in a random place like this. Although I guess that’s convenient for me.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon happily laughs. But wait, do otherworlders have some sort of skill that works well against the demon king?</p><p class="calibre2">To be perfectly honest, I think high ranking adventurers are stronger than me. I don’t think I can even beat C ranked adventurers. Then again, the others probably can.</p><p class="calibre2">“Unfortunately, while I am an otherworlder, I’m so weak that I was discarded the same day I was summoned. Honestly, all I feel is irritation towards those people, and I have no intention of letting them tell me what to do. So if you could just turn a blind eye to me, I’d really appreciate it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…That’s an interesting story, but I’m obviously not going to take it at face value. Humans are a treacherous species that hurt and lie with no issue.”</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t argue with that. It’s the same in this world and mine. Very few people are not selfish and don’t put themselves before others.</p><p class="calibre2">“Aren’t you going to argue?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I think it’s true.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hm… But the best course of action would be to eliminate an uncertain, but dangerous element. Wouldn’t it be best to execute you here?”</p><p class="calibre2">Overwhelming bloodlust is being released.</p><p class="calibre2">I feel like I would pass out if I took it head on, but I manage to just barely brace myself for it.</p><p class="calibre2">But then, something happens that neither I or the demon saw coming.</p><p class="calibre2">Number Thirteen reacts to the bloodlust, and suddenly attacks the demon.</p><p class="calibre2">The demon is taken completely by surprise and attacked from a perfectly blind spot, although I can still see it.</p><p class="calibre2">The timing couldn’t be more perfect, and yet, the attack is blocked with one arm wave without the demon even needing to turn around.</p><p class="calibre2">“First you fight, then you protect? I’m really struggling to understand your actions.”</p><p class="calibre2">Number Thirteen bounces back and flies like a ball.</p><p class="calibre2">He then rolls around on the ground, but immediately gets back up when the momentum dies down.</p><p class="calibre2">“Executing orders. That is to be taken back. Anyone in the way is to be removed.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Can’t you even understand the power of your opponent? You really are nothing more than a doll. I should just break you here.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon has a new target, but I don’t think I can run away.</p><p class="calibre2">If I’m attacked, I’m dead. I would just be slightly prolonging the time until my death.</p><p class="calibre2">I look around, looking for a weapon, and see Number Thirteen’s knife.</p><p class="calibre2">I move when Number Thirteen moves, pick up the knife, and then throw it.</p><p class="calibre2">The knife flies toward Number Thirteen, obstructing his move.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hou? Are you going to get in my way? To help an enemy no less?”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon was definitely headed for the kill. Number Thirteen would certainly be dead right now if I did nothing.</p><p class="calibre2">“I want to ask that person some things if I can. That slave mask for example. Is it possible to liberate someone from that?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmph. What would I gain from that? And you’re both going to die anyway, so what’s the point?”</p><p class="calibre2">There’s no point because we’re going to die?</p><p class="calibre2">I feel like I’m at a crossroads of life, and if I choose the wrong path, there’s no future for me.</p><p class="calibre2">I swallow, and the gulping noise echoes in my head.</p><p class="calibre2">“In this world… No, can you use enslavement magic?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Enslavement magic? No.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But can you use something similar, like something that stops people from betraying you, or causing harm to you?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I do have something like that.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Then…”</p><p class="calibre2">If there’s a chance, I have to grasp it. It’s all over if I die.</p><p class="calibre2">“Put restrictions on me.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon stares at me with probing eyes, and I look straight ahead without averting my eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">Sound stops.</p><p class="calibre2">Time stops.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s a tense air around us.</p><p class="calibre2">Every minute, every second feels long.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t even know how long I wait.</p><p class="calibre2">But eventually the demon’s mouth opens.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Interesting. Why are you willing to go that far?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Because I can’t accept being brought into this weird world and having my life end in such a nonsensical way.”</p><p class="calibre2">No, what I feel now is different from what I felt when I was expelled.</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I want to go around and see this world that’s new to me. Things like the culture and scenery in general of this world are so different from mine’s. And obviously, I just don’t want to die. So if you spare me, I’ll obey you… At least to a certain extent…”</p><p class="calibre2">That’s pretty much how I actually feel. But I want to say no to things I really object if I can. That’s important.</p><p class="calibre2">Those probing eyes are still watching me.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Fine. If you accept a restrictive curse, I will let you live.”</p><p class="calibre2">Is this what they call a deal with the devil?</p>
