                                <div>
                                    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;Are you awake?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>I&rsquo;m cooking in front of a fire, when the girl that has been sleeping all this time starts to squirm and wake up.</p>
                                    <p>She gets up, and suddenly stops. Her eyes are on her hands.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Sorry, but I had to bind them. Do you understand why?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>She tilts her head with sleepy eyes. I don&rsquo;t think she does.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Do you know who you are?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m Number Thirteen. And you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>She seems shaken and bewildered. I&rsquo;m sure her head&rsquo;s in a state of confusion.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Easy. Just tell me what you remember.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;I received orders. Yes, to watch you. And take you with me if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Do you still want to follow those orders?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>She says while meekly hanging her head. She really looks troubled.</p>
                                    <p>If this is acting, she&rsquo;d be a great actress.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about yourself?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;I was picked up. Received training there. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>Then, I hear a cute noise. The nice smell coming from the pot in front of her must be working her appetite.</p>
                                    <p>Yes, this soup turned out pretty good, although that&rsquo;s thanks to orc meat.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll unbind you, so do you promise not to attack?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>She looks at her arms, at the soup, at her arms, at the soup, and then nods.</p>
                                    <p>I pour some soup into a bowl, and remove the binding item with alchemy, before handing the bowl to her.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Eat slowly.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>She nods, and tastes the soup.</p>
                                    <p>Her face is still expressionless, but she doesn&rsquo;t stop eating once she starts. The bowl soon becomes empty, and she looks at me like she wants more. And so, I pour more.</p>
                                    <p>After eating almost everything in the pot, I&rsquo;m guessing her stomach is full, and she starts to doze off.</p>
                                    <p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to be able to talk to her more for now, so I decide to rest for today.</p>
                                    <p>I&rsquo;m tired too, after walking for two days. Not physically, mentally.</p>
                                    <p>I wanted to get away from there as quickly as possible, but I know I pushed myself too much. I rested on the way, but didn&rsquo;t sleep well. Crossing through the forest when I&rsquo;m not used to walking there didn&rsquo;t help.</p>
                                    <p>I check the area around us with Map, lie down, and soon after fall asleep.</p>
                                    <p>　◇ ◇ ◇</p>
                                    <p>I hear a quiet sound, and my sunken consciousness is called back.</p>
                                    <p>My eyes get used to the darkness, and I can more or less see what&rsquo;s around me.</p>
                                    <p>As I try to focus on the sound, I quickly pick up that it&rsquo;s coming from Number Thirteen.</p>
                                    <p>She&rsquo;s writhing with a pained expression on her face.</p>
                                    <p>This didn&rsquo;t happen in the last two days. Did waking up and talking cause some sort of change?</p>
                                    <p>I&rsquo;ve seen scenes on TV where someone is ill and someone else makes them feel better by grabbing their hand. I grab Number Thirteen&rsquo;s hand, while wondering if it will actually do anything.</p>
                                    <p>I&rsquo;m guessing that calmed her down, because she soon starts sleeping quietly again.</p>
                                    <p>So it&rsquo;s actually true? I&rsquo;m kind of impressed, when suddenly I&rsquo;m hugged.</p>
                                    <p>She&rsquo;s not holding me too strongly, and as I look at her peaceful expression, I hesitate to push her away.</p>
                                    <p>Although I&rsquo;d probably be arrested if a police officer happened to see this.</p>
                                    <p>After some internal conflict, I decide to just let her be and rest. I just pray that I don&rsquo;t wake up and find out I&rsquo;ve been stabbed.</p>
                                    <p>　◇ ◇ ◇</p>
                                    <p>After waking up, I see the same expressionless girl.</p>
                                    <p>Our eyes meet when I open mine. That&rsquo;s right, she was holding me. And I&rsquo;m definitely not hugging her back with my arm around her.</p>
                                    <p>I feel kind of awkward, and I decide to make breakfast. Today&rsquo;s is wild herb and wolf meat soup.</p>
                                    <p>I give her some soup too, and she eats without saying anything. Is she just hungry?</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Do you know your name?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Number Thirteen.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;No, your real name.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>She tilts her head.</p>
                                    <p>I guess she doesn&rsquo;t remember it. But I can&rsquo;t call her Number Thirteen in front of other people.</p>
                                    <p>Should I call her by the name I see when I use Appraisal? It didn&rsquo;t work when she had the mask on, but it&rsquo;s a different story now that the mask is gone.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Your name is Hikari. Do you remember being called that?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>She tilts her head again.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;Hikari&hellip; Hikari&hellip; Number Thirteen&hellip; Hikari&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>She whispers it several times, but apparently it doesn&rsquo;t sit well with her.</p>
                                    <p>She was probably called Number Thirteen for a long time. I don&rsquo;t think she has the skills of someone who has only been training for one or two years. I ask her how long she&rsquo;s been doing this, and she says she doesn&rsquo;t remember.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Do you have any objections to being called Hikari?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;Not really. If that is an order, I will follow it.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>So she would probably still follow it if ordered to respond to another name.</p>
                                    <p>My naming sense is about average&hellip; At least I want to think so, but I&rsquo;d rather call her by her original name instead of risk giving her a bad one.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;All right. From now on, you&rsquo;re called Hikari. And call me Sora.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Hikari&hellip; Sora&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>Her reaction is kind of worrying. I can&rsquo;t tell if this is because of the mask, or if her personality was always like this. Maybe it was the environment around her that made her this way.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;I figure you know my circumstances to some extent. Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Yes. Sora came from another world. I&rsquo;ve been watching.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;And you wanted to take me back?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Yes. I was told to bring you back if I decided you were strong.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;I have no intention of going back. Do you still want to take me back, Hikari?&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no good. You need to think for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>I complain while looking directly at her.</p>
                                    <p>It might feel like it&rsquo;s easier to just follow orders, but from now on, she can&rsquo;t just drift along and not think. It&rsquo;s for her sake too.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;Hikari doesn&rsquo;t want to go back. Sora gave Hikari warm meals.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>She whispers after pondering it for a bit.</p>
                                    <p>I won her over with food?</p>
                                    <p>I smile awkwardly, but then I&rsquo;m startled when I look at her.</p>
                                    <p>Tears are streaming down her face. It doesn&rsquo;t look like she realizes she&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
                                    <p>I unconsciously start patting her head.</p>
                                    <p>It looks like she&rsquo;s a bit confused by it, but she closes her eyes a little, and doesn&rsquo;t seem to object to me doing this. The corners of her mouth look like they&rsquo;re twitching.</p>
                                    <p>Do I have one more thing to do now? I guess they say no road is long with good company.</p>
                                    <p>And so, now I have a small traveling companion.</p>
