<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, a white light burned into Eisuke’s retinas, blocking his vision.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He felt as if the world had turned upside down. The stinging pain in his eyes gradually eased, and when he opened his eyelids….</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait… what the hell is thiiiiiiiiiiis…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">What appeared before his eyes was a blue ocean stretching out endlessly. A huge island of floating vegetation. Cities and towns could be seen in many places.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He was thrown head first into the air at an altitude of about 3,000 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, wait, wait, this has got to be a joke, hey…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was forced to parachute, but without a parachute. The force of the wind hitting his whole body felt painful, and the intense feeling of floating tried to dull his consciousness. Gritting his teeth against the fierce gravitational acceleration acting on his body, his eyes were riveted on the unfamiliar landscape of the world before him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The huge continent was not the Japanese archipelago, whichever way you looked at it. The surface of the ocean was getting closer and closer, and the resolution of the view was increasing as if it were a magnified photograph.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Then Eisuke caught his breath and his eyes blinked several times.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What the hell… is that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was a mysterious girl on the beach with a seven-colored holy light radiating from her entire body. With her hands outstretched like a benevolent goddess, and her clear eyes staring at Eisuke, it was as if she was trying to welcome him into her heart as he crashed headlong from the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The distance between her and Eisuke was getting smaller and smaller. After less than a hundred meters, when her silhouette was clearly visible… softly, the acceleration Eisuke had been experiencing was instantly reduced to zero.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-wow…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s body floated as if in weightless space in front of the girl’s eyes, who hugged him tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Finally we meet…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke couldn’t hide his confusion when he was suddenly passionately embraced by a girl he didn’t know. The girl hugging Eisuke’s chest was looking at him with tears at the corners of her eyes. He could only swallow saliva.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/NWMMyFh/000006.png" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">She had long, silky blonde hair that reflected the sunlight like gold dust. Her blue eyes were as clear and beautiful as jewels. Her bare skin was as white as snow, and her body so slender that it looked as if it would break at the slightest touch. Her moist eyes gave off an air of fragile beauty, but the way she smiled softly exuded a touch of elegance. She was a stunningly beautiful girl.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Ah! I-I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to be so rude…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The girl finally realized her bold action and blushed. She hurriedly pulled away from Eisuke with a huff and then cleared her throat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah… I really don’t mind, but first I want to ask you something.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke frowned and asked the puzzled girl.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Where am I?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The girl’s face changed to a serious expression at his words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…This is a different world from the one you used to live in. You could say it’s another world from your point of view.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke swallowed saliva and turned around to take another look at this world.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">The horizon stretched on forever. The sky was clear and blue, with bright white clouds. Two suns peeked out from where he stood. To top it off, in the distant sky, a creature that could only be called a dragon was flying with its wings flapping calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, he didn’t need to check again. Suddenly, he was brought across the sky, had a bird’s eye view of a continent he had never seen before, and… met a beautiful and mysterious girl. With all these elements, there was no room for doubt: This was a different world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is this real?” Eisuke involuntarily mumbled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m Marie… funyu!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In this state of stupefaction, Eisuke pulled the cheeks on both sides of the face of the girl in front of him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hyah, his hihen ha heam.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I see it’s not a dream. So it really is a different world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He-hease, eho hit how!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The girl’s reaction was funny, as she didn’t try to force Eisuke away, and to which he was satisfied and let her go.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whoops, sorry, sorry, I thought I was dreaming.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, don’t you usually check it with your own cheeks?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have a habit of wanting to pull anything that looks soft.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that really a habit? Doing that with people you’ve just met will leave a bad impression on them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m trying to be more honest with myself. Don’t get so upset. Your beautiful blonde hair is going to fall out.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not going to fall out! And this is not the time to do this!” The girl who had been carried away by Eisuke’s lighthearted tone was quick to shake her head. “Well, if I may be so bold, may I ask your name?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, hey, did you just summon a guy whose name you don’t even know?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The girl giggled at Eisuke’s jaw-dropping comment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hahaha… Actually, I know who you are.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s mood changed with the girl’s answer, and he looked at her with a questioning look. She instead answered him in a more serious tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We need you here. You, who have a strength superior to the common people.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…She knew that Eisuke was a person with strength beyond humans.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was not by coincidence or miracle, but Eisuke was summoned with a clear reason that had to do with him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Who are you? Let me hear your name first.” Eisuke’s face took on an amused expression and he asked irreverently. However, his eyes were not smiling at all. They were the eyes of a man who was coldly trying to determine whether she was a friend or an enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, you’re the one who interrupted me by pulling my cheeks when I tried to say my name first…” The girl let out a small sigh, saying resentfully. She bowed reverently and looked up again. In contrast to Eisuke’s dark eyes, her blue eyes were full of expectation and a light that expressed willpower. “I am… Marielle. Marielle Lay Arestina. I am the princess of the Arestina Empire, and… I am the reincarnation of a goddess of this world.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was stunned. This was the first girl he had met since he came to this other world. The person who brought him to this world was the princess of a country, and a reincarnated goddess.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, I’ll leave the details for later…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, wait, wait, are you serious? You’ve got to be kidding me. You can’t ask me not to be curious if you tell me you’re the reincarnation of a goddess.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle tried to move on, but Eisuke couldn’t help but raise his voice at her words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But right now, there’s something more urgent…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My-My lady… guh…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">What emerged from some bushes behind the beach with a rustling sound was a beautiful woman with wounds all over her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Rukino!” Marielle rushed over to her as she saw her collapse on the beach. Eisuke also looked at her in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was a beautiful woman with a dignified face, with a mature and intelligent appearance. Her straight, brown, medium-length hair gave off an air of nobility, and she was much more mature than Eisuke. But more than the visual, Eisuke was glued to the fine sword at her waist.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-42" class="calibre7"></span>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/GRt1J6w/000004.png" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">…A knight. That’s what Eisuke thought as soon as he saw her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I’m sorry…! I’m sorry I lost, to mercenaries…!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-43" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“This is terrible… Wait, I’m going to cast a healing spell on you now…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knight named Rukino had her light medieval noblewoman’s clothes torn, and painful scars like burns peeked out of the holes. Marielle extended her hand towards her, looking as if she was in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that moment, a slight light emanated from Marielle’s small palm, turning Rukino’s wound into beautiful white skin again in a matter of seconds. No trace of the wound remained.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-44" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s magic, isn’t it…? Then this really is a different world…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh…?” Rukino reacted to Eisuke’s surprised murmur. As soon as she saw his face, her eyes widened, “You’re…? So, you’ve successfully performed the summoning, my lady!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes! It’s thanks to Rukino and the others who were able to buy me some time!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle said to Rukino with joy. Eisuke, who didn’t know what was going on, asked the girls with wide-eyed surprise.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-45" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, wait, explain to me first. What’s the situation?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“M-My name is Rukino…! I’m an imperial knight in the service of my lady…! From now on let’s get along… gah…!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Rukino, please rest!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I don’t need such an exaggerated self-introduction at this time! Anyway, let me explain first….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There they are!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The discussion between Eisuke and the others was interrupted by a threatening voice.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-46" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Four strong men came out of the forest. With swords, bows and clubs in their hands, they stood in front of Marielle and Rukino, licking their lips and laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Surrender now, Princess Marielle… or should I say ex-princess?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“P-please stop it now! Why are you doing this…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why? Because of that generous man! Wasn’t it nice of him to hire some thugs like us!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle complained with a saddened face, but the men only raised vulgar voices.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-47" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“But-but, he…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haha, I see. I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle raised her voice in confusion. Because in the middle of the exchange between Marielle and the men, words were heard spoken in a serious voice from her side. At the same time the owner of that voice finished saying those words, he jumped from Marielle’s side at high speed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hyaah!?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-48" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s blonde hair fluttered in the wild wind. She squinted her eyes for a moment and when she could look…</p>
<p class="calibre4">…One of the men was thrown off by a flying kick.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After the unannounced kick came out of nowhere, Eisuke grabbed two of the three remaining men by the head and smashed them into each other’s, then quickly jumped to the side of the remaining man and hurled him like a cannonball towards the other two from before. He then launched a running kick at the three that were piled up. As if they had been hit by a super-heavy object, they were thrown off with great force, rolled and stopped moving. This happened in just three seconds.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-49" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">…In a matter of seconds, Eisuke had subdued the four thugs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He waved his hands in boredom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s done.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh… eh…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle was simply surprised. Since it seemed that Eisuke, who still didn’t know anything about this world, was confused, but still threw kicks and flying kicks without hesitation. And then, he spoke as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know the kind of people you can beat up without mercy or remorse. Like these. They’re a group of four big guys chasing you. Same modus operandi as the yankees. And that’s just what I specialize in.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-50" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Yan, kees…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle tilted her head as the word was unfamiliar to her. She had summoned him without knowing his name. Then of course she wouldn’t know what he did daily. He was fairly well known for being the “Yankee hunter”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, now that there’s nothing to interrupt us, let’s hear the rest of that beautiful story, shall we?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No ‘huh?’. You didn’t bring me here just to beat up these small fries, did you?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-51" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle was speechless as Eisuke shrugged. He easily called the strong thugs that Rukino, Princess Marielle’s knight, had had difficulty fighting, even though they outnumbered him, small fries. He did not mean it as hyperbole, exaggeration, or a facade, as could be seen by the silence of the men lying on the other side.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The reason you summoned me. …Who do you want me to help you defeat? Of course, that’s what I want to hear.” Eisuke smiled sarcastically.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle swallowed.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-52" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">She let out a small sigh and answered in a low tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I’ll tell you the story. Not long ago, a demon king ruled this world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The moment he heard that, Eisuke silently knelt down on the spot and made a pump fist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Um, what are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…As you can see, I’m so excited that I can’t stop shaking…” Eisuke replied to the bewildered Marielle without moving a muscle in his pose.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Well, maybe our concepts of Demon King are different. Here, the Demon King is the worst of the worst, and he sent demons to various places to invade this continent and began a regime of tyranny…”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-53" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, that kind of Demon King I imagined.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What, really!? Then why are you happy?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course I’d be happy! I’m sure he’s the kind of asshole you can punch and no one would complain, in fact, they’d cheer for you! Well, I totally get it! I just have to punch him until I’ve had enough! Otherwise, why would I be brought from another world?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s face tightened as Eisuke approached her with an excited expression on his face.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-54" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Um, no, that’s not…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s okay, no problem! I’ll give that damn bastard a good beating, don’t worry! And where is this Demon King? That way? Is it that way!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“P-Please! You need to calm down! You’re wrong! You’re jumping to conclusions too fast! The Demon King has already been defeated!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?” Eisuke stiffened like a rock.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…No, no way, what about what you just said? All that stuff you said about the Demon King, what was it for?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-55" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I thought to explain it in order! The Demon King has been defeated and sealed a long time ago!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-who was it!? Who would do such a thing without me!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s words grew louder in frustration and surprise. Marielle lowered her eyes a little and answered in a low voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…It was the Heroes.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Heroes?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In this world, there were already people who were summoned from the same world as you to defeat the Demon King, people who have obtained different abilities: Heroes. They joined forces and defeated the Demon King.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-56" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“What was… what you just said…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was mortified, and this time his knees gave way. It was impossible for anyone not to be surprised to hear that the Demon King had already been defeated by the heroes. Marielle smiled bitterly, half amused, and spoke fluently.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I told you I’m the reincarnation of a goddess, didn’t I? When the coming of the Demon King is foretold, according to tradition, the goddess reincarnates through the blood of Arestina’s royal family. Therefore, I was born with the ability to give the divine power of the goddess to those who are qualified to defeat the Demon King. The general term for those who are chosen by that power is ‘Heroes’.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-57" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait a minute, then what’s the reason you summoned me? Don’t tell me you want me to help those Heroes or clean up their mess?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke asked resentfully. Marielle then let her gaze wander.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…No. I want you to stop them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke couldn’t believe his ears. Marielle exhaled sharply and told him:</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The one to stop is the Heroes who defeated the Demon King and took over our country.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-58" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">The young people who were summoned from the same world as Eisuke… the beings called Heroes had taken over this country. Eisuke swallowed unconsciously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Drunk by the immense power they had acquired, after defeating the Demon King, they refused to return to their original world and took over every city in the entire Arestine Empire. …Even the imperial capital where we used to live.”&nbsp; Marielle lowered her eyes and looked at him with a piercing expression. “…Please. We have no choice but to rely on your power that is beyond human. I have already summoned two beings like you, but their abilities were not enough to stand against the immense power of the heroes. But your ability is…”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-59" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hmm?” Eisuke then interrupted Marielle. It was because he heard something she said that didn’t help but cause him surprise. He opened his eyes and asked: “Did you just say that there are two people like me…?!”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-yes. You are the last person I summoned to this world, the third one to be exact.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The last…? The third…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the biggest surprise of the day to Eisuke. It was no wonder. He thought he was the only one.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-60" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“People with abilities beyond human limits, like you, are already fighting for us.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Like me…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A person whose growth rate was abnormal and had no concept of human limits. He was not the only one. They were summoned before him. Eisuke was surprised by this fact.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, this is the worst! Why are we in such a mess?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s because we’ve been summoned to another world.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I know it! That’s why I’m complaining! I don’t know why you keep repeating it…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A complaining voice and an indifferent sounding voice became a duet and echoed in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The forest opened up, and the deep green that blocked the sun’s rays had disappeared, leaving a meadow-like space. Two girls stood there, back-to-back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They were cornered. Men with weapons like swords, bows and other noisy weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…But to say “cornered” was extreme. In fact, it was the men who seemed to be taking all the damage.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“They’re giving us a hard time…! What the hell is wrong with them…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re just high school girls. …Well, the other girls are a little less pretty than us, aren’t they?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…It should only take a minute…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“T-That’s because values vary from person to person, right?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Even if you say ‘right’…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At first glance, the situation appeared to be hopeless. In such a situation, the appearance of the two, who were having a lighthearted exchange without any sense of tension, was just as they said, they were ordinary high school girls wearing a shabby school uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui Koikuzue. A second-year student in high school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The large hoodie she wore with her school uniform, her short haircut, and the headphones she wore around her neck gave her the appearance of a high school girl with the sweetness of a Yamato Nadeshiko<a href="#calibre_link-8" name="_ftnref1" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre1">[1]</a>… but her face was as cold and expressionless as that of a mechanical doll. At best, she was calm and serene, but at worst, she was a short girl with a gloomy impression.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">And then there was Serika Hayami. Also a second-year student in high school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She had a cardigan wrapped around her waist, a scrunchie tied to her arm. Her hair, dyed bright brown, was pulled back in a side ponytail, and if she had to describe herself, in one word, you’d say she was a “modern high school girl”. You might even say she was a “gal<a href="#calibre_link-9" name="_ftnref2" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre1">[2]</a>.” With her well-proportioned style, bright looks and personality, she was a girl with a pop star charm that you could easily imagine at the top of the school society caste.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Kw4PBHN/000002.png" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">Why were such extremely modern girls summoned to this world?</p>
<p class="calibre4">What Yui held with her eyes narrowed emotionlessly was two pistols. She held a pistol in each hand, with a brown barrel that shone with varnish. Serika, also staring with narrowed eyes, was crouched down, throwing her right leg back and her left leg forward. It was her combat stance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The answer is that they were both, according to Serika, a bit different from the concept of “normal” high school girls.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tsk, deyaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A strong man bellowed and rushed towards Yui. In his hand was a real sword, sharp and serious. However, Yui was undeterred and pointed the muzzle of the gun at him. Then, her cold eyes narrowed even more…</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Dang!</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sound of the gunshot roared through the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The bullet she fired was aimed right at the hilt of the sword the man held and ricocheted off it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nna…!? Gah…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Another bullet was fired without delay, aimed at the man’s breastplate. The small piece of metal holding the breastplate came loose. With the barrel of the gun pointed at his chest, which was now empty after losing the breastplate, Yui muttered under her breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…The next shot is going to go into your heart, not a piece of your armor.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui joked with a nonchalant tone, while having airs of being a skilled sniper. …It should be noted that she only started shooting after coming to this world. She had never been in a war zone where bullets were flying, nor did she go through bloody shooting training in her previous world. …But even so, the bullets that came out when she pulled the trigger went precisely where she was aiming. It was hard to believe that she could even shoot in the dark.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wh-why a little girl like you…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Because I’m not an ordinary little girl.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she said this, she turned around quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was another man who looked like he was going to jump at her from the forest behind. As she looked at the man in front of her, he was planning to attack her by surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s useless.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, Yui calmly muttered and stepped back to jump back. Pointing the barrels of her pistols at the man… she pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The bullets hit the man’s thighs with precision. Fresh blood spurted from the wounds like a bottle of champagne on New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ughhhh!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She stared at the man, who was screaming in pain and thrashing around on the floor, and exhaled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you’re going to sneak attack, you should be quieter.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The sound of your breathing, your heart beating nervously. …If I concentrate, I can hear it very loudly.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The man was sweating and his eyes widened in amazement. Needless to say, it was impossible for you to hear the heartbeat of a person who was far away from you. Yet Yui said, as if it was nothing, that she could hear it. She even said it was very loud.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She held the gun and lightly hugged her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…It’s because I’m more sensitive…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…The way you say it can lead to misunderstandings…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…But it’s not badly put…” Yui furrowed her eyebrows slightly at Serika’s response beside her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui was… a girl whose five senses had developed beyond human level.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She could see things the human eye couldn’t, hear things you couldn’t hear, and feel things you couldn’t feel normally. That was why she was no ordinary girl and could shoot accurately without training or a scope.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn them, they’re freaks!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Two men stood side by side, bows at the ready. They quickly pulled the arrows from their waist packs and pulled the strings. The arrows reached Serika like the wind. She clicked her tongue.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Who are you calling a freak?!” Serika said those words and disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two archers were stunned as the arrows they shot pierced the void. A swift wind blew past them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, that’s it, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A voice suddenly rang out; before they knew it, Serika was behind them. In her arms, she held a large number of arrows.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be possible…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The men rushed to check… there was not a single arrow left in their quivers they carried on their waists. She had taken them away. Serika scattered the arrows on the ground in pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Without arrows, you can’t fight anymore, can you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wh-When was it…?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, no, it isn’t when. But this very instant. Didn’t you see how fast I went?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika stuck her tongue out at them mischievously and mocked them. The two men shuddered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika, like Yui, was also a girl who had developed abilities beyond those of a human being in the process of growing up. What pushed her beyond her limits was her agility. She could run as fast as the wind, or even faster, being faster even than sound. It was no longer just high-speed movement, but instantaneous. She could not be called “normal” in any way.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-61" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Unlike fictional heroes, these girls did not acquire this kind of power due to some special event. Yui, in her daily life, listened and watched carefully. Serika was always sweating and running in the playground and on her way to school every day. Without realizing it, they had somehow exceeded human limits in their respective fields. That’s why they were both high school students who were discovered by Marielle and summoned into this world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two exchanged words matter-of-factly as they effortlessly fended off the ruffians who approached them.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-62" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I wonder if they were able to summon the last one correctly.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle’s voice is heard from the other side. Perhaps she is talking to the person she summoned.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see, so we didn’t buy time in vain, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui was shooting and disarming the men, and Serika was giving high-speed spinning kicks to the jaw.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In that case, why don’t we just get it over with and join them?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Yeah, let’s do that.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-63" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">…The only one left was a hooded man with a sword.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two rushed towards him to finish the battle.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hee, Yui and Serika, huh? I didn’t think there was anyone in the same situation as me. They have some pretty interesting skills.” Eisuke tapped his knee, amused as he listened to the details of the girls who, like him, had abilities beyond human.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“At the moment, the girls are fighting bandits and mercenaries in the surrounding area, buying time so we can finish your summoning. I think they should join us soon.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm… Are they strong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course, they are much stronger than most humans. They are strong enough to fight without magic or special weapons.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But they are weaker than the Heroes… Aren’t they?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke pointed out, striking a chord. Otherwise, there would have been no need to summon Eisuke with such zeal. Besides, although Yui and Serika’s abilities might be tremendous as humans, it was doubtful that they could compete with the Heroes who had acquired great power to fight the Demon King. Marielle made a bitter face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be helped. The Heroes are too strong in comparison. …But I think they are fine for now. On the contrary, as long as they don’t face any Heroes, they shouldn’t lose either.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle replied with a calm tone. Eisuke then looked around.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now that I think about it, those yankees from before were after you, weren’t they? I think they said they were hired by someone or something, but who were they referring to?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke asked nonchalantly, and contrary to his nonchalance, Marielle began to speak, her face contorted in anger and pain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…The numerous Heroes we summoned are now calling themselves rulers of cities and towns across the country, behaving authoritatively and imposing selfish systems as they please. In short, they are building their own kingdoms everywhere. …And the one who controls this whole area is Sir Ken, one of the Heroes.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hero Ken. The Japanese-sounding name was proof that he was from the same country as Eisuke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What’s that guy doing in this place?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hunting.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hunting?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke repeated, and Marielle bit her lip in disgust.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This forest and the coast have many natural resources that can only be found here, such as animals and fruits that serve as food, trees and minerals that serve as materials. But Sir Ken has taken the liberty of making this area his territory, and has gathered and hired bandits and thugs from all over the country to live in this area. Then he started attacking people who came to collect resources, calling it ‘hunting’.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle gripped the hem of her dress tightly. Rukino couldn’t stand it either, a blue vein appearing at her temples.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He’s a very despicable kind of Hero. He regards this area as the board of his own game, and takes pleasure in watching from the side as those who enter are attacked by the bandits hiding in the area. Truly, he is an irredeemable outcast.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke frowned. Probably not just him, but all the Heroes had the feeling that they had become all-powerful gods. In a world they controlled, their pawns moved as they pleased. They were intoxicated by the pleasure of playing dirty in their game.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s a nasty son of a bitch. I don’t think I could make friends with the likes of him.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But we’re safe for now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Safe?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino cleared her throat and said confidently. Marielle also nodded her head confidently.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. He doesn’t show off as much as he enjoys watching. At high speed, Lady Serika confirmed an approach from the surrounding forest. The Hero was nowhere to be seen.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And as long as the Hero does not come out, neither Yui nor Serika will be defeated. While they buy time by defeating the bandits, I had to summon you from the other world, and you’re supposed to join them before the Hero appeared. A perfect strategy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke rubbed his chin silently. They would take advantage of his opponent’s taste for watching and create an opening. He had a strange feeling about the perfect strategy Marielle and Rukino were talking about.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…If the jerk doesn’t show himself, where is he then?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? We don’t know…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why should I know that? Serika made a high-speed patrol, and Yui was sure she could spot anyone hiding. If you’re here, it means there are no Heroes around.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hidden…” Eisuke had a bad feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui and Serika were proud of their strength, and after all, he was like that Hero.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, where are those Yui and Serika now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke spun on his heels and asked quietly. Marielle and Rukino looked at each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe this way? I might be wrong, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, well, if you’re wrong here, they’re likely to die.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If we don’t hurry, those girls could be in danger.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke told them bluntly. They were both shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Exactly what I said. What’s with the silly faces? You’re the ones who had been outclassed from the beginning. Those two will definitely fall prey to Hero Ken.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle and Rukino were stunned at Eisuke’s serious words. Rukino cried out in dismay.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you mad!? We already told you that we checked the Hero’s absence! And even if he hid, Yui’s five senses could detect it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right. If there was a suspicious guy hiding in the bushes, they’d certainly notice him.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“‘Hiding’ and ‘lurking’ are not the same thing. His purpose is to have fun, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wha-what do you mean…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No matter how much he liked it, no one would settle for watching things from the side.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Especially if Ken thought what he was doing was a game… he probably wouldn’t be satisfied with just watching. A simple truth that even a child could understand. No one would get satisfaction from watching a game from the side. Everyone would want to participate in the game. This was especially true if it was a more skilled player than the others. What’s more, if the game was a versus game, what was the most fun to do?</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Being smarter and beating your opponent. That’s the most interesting part.” Eisuke said, as if speaking to himself. He pointed at Marielle with his chin. “Hey, Marielle, what would you do if you were a Hero?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How refreshing would it be to beat a bunch of good guys who can’t be beaten by your group of men when they come to your territory?” The smile on Eisuke’s face was that of a con man. Definitely that of an evil person. But that was why he understood what the twisted Hero was thinking. They were of the same ilk. The plans of twisted people could only be read by those who were also twisted. Eisuke raised his index finger. “If I were him, I’d do that. If you’re in the middle of a group of ruffians, or if you’re convinced your opponent is going to win, you catch him off guard and say, ‘Actually, I’m the Hero’.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…At that moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Dogooo!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, the landscape became dazzlingly bright and a tremendous torrent of energy burst forth from the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The three of them staggered. Eisuke went to reflexively help Marielle, who was going to fall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When they turned their eyes toward the direction where the huge torrent had appeared…</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-64" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">…The forest that had existed where the stream of energy had been, had disappeared without a trace. The ground had been furrowed in a semicircle, as if a giant spoon had done it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Haa, looks like that sound and the light that came up proved me right… huh!?” Eisuke let out a laugh and ran towards the place where the light and sound came from. Marielle and Rukino hurried after him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“M-Mr. Eisuke!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hurry! I’ll crush that pretentious Hero!”</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">A tremendous torrent of energy rushed past the two of them, Yui and Serika. Even though it hadn’t reached them, the heat made their skin crawl. A flash of white light tinged their vision and the landscape flickered.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Haa!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A raspy voice filtered from Serika’s throat. The two looked to their side with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…There, as if it had always been, was a wide wasteland of bare brown earth. There was no trace of the meadows or the trees that had been there only seconds before. The immense energy had uprooted all that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aah, did I miss?” The one who said that playfully was one of the last bandits Yui and Serika were to defeat. Particles of light danced in his palm like sparks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He removed the hood he wore and shrugged his shoulders. The man, whose hair color was somewhere between brown and black, was a boy the same age as Yui and Serika.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, you’re pretty quick, aren’t you? If you had reacted a tenth of a second later, you would have been blown to bits.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika felt a shiver run down her spine when he said that so brutally and nonchalantly. He was right. Serika approached at the last moment at high speed, but when she saw him raise his arm opposite to where his sword was, she felt it was a warning and backed away immediately. And as she lifted Yui in her arms, a fierce heat ray burst from the guy’s arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You are…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She gritted her teeth and glared at him. He raised his sword to his shoulder and said to the girls with a generous smile.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…I’m Ken, the strongest of the Heroes who reigns in this world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…A Hero.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In this world where the demon king had been defeated, those currently reigning were the strongest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Moreover, they were the people who betrayed Marielle and could be called the source of all evil.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And although they were the enemies that Yui and Serika should defeat, they were too strong, for they had a power that could blow up a forest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why are you here…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hahaha, yeah! I wanted to see that face! Making stupid people who think they have the upper hand make that face is the best!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When Ken saw the desperation on Yui’s and Serika’s faces, he let out a big, raucous laugh. The two managed to pull themselves together and stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll tell you what, go back to your world. After all, you don’t belong here, do you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is our world now.” Without even listening to Serika’s words, Ken said without hesitation. “It was us, the Heroes, who saved this world that was originally destined to be destroyed by the Demon King. It’s as if we reused the trash that was about to be thrown away. So, what’s wrong with that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two were puzzled by Ken, who was spouting his convenient interpretation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And that other world is not where I’m supposed to be. In that world I’m just an ordinary high school student who can be found anywhere. I have no identity, so to speak. …But in this world, I can do what I really want. I can live here for the rest of my life as Ken the Hero. This ‘Ken’ is the real me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…The real you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui asked in a deadpan tone. Ken answered immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m a predator…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Everyone is afraid of me, and because of that fear, they obey everything I say. The top of the food chain, the strongest. That’s a feeling you would never experience in our original world, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">His thoughts were not those of a Hero, his words were cruel and inhuman. …No, he was a Hero, but now he wasn’t. He was only a tyrant with the power of a Hero. A traitor who rebelled against the empire. An incarnation of evil, mired in greed. The word ‘Hero’ in this world had fallen into such a synonym.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I see, now I get it….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m glad you understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, perfect.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika made an ‘OK’ sign with one hand, and then… her gaze intensified.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re crazy, you know that? Yui!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After saying this, Serika disappeared from the scene. At the same time, Yui silently raised her two pistols and fired them in quick succession. The bullets she fired made a straight trajectory towards Ken’s legs, arms and other parts of his body. However, the bullets were aimed precisely at disparate places.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haa!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ken raised his voice and quickly drew his sword. As soon as several metallic noises were heard, the bullets Yui had fired fell to the ground in a burst of gunpowder. Each of them was cut in half.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Take this!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Serika seized the opportunity to get behind him. With her lithe legs, she unleashed a high kick with great impact. She aimed for his temple. Ken was not yet in a defensive position, as he had blocked Yui’s attack.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Serika’s kick smashed into his head. Even though it was a girl’s kick, it was inevitable that his brain would jolt with such a blow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Or that must have happened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What, did you do something?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…No… it can’t be…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ken turned his attention back to her, not moving an inch. He quickly headbutted the surprised Serika.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gu-Guah…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Serika!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui fired to push Ken away. However, the bullets were cut off after a flash of sword, which he only wielded lightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wow, I can’t believe it. I had heard rumors that Princess Marielle had brought some strange allies, but… you’re quite a formidable force, aren’t you? Although the surprising thing is that you don’t use the princess’s powers. Who are you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh, guh…! I’m just a high school student… Just like you…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika groaned and answered him. Ken exhaled mockingly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Gosu!!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“¿¡Kah, hah…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He kicked Serika in the stomach. She rolled on the ground and cringed on the spot, writhing in extreme pain. It was no wonder. Her body strength was no different from that of normal high school girls.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He, so it hurts. So, you really are high school girls, aren’t you? …Then you and I are different. When we became Heroes, we were given not only the abilities of Heroes, but also a strong body that couldn’t be hurt by ordinary things. In addition to that, we also have this kind of thing…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ken swung his sword from side to side. What was produced was a vacuum blade that compressed the atmosphere, like a <em class="calibre8">kamaitachi</em><a href="#calibre_link-29" name="_ftnref1" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre1">[1]</a>. Serika bit her lips and endured the pain in her abdomen, and moved instantly, holding Yui by the waist.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">…But it was still a little late. The slash exploded on the ground at her feet, creating an impact as if an explosion had occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kuuh…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The explosion caused Yui and Serika to fall to the ground. Ken stared at them and spoke unhurriedly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have also mastered the Hero’s sword skills. This is also the power Princess Marielle has given us.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What about that princess, didn’t she give them too good a service…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I guess that’s how much they were afraid of the Demon King…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now, I’m going to engrave my name on you too! You’ll tremble with fear just hearing it…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ken took a big leap and approached the two girls. Serika jumped up, pushing Yui as fast as she could. With her sword, Serika deflected the swung sword towards them. However, Ken unleashed a series of slashes in a figure eight, a breathless onslaught. As if to cut off her path of retreat, Serika could only move fast enough to avoid the slashes headed her way.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-65" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“W-Wait… kuh!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui, who was pushed back by Serika, regained her position and readied her pistol. The muzzle of the gun, which was aimed at Ken in profile, burst into a fierce fire. But Ken evaded the shot by throwing his head back, and swung his sword at Yui in a wide arc. But the sword was faster than Yui had imagined. The end of the blade shallowly sliced her upper left arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aah…!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Writhing from the intense pain, Yui dropped her guns. Once again, the strength of their bodies was no different from that of mere humans. If they were cut, it would hurt and their lives would be in danger. …Yui, in particular, had sharper senses than most humans. If her body was injured while fighting with her senses at their peak, the pain received would be twice as intense, and even a slight cut would make her sweat from the intense pain. It was not something a high school girl without any training could easily endure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika didn’t want to miss the opportunity, so she took off ahead of him at high speed. She instantly moved to Ken’s left side. Then she aimed at his hand, which was clutching his sword. She was about to close the distance between her and him at once, but that’s when…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She realized and paled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Something like particles of light was converging in his hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika backed away at high speed. She held Yui, who was unable to move due to the pain, as if she was being kidnapped… at that moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Goooooooooo!</p>
<p class="calibre4">A huge beam of light, a destructive beam, shot out from Ken’s palm and shot past Serika and Yui.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaaah!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-67" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">A tremendous mass of energy struck with a blast, sending the girls flying. The destructive beam burned everything in its path, turning what was left of the forest into another empty clearing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hehe… hahaha! No matter how hard I look at it, it still has tremendous strength! It picks up light and releases it like lightning! Have you seen my strongest ability? This was the one that blew the Demon King’s horns!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika clicked her tongue as she set Yui down on the ground. The place where Yui and Serika had been until a moment ago had been transformed into a miserable scene without a single blade of grass. If they had taken even a little longer to escape, they would have been annihilated without leaving a single speck of dust… The faces of both of them distorted just imagining what could have happened to them.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-68" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s no way we can win against something like that…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two of them, who had so far won by a landslide against the thugs from before, had been completely outclassed. Even if you simply thought about it, the number of cards in their hands was too different. In contrast to the girls who excelled in a single skill, such as shooting or moving at high speed, what the Hero had was a sturdy body, skillful swordplay, and….</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Cheats.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-69" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Yui muttered resentfully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Cheat skills. The strongest power that could easily distort the balance of power in this world, given to the heroes by Marielle to defeat the Demon King. In the first place, there was no way they could take on such a ridiculous thing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Come on, this is ‘hunting’. Talk about the best part of hunting…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ken pointed his right hand at the girls, then pointed his fingertips at Serika’s legs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…A thin beam of heat shot out from his fingertip and shot through Serika’s calf.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-70" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Hi… aaahhhh!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Serika!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The heat ray made a hole in her calf that seemed to have been made as if with a cone, causing blood to pour out of it. Serika screamed, feeling a mixture of heat and pain. Ken let out a squeal of pleasure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s it, that’s it! The best part of the hunt is the moment when the prey lets out a scream! If I had just stood watching from the side, I wouldn’t have been able to hear you scream.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-71" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">It was a very deep wound, deep enough to keep her from moving for quite a while. Yui could only look around. …Meanwhile, Ken approached Serika.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, no, what are you…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve had enough of the women of this place… In my previous world, I never found uniforms so arousing…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Serika…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui gritted her teeth and raised her gun, but Ken pointed his palm at her. Yui was frightened. …Because that palm shot out a beam of light that erased everything.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-72" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Stay where you are. Can’t you see I’m in the middle of a good time? And your bullets won’t hurt me anyway.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kuh…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It would be a shame to make you take it all away. I’ll let you keep at least half of it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ken began to roll up the hem of Serika’s shirt. Her thin white skin, the small dimple in her abdomen that was her navel were exposed. Serika’s voice contained hatred and reluctance.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-73" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“No, you are… a criminal!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haha! A criminal? Don’t be silly. A criminal is one who breaks the law. …And in this world, we are the law.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ken was taking off Serika’s clothes with a feverish expression on his face. Serika, who was supposed to have superhuman strength, had lost her will to fight and her eyes were contracted with fear. There were even tears at the corners of her eyes. When her underwear was finally exposed, she let out an inarticulate, helpless cry.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-74" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“No, stop…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…At that moment…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeey…!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the roar shook the air, Ken was punched.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gah…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A fist slammed into Ken’s cheek, sending him flying sideways for nearly a hundred meters. The impact erupted in a furious whirlwind, causing Yui and Serika’s bangs and clothes to shake violently.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaah!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-75" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“W-wha-what’s wrong…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Yui and Serika asked and covered themselves from the explosion that hit their cheeks…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…It’s about time, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A cheerful and optimistic voice reached their ears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui and Serika’s eyes widened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What they saw in their vision, instead of Ken, was…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m the last one to arrive.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the back of a black-haired boy with a denim jacket flapping in the wind.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">As soon as Eisuke felt the Hero, he jumped up and threw the first punch of the match. He looked at his right fist, which had the feeling of the punch, and felt the euphoria in his chest increase even more.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“That was a good punch, wasn’t it…!” It had been a long time since he had hit with such strength…</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Hero who was thrown through the air and a high school boy who suddenly appeared. While Yui and Serika were stunned at the scene, Eisuke raised his hand in a friendly manner.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, that was close, partners.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, partner…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, that hooded one over there is Yui, and the one crying here is Serika…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I’m not crying! It’s just a sneeze! The sneeze did this!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That jerk let his guard down too much in this situation… Well, you didn’t expect to find someone as inadvertently superhuman as me, did you? I’m glad to meet you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke calmly displayed his carefree and tension-free attitude. The two looked at each other at the sudden turn of events and muttered in a dazed tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, you…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Lady Yui, Lady Serika! Are you all right!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When they saw Marielle and Rukino, who had arrived late to meet them, a look of relief finally appeared on Yui and Serika’s faces.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle, and Rukino too…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re safe now! We’ve summoned the last one!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika and Yui’s eyes were wide open. In the back of their minds still burned the image of Eisuke easily beating the immovable Ken.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He’s… well…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, right, I haven’t introduced myself yet, have I? I’m…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When a figure appeared, Eisuke cut off his words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Ken, who had flown out, instantly approached him and swung his sword at Eisuke in a surprise attack.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Blood drained from everyone’s faces. In a surprise attack from behind, Eisuke was stabbed in the back. Or so everyone thought instantly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…But everyone blinked and felt weirded out by the scene. Eisuke, who was supposed to have been attacked by surprise from behind, had his back to Marielle and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What… what is this…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Moreover, it was Ken, who had supposedly finished off Eisuke in such a despicable manner, who raised his voice in annoyance. Then, finally, everyone present saw the actual scene.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Eisuke had caught Ken’s sharp sword head-on with his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, come on, don’t be hasty. I’m trying to enjoy this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The edges of Eisuke’s mouth curled up as he had caught the sharp sword with his forearm without moving an inch.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What, why… the sword… won’t move…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ken muttered with trembling lips, his face turned pale. It was a scene that made no sense at all. Even though Eisuke’s forearm was hit head-on by an edged weapon wielded with full force, he didn’t bleed and there wasn’t even a cut. The feeling in Ken’s arm was like having foolishly tried to cut a diamond. It was not at all the feeling he had when cutting humans.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke, whose arms were as hard as diamond, answered without difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right, my body is super strong from training.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haa?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the moment of silence that followed, a rampant spinning kick delivered by Eisuke impacted Ken’s side. The kick shattered the atmosphere and made an explosion sound. It was a blow of such absurd power that it could hardly be considered as coming from a human leg. Ken was thrown off as if he had been hit by a car and slammed his back against a large tree nearby. As Serika watched in amazement as Ken was dragged along the ground and groaned, she thought to herself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wh-why…? But my kick didn’t work at all?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I told you. It’s because I’m more than human.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke let out a fierce laugh and adjusted his denim jacket by holding the front hem.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My name is Eisuke Tsurugi. I’m just a high school boy who got too strong.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle recited his name in a daze.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mr. Eisuke… Tsurugi…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll take care of the rest. You’re all in my way, so back off.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke said in a reproachful tone. The others could only stare at his back, dumbfounded. Eisuke approached the staggering Ken and cracked his knuckles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What the hell are you…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m the new guy summoned as the ladies’ bodyguard. I’ve heard a lot about you. So, you’re pretty strong, huh? Was that destroyer beam I saw earlier your doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke asked Ken in a somewhat animated voice. Ken replied in a slurred voice, trying hard not to let himself be pressured.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Th-That’s right! So, if you fight me…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hehe, hahaha! I see, I see, if that’s true, then it’s confirmed!” Eisuke interrupted Ken to laugh laud. His mood was more euphoric than ever. …After all, the being he had been searching for for so long was now in front of him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">An existence that could stand when he went all out. An existence that could compete with his excessively strong self. An existence that he could never have found in that dull, cramped, depressing world. At last, he had found it.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">And what to say: to fight with him, who had a power of divine degree, with all his might was the mission that Eisuke was entrusted with in this world. Eisuke’s feelings in such a situation could be expressed in a single sentence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“To say the least… this is most amusing!” Eisuke let out a small tremor of joy, like a warrior. With a fierce grin, he flexed his fingers at Ken in an attempt to provoke him. “Come, come, great Hero who saved the world. Fight me with all the strength you can muster, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He said arrogantly and adopted a fighting pose. His fearless and imposing appearance was intimidating in itself. Ken clicked his tongue and gripped the hilt angrily, defeating this intimidation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t be sorry then!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Saying that, Ken took a big swing with his silver sword. The crescent-shaped slashing blade that emerged from it attacked Eisuke, tearing up the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Eisuke stared at the approaching blade and did not move a muscle. Instead, he calmly clenched his right arm. As he did so, he glanced sideways at his fist and lifted the corner of his mouth in a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s it…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With all his strength, the blade delivered a slash….</p>
<p class="calibre4">…It was a vacuum blade that cut through everything. A fist of flesh would end up cut in half, arm and all, as expected.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haaa!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Who did that surprised voice belong to? Was it Hero Ken’s? Marielle’s or Rukino’s? Yui’s or Serika’s…? …No, all of them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s fist erased the blade without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no other way to describe it. The sharp vacuum blade dissipated and disappeared as it was crushed by Eisuke’s strong fist. He punched the air away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Th-that’s impossible…!? Wh-what the hell is that power…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ken’s face paled. Instead of answering, Eisuke twisted the edges of his mouth and jumped like a spring. As he approached, Ken lost his composure and brandished his greatsword in desperation. The blade released another slash, but Eisuke pushed it away with a mere backward fist.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Raah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He lunged at Ken’s opening and delivered a powerful blow to his chest. A stormy updraft swirled around Eisuke’s arm, hurling Ken skyward at a furious pace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gaha…!?” Ken was hit with the strike with great force, and was sent spinning several tens of meters in the air, “Bullshit…! So… how about this…!” Ken threw down his sword and raised his palm in the air. Particles of light converged in his palm.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-76" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“He’s going to blow up the whole forest…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With a snap, his hand shot out a flash of light. And then, a huge torrent of energy that defied the laws of physics; a non-standard technique called destroyer beam, was fired to destroy Eisuke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha, that’s ridiculous!” However, even that desperate attack was repulsed by him. Eisuke jumped up giving a roar. …And kicked the destroyer beam, cutting it in half. The beam, which split in two, burst out a different direction than the original one, ripped the earth from that place with a bang.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-77" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Whaaaaaat!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Once again, a stupefied voice came from everyone present. It was a scene bordering on absurdity. Eisuke had cut the destroyer beam that had attacked him in half with a kick accompanied by an explosion, changing its trajectory.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wha-what…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ken was so surprised that any other action left his mind. Eisuke laughed and walked over to him. The leg he kicked the light beam with was bare with burnt pants… but there was only a slight red burn mark.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-78" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“M-My Hero powers, why…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s simple! It’s just that your precious cheating ability was no match for my overtrained body!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">What Eisuke said was ridiculous, but at the same time, he stated a simple and clear fact. Indeed, that was true. The pride of having his strong body that could withstand ordinary blows just because he was a Hero, his sword skill that could cut bullets, and even the cheat skills given by the Goddess… all of it was far from reaching Eisuke, who had trained his muscles beyond human limits. That was all he was saying.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-79" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Then it’s time for you… for you to fuck off!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Hero began to fall. Eisuke lunged toward him. The moment they crossed each other in mid-air…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Take thiiiiis!” Eisuke turned his body and drove a right hook into the hero’s chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was an overwhelming blow that even made him reach the atmosphere and caused a shockwave. Ken couldn’t even scream and fell head first with the speed of a meteorite.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Bagaaaaaanngggg!</p>
<p class="calibre4">With an earth-shaking roar, a cloud of dust rose up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When the dust cloud cleared… there were concentric cracks in the ground, and in the center of them was Ken’s unconscious figure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke landed in front of Marielle and the others. He looked down at his attire again and frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Crap, my pants are ruined. Well, I guess that’s how strong that attack was. Hey, are any of you guys good at sewing? It would be awesome if you could fix them for me, I love these.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-81" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“More importantly, I think that burn must hurt like hell?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, no, that’s not what you should be retorting him. You kicked a beam of light that blew up a whole forest before, so why did you just get burned like you got boiling water on you…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s because I’ve been working out to kick the crap out of yankees and troublemakers.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know if that’s something you can achieve with just exercise…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">No one could punchline him anymore. The difference between the tremendous power he had just displayed and the lighthearted and well-mannered Eisuke made all the women not know what to say to him. In the midst of it all, Yui muttered to herself.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-82" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Yankees…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…? Yui?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…No, it’s nothing…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke turned his attention to Marielle. She gasped at the fierce and fearless look that made him feel even more powerful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…She couldn’t believe it…!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle forgot to even blink as she stared at Eisuke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Besides Yui and Serika, there was another person who surpassed an ordinary human. Knowing this, Marielle summoned Eisuke to this world. She understood that he had effective power against Heroes.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-83" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">However, her comprehension was nowhere near knowing this level.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A body so hard that not even a sword could penetrate, and limbs so strong that they could create a storm with a single blow. And the audacity and courage to even show a smile and challenge a Hero who was known to be the strongest. In every way, he was no ordinary person.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…That made her wonder if she had summoned the most extraordinary person of all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She couldn’t help but, with tremendous astonishment… her expectations shot sky high.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-84" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…lady! My lady! You must send him back now!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Eh?! Yo-You’re right!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle was startled by Rukino’s voice urging her on. She walked over to the crater area where Ken lay.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh, gu…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Sir Ken. I’ll return you to your world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle looked at him and held out her hands to him. When Ken awoke, he felt instantly troubled, as if his previous state had been a lie.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-85" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Wa-Wait! You can take away my abilities, but this world is so much more wonderful than the other! Let me be reborn in this world, please!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle made a worried face as Ken began to get down on his knees.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Indeed, I summoned you for my own selfish reasons. Yet, you have defeated the evil Demon King. For that, I am very grateful.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But you desecrated this ‘wonderful world’.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-86" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Ken complained. Marielle denounced him with a more intense look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You used the power I gave you to defeat the Demon King, invaded many places and injured many people. …I, as the person who must bear the responsibility of this country, prioritize my duty to protect this country and its people over my duty to you. Even though you are the heroes who saved the world, I cannot forgive you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s honest eyes said Ken had no more words to say.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-87" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“The world you are supposed to live in is not this one. With the pride of having defeated the Demon King in your heart, go to that other world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But it’s okay, isn’t it? If you think it’s okay, leave this guy in this world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When Eisuke suddenly interrupted, Marielle looked like a pigeon that had been shot to death. Rukino shoved Eisuke in the side and admonished him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He-Hey, don’t interrupt her! Why don’t you just listen quietly to what my lady has to say!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I was so far away that I could barely hear her. I only heard the part about a new era.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I at no time heard her say anything like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika shot a sidelong glance at Eisuke, who was making a silly joke. He ignored her accusations and crouched down to Ken.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There is a saying in our world.” Eisuke raised his index finger and showed it to Ken with a serious look. “Don’t be a wimp.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, that’s not true.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-89" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“If you want to stay in this world, I won’t stop you. You can even keep the cheats, for all I care. But if you do, I’ll fight you as often as I can. Even if you don’t like it, even if you run away, I will find you and beat you even more than I did today. You are weaker than I am, so I will not allow you to respond to me in a way that does not please me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke smiled grimly and pinched the bridge of Ken’s nose with his finger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you want to stay in this world, there’s only one way. The only way is to become stronger than me. Now, choose for yourself. You can live an ordinary life in the other world, or you can spend the rest of your life with me in this one.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-90" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">No matter how he looked at it, he had only one choice. Ken, who had been defeated by a being bordering on the ridiculous that he couldn’t beat even with the ability to blow up an entire forest, no longer felt like fighting. All he felt now was fear of Eisuke’s unknown power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not going to fight someone like you again, you son of a bitch!” He replied in a trembling voice, trying his best. Oddly enough, he would be unable to forget Eisuke for the rest of his life due to the fear he had expressed out loud.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-91" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Then I will return you to your world.” Marielle announced, and raised her hand again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Her body was enveloped in a holy light. Pale light particles of seven colors emerged from everywhere, and soon a geometric magic circle appeared at Ken’s feet. Marielle’s blonde hair glowed as if alive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With closed eyes and a dazzling aura that seemed to burn the eyes, the woman was a goddess.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“May the goddess bless you in your future life.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After receiving Marielle’s parting words, Ken was enveloped in a dazzling light and disappeared.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">Fireflies flitted in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sun had set and night had fallen in the other world. There were no neon or electric lights like in a city, nothing could be seen, and a jet-black canopy descended… Eisuke’s expectations had been completely wrong.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…The moon, isn’t it very close?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The moon was clearly large and close, so close that even if he stretched out his hands, he could not reach its ends. Its light illuminated the seashore, sparkling as it met the starry sky. Thanks to it, even at night, you could see all around by the clear pale blue glow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If the scenery is so beautiful, it makes me wonder if global warming is really going on.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course not, this is not Earth.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, right, haha, I forgot.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">All the women let out a collective sigh as Eisuke slapped his knee and laughed at Serika’s response.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Right now, the five of them, including Eisuke, were making a fire on the beach where he had landed after being summoned, and were about to spend the night there. Of course, Marielle and the others, who had fled the imperial capital, had nowhere to settle. Naturally, they had to stay out in the open.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Eisuke didn’t seem to mind that, and happily contemplated the night scenery of the other world. …It should be added that it had been less than a day since he had arrived in this other world. Marielle frowned as she looked at Eisuke, who seemed to have become completely accustomed to this world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Mr. Eisuke, would you like me to explain once more the harsh situation we find ourselves in?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? I simply have to eliminate all the bad heroes, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes… no, something like that, but… just said like that it feels kind of incomplete…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle tilted her head somewhat frustrated. It was true that in the end she brought Eisuke into this world in the hopes that he would help her, but she felt he was ignoring too much of the context behind a lot of things. Rukino admonished him as well, holding her hand to her forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Indeed, his power was tremendous. But there are many heroes in this world who are just as bad, if not worse, than the Hero you just met. You have underestimated the situation too much.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That I underestimated the situation? Ha, this is practically heaven!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There can’t possibly be such a dangerous heaven.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika looked at Eisuke, who was getting excited about the existence of the Heroes threatening this world. Eisuke pointed a finger at Marielle with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t you know that being a Hero with cheats is all about romance? What other cheats can they have?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Roman… ce…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m talking about the destruction beam. Being able to shoot a destruction beam is romance material.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s nothing romantic about an attack that’s aimed at you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, the destruction beam itself is romantic.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yui! Why are you nodding? That destruction beam almost killed you, didn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle replied with a bitter smile as she saw how Yui, who was sitting in front of the fire in her gym clothes, agreed with Eisuke’s lighthearted comment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s… I’m sorry. I don’t understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? Those cheat skills, you gave them to all the heroes, didn’t you? What don’t you understand?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke raised an eyebrow questioningly. Marielle put her hands in front of her knees and began to speak softly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…To defeat the Demon King, we needed someone who could wield the divine power capable of destroying demons, that is, my power, the reincarnation of the Goddess. That power is the ‘Seed of Imagination’.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Seed of Imagination…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. When that seed sprouts, it can transform the imagination in the mind of the person in whom it was planted into something real. In the example above, Sir Ken awakened that kind of power because he had previously imagined in his mind that rays of light would come out of his hands.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fuck.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, he had eighth-grade syndrome.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a power that makes the dreams of people with eighth grade syndrome come true. That’s why it’s so romantic. Marielle, why don’t you build a shrine in our world? You could make a fortune.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shri, ne…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My lady, continue. You will not be able to finish the conversation if you continue to be stopped by their interruptions.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle was puzzled by the answer that only the other three could understand, but regained her composure when Rukino, who was rubbing her temples, suggested.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“That Seed of Imagination was the only power that could defeat the Demon King, but there was no one in this world who could use it. Not everyone was so imaginative. That’s why we found people from your world who would be compatible with the Seed of Imagination and summoned them to this one.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke clasped his hands behind his back in understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, imagination is largely cultivated by culture, you know. I don’t know about this world, but our country is full of rotten subcultures. Everyone at some point has thought about what it would be like if they got cheat skills. I’m sure there were a lot of compatible morons.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are all boys like that? It’s disgusting, isn’t it stupid?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not disgusting, and it’s not stupid. I bet you guys have at least once fantasized about blowing up a city full of Christmas spirit with a death ray, right? It’s the same thing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, not at all. What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I have. It happens to me every year.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yui!? Haven’t you been nodding too much to what he says for a while now!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika couldn’t help but reply to Yui, who nodded again with a matter-of-fact tone. Eisuke chuckled and nodded to Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But at this point, I can clearly see that your world has collapsed. You summoned these delusional people and made their fantasies come true, didn’t you? Of course they wouldn’t want to leave for good.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“True, we were too naïve in our thinking… They readily accepted our request to defeat the Demon King. We assumed they were truly righteous heroes, capable of altruistic goodwill. I thought that, if they defeated the Demon King, they would naturally return my lady’s power and return to their world…”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino groaned with regret. There is no such thing as altruistic goodwill, Eisuke thought to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your greatest ally turned on you, betrayed you and became your worst enemy. So you decided to summon new allies to defeat those enemies.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. I’ve given all my power to the Heroes, so I can’t give new powers…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s like algae that have run out of broth.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t use seaweed as a metaphor for my lady!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle smiled at Eisuke’s mockery and continued.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…So I searched for the existence of someone with a power that didn’t depend on me. …To be honest, I was about to give up. There was no way for ordinary people to transcend like that without having the power of a god. At that moment, when I was looking at your world in despair, that’s when I felt the three of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">All three swallowed saliva at the same time. Marielle smiled as if to affirm her amazement at that moment.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-92" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I was very surprised when I discovered that you were using powers that were clearly not those of normal humans in my observations of the world. I’ve already asked Lady Yui and Lady Serika the same question, so this may be a bit repetitive, but… why do you have so much power?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle asked from the bottom of her heart, but Eisuke shrugged his shoulders in response.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you want me to tell you, I don’t know either. I fought a lot, so I trained a lot too and then I found myself in this situation. That’s all I can say.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-93" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, we were just doing normal stuff too, but… being with this guy, it makes you doubt that he was just doing normal stuff…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle could only smile at Serika, who made a suspicious face as she spoke. Eisuke leaned towards her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But, to make a long story short, I can say this for sure…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke smiled at Marielle, who was puzzled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re your last hope, aren’t we?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-94" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle fell silent at Eisuke’s smile. Finally, she pursed her lips and then said earnestly as she exhaled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Indeed. I escaped from the imperial capital and came here to meet you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle took a deep breath and turned her serious gaze to Yui and Serika.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not sure what kind of Seeds of Imagination the Heroes will have germinated, so I don’t have a full understanding of the situation. Although Lady Yui and Lady Serika have powers superior to those of an average human, you are not used to fighting. That means you will be involved in many dangerous situations in the future.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Finally, she cast a glance at Eisuke with her intense blue eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…And you, Mr. Eisuke. I understand that you are tremendously strong. It is very comforting that you have come. …However, Heroes can have even stronger abilities. They can still be dangerous. I believe you will have a particularly heavy burden to bear.” Pushing away her trembling tone with a deep breath, Marielle clenched her fists tightly. Then she stood up and bowed her head, deeply. “But still… I have no choice but to trust you! Please, lend me your help to send the Heroes back to their world!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s bow was so deep, so desperate, so tragic, that when Rukino looked at her out of the corner of her eye she bit her lip.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…From me too, please. Now that the real ruler of this country has come so far to bow down, please give us a positive answer.” Rukino also stood up and bowed deeply beside Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The other three looked at each other and let out a small laugh. The answer was already decided, no matter what they said. The three responded in unison to Marielle, who bowed her head.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sure.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, what do I say, I refuse.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was different. Eisuke was the only one who answered exactly the opposite. Marielle and Rukino were surprised and exclaimed. Serika rushed over to him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“H-Hey, you!? Why!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Didn’t you want to fight, Eisuke?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui also asked Eisuke curiously. Eisuke snorted and crossed his arms behind his head.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I do. I love the idea and I want to fight the stronger ones and kick their asses. But sending them back to their world? That’s too vague. If anything, that would be a pain in the ass.” Eisuke leaned forward. And then he said with a laugh, as if he was a bullying brat proposing a prank. “We’re going to crush all the heroes.” Eisuke pointed his finger arrogantly at Marielle. “I’ll give you a hand until you get your country back in full. It will be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. I’m here for the cheater heroes. I will make sure that all the heroes who betrayed you are punished by me. I bet that will make you feel better later.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">He was too pompous, too sarcastic and… too confident in his smile. Eisuke made that clear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle continued to stare at his smile. She unconsciously felt a surge of excitement in her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle was convinced. After all, she had summoned an extraordinary person. …She knew she had summoned an amazing person, but she had also summoned the strongest ally she could ever hope to have.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hi… gu!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“U…Uwuuaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Immediately, Marielle began to cry, shedding large tears. Eisuke was startled and panicked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, wait, why are you crying!? You should be jumping for joy!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aaaaah, you made a girl cry?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You should be more delicate, Eisuke.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“N-Now it’s my fault!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Look, look, that, that, how bad, how bad, we’ll charge him with the teacher.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-101" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I haven’t heard that in a while! It’s been almost 10 years since the last time!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle cried while Eisuke was completely shocked. Relief softened her heart, which had hardened after being betrayed by the Heroes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…She could trust this person.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Until now, Marielle had been the one to ask the Heroes for help. …But with Eisuke it was the opposite. He reached out to her himself. He would not only fight for her. He understood Marielle’s pain and depression, and said he would fight for her to relieve her pent-up anger. Those words could only be spoken by a person who was going to sincerely support her. …There was no reason not to be happy.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-102" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Serika and Yui also smiled at Marielle, after teasing the desperate Eisuke a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll tell you, even though we were summoned here before, we’re already dependent on him. But I can’t just give up my pride, can I?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Even if I’m not as good as Eisuke, I can still help you. Please trust us too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ugh, guh… Th-Thank you, thank you so much…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle expressed her gratitude to both of them in a voice mixed with sobs. Rukino gently held her slender shoulders.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“What a joy, isn’t it, my lady?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Auuu… Rukino too… Shankiuuuuuuu~~!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, you’re crying in a way unbecoming of a lady of your status! …Guys, really thank you very much.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino said and bowed her head. Eisuke scratched his hair at her mature smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Don’t worry, you don’t have to thank me. It’s just that you and I have the same goal.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-104" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hey, where are you going?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika asked as Eisuke spun on his heels and waved his hand in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to pee, to pee. Do you want to keep me company?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stupid pervert, have some finesse!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke waved his hand while Serika cursed behind his back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What’s wrong with you, Yui?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Serika noticed that Yui was staring blankly at his back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Me too…”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Yui just said that and followed Eisuke from behind. Serika, who was puzzled, couldn’t help but say:</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Eh, are you going to accompany him?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course it wasn’t that. But… then, when Yui stood up, did Serika seem to see that her cheeks were flushed…?</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Eisuke!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the shadow of a rock on the beach, away from Marielle and the others. Yui called out to Eisuke from behind, who was looking up at the night sky there.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“You followed me, didn’t you? What were you going to do if I was really peeing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I heard the sound. If you really were, I was going to leave.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re trying to make it sound like you’re being delicate, but you shouldn’t have tried to listen to someone peeing in the first place.” Eisuke frowned accusingly and then snorted in amusement. “Well, that’s your power, isn’t it? You have sharper senses than normal people, huh? I didn’t think there was anyone else with that kind of ability besides me. I’m surprised.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I’m surprised, too…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke laughed at Yui’s expressionless response.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I never thought we would meet in a place like this. Looks like Marielle is the reincarnation of the Goddess of Love.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hahaha… huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The laughter took a turn and turned into a voice of surprise. Eisuke looked at her face, raising his eyebrows at the mysterious comment. He could see a hint of vermilion in her expressionless cheeks, as if on her face she wore a mask.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…You’re the Yankee Hunter, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hey, so you know?” Eisuke was stunned when Yui told him about his infamous reputation in the other world.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-106" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“As I thought, it was you.” Yui’s mouth relaxed slightly. She approached him gently and tugged on the sleeve of his jacket. Then she looked at Eisuke, who was taller than her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke looked at her suspiciously. It was no wonder. The current expression on Yui’s face wasn’t expressionless, but she had melted eyes, as if she was agitated, and she had a charming, soft smile on her face that he couldn’t help but admire. With thin lips, she whispered:</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-107" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…At last, we meet…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After Marielle, Eisuke received a happy reaction from a girl he didn’t recognize. Eisuke Tsurugi, the brawling student without peer in the world, could only be perplexed by Yui’s “maiden in love” expression.</p>
