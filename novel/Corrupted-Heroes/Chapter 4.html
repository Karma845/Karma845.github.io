<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p class="calibre4">“…Um, Marielle?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The next morning, on the way to the imperial capital after leaving Balletta. Yui approached Marielle. Marielle looked at her inquisitively and smiled warmly.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What happened last night?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle was startled. Her shoulders shook and she immediately turned her face away. Serika approached her, looking amused at her reaction, red to the ears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is it now, Marielle, are you hiding something?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I’m not hiding anything, I swear!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Did something happen with Eisuke?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whaaat!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">What a surprise! Marielle’s shoulders shook with fright. She was a princess who wasn’t very good at hiding her feelings. Yui began to question Marielle with more eagerness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I knew it, I was already suspicious. You’ve been looking at Eisuke’s face out of the corner of your eye.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I haven’t looked at him! At no time did the idea of looking at Mister Eisuke’s face even occur to me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, it’s hurtful when you say it like that.” Eisuke looked sideways at Marielle who was denying everything and groaned. He spoke lazily while scratching his ears. “Don’t get so agitated, Marielle, there’s nothing to hide. Last night, you and I…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whawha!? Are you an idiot, Mister Eisuke, or did your mother drop you when you were little!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle, aren’t you getting more and more foul-mouthed? I’ll bet you’re hanging out with some bad influences.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And those bad influences are you, for sure.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika said to Eisuke in a contemptuous tone. Marielle was fuming with a red face, as she thought she had done something rather daring. Though, in fact, there was nothing to hide anyway. Rukino cleared her throat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Aren’t you a bit agitated? Look straight ahead.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino urged them with a sigh. In front of Eisuke and the others, the imposing walls surrounding the Imperial City cast an intimidating shadow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s the imperial capital. That heart of this country, and serves as the home of my lady and the Imperial Knights… it is our destiny to retake that place, isn’t it? And yet here you are as relaxed as ever… I wish you would get a little more serious.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I am serious. Even for a while now I’ve been pretty excited, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not the same as being serious! You don’t know what kind of powerful abilities this Hero has!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino scolded Eisuke, who was trembling with excitement. Marielle and Rukino escaped to summon Eisuke and the others before the Heroes’ invasion of the capital. As expected, they did not know the details of the Heroes’ cheating abilities. However, Eisuke was excited about this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If they’re the Hero who invaded the heart of this country, you’d expect his abilities to be flashy, evil and ridiculously strong, wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? No, I wouldn’t want to expect that, I’m not an idiot.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What about the ability to blow away clothes? That’s how Eisuke’s clothes ended up in tatters.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Who the hell would want to have that kind of pervert’s luck?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can see that it’s just me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t imagine anyone else!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle laughed at the silly exchange. Who could believe that they were the ones who had been instrumental in defeating three Heroes so far? Yet Marielle had been saved by this cheerful and open attitude. The bitter memories that had haunted her were overwritten by happy memories.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If it was them, they could surely take on the Hero of the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke and the others arrived at the castle gate. At the place, two imperial knights stood guard. Rukino advanced calmly in front of them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Imperial Knight Rukino, I have just returned with Princess Marielle. Open the door.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Rukino plays the superior.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re telling me. I think it’s the only scene where she can be so cool.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Would you guys shut up for a second!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke and Serika teased Rukino for acting superior. But….</p>
<p class="calibre4">“An Imperial Knight…? Who are you again?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knight doorman casually turned Rukino away. Serika and Yui teased her again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wow, how embarrassing, they don’t know you…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s pretty funny, like a celebrity who went to get involved with people who don’t watch TV.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I know you’re making fun of me! Hey, I may not know you directly, but you really don’t know me!? I’m Rukino, the Imperial Knight of the princess!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Princess? I don’t know what you’re talking about, but impersonating an imperial knight is not allowed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-What nonsense! Whatever, forget about me right now! Princess Marielle has returned to the capital! Open the door!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino demanded desperately. Marielle bowed her head towards them, bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Good day, sir knights. I thank you for protecting the Imperial City in my absence.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle turned her princess smile toward them, and at that moment….</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re the rebel Kaito, the Hero, was talking about!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“………Excuse me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The imperial knights became aggressive and drew their swords towards Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Silence! You’re definitely the blonde woman who said she would take revenge on Kaito, the Hero, someday! I’ll capture you right here!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What the…!? Huh…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">No one could understand what was going on. Rukino quickly stood up to protect Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t you know what you’re doing?! The one in front of you is the princess of this country!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There is no such thing in this country!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The imperial knight said without hesitation. Marielle’s throat constricted as if she had been strangled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You are the ones who have rebelled against the king of this country, Kaito, the Hero, even inventing a princess! In the name of the imperial knights, you will be…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">What silenced the men was Eisuke’s painful slap. With a bang, the ferocious force of the slap slammed the imperial knight into the door behind him, sending the wooden door crashing down. Amidst the dust, Eisuke clapped his hands roughly.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s useless to keep talking, they don’t know you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But… that’s…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle bit her lip hard at Eisuke’s open and honest statement. Serika spoke in a serious tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Were they brainwashed too, like they did me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t think so. They seemed to be too aware for that to be the case.” At what Serika said, Eisuke put his finger to his chin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The dust cleared, and what they saw before them was the cityscape of the imperial capital. The city, similar in appearance to a European castle, which had been overrun by the Heroes, but was still beautifully landscaped and without appreciable damage. The citizens passing through the streets, perhaps not as attentive to their personal appearance, were slightly disheveled in their hair and clothes, but showed no signs of fear or disappointment. There was a scene that could be described as quiet peace.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">But…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Isn’t that the rebel…!?” exclaimed one of the citizens. …Pointing to Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey! Call the imperial knights quickly!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Here come the rebels who want to overthrow the Hero!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Everyone’s face turned pale and they fled from Marielle and the others like spiders. Not a single person rejoiced at the triumphant return of the princess. On the contrary…</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-183" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I-It hurts…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle frowned at the sudden pain. …A pebble rolled under her foot. …It was thrown towards her by a small child.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Get out of this city, you villain!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…!?” Marielle’s face contorted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Every person in this town considered Marielle to be a total and absolute enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean…!? Why… my lady…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…It’s obvious why…!” Eisuke said sharply to Rukino, whose lips were trembling, without turning around. “It’s because of that bastard Hero, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before his gaze… was the royal castle, which even had a strange atmosphere.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">While losing the pursuing imperial knights, Eisuke and the others decided to attack the castle immediately. Since all the people in this city regarded Marielle as an enemy, they could not find peace without defeating the Hero. There was no other choice.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke kicked through the door at the other back end of the castle. Amidst the dust, Eisuke’s voice was heard in the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, could the wonderful Hero come out to play…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The dust disappeared and the scenery cleared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a room with a red carpet and luxurious decoration. And the person who was sitting on the throne of that room worthy of a king, was…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“For someone who wants to play, you have pretty bad manners, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A golden armor, dazzling and shining. The haughty and regal demeanor of a man who at no time changed his arrogant tone. His eyes sparkled with amusement, showing no sign of alarm to Eisuke and the others. Even if they didn’t want to admit it, he had the air of a king.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle spoke with trembling lips.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You are…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right. I am the Hero and “king” of this imperial city, Kaito. Is this the first time we’ve met, rebellious girl?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito leaned his cheekbones against his hand and announced himself in a pompous tone. Marielle couldn’t stand such provocation and inquired fiercely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-What have you done with the people of this country, what is your purpose?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Looking up into Marielle’s desperate face, Kaito cracked a small smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“To free them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Free… them?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you talking about, are you crazy?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ignoring Serika’s sullen tone, Kaito slowly rose from his seat and began to speak with the tone of a speech.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I am freeing people from the chains of suffering and giving them what they should have. The root of all human suffering is memory.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Memory…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino raised an eyebrow. Kaito then looked at Marielle and smirked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Princess Marielle, you were the one who had to disappear from his memories.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh……?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Since by your actions summoning the Heroes, they have invaded various parts of this country. After all, it was all your fault, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“………!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s face contorted at Kaito’s words. Rukino raised her voice in fiery fury.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How dare you! You’re the real culprits! You can’t just shift the blame onto us!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That kind of logic won’t work with a crowd. Crowds are the ones who humiliate those who are weaker than they are. They must have developed a hatred for Princess Marielle, because they couldn’t even stand up to me. I freed them from that chain of bad feelings. …Just like I will do now.” He snapped. Kaito snapped his fingers sharply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…At that moment, a huge magic circle unfolded all over the floor of the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t tell me that…!” Eisuke felt his blood run cold. A few moments before he could shout, a crimson light flashed at his feet. He jumped up as fast as he could.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My lady!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? Kyaah…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The moment Rukino shoved Marielle….</p>
<p class="calibre4">Boom! and light exploded all over the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When Marielle fell to the floor, the light had already dimmed. Eisuke, who had jumped, landed on the floor and ran to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you all right, Marielle?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-Yes…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, girls…” Eisuke turned around and was about to call the other three.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Something passed by Eisuke’s side at high speed. With amazing reflexes, he grabbed it and caught it. Feeling the coldness of the metal in the palm of his hand, Eisuke stared at the attacker with a sharp glare.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you doing, Rukino…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">What Eisuke caught in his hand was a sharp rapier.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…The person who aimed at Marielle’s forehead and delivered a merciless thrust was Rukino.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The girl over there is a rebel. If you plan to protect her, I will show no mercy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino looked at Marielle with cold eyes. Marielle despaired at Rukino’s merciless gaze, which she had never seen before. As if to support her, this time the sound of gunshots rang out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke threw down the thin sword with the toe of his foot and kicked the ground, holding Marielle in his arms. A bullet exploded at his feet, sending sparks flying. A shadow took advantage of the gap and approached Eisuke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn it…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A series of kicks was unleashed down like rain. Using all his dynamic vision, Eisuke controlled it with one hand and returned a high kick as a counterattack. The shadow fell backwards significantly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t tell me…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s voice trembled. Eisuke gritted his teeth and glared at the new enemies that appeared before him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He’s a pretty tough opponent, can we handle this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I won’t miss next time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Yui, Serika and Rukino, stood before them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yui, Serika…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? Who are you? Don’t call us by our first names.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t talk to me so casually.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke felt a slight pang of sadness at their unfriendly reaction. The displeased attitude they showed towards Eisuke was not something that could even be called something from a first meeting. They even considered Eisuke as an enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito sat on the throne behind them and rested his cheek on his hand. His sarcastic smile made Eisuke’s blood boil.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your skill… is it “Memory Forgery”?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Memory Forgery. That was the cheating ability Hero Kaito had acquired through the “Seed of Imagination”. It rewrote and implanted specific memories in the target. That is why the people of this country did not forget Marielle, but believed her to be a rebel, and instead worshipped Hero Kaito as their king.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Who knows, will that really be it?” Kaito shrugged his shoulders deliberately. In front of him were Yui, Serika and Rukino, whose memories had been falsified.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’ve got to be kidding me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke raged, with a burst, lunged forward at Kaito’s chest all at once. …But a gust of wind blew through and blocked it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn it…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it against the rules to go after the king first?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika intersected Eisuke with a flying kick. She threw him with her nimble movements and didn’t allow him to get close to Kaito. Eisuke was immediately forced into a defensive stance. Serika’s voice rose in frustration as she let out a kick.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Now what, you’re not attacking because I’m a woman?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You sure are kidding…! Why do I have to fight you over and over again?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh!? What are you talking about!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika’s memories of Marielle had been falsified and she no longer remembered them. And if that was the case, of course, the memories of the last few days she spent with Eisuke would have disappeared as well. He felt more pain in his heart than in his kicked arm.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke looked at Yui out of the corner of his eye. …Yui’s emotionally unreadable eyes and her guns were pointed… mercilessly at Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“F̲u̲c̲k̲, it’s always the same…!” Eisuke quickly turned away from Serika and lunged in a tackle towards Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s scream overlapped with the sound of gunfire. The bullet Yui released hit Eisuke in the back and bruised his skin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ngh…?!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-184" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">The steel body, impervious to blades, was not pierced by the bullet, but it did feel the pain. Marielle covered her mouth as Eisuke gritted his teeth. He stood up straight and glared back at Yui.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I thought I’d hit her. Then, next time I’ll aim for the brain.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was, as always, expressionless and unconcerned. But her face was harsher than usual, stern… full of hostility. The lovesick maiden who had clung so tightly to Eisuke was nowhere to be found. Kaito declared loudly to Eisuke, who gritted his teeth.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-185" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“If you want to defeat me, you must go through them first. But… they are the two I summoned as excellent guards who will protect me even at the cost of their own lives.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Son of a b̲i̲t̲c̲h̲…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s temples ticked. Kaito laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why are you looking at me like that? It’s not me that torments you. It’s the memories in your mind. It’s those memories that keep you from attacking them. You’re tormented by the memory of what you’ve done together. If you want, I can redeem you too…”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-186" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke couldn’t say anything. He could only look at him with bloodshot eyes. …Because what he said was also true. It was true that, if he hadn’t met them, he would have been able to fight without hesitation. But the reason he doubted was… the smiles they had given Eisuke and now it was burned into his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So what would happen?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s simple. She is the devil’s daughter intent on seducing the Heroes of this world and bringing it to its ruin. If she is not stopped, this world and even the world you came from will be conquered. The only one who can stop her… is you.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-187" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…I understand…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I never thought that my power would save the world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">They believed the lies exposed by Kaito and took a fighting stance against Marielle. Eisuke shouted to Rukino, who was standing next to him, looking calm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Rukino! Who was that master of yours that you’ve been calling “my lady” all along?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t play dumb with me, rebel. I’ve never called anyone that.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-188" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Then who have you been working for all these years?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“For King Kaito.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without a second’s hesitation, Rukino answered. Marielle, who was in Eisuke’s arms, had tears in the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Rukino…” Marielle muttered under her breath. The hand holding Eisuke’s arm tightened its grip. At that moment, she began to shake as if she was possessed. “Rukino! Rukino! Ruki… no…! Rukino, Rukino…!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-189" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle cried out repeatedly between sobs. Eisuke bit his lip and put all his strength into his arms to prevent Marielle from running away. He was frustrated by the girls’ coldness towards Marielle’s crying face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, can’t you see what you’re doing? You should see yourselves in a mirror right now!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mirror?? I don’t know what that means.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t go around saying things that I don’t understand.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-190" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…F̲u̲c̲k̲!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke kicked angrily and smashed the wall behind him. The wall, reduced to rubble, raised a cloud of dust that blinded everyone. Eisuke moved sideways with Marielle in his arms. Fortunately, all the windows in the room had been removed and to make a sort of atrium. Eisuke jumped out the window with Marielle in his arms and escaped from the hero.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">Eisuke and Marielle escaped to the castle city of the imperial capital. Eisuke hid behind a house to avoid being discovered by the citizens and catch his breath. Beside him, Marielle held her knees and looked dejected. She looked down with empty eyes, as if she no longer had her soul, and Eisuke spoke to her with bated breath.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Pull yourself together, Marielle. Now that this has happened, we have no choice but to look for a way to restore their memories. There must be some clue. We must look for…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……What if there isn’t?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke lowered his eyebrows at Marielle’s laughing words. Laughing at herself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I give him that power… Do you think it would conveniently have a weakness…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Even if it’s not like that, we can’t do nothing! I can’t… fight Yui and Serika…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke looked away and gritted his teeth. The brainwashing before and this time was different. The girls had had their memories rewritten and recognized Eisuke as an enemy. In contrast, his perception of them had not changed at all. They were still, and always would be, his precious friends.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s also memory that makes you have that look on your face, isn’t it?” Marielle said. She gave a fleeting smile and weakened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Maybe what that jerk says is true. We all have some painful or sad memories. …No, even memories that are pleasant in the moment can become painful to recall later.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Like right now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s mind ran through the memories of the past like flashing lights. The time she bathed with Yui and Serika. The time she got caught up in Serika’s evil plan. The time she and Rukino fled the Imperial Capital. The day she met her. The time when she smiled and greeted the people of this country. All of them were now unraveling with a cracking sound and losing their shape inside her. Marielle gave a forced, fake smile.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-191" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“If you can forget every one of those memories and go on living… I suppose what you’re doing can be called… “salvation”, after all…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Don’t be stupid. You think you’ll be happy if you forget everything? That can’t be true.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course it can’t!” Marielle shouted loudly. “But…! All the people who forgot about me were living normal lives! Lady Yui, Lady Serika… even Rukino…! Even though they forgot me, they didn’t change at all! On the contrary, they were fighting more openly than you, who was fighting to protect me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was speechless. He could not retort anything. He had been more concerned about Yui and Serika’s safety, and they were fighting with all their might against him, who was forced to defend himself to prevent Marielle from being hurt. It was a fact that could not be disguised.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Can you tell me from the bottom of your heart that my presence is not a burden to you? Can you say that you need all the memories you have?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no need to lie. Marielle’s watery eyes were clinging, but they were attractive. …Eisuke kept silent. He stared into her eyes and said nothing.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…I…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Dan, dan!</p>
<p class="calibre4">A thunderous gunshot. Eisuke, with his mouth open, swung his arms quickly. …A bullet rolled out of his hand. The bullet was aimed at the back of his head, and he quickly caught it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I found you…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When they traced the source of the bullet… they found Yui staring at them both with a cold stare. Behind her, the Imperial Knights were lined up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tsk…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke held Marielle in his arms and ran out of the alley.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We won’t let you escape. Please go after them…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui announced in a low voice and fired her guns at Eisuke. He ran out to the main street to continue the fight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s the rebels! Chase them!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The voices of the imperial knights and townspeople could be heard here and there. Eisuke peered into the streets as he passed, but all the houses and stores had their window panes removed without exception, and were closed with plywood and blackout curtains so that the interior could not be seen. It was as if they refused to let them both in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn it…! Is everyone in this town against us? What are we going to do?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mister Eisuke! Please, put me down!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Waah!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle, who was being held by Eisuke in what would be called princess-like carrying, was flailing in his arms. Her eyelids were red and tears were gathering every time she opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t want anyone else to suffer! I’d rather that than be a burden to you…! If my existence is a cause of hatred and suffering, then I don’t want anyone to remember me ever again! kyaah!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The army of imperial knights attacked. Eisuke reached for the weapons where the grip faltered, and intercepted them with his legs alone. Shaken by his movements, Marielle shouted.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I won’t let you escape!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika appeared to block the path in front of Eisuke and Marielle. Eisuke clicked his tongue and fled back into the shadows of the building to get out of sight. A bullet hit him in the shoulder. Eisuke screamed in anguish as the bullet managed to lodge in the crevice of one his muscles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh, gah…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah…! Please put me down now! I don’t want anyone else to suffer, and I don’t want to suffer anymore! You lent me your power because you wanted to fight strong people, didn’t you! You don’t need to feel sorry for me! I’ll be fine, so…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle…!” Eisuke, with sweat on his forehead, uttered in a low voice without looking at her. “Wait, shut up for a second…!” The angry tone of his voice forced Marielle to shut up. Eisuke shouted just for the two of them to hear. “It’s true! If it wasn’t for you, I could fight more freely! If I hadn’t met Yui and Serika, I would have defeated the Hero along with them and it would have been over! To be frank, to me, anyone weaker than me is a burden!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then why…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But also! That burden is what really matters! There’s no point in fighting only against strong people! Only when you fight with a lot of things on your shoulders can you really feel happy after winning! You’re the one who taught me that! Don’t deny your past too!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-192" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…In the past battles, Marielle and the others were not the only ones saved by Eisuke. Before he himself realized it, Marielle and the others had also become his strength.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He had spent all his time fighting for his own thrill and pleasure. He thought that, if he could fight the strongest, if he could fight with all his might, he would be satisfied. That was true.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But fighting Heroes… was not the only thing that gave Eisuke a sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle. Rukino. Yui. Serika. The people of the cities. They were counting on his monstrous power. They looked more pleased with his victory than he did. This began to give him a pleasant satisfaction before he knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…His own desire was also the greatest desire of others. So he exerted his strength. This was the reason why Eisuke now really threw himself into the fight. This was the reason he didn’t want to give up Yui and Serika. And… the irreplaceable reason why he wanted to save Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“These are my memories, memories about the time I spent with you! I won’t get rid of them! No matter how heavy it is, no matter how painful it is, I’ll carry them with all my might! I want that for myself! So shut up and put your hands around my neck, Marielle! I’m going to…!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-193" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">“I said I’ll lend you my strength until you get your country back!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s chest felt full. At that moment, she remembered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…She remembered the moment when Eisuke had refused her request and instead reached out to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The warmth she felt then flooded her eyes with tears. Marielle bit her lip and held them back. Then, she resolved herself and put her hand tightly around Eisuke’s arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I’m sorry, Mister Eisuke…! I’m going to…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s going to have to wait a bit! For now, hold on tight!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke walked out into the main square of the Imperial Capital. The fountain in the center was dry and there wasn’t a drop of water left. They went out there…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it about time we stopped playing tag?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Please surrender…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui and Serika and the Imperial Knights led by them surrounded them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“F̲u̲c̲k̲… they were leading us, weren’t they?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haha, how could you get through the city?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Imperial Knight Army split in half to make way for Hero Kaito who calmly appeared. Rukino was standing next to him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s over. Hand over the rebel girl quietly.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke stared at him. Finally, he exhaled and slowly lowered Marielle to the ground. Marielle looked at him anxiously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mister Eisuke….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke clicked his tongue, then snorted and played hard. He turned his gaze back to Yui and Serika and shrugged with a light tone.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-194" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, hey, Yui, Serika? Don’t make such scary faces. We’ve been fighting together for the past few days, haven’t we?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Say what again? I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t lie.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not a liar. I’ll prove it to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……What are you saying?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">They looked at each other with a frown. Eisuke took a small breath and…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yui, your underwear is black and a bit erotic too! And Serika, your bra is a rather plain light blue!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">He pointed at them and announced loudly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“………………Um, Mister Eisuke?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A hellish silence permeated the area, and the temperature dropped to sub-zero levels. The Hero, the Imperial Knights and even Marielle stood stunned and rigid, mouths agape.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“………huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What… what are you…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…The two of them, Yui and Serika, were the exception. Yui’s face was still impassive, only blushing, and Serika’s was as red as a tomato.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-196" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“H-How do you know?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What kind of skill is that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t just awaken the skill to know the color of underwear! I know a lot of other things too! Yui! You’ve been in love with a guy who calls himself the “Yankee Hunter” ever since he saved you!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Serika! You like nice things despite your looks and character! And I don’t know why you’re hiding it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“As I said, how do you know all that?!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-197" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I know you better than you know each other now! You are my best friends, born with the same circumstances as me! Even if you lose your memories or forget everything, that fact will never change in my mind! I won’t let you say we’re not friends!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s strong words shook the atmosphere. Yui and Serika felt overwhelmed and started to get confused, unable to answer anything.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Did we lose our memories…?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-198" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Stop it, don’t listen to him! It’s just a desperate attempt!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito’s wide smile disappeared and he shouted at them. Eisuke shouted even louder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Rukino! I know who you are, too! I know more about you than that f̲u̲c̲k̲ing Hero over there who says you’ve served him all your life!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s all lies! Don’t be fooled!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha, then answer me! Tell me if the food Rukino makes is good or awful!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-199" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“T-That’s…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What about her sewing skills!? Can you answer that too!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-What do you think imperial knights are! They’re not housekeepers!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“To us, you’re a housekeeper and a doting idiot to Marielle!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle shot a glance at Rukino. Her face contorted slightly as their eyes met. Obviously, her reaction had changed compared to when her memory was altered. The girls had been confused precisely by Eisuke’s words.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-200" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Rukino, remember…! We may have had some difficult times, but…! I love you because you have overcome those difficulties together with me all these years! Please come back, Rukino!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle pleaded with a saddened face. Rukino was intensely disturbed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But, but I…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up, you damned rebels!” Kaito interrupted Marielle’s plea with strong words. “They don’t have those memories at all! The memories that only exist in your minds are nothing but dreams and delusions! If what you say is true, prove it!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn it…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seeing Yui and Serika looking disturbed with worried faces, Eisuke gritted his teeth in frustration. It was impossible to test a memory that didn’t exist. Knowing this, Kaito was provoking them. After all, unless they recovered their memories, this hopeless situation could not be reversed.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">S̲h̲i̲t̲, it’s going to be impossible…! Is there really no way to restore their memories…!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was drenched in sweat, desperately trying to find a way to get their memories back. Everyone’s memories of Marielle in this city had been altered by Kaito. Yui, Serika and the Imperial Knights, including Rukino, had no doubt that Kaito, not Marielle, was the king. There was not even a contradiction left in their memories.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-202" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">The knights gradually tightened their grip on Eisuke and Marielle and cornered them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mister Eisuke…! What should we do…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Together with Marielle, who was clinging to him, he was forced to retreat, step by step. He hit the edge of the fountain with a thud. Eisuke looked back at the fountain for a moment. The desolate, dry remains of the fountain, not even filled with water to reflect Eisuke’s pained face…</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-203" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">…Wait!</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">Time stopped for Eisuke. The whole landscape turned gray and the flow of time became stagnant. His thoughts were dominated by the conversation from earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">Isn’t everything too well planned out…!</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">If so, would it have even made the girls forget things that had nothing to do with Marielle?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke surveyed the scene around him as if driven to do so. Then, he confirmed that his guess was probably correct.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-204" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Certain things weren’t here from the beginning in the city. Perhaps they were eliminated by Kaito. Maybe that was the key to bringing back the memories.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">But if that’s the case, after all, there’s no way to restore their memories at this very moment, is there?</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">The path that seemed so clear was closed again. If that “it” had been removed from this city for good, it was impossible to obtain it at this very moment. Even if he knew his seed, Kaito would still be one step ahead of him.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-205" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">What should I do… think…! I was summoned by Marielle, I know I am her last hope…! I came from another world and I have abilities superior to the average human…!</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">Then a revelation pierced his cerebral medulla.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…There was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If you were someone from another world, you probably had “it”!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Haa.” Eisuke exhaled and snapped back to reality.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…As always, holding back a frivolous and reckless laugh.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-206" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Marielle, stand up for a moment.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I’m going to bring them back right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as Eisuke said that…</p>
<p class="calibre4">The earth was crushed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The ridiculous power of Eisuke’s legs produced an earthquake that shook the ground violently. It shook all the people in the place, making them lose their balance. The paved road cracked like lightning, and the rumbling was deafening.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Meanwhile, Eisuke approached Yui and Serika.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn it, you’re stubborn…! What a waste of time…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito blinked a little and was about to look at Eisuke… when….</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Sparks flew and a whirlwind blew.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Imperial Knights, who had formed an encirclement, flew backwards.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle looked closely. Standing in front of her… were three figures.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-208" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hey, you guys, you’re nothing but trouble. This time I was in a hurry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a mistake I’ll carry for the rest of my life. I can’t believe I forgot about Eisuke, even for a moment.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, how many times am I going to be manipulated? I don’t want to feel like a backstabbing character. You don’t think I’m becoming less nice, are you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s ears rang with the usual carefree, lighthearted banter. Her vision of her back slowly blurred.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…La-Lady Yui…! Lady Serika…!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-209" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">They turned around and smiled confidently at her. It showed in their soft, favorable smiles. …The girls had recovered their memories of Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why, it can’t be…! How did you get their memories back?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You were careless, weren’t you? …No, you were quite careful this time, and that was your undoing.” Eisuke put his hands in his pockets and stuck his chin out pompously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-What are you talking about…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You didn’t just erase Marielle from their memory, you erased everything that could pose a risk to get them back to normal as well, didn’t you? I’m just saying that your precautions gave me a clue.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-210" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“A clue…? How is that even…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It was at that moment when I shouted at them in irritation, when you altered their memories. I told them, “You should look in a mirror right now!”. They responded to me with an amusing reaction.”</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">“Mirror? I don’t know what that means.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">“Don’t go around saying things I don’t understand.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Yes, the girls didn’t understand what I meant. The meaning of my words. …Specifically they didn’t know what I meant because the word “mirror” didn’t exist in their memory.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-211" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito reflexively fell silent. Eisuke faced him with the truth while he kept silent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…By looking at their own faces in the mirror. That’s the way to restore altered memories, so you erased the entire existence of the “mirrors” from their memory! Isn’t that right, Hero Kaito?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito was immensely surprised by Eisuke’s intelligence. Marielle was amazed by Eisuke’s reasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mister Eisuke, how could you notice such a thing…!?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-212" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Because there were other things that didn’t feel right. …Marielle, do you remember when we escaped from the palace and all the windows had been removed?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There are no glass windows in this city at all. The windows of the private houses were unglazed and closed with brass or wood, and the rooms of the royal palace were also unglazed and as if they were atriums. …This city is completely devoid of glass. The glass reflects your face, that’s why.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-213" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">The truth unfolded before Marielle’s eyes. Looking around agitated, she saw that Eisuke was right: there was not a single pane of glass in the windows of the buildings. …Then, Marielle quickly looked back at the fountain behind her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, it can’t be, this fountain too…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course. This fountain isn’t filled with water on purpose either. So that it doesn’t reflect people’s faces. The fact that the people in this town are not so well dressed is probably due to the loss of the mirrors.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-214" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito recoiled at Eisuke’s reasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“B-But how could you bring back the memories of those two… There’s no way to see your face in this city anymore! What did you do!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course, at that instant, there was no mirror, no glass, not even a bathtub full of water. There is nothing to reflect your face. But I have something that helped me. After all, I’m also an ordinary high school student living in the modern era.” With that, Eisuke twisted the edges of his mouth… and held “it” next to his own face.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“T-That’s…!?” Kaito exclaimed again. It was such a familiar tool, but… absolutely unnecessary in this other world. “A smartphone…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Eisuke showed him the phone he had been carrying all along.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke proudly tapped his temple with his phone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I made them see their faces on the phone’s black screen. That’s it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke walked over to them in an instant, created when he stomped on the ground, and put them in front of their face. …A smartphone with a black screen on which their faces were reflected. The corners of Eisuke’s mouth twitched into a smile as he pocketed the phone.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-215" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“The moment you recognize yourself other in reality, your memory comes back… Ironic, isn’t it? I knew it, after all, your power isn’t salvation by a long shot.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What… do you say…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito was indignant at Eisuke’s mocking tone. He clenched his fist and said to him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No matter how trivial the memory is, no matter how painful and unpleasant it is…! There is no memory that you can forget and pretend it never happened! If a happy memory can become a painful memory, the opposite is also true! We must try to move forward to change those sad memories into something positive! …Unlike you, Marielle knows how to do it!”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…!?” Marielle choked at Eisuke’s sudden statement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle didn’t lock herself away after being betrayed by you, she summoned us to fight with her for this country! Between you, who made them turn away from reality and forced them into a false peace, and Marielle who faced reality and brought us here with her! If I had to choose a ruler, I would definitely respect Marielle more.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mister… Eisuke…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tears naturally welled up in Marielle’s eyes. Eisuke didn’t think any of his memories with Marielle were useless. In fact, he told her out loud that all those memories were proof that Marielle was a person worthy of trust and respect. For Marielle, that was “salvation”.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Good and bad memories can be transformed into the power to create the person you are going to be! You have only deprived others of the opportunity to move forward and become stronger! If you want to stay stagnant and settle for what you are now, do it on your own! Don’t drag the people of this city and my precious friends into this, you son of a b̲i̲t̲c̲h̲…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Everyone listened with bated breath to Eisuke’s roar. The knights didn’t even flinch, but turned their attention to Kaito. He, who had been devastated, was caught in their gaze and gnashed his teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“F̲u̲c̲k̲… f̲u̲c̲k̲! F̲u̲c̲k̲, f̲u̲c̲k̲, f̲u̲c̲k̲, f̲u̲c̲k̲, fuuuuuck!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito began to ruffle his hair. …And then, an idea occurred to him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A familiar magic circle appeared under his own feet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What the…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The magic circle of memory forgery…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke and the others were amazed. …Kaito had begun to alter his own memories.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-What’s wrong? Is he self-destructing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, you moron, what are you…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m getting new powers.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito, in despair, grinned at Eisuke’s exclamation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The “Seed of Imagination” is the embodiment of imagination. So, if I erase the memories of the imagination I’ve cultivated so far, I should be able to create a power based on my new imagination…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How is that possible?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do you think we should overcome our painful memories…? I’ve had enough of your pretty words…! Then you overcome it…! I’ll take the form that torments all humans with memories of despair…! A-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito roared. At that moment, his entire body began to be enveloped in a terrifying aura. Soon, he was swallowed by a terrifying jet blackness, a suffocating dark wind that slowed everything down, blew hard against Eisuke and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gooh…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke and the others quickly covered their faces with their arms. Before they could open their eyes…</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!’</p>
<p class="calibre4">An almost agonizing scream shook their eardrums as if piercing them. The jet blackness faded, revealing Kaito’s figure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Twisted horns. Wings torn and rotting. Beast-like skin that covered his entire body in black. And a terrifying form that struck fear into the hearts of all who saw it. It seemed to cover his outline and envelop his figure. And then that ghost, which had borrowed his body, manifested itself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be…!? How is it possible…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle almost stopped breathing. His figure was one that should never have appeared in this place. Eisuke broke out in a cold sweat at the terrifying apparition and shivered with the trembling of a warrior.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What the hell is this!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No matter how you look at it, it looks like a Demon King…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito’s newly acquired power through the modification of the “Seed of Imagination”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was… “changing into a Demon King”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito, transformed into a Demon King, floated in the air with his black wings. He pointed with his fingertips, which were as thin as tree branches, and at that moment….</p>
<p class="calibre4">A red light shot out from his finger. It drew a line of light through the streets of the capital.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Booooooooooom!</p>
<p class="calibre4">It exploded, violently. …About a quarter of the city was reduced to ashes in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘Wahahahahahahahaha!’</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a loud, booming laugh that sounded like an echo. It was the echo of Kaito, who had become a demon king. He no longer retained his sanity and only destroyed by instinct.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito now fired a volley of energy balls from his black hand. They landed here and there on the city buildings, blowing everything to pieces. One of them landed on Marielle’s head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t even think about it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke kicked that energy bullet and bounced it away. The energy bullet changed its trajectory to the opposite direction and landed on the Demon King. When Marielle turned around in surprise… Eisuke was deeply dejected.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“………appeared.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The Demon King has appeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaared……….!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then he shouted in high spirits and knelt on the spot, celebrating with his fist. …It was a kind of déjà vu for Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“………Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Look, Marielle, it’s the Demon King! That’s the Demon King those stupid Heroes defeated, isn’t it! I’d given up, but I never thought I’d find him at a time like this! This is what a different world should be like!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle was completely dumbfounded. This battle junkie boy, facing an entity that was synonymous with despair, was patting Marielle on the shoulder and snorting with excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t take him anymore, this guy is a new kind of pervert…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I like this kind of childish excitement from Eisuke.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This isn’t the time for that! Why are you so calm even facing the Demon King!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the moment when Marielle was complaining unable to bear the situation, the Demon King’s crimson beam attacked them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kah, don’t interrupt, you moron!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke punched the beam away, deflecting its trajectory. Then he turned to Marielle, who was behind him, and showed her his fist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re going to do it the same way we always do!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s the matter, can’t you believe it? I can beat him just like I’ve beaten the Heroes so far!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle remembered. When he was smiling fiercely and heading towards his foes… there wasn’t a single obstacle in his way. He had always used his ridiculous strength to create impossible spectacles and achieve victories that defied common sense. No matter what the enemy, the outcome was never altered. …He was going to win. Every time. Every one of them. Forever and ever. And so, this time, too. Even if it was the Demon King, in his hands…!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle clasped her hands together as if in prayer and spoke to him. As a goddess would:</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mister Eisuke…! …Win! As always…!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke answered her prayer with a smile. With the face of a hero who left no one behind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha! I would do it even if you didn’t tell me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke took a big leap from the spot. Like a missile, no, faster than a missile, he cut through the wind and launched himself at the demon king in a straight line.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eat this!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke put all his thrust into his arm and threw a hard right. It created a gust of wind and the sound of an explosion. A circular shockwave appeared around Eisuke’s arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…But his fist was caught by the Demon King’s fist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What the…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke, unable to process what had happened, unleashed a series of fists and knees. It was a torrent of quick actions. But even so, the Demon King responded to all of Eisuke’s attacks with the same move. It was like a fierce contest. A wild exchange of blows, with each blow accompanied by an explosion. Their strength seemed to be evenly matched… but it only seemed so.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Booooom!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Go… ha…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito, turned Demon King, hit Eisuke in the side of the head. That stopped all of Eisuke’s momentum. Not only that, but he kicked him as well, which inflicted painful damage on Eisuke’s steel body, which had repelled even attacks that looked just as bad or worse.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">Is this guy… stronger than me…!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke vomited blood from the blow, which was more threatening than his own, scattering a shockwave. The Demon King stretched out his hands to knock him down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Dododododododododoooo!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">A large number of energy bullets were launched at Eisuke at close range. It went up in smoke and crashed into a nearby building. The building began to collapse with a roar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mister Eisuke!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle shouted. But only seconds later, the building collapsed completely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Debris from the collapsed building flew out and smashed into the Demon King’s face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘Gu, ga… ah!’</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now you’ve really made me angry, you cretin…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke jumped like a comet, roaring ferociously. He had been caught in the collapsing structure, but was unharmed. The Demon King fired a heat ray again. Eisuke crossed his arms in a cross and brought them down in a single motion, wiping out the attack. He continued to approach the Demon King.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How about this!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">While feinting with his right arm, he threw a spinning kick with his left leg. The Demon King was thrown off by the spinning kick with all his might and crashed to the ground with a clatter. Demon King Kaito howled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘Damn… it! I see you’re smaaaaaart!’</p>
<p class="calibre4">A red bolt of lightning shot out of the furious Demon King’s horns. Snaky lightning flashed around it, striking Eisuke from all directions. Eisuke, who was in mid-air, couldn’t avoid the electric impact that was coming at him at the speed of light.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gaaaaahhhh!?” Eisuke groaned, his whole body numb from the lightning impact. He, momentarily stunned by the shock, was thrown into the air.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">He crashed to the ground. A cloud of dust rose up. Kaito followed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And now, eat thiiiiis!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was lying on his back with a crater in the ground, and a myriad of white and silver swords appeared in the air surrounding him. The numerous swords hovered eerily, their glowing tips all pointed at him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">¡¡Zuzazazazazazazazazaza!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Like a rain, the swords fell all at once. …Eisuke’s entire body was staked by the swords stabbing into the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn… it…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was unable to move as the swords stabbed into his body here and there.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Shudoooooon!</p>
<p class="calibre4">…A heat ray, powerful enough to destroy a city, struck the area.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">…Eisuke woke up from his sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ouch! What did I…!?”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Please don’t move yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A soft but decisive tone of voice commanded Eisuke calmly. His whole body was filled with a dull ache and great fatigue, so much so that he couldn’t even lift his head. With just a glance, Eisuke checked his condition.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…It was Marielle who had her hand on his chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A pale, warm light glowed from her palm. …It was healing magic. In concentric circles around the area touched by her palm, the pain eased. However, the slow and gentle healing process made Eisuke feel impatient.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hurry, we have to…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A bullet of energy flew over Marielle’s head, who was smiling softly. Eisuke went into a fit of rage… at that moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A figure appeared to protect Marielle and deflected the trajectory of the energy bullet with a series of thrusts with a thin sword. The energy bullets avoided Marielle and landed in the surrounding area. Her flaxen hair fluttered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Rukino!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry about earlier, Eisuke.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino’s thin lips twisted into a smile and she bent down towards Eisuke. Finally, his whole body recovered enough to stand up. …Almost at the same time he stood up….</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘Ooooooooooooooooooohh!’</p>
<p class="calibre4">A battle cry was heard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Swords sparked, arrows flew, and knights roared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The Imperial Knights…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was taken by surprise. For the few minutes he was on the ground, it was the Imperial Knights, whose memories had been altered, who fought to buy time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Princess Marielle has returned, we can no longer allow the Heroes to do as they please!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Until that boy returns, we will show our pride!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The brave and fierce shouts shook the atmosphere and brought the knights onto the battlefield in high spirits. They evaded, dodged and desperately survived the Demon King’s fierce attack.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How did this happen…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We brought them back.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We helped too, you know? After all, we’re modern high school girls too.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">It was Serika, with Yui in her arms, who came to see the stunned Eisuke. In their hands, each held a smartphone. These women, like Eisuke, had undone the Imperial Knights’ manipulation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle shook Eisuke’s hand with her own.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I believe you will all be victorious, Mister Eisuke. Because you believed in me with all your heart.” Marielle closed her eyes and went over Eisuke’s words again. “…So I want to answer back. Not only do I believe in your victory, but I promise you that it will be so. Because I am… I am the reincarnation of the Goddess…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino wrapped Eisuke’s hand over Marielle’s hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui and Serika also wrapped their hands from both sides.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Then Marielle’s body began to glow white. Dazzling rays of light shone around her. Her blonde hair waved as if alive, and her dress danced in the windless air.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With that smile Eisuke protected, she gained strength. Holding his thick, warm hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…The warmth of her palms naturally ignited the flames of fighting spirit in Eisuke’s chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">…Yes, that’s right.</em> Eisuke closed his eyes silently and understood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Surely strength was not something that could be expressed through fists alone. What was truly “strength” was something that connected between people and grew like the warmth he felt in his hands now. Strength was not something that existed only for oneself. It was for everyone who believed in you and put their hopes in you.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a “light” like that of the sun.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…A seven-colored light exploded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The light enveloped Eisuke. It was the most fantastic and beautiful light than any other. It pierced the heavens and space, and fell to earth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘What……………!?’</p>
<p class="calibre4">Everyone was astonished by the light. Even Kaito, the Demon King, was blinded by it. At the same time, it split in two.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…The light appeared in front of the Demon King’s eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Demon King’s eyes opened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry for the wait, let’s continue where we left off…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito was completely perplexed. The light that appeared in front of his eyes was… Eisuke Tsurugi. His eyes glowed with a golden color, and his figure was surrounded by a pale white light. Eisuke extended his hand towards him and folded his fingers inward. It was a fearless and arrogant provocation to the Demon King. In other words… he was looking for a fight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Come on, great Hero who has saved the world. Let’s fight with all our might.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">‘Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!’</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito’s instinctive astonishment at Eisuke, now with a golden aura, caused him to tremble and shudder. Then he switched his attack target to him and unleashed it all at once.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Energy bullets, terrifying blades, hellfire, red lightning, chaotic shockwaves… the Demon King’s attacks landed all over Eisuke’s body like a raging wave. The scene of destruction, as if an unprecedented natural disaster had been wreaked on the place, painted Eisuke’s dazzling light into darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Or at least, that’s what he thought…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kak……!!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">All traces of the attacks from before exploded without a trace… again the sun was visible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The intense light, like a prominence painting over the darkness, was nothing more than the glow from the impact of the demon king’s tremendous onslaught, which was completely extinguished when Eisuke made a slight movement of his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-W-What is…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke, who had the sun on his body, silently laughed at the astonished Kaito. He was furious. He could not accept the existence of a being who had obtained power even more absurd than his own, who had become a Demon King.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-216" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Kaito tensed his muscles and spread his arms wide.</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘You’re a sneakin’ wreeeeeeeeeetch!!’</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Demon King delivered a blow with a force that surpassed Eisuke’s. A mighty blow, which could shatter even mountain ranges, slammed into Eisuke….</p>
<p class="calibre4">A roar. An impact. A gust of wind. An explosive blast. Slaughter. There was every symbol of destruction exploding…</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘…………………How.’</p>
<p class="calibre4">…And… nothing happened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke had taken the Demon King’s strikes… with the finger of one hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘How can it be possible…………!?’</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s thanks to you, great Hero. You have made me strong.” Eisuke spoke. The tone of his voice contained no anger or hatred. It was a proud voice, clear and refreshing. “This power is the result of everything I have encountered up to this point. My own efforts, my past memories, the thoughts of all the people who have been involved with me… everything is combined in this power! And now I’m going to give you the chance to feel it…!” Eisuke’s right arm became enveloped in light, as if responding to his words. He raised his arm above his head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…A pillar of light pierced the heavens.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The light of hope spilled over the land, cutting through the chaos and despair caused by the Hero turned Demon King. Eisuke converged all that light into his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">An aurora. The light flickered and exploded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s fist no longer struck a blow. It was more like an explosion or the impact of a meteorite. The explosion and impact blew away all the surrounding structures without a trace, and even the surrounding knights flew away, unable to stand. Eisuke’s golden blow, which had been sent into the ground to destroy the Demon King, was, so to speak, the hammer of God’s judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They all covered their eyes with their arms. A tremendous roar deprived them of listening properly any longer. When the light faded, they regained their senses, and the first thing they saw…</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-217" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hahaha, you weren’t so good if you fell in one fell swoop, were you?” Looking at Kaito’s unconscious human body and smiling, was the heroic figure of Eisuke Tsurugi.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“H-He did it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">One of the knights blurted out those words. With a metallic clang, his sword fell to the ground. That was the beginning of a chain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He did iiiiiiit!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“To the Demon King…! He has defeated the Hero…!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-218" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“With this, the Imperial Capital will be restored!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A loud cheer filled the air. The knights clapped their hands, sang triumphant songs in high spirits, and clapped their hands in encouragement to each other. Countless cheers filled everyone’s eardrums.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mister Eisuke!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle and the others ran to Eisuke. Marielle jumped towards Eisuke’s chest with great momentum.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-219" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“W-Wow…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was unable to catch her and was pushed to the ground. It was a bit of déjà vu for him. Marielle was a bit perplexed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you okay?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“H-How do you even think of doing that…. Ouch, it was hard this time. I couldn’t move another millimeter.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The exhausted Eisuke answered Marielle, still on his chest. Marielle hugged him, pressing him still on the ground.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-220" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you so much, Mister Eisuke.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle murmured and looked up. Her eyes watered as she said those words… she smiled brightly like the sun, as if she loved him with all her heart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You are… the best of the “heroes” for me…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Come on, that tickles!” Eisuke laughed and told her bluntly. …Holding the hem of his denim jacket, he said his usual line. “I’m just… I’m just a high school boy who got too strong.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-221" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…And I wonder if there really is another high school student this ridiculous?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika and Yui did their usual joking punch line.</p>
