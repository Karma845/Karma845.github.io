<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p class="calibre4">“I would like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Really, thank you very much.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">The royal castle was caught in the deadly battle between Eisuke and the Demon King, and was in a deplorable state. However, the throne was still there with an aura that made it seem worthy of a king and inspired a sense of awe in everyone present.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The one sitting on the throne now was Queen Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She wore a tiara in her beautiful, shiny hair like golden sand, and was adorned with necklaces and earrings. Even at 14, she was a queen in her own right. Beside her, Rukino was nodding her head repeatedly, as if satisfied with Marielle’s appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And those who had now been invited in front of her were…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Woah, you really have become a queen. It feels a bit awkward.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Lady Serika!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The girl who was so impressed in the bathroom is now wearing a jeweled necklace. Is this what you call “nouveau riche”?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Lady Yui!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle, you’re not ready to be a queen yet, are you? We’ll call you our eternal princess.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s too painful. Wouldn’t that be like a slogan for a failed idol?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Even Mister Eisuke? What’s wrong with you people?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey you, my lady is already the queen of this country! Show more respect!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle puffed out her cheeks and stomped her feet, and Rukino yelled at Eisuke and the other two for their nonchalant attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…A week had passed since Hero Kite was sent to his world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle was finally crowned. She became the queen of the country at a young age. The Imperial Knights were once again armed, pledging their loyalty to Marielle and working to keep the country safe. Anyway… first and foremost, they were engaged in the reconstruction work of the imperial capital that was destroyed by Kite.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle sat back on her throne with a frown. With a sigh, she said:</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haa… You guys really don’t change at all, no matter if I become the queen or if you are revered as the “saviors” of this city…”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-222" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">They had defeated a total of four heroes and sent them back to their world. In particular, Eisuke, who defeated Kite, who ruled the Imperial Capital and had the skill to alter memories, something akin to massive brainwashing, and even became a Demon King, was called a “savior” and respected by all. However, it seemed that he was not so satisfied with this fact.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha. Being called a hero or a savior or something like that is too exhausting.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“As expected from the guy they called “Yankee Hunter”.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You want me to kick your a̲s̲s̲!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, let’s use a more appropriate nickname for you, Eisuke. I think “Honey” or “Darling” would be better.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s how you call a husband! They’re not nicknames!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How about thigh fetish?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re still saying that!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“By the way, what was that amazing power Eisuke showed at the end?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t change the subject on a whim after you start picking on others!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui asked Marielle as if she had just remembered. Marielle and Eisuke cocked their heads.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Even if you ask me… I don’t understand either…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Neither do I. After I went to bed, the next day I didn’t have it anymore. Isn’t it some kind of stupid last-minute power?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If that’s the case, you’re too stupid, because your attack almost blew up the city instead of the Demon King.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then it’s the power of love, isn’t it? My love must have given Eisuke that spectacular power.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait! If that’s the case, doesn’t that mean I gave him the power of love too?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So Serika, that means you don’t have any feelings for Eisuke?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course not! I don’t have any feelings for him…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And why are you whispering it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I-I told you it’s nothing! Don’t be making things up!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How cold! What’s the matter, have you already forgotten that I saved your a̲s̲s̲ twice?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And you’ve also seen my underwear twice, so we’re even now!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You call that being even when it was just plain light blue lingerie? It wasn’t even worth it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to kill you, I’m really going to kill you…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“After all, Serika is my biggest rival. But that’s all right. I’ve heard that with love, the bigger the obstacle, the harder it burns…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What the hell are you talking about?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle smiled in dismay at his increasingly derailed jokes, and then she remembered:</p>
<p class="calibre4">…That power could not have come from the goddess Marielle. She had no more power left to bestow on anyone. In Eisuke’s words, Marielle was a seaweed that had run out of broth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Therefore, that power was probably a response to Marielle and her friends’ thoughts and Eisuke’s latent power. In other words, the power Eisuke displayed… but it was still unclear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It would surely continue to go further. Limitations, common sense, difficult enemies, expectations… and even Eisuke… himself. He would overcome everything. Because he was a “hero”, a “savior”, the strongest high school student transcending humanity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, Marielle. What do we do now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke suddenly asked Marielle, bringing her back to reality. Eisuke frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t “huh” me. You summoned us to “defeat the Heroes”, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui relaxed her cheeks calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika smiled innocently, showing her white teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And Eisuke… sneered at the almighty heroes left to defeat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle smiled along with the three. Taking a deep breath, and told them, with a smile of encouragement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Holding in her small chest the bond she had formed with them beyond humans and beyond the world…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well… then, which city will you rescue from the Heroes next?”</p>
