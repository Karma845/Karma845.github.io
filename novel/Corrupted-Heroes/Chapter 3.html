<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh~…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke and the others exclaimed in unison.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">The wide street was lined with food stalls on both sides. Here and there, the high-pitched voices of vendors could be heard, and many people were coming and going all along the street. The scene was like the bustling streets of an Asian center.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is Balletta, a city that serves as a hub where products from all over the world are gathered, partly because of its proximity to the imperial capital. It is a bustling city with many migrant workers.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you, Rukipedia.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean Rukipedia!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Rather, it’s very quiet. Hey, is there really a Hero here?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Listening to Serika’s opinion with narrowed eyes, Eisuke remembered the words he heard yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A Hero of justice, huh…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle looked at Eisuke as he muttered under his breath. Eisuke and Rukino looked at each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s just that we heard something strange yesterday… something about the person who rules this city being a Hero of Justice who protects the citizens or something…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I guess a Hero would inherently be a vigilante.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika replied. Marielle threw a somewhat relieved look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t that wonderful!? If so, we might not even have to fight, and we could easily head to the imperial capital!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stupid, moronic, imbecile. Nothing but flowers on your head, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What was it you said?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle was indignant at the abusive words he hurled at her. Eisuke glared at her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You have to learn to distrust people. You’re already talking as if there’s no evil, even with yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uhhh…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s mood turned gray. Just yesterday they had repelled Hiroto, the Hero, who had approached them calling himself Marc. Marielle, a good person, honest to the core, had a tendency to believe what people told her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And even if they were a Hero of Justice, I wouldn’t care. I’m going to crush every one of them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A-Aside crushing… if we can solve problems by discussing them, it would be better that way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What a brute you are. If we decide to talk with our fists, there’s no way there’s going to be any communication.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not arguing anymore, that’s just making the other party give up! If we start fighting, it won’t be an argument anymore!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle was terribly annoyed by Eisuke’s bloodlust. She exhaled giving up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh… Regardless of what Mister Eisuke says, it’s necessary to take a look at the Hero of this city, isn’t it? There are a lot of people here, but let’s try not to get sidetracked and look for them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, sure. Eisuke, please refrain from acting arbitrarily…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…When Rukino and Marielle tried to talk some sense into Eisuke… neither him nor the other two girls were near them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And I was just about to tell them to stay close!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thi-This is bad, Rukino! If Mr. Eisuke does something reckless again…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The image of Eisuke behaving provocatively and causing unnecessary trouble easily appeared in Marielle and Rukino’s minds, and the blood drained from their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Le-Let’s find him quickly!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Bu-But…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two, dismayed, saw that countless people were spreading out in front of them like a flood…</p>
<p class="calibre4">The goods lining the streets were truly varied. Fruits, vegetables and other foodstuffs, clothes and other necessities of daily use. There were also metal parts and other items of unknown use. Serika stared at Eisuke and Yui’s backs as they walked, observing the stalls and carts that lined the street.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, wait, is it really okay that we got separated from Marielle and Rukino?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Lalala, I’m not hearing you. Until I kick Hero’s ass, I can’t hear you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This guy is really…” Serika was sick of Eisuke covering his ears. He was a troublesome brat who, as long as he could fight, everything was fine with him. She exhaled in disgust and withdrew her gaze from his back. …And then her vision drifted to something else.</p>
<p class="calibre4">One of the items being sold at a peddler’s stall selling accessories and knick-knacks was an adorable-looking bear-shaped stuffed animal. It was made of felt fabric and its eyes were inlaid with translucent glass beads. Serika swallowed hard.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">It’s… so… cute…!!</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika’s eyes were riveted on it. Just looking at it made her feel so excited that she almost let out a scream. The more she looked at it, the more she realized that the stuffed animal was just the way she liked it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Ah.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika came back to herself at the question from the quizzical Eisuke. She unconsciously stared at the stuffed animal, which was several inches from her nose before she realized it. She struggled to remain in that position and calmly returned the question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, don’t play dumb. Do you want that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? Why? Why would I want it? What’s the matter with you? What do you want?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t get so defensive… and do me a favor and turn your face away, which is so close to me, before you say it. If you want it, just buy it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Eisuke said this with a frown, Serika looked at him with somewhat reproachful eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…If I buy it, won’t you make fun of me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I mean… this kind of thing doesn’t go with my character.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika fiddled with the ends of her hair. Indeed, given Serika’s more adult personality and lazy appearance, it was surprising that she preferred something so childish. But Eisuke was not the type to fuss over such trivial matters.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know what kind of character you’ve developed so far. And besides, I don’t like it when people hide things from their friends, even if they are trivial things.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke said indifferently. Serika blinked and looked at him, then relaxed her mouth happily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Sigh, I see. I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Besides, there’s nothing weird about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The gap between a normally simple gal who likes nice things and is kind to children and animals is more appreciated and is called a pure-hearted girl overflowing with motherly love.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?!” Serika said angrily to Yui while Yui said with a serious face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Miss, if you like it so much, please feel free to buy it.” The store owner, who was wearing a dark robe and lipstick, smiled thinly at Serika as she listened to this ridiculous series of exchanges. “That stuffed animal is also a good luck charm. It has a spell to protect you from evil spirits.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And of course, that’s not suspicious at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was that rude even though he was still standing in front of the store. Serika, however, broke into a smile and looked at Eisuke and Yui.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Hehehe… well, if it’s a good luck charm, it wouldn’t be weird to buy it, would it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not sure what to say to that…. Do whatever you want.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll buy it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thanks for your purchase, hehe.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika raised her hand cheerfully, and the store owner smiled at her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hehehe, I’ll draw heart marks on your eyes when I get back to my room.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika was overflowing with joy with her stuffed toy in her hand. Eisuke and Yui watched her with warm, half amused eyes.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-134" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Serika, you’re cute.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is the kind of thing that reminds me once again that she is a woman.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…You still lack finesse, Eisuke…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui stared at Eisuke. He frowned, not understanding what she meant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know what you’re accusing me of, but I’m sure it’s something bad, right? But in my mind, more than a woman you’re a…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s when it happened. With a thud, Yui bumped into an oncoming figure.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-135" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, sorry…” Yui quickly apologized… but then looked at the person and choked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Haah? What are you up to, brat?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Silver hair and eyes as fierce as a predator’s. His lean, muscular body, with sharp canine teeth peeking through his dentition. Above all… ears sprouted from the top of his head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…A half wolf beastman. A werewolf, as one would say.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Balletta was a town of mixed cultures due to its thriving commercial district. Therefore, people who lived in other districts with the physical characteristics of animals lived their lives in the same way as ordinary humans. It was not that they were especially fierce or unable to communicate. They were almost the same as humans.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-136" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">But Yui sensed it immediately. Perhaps this man was not a crook, but his eyes and the look of irritation on his face revealed a fierce personality.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, brat, do you know who you’ve run into…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, wolf, who are you trying to pick a fight with?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before the werewolf could even threaten her, Eisuke was on his heels with a terrifying look. Yui and Serika thought he was several times worse than the rough looking werewolf, but said nothing. The werewolf looked at Eisuke with the eyes of a true predator.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-137" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know if it’s because you’re in front of her or what, but you’re getting cocky, kid.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You don’t want to fight me, do you? If you don’t trust your fists, then turn around and go home, or else I’m always ready to fight.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He-Hey you…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika was completely surprised. Eisuke, unsurprisingly, was trying to fight the werewolf.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you serious?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I’m serious, I’m very serious. If we’re going to do this, let’s get down to it. The more you talk, the more boring the fight will be.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-138" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke repeated his provocations. The werewolf sneered at the daring boy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Keh, then I’ll make sure you don’t open that mouth again. I’m a good wolf hunter, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before they knew it, the surrounding bustle had moved away, sensing the tense atmosphere, and now there was plenty of room to move. The werewolf crouched down. When he opened his hand, his long claws gleamed. They were like blades. But Eisuke smiled and said:</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-139" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“What a fool. I’m better at hunting than the wolves. I guess my reputation as the “Yankee Hunter” stayed in the other world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You idiot, I don’t give a rat’s ass that you’re a party hunter!” The werewolf jumped. Immediately, he leaped towards Eisuke’s chest and swung his sharp claws vertically. Its speed was like that of a missile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, Eisuke observed it calmly and turned his body to the side. With minimal movement, he easily avoided the werewolf’s attack. Claws slashed the air.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-140" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Tsk, s̲h̲i̲t̲!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The werewolf quickly changed direction and lunged at Eisuke again. The latter dodged it again with no trouble. Sometimes by bending his upper body, sometimes by backing away to distance himself, and sometimes he ducked diagonally. He avoided all of the werewolf’s attacks by moving in all directions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What, wha-what the hell is that guy…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He’s not even sweating! Is he really human!?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-141" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">The astonished voices of the crowd echoed in Eisuke’s ears. But to him, this was like wringing a baby’s hand. After all, he used to be the “Yankee Hunter”, who came to face a dozen criminals with cardboard knives attacking him at once, and defeated them unharmed. Even if he were lucky, the werewolf’s claws could hopefully take out a little piece of his tooth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, hey, weren’t you a great hunter? Be more serious!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut. Up!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-142" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">The werewolf became enraged at Eisuke’s provocation, and backed away from him. Then, it began to run in circles around him. His speed gradually increasing, and Eisuke was surrounded by the residual images of the werewolf.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha, are you trying to trick me?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke joked and as he wondered where the werewolf was coming from towards him. The werewolf jumped on his back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I got you…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There you go!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-143" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Gugyah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…But his surprise attack was completely read. Eisuke launched a kick to the back with his whole body. The counter kick accurately hit the werewolf in the face and kicked him to the side.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gug, gah, ha…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke walked over and crouched down next to the werewolf, whose consciousness was clouded by the painful kick. With an evil grin, Eisuke sneered at him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Too bad, I win the fight. Then, don’t ever talk to us again…”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-144" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“He-Hey, you, what are you doing? Let go of the man!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haah?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, a woman’s voice rang out. It was definitely directed at him. Eisuke, who had grabbed the werewolf by the ear, turned around with a gloomy look. But as soon as he saw the woman calling out to him, his eyes widened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Flaming red pigtails. Armor of warm colors. Piercing eyes that burned with the flames of justice. And… the magnificent sword she wore at her waist. There was no doubt.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-145" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I am Kyoko, the Heroine! If you resist, I will show no mercy!” She, Kyoko, the Heroine, spoke to Eisuke in a dignified voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-It’s the Heroine!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The crowd applauded Kyoko’s appearance. Their eyes were full of anticipation and admiration as they looked at her. Eisuke twisted the edges of his mouth provocatively.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He, you’re the Hero of Justice of this city, aren’t you? I warn you, he was the one who threatened us first.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-146" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re the one to blame here, no matter who you are!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I expected as much…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika had been left alone, as if it didn’t matter what happened to her. Eisuke was also glad to see Serika, and laughed flippantly at Kyoko, snapping his fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha, then why don’t you take a swing and try to catch me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Okay. If you want to do that, I accept it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko accepted Eisuke’s declaration of war and stuck her hand into the ground.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">¡Goooooooooooo!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Flames erupted from her hand and surrounded her and Eisuke in a circle with a radius of about five meters. The wall of flames rose so high that it hid them both from the outside. The crowd erupted in a roar of excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Here it comes! It’s Lady Kyoko’s flame formation!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Flame formation?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika asked one of the onlookers as Yui stood erect beside her, trying to catch a glimpse of Eisuke’s heroic figure.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-147" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right, Lady Kyoko always fights inside that ring of flames to keep us out of it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…In the ring of flames, Kyoko raised her sword. The flames also covered the blade of the sword, which burned red.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Heh, so that’s your power, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s mouth dropped open. Her Hero skill was evident. …The power to manipulate flames at will. A simple, yet striking and powerful skill.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-148" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Who the hell are you? Are you from my hometown in that uniform?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Good answer. I was summoned to defeat you, I’m just a high…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stoooooooop it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is it!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino suddenly rushed from behind and threw herself against the wall of flames, and Eisuke was hit in the back of the head! Eisuke bared his teeth, resentfully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, you! What the hell are you doing, you clumsy knight?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-149" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you doing fighting in a place like this? She’s a Hero of Justice, isn’t she?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t give a damn! We’re already in a fight! I can’t just turn back!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wa-Wait, please! S-Stop fighting!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko was startled by the suddenness of the situation and extinguished the flame formation. Outside stood Marielle, gasping for air. She was wearing a hood and was frantically trying to get to Eisuke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you doing, Mr. Eisuke? I told you we’d discuss it!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-150" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, that’s why, to discuss it with our fists?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s enough!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Pri-Princess Marielle!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko’s eyes widened and she stared with bated breath at the argument between Eisuke and Marielle.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Once again, I am Kyoko. I am the Heroine who has taken the liberty to rule this city.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke and his group were led to a luxuriously furnished building. It was Kyoko’s mansion in the center of Balletta. It used to be the estate of a prestigious noble family, but it appeared to have been remodeled. Indeed, this was the center of Balletta, which was now controlled by Kyoko. The latter smiled at Marielle with her red hair swaying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Princess Marielle, I see you are alive. If I had known earlier, I would have at least tried to hide you in this city…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, no, that’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Very nice and all, but I don’t see you siding with the princess and fighting the other Heroes, do you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Aside from Marielle, who was still wondering what to say, Eisuke’s words were meant to provoke. Kyoko scratched her cheek reproachfully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t like to admit it, but… Like them, I don’t want to give up this power either. With it, I can carry out justice.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Justice…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle murmured, and Kyoko continued.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I have always longed to be on the side of justice. To appear on the scene and defeat evil. Of course, I know it’s a bit childish.” Kyoko let out an embarrassed giggle. She clenched her hands tightly and made a fist. “Of course, I was very happy that I was able to use this power to defeat the evil Demon King. I want to protect people from many more evils. And at the very least, I want to perfectly protect the area within my reach. That’s why I’m trying to guard the peace of this city, because it’s within my reach.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“She-She is a Hero…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, a Hero…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika and Yui were really surprised to see a real Hero for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I lose this power, I won’t be able to protect this city from evil. …Please, Princess Marielle. At least wait until the current incidents in this place are resolved.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Incidents…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s eyebrows twitched. Kyoko nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. …Recently in this town, some “witches” have been appearing at night.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Witches…?” Marielle’s eyebrows furrowed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Lately, women with vacant eyes, who lose control and lash out at others, have begun to appear. For convenience, we call them witches.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Is it brainwashing magic?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino asked inquisitively, and Kyoko frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe… but it would be strange if it really was brainwashing magic.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean? But how about first explaining to me what this brainwashing magic is?”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke asked Rukino. Rukino, or rather Rukipedia, exhaled and began to explain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Brainwashing magic is, as the name suggests, a magic to brainwash others. However, being a mind-controlling magic, the activation conditions are quite limited.” Rukino made a peace sign. “The first is simple: you must activate the magic while touching the person you are going to manipulate. The second is to send the magic to a catalyst while the wand or magic stone is in contact with the person to be controlled. There are only these two main things.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Direct touch or indirect touch. Limited, it seemed, also meant that the conditions were strict.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see… no one would be stupid enough to let themselves be touched knowing that it can be manipulated. By the way, what is a magic stone?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Normally, magic revolves around the magician, and is activated from the magician’s hand or wand. But if a magic stone is charged with magic beforehand, it can be activated by focusing on the magic stone even if it is far away.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle answered in Rukino’s place. After explaining the premise information up to that point, Kyoko cut the conversation short.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I too suspected brainwashing magic when I saw that they had lost their minds, but… there is no evidence that they have anything resembling a magic stone, and there is no information that they were in contact with anyone just before they went on a rampage against others. First of all, magic stones are very valuable things, and considering the number of victims, I don’t think it’s possible that they would prepare so many magic stones and make a mischief like this.” Kyoko shrugged her shoulders as if she couldn’t help it. “Now, anyway, I’ve been trying to subdue the out-of-control women so that the damage won’t increase…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Okay, then I’ll get the culprit.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You… mean it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko’s expression turned to surprise. Eisuke smiled at her, his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“When I catch that criminal, you’ll have to fight me. Once the case is closed, you won’t have any more doubts, will you? I’ll beat you in a fight and send you back to our world. Okay, it’s all set! Let’s go out and patrol the streets!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, wait, Mr. Eisuke! You can’t decide that on your own!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke quickly left the place, without listening to Marielle. Yui and Serika, also stunned, followed him. Marielle and Rukino were the only ones who stayed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Someone… should stop that boy…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I’m so sorry… That boy is a hopeless fool who is only interested in fighting Heroes…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle apologized flatly, and Kyoko let out a low chuckle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s okay. …Besides, he’s absolutely no match for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…That’s a lot of confidence. Do you have a secret plan?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle asked nonchalantly. But Kyoko shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Because justice always prevails.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She said it with a perfect smile, without a single cloud of doubt.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">That night. Although the number of people had decreased compared to those of the day, the streets were still not completely deserted. Eisuke, Yui and Serika were walking together along the main street of Balletta. Of course, they were patrolling for the “witches” case.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Yui, if you see someone suspicious, tell me right away. But if you see that they are very suspicious, shoot him then.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Understood.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, don’t say you understand so lightly, you can’t shoot him, or we’ll be apprehended.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika was fed up with Eisuke’s ranting. The two of them were so desperate to find the culprit of the incident that they were even the most suspicious in sight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yui, you act like you’re his faithful dog?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Naturally. I’m Eisuke’s faithful dog.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t be calling yourself that way.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, I’m an obedient b̲i̲t̲c̲h̲.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s even worse! Don’t go around saying that with such a straight face!” Eisuke raised his voice because of what Yui said, who dropped that bombshell with such a flat tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So what am I to you, Eisuke? Your girlfriend?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think you’re getting carried away… I didn’t mention it before, but to me you guys are more friends in the same circumstances than women?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika looked sideways at Eisuke’s profile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Friends in the same circumstances. She turned the phrase over in her mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika was a prep school girl who had lived relatively well compared to Eisuke and Yui. As long as she kept her abilities under control, she didn’t usually get exposed. In fact, she even used her abilities to make things easier when she occasionally went to the store or when she was running late. She was superhuman, but ordinary at the same time. She was not particularly dissatisfied with such an incongruous life.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-151" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">However, being satisfied was not the same as having no dissatisfactions. There were times when she suddenly felt a sense of alienation in a corner of her mind. She was not normal, she was different from the others, she was really strange.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, what’s wrong, Serika?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika, who was distracted thinking about the past, was jolted back to reality. Eisuke and Yui were looking at her curiously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They were the only two friends who accepted Serika as she was, even if she preferred things more tender and out of the ordinary, even if she showed off her extraordinary abilities…. They were the first friends she had ever made without having to feel self-conscious, friends at heart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika frowned and stuck out her tongue mischievously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, I was just thinking what a stupid friend I have!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why are you making fun of me in your mind!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika teased Eisuke with a sheepish and carefree smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…But then at that moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, Serika’s neck bent forward with a jerk. She turned her face, hiding her expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Serika?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke and Yui were puzzled at Serika’s sudden change in mood. Eisuke tried to put his hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And Serika… disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh…?” Eisuke was stunned. However, a shiver immediately ran down his spine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yui!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, hyah…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Turning quickly on his heels, Eisuke covered Yui with his arm. Almost at the same time…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s arm was kicked with great force.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Serika kicked him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika, without hesitation and without paying attention to the surprised Eisuke, gave him a succession of kicks at great speed. She didn’t hurt him thanks to his strong body, but it was his own friend who was kicking him. And protected Yui as he was, he could only defend himself in bewilderment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, what kind of joke is this, Serika…?” Eisuke exclaimed, his voice hoarse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Her big dark eyes had gone blank and lost their light.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be, you…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…She had become a “Witch”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why Serika…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know! How did she become a witch!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah… B-but, it’s kind of nice to be protected by Eisuke’s arms ♡…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stop fooling around, can’t you see what’s going on!? Start looking for anyone suspicious around us!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yes, that’s right!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke managed to give instructions to Yui, but Serika’s continuous attacks didn’t stop in the meantime. He was trying to think while getting kicks thrown at breakneck speeds, and as if to interrupt him, she easily put her legs around his neck and choked him hard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, Guoh!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke lost his balance and fell backwards. Serika, who had turned into a witch, had her empty eyes and silently began to strangle him with her thighs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“F̲u̲c̲k̲, the situation is what it is, so I couldn’t consider it a reward or anything…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke pulled her supple thighs tightly. With a slight movement, Serika moved away from him and disappeared again at high speed. Then she threw another kick in surprise. Eisuke clicked his tongue as he somersaulted backwards and looked for her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t see her at all…! If Serika becomes our enemy, she’s going to be a nuisance…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, it would be easy for Eisuke to create an explosion and blow her up or shatter the ground. There were many ways to defeat her. …But this was Serika. He couldn’t afford to be rough with her. Just as Eisuke was about to ponder what the cause might be…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Goooooooo!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Flames raced like a fuse to the ground beneath his feet. Serika, controlled, stepped back. Eisuke, startled, traced the source of the flames with his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There stood the Hero Kyoko. She shot flames from her hands and hurriedly asked Eisuke a question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“She’s become a witch! How did it happen!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know! You really don’t know the cause of all this!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Didn’t you notice anything strange about her behavior!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke followed Serika’s high-speed movement with his eyes, frantically thinking about what to do.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">…Witches appear in this place. I have to think about what she did when she entered this city…there’s only one more thing she did, isn’t there…!?</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika’s kick came at Eisuke from the front. He caught the leg with his forearm and shouted behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yui! That strange stuffed animal she bought today at lunchtime, do you remember where she put it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He asked Yui sharply, who was slightly perplexed. However, she quickly replied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think it was in his breast pocket!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In her breast pocket!? Please forgive me, Serika!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, what are you going to do!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to take it from her! I’ll bring her back!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke stopped Kyoko, and bent down to warn Serika, who was moving at a breakneck pace. Having excused himself beforehand, he deliberately, for a moment, showed a large opening at his back. Serika jumped to take advantage of the opening.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke immediately turned around and reached for Serika’s chest with his left hand while pressing her flesh. He pulled the collar of her shirt with rolled up sleeves and pulled her body closer. Then, without giving her a moment’s pause, he forcefully ripped the stuffed toy along with the whole pocket with his right arm and threw it away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The light returned to Serika’s eyes. Her whole body suddenly weakened, and she fell onto Eisuke’s chest leaning against him. Eisuke reflexively held her in his arms.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Eh? …What? What are you…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you alright?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The confused Serika’s eyes blinked as she couldn’t take in what was happening, and Eisuke asked her. Serika, still in Eisuke’s arms, checked her condition, dazed. Finally, she realized that her body was snuggled against Eisuke’s. She blushed and pulled away from him to push him away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, i-idiot, what are you doing?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?! You, you were being manipulated…!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-152" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Manipulated…? Huh?” Serika raised her eyebrows. Apparently, she didn’t remember being manipulated. She looked around…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Ah.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">They both froze at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Serika’s shirt, which had been ripped off by Eisuke, had boldly exposed her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What… what… what!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika’s bra was exposed, revealing a simple light blue design. The dazzling white cleavage of her breasts peeked out from there. In contrast to the color of the bra, Serika’s face turned red as a boiled octopus, losing her mind much more than when she was in the brainwashed state.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-153" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh…” Eisuke turned away from her awkwardly and looked at Yui again. “…Yui.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What’s wrong…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke said to Yui with a serious look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This time, it’s Serika who wins in sex appeal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Understood.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t say you understaaaand!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ugh!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika’s flying kick exploded at the tactless Eisuke’s waist. It was much more forceful than when she was in a brainwashed state.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-154" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Haa, anyway, I’m glad you’re okay.”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/6sKsfLD/000005.png" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">Kyoko exhaled, put away her sword and picked up the suspicious stuffed toy Eisuke had thrown away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…And what’s this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Ah, it’s a rare stuffed animal that Serika bought from a suspicious person. Yes, she’s an irresponsible girl.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re the one who told me to do whatever I want!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-155" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I will take care of this stuffed animal. I will also ask the public for information about this suspicious woman. You guys can go back to the inn right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko said coldly and left. At the same time, Marielle and Rukino desperately ran up to them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A-Are you all right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-Yes… I’m fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika was puzzled by Marielle’s concern. Eisuke frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What was that woman’s purpose? Why would she want to cause such an incident in this town?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-156" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Purpose?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui tilted her head to the side, and Eisuke pointed with his chin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh. It must be because there’s that nasty Hero of Justice in this town. It’s like committing a crime right in front of the police station.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As long as Kyoko ruled this town as a Hero of Justice, the evil of the place would be punished by her. So why go to the trouble of causing such evil among these people?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Was it someone like us who rebelled against the heroes?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-157" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“No, because she did everything half-heartedly. It’s not possible that a mere witch won against a Hero. No matter how many times she tried to fight, it would be a losing battle.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke pointed out. First of all, the basic premise was that in this world Heroes were known to be invincible. So why would they be so willing to not give up and create witches over and over again?</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">Hmm…? Lost battle…?</em> Eisuke suddenly felt uncomfortable with his own statement.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-158" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Perhaps… winning is not their goal…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle asked. Rukino frowned as well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean, then what’s the culprit’s goal?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke put his finger to his chin and kept silent. He found himself in silent contemplation. Silently, he tried to recall today’s events, but… trying to guess did not always lead to the truth. Eisuke became distressed with a worried expression on his face.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-159" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">…At that moment, as if to stop him from thinking any further, someone tugged at his sleeve.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong, Yui? I’m concentrating right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was Yui who was tugging on Eisuke’s sleeve. She pointed to Serika, who was half a step behind her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Serika seems to want to say something.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait a minute, Yui! Not now!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hm… Say it quickly. It might be interesting.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-160" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke looked at Serika with half-open eyes. Serika fidgeted nervously. She opened and closed her mouth for a while, then let out a sigh and said:</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry. I still don’t quite understand what happened, but thank you. For… helping me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika said to Eisuke, her cheeks tinged with embarrassment. Blinking with a curious look, Eisuke…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haa… seriously, that really couldn’t wait until later?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I thought so too! It’s Yui’s fault, isn’t it!?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-161" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">She replied with a heavy sigh. She made a cutting gesture with her hand to Serika, who was very red.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You don’t have to thank me, that’s what friends are for…”</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">…Thanks me?</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke swallowed and blinked several times. Yes, that was it. With that one word, it all led to a truth…!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see…! It’s all connected! Serika!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hyah!? What’s wrong now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke grabbed her by the shoulders in an instant of excitement. He laughed vigorously and put his hands on Serika’s shoulders while Serika didn’t know what was going on.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-162" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m so proud to be your friend! I love you!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You love me, what, huh?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mr. Eisuke!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika was completely shocked by Eisuke’s impetuous comment. Even Marielle, who was watching from the side, her eyes almost popped out in surprise. …While Yui’s real face was tense with despair.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, Eisuke… l-loves her, eh…? How did that…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle! I know who’s behind this!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-163" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“What!? Really!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. The criminal is definitely going to contact us tomorrow. This time it’s our turn to trick them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke smiled. Marielle felt her own kind smile contract at his evil grin, which made her suspicious if he wasn’t the mastermind behind the whole thing. …She had a bad feeling about this. Without breaking his smile at all, Eisuke grabbed her by the shoulders, she felt terrified.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, Marielle. I’m going to use you as bait for a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…U-um… that means, by the way, that I have no way to refuse… Ah, well, do what you want…” Marielle could only give in to Eisuke’s silent pressure.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s the woman in the black robe…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The next night. Marielle’s group, who had delayed their departure from Balletta for a day, heard Yui’s scream in Kyoko’s mansion. Yui heard the scream with her ability.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“She seems to have appeared on the main street. The citizens can be heard making noise.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Finally that wretch is here! I’m going to get her!” Eisuke rolled up the sleeves of his jacket and ran his finger under his nose. “Kyoko, you stay there with Marielle! I’ll go get my ticket to fight you! Come on, Yui, Serika!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without waiting for an answer, Eisuke ran out of the mansion with Yui and Serika. Marielle smiled bitterly and spoke to Kyoko.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ahahaha… I’m sorry he’s such a noisy boy, Lady Kyoko…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I don’t mind, they don’t seem to be bad guys.” Kyoko replied with a slightly bitter smile and smiled at Marielle as if she had just remembered. “By the way, Princess Marielle, didn’t you say at lunch that you wanted a hair clip?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I was wondering if I could wear my hair like Lady Serika?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have a hair clip that would look very nice on you. Please wait a moment. I’ll go get it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko happily got up. Marielle and Rukino stayed in the room. Their faces became serious and they nodded as if to encourage each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My lady…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. It’s time to start the operation…”</p>
<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre3">***</strong></p>
<p class="calibre4">It was night in the city. However, this was in an uproar. The cause was a woman in a black robe standing ominously on the roof of a certain building. She was smiling under her robe.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you the ones who have been spying on me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, yes we are. But you already knew that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Like her, Serika was on the rooftop, her cardigan billowing in the night breeze at her waist. Behind the robed woman, Yui held one of her pistols.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Please don’t move.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, my dears, such caution. I guess I was too flashy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika also threw a warning to the robed woman, who remained aloof despite the pincer attack.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, this has gone too far already. You were even manipulating me. I’m going to make you pay for that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Even though your underwear was simple.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yui!? You said it so out of the blue, are you being controlled!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just that you’ve become my rival.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika cleared her throat, dismayed by Yui’s puffy cheeks with a sulky look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, I’ve been through a lot because of you. I warn you, I’m the spiteful type, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika lowered her hips and adopted a fighting stance. The robed woman held back her laughter at her steely demeanor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hehe, wow, what a savage. You look just like your friend’s boyfriend. I think you’re starting to look a lot alike.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stop, really stop, that’s the last thing I want to hear anyone say to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Speaking of which, I wonder if he’s around. Will you two be fighting alone?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The robed woman looked around. Serika smiled at her demeanor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, let’s both go. Have you grown fond of him yet? Or was it your boss who grew fond of him?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The tone of the robed woman’s voice changed. Serika said provocatively.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m saying you’re just a minion. You act like you’re the real brains, but it’s useless. You’re just a witch who was ordered to do this. …And he’s on his way to the real culprit right now. …My little savage friend…” As she pointed at the robed woman, Serika’s sneer matched the sneer that Eisuke always had.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kyoko returned from the living room of the mansion, bringing a hair clip.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Princess Marielle, here it is. Please take it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is it really okay for me to have it…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, it doesn’t seem to fit me very well.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The clip she brought was a large one with a ribbon. Kyoko brought her hand to the reserved Marielle’s hair.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let me put it on. Actually, I’ve always wanted to do this to a younger gi…” As Kyoko spoke…</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Suddenly she was grabbed firmly by the arm by Rukino.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I’m sorry. He told me to do this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Exactly!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The heavy door suddenly opened with a loud noise.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The one who kicked the door violently was Eisuke, who was supposed to have gone to catch the robed woman. Kyoko’s shoulders shook in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-What’s wrong…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I happened to come to catch the culprit, you damned wretch. I knew you’d bite with the hair clip story. I won’t let you put that thing on Marielle.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke pushed Kyoko away from Marielle. Kyoko glared at him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-Why are you doing this so suddenly!? What happened to the woman in the robe!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t give a damn about that fourth-rate scum. You think I’m not going to take the opportunity to fight you when the boss of the robed woman is already here?” Eisuke grinned sadistically.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-what are you talking about…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m saying that you’re the real mastermind behind all this, Kyoko, the Hero.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What!?” Kyoko blinked unnaturally. But she immediately sighed in disgust. “…Enough of this nonsense. Tell me, what’s the point of this accusation?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yesterday, when you asked Serika about the stuffed animals. You said, “I’m going to ask people for information about this suspicious woman.” But at the time, I said something like, “Suspicious person.” How did you know her gender?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…!?” Kyoko’s face contorted slightly at Eisuke’s question, but her eyes immediately became more intense. “Well, that was just a hunch!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I admit it might have been a hunch. That’s why I didn’t say anything about it. But you were able to see all the witches, weren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko gulped. Eisuke held up his index finger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The way to activate the brainwashing magic is by touching the target directly or… using a wand or a magic stone. These are the two ways. But when Serika was brainwashed, nothing significant touched her body. So, after all, the brainwashing on the witches could only be brainwashing magic activated by means of a magic stone that had been loaded with magic beforehand.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But, no magic stone was found at that time…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Could it be because you take it away?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko stiffened at Eisuke’s abrupt question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Those stuffed animals were the ones with the magic stones, weren’t they?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko choked at Eisuke’s accusations.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“They say silence gives consent, don’t they? I was puzzled. I was wondering why you took such a dangerous thing that could lead you to be manipulated and took it home instead of burning it right there.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…B-But! No other woman who became a witch had anything like that! Don’t you remember!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, they didn’t, did they? Because you took them from them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke pulled Kyoko back even further.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You always use that “flame formation” that covers the perimeter with a high wall of flames when you fight, don’t you? You say it’s to keep the citizens out, but… it’s to retrieve the magic stone that’s attached to the witch so that no one can see you, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">That wall of flames was high enough to hide Eisuke. It should be easy to secretly retrieve the magic stones that the women carried after they became witches were defeated.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re wrong! Everything you say is speculation! If you’re so sure, show me the proof!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The proof is in your hand!” Eisuke pointed to the ribbon hair clip in Kyoko’s hand. “If I find a magic stone in that ribbon, you won’t have any more excuses, will you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I saw through all your plans. You’re going to turn Marielle into a witch before we leave here, and then you’re going to get rid of her under the pretext that it’s for the good of the town. That was the plan, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s face contorted. Kyoko bit her lip and leapt forward to retort.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I bought this ribbon in this town! Of course there’s a chance it might contain a magic stone!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see, so you’re going to admit there’s a magic stone in it. Hmm, good way to cover yourself…” Eisuke was impressed with her answers. But he snorted and urged her to continue. “Then take the magic stone out of that ribbon.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’ll know when we see it. You are the only possible mastermind.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At Eisuke’s provocation, Kyoko reluctantly opened the ribbon. …From it, a crystal-like stone rolled out. …It was a magic stone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“T-This magic stone. What is this…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko exclaimed. Eisuke laughed, but stifled the laughter soon after.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kuku, hahaha! You mean you were literally holding your heart in your hand?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The magic stone had a… heart mark engraved on it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Didn’t you notice? That big little girl put a heart mark on the stuffed animal’s eye. That’s the stuffed animal you took from Serika yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko’s face turned pale.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You said magic stones were expensive. If you’re collecting magic stones, what would you do with them… I’d rather reuse them. But what a coincidence. What do you think?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke looked at her smugly, and Kyoko lowered her head in frustration. This attitude was the best proof that she was the guilty one. Seeing this, Marielle stood puzzled next to Eisuke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“B-But why…? Why go to the trouble of manipulating someone with a tool and then defeating them yourself…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Because she wants to be on the side of justice.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“To exercise power and earn appreciation and respect, you must have enemies, don’t you? She made her own enemies and pretended to be on the side of justice.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“B-But that’s…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s face twisted in disappointment. Kyoko, the Hero… she wasn’t an ally of justice or anything. She was a mock Hero who created a fake enemy and defeated it herself. That was her true identity.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Aah, I’ve been found out.” When she looked up, Kyoko was no longer smiling a dignified and righteous smile… she was smiling a twisted, creepy and bewitching smile. “And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren’t for you meddling kids! …So, you know what will happen now, don’t you?” Kyoko unsheathed her greatsword with a jerk and…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Zuba!!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her sword unleashed a slash against the wall of the building. It created a large hole in it, which she cut in a criss-cross pattern. From there, Kyoko stepped outside into the large garden. …A flow of the situation that invited the battlefield. Eisuke laughed and jumped in as well, oblivious to her unusual murderous intent.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-164" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, you’re going to kill all the witnesses, aren’t you? This is too promising and funny.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You won’t be able to laugh for long. I am justice itself. …And justice will prevail.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What justice are you talking about, you clown? You’re just a villain. Well, I don’t care as long as I can fight you.” Eisuke turned his displeasure into a smile and turned his arms slightly to brace himself. And finally, with icy, steely, boiling, angry eyes, he looked at Kyoko. “…But Serika and Marielle are my precious friends. I don’t like them being put in danger. I’m not going to make it easy for you, so get ready, b̲i̲t̲c̲h̲.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-165" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke and Kyoko’s gazes met and sparks flew. Kyoko’s eyes narrowed tightly and she pointed the tip of her sword skyward. At that wild moment, with a Goo! on the blade of the sword, a red flame burst forth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll finish you off with one blow!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Kyoko shouted this, two fiery lumps of flame were summoned into the darkening sky. It was as if they were micrometeors. If they hit correctly, Eisuke and the others would become scorched earth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eat them!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-166" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">In response to Kyoko’s command, the mass of flames flew towards Eisuke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha, so finish me off in one fell swoop! I won’t let you do something so boring! Ka!!” Eisuke sneered. He crossed his arms on the spot and swung them. With a wave of his arms, he created a blast of air, which erased the flaming mass without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What?” Kyoko raised her voice. She looked closely at the scene before her. But no matter how many times she saw it, the fact that it happened remained immovable. With a wave of his arm, Eisuke had extinguished a meteoric mass of flames, as if he had blown out a candle with the air in his hand. Eisuke smirked.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-167" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn… So, how about this!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko lowered the still burning tip of her sword at an angle. As Eisuke watched cautiously, red sparks danced beneath his vision.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You don’t say!?” Eisuke quickly spun on his heels and jumped back…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He held Marielle, who was behind him, in his arms, and jumped to throw her diagonally upwards. Almost at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Gooooooh!!</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-168" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">A column of flames rose vigorously from the footsteps where Eisuke and Marielle had just been.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That was close…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko swung her sword even harder at Eisuke, who was holding Marielle by the waist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Burn to the bone!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Numerous columns of flames chased Eisuke and Marielle. With Marielle in his arms, Eisuke acrobatically dodged them with his superhuman physical abilities. Marielle’s eyes were dazzled by the intense sensation of floating as she was swept away by Eisuke’s inexhaustible dodges.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-169" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“M-My laaaaaady! Are you all right!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You should be worried about me! I’m the one who protects her and avoids the flames!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ugh, bwah…! I-I don’t feel so good…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, don’t throw up in my arms, Marielle!” Eisuke jumped high and landed on the wall of the building. He took another spring-like leap and charged at Kyoko. “Now it’s my turn!!” Eisuke extended his free right leg and charged at Kyoko.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…With a “Suka”, Eisuke’s leg ended up kicking the sky. The wind created by his strong legs blew downward, and Kyoko’s figure vanished.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Was it an illusion…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s a residue of heat.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko’s voice came from behind Eisuke. He turned around as fast as he could; a slash of flame was coming at him at close range. Marielle screamed and closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaah!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“God… dammit!” Almost by reflex, Eisuke kicked his opposite leg towards the slash. The ridiculous strength of Eisuke’s leg erased the fiery slash the moment it exploded. However, Eisuke lost his balance from the recoil and fell backwards with Marielle clutching at his chest. “Guha…! F̲u̲c̲k̲, you’ve got to be kidding me…!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-171" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke clicked his tongue and dodged only by ducking. It seemed that Kyoko’s ability to manipulate flames could even manipulate heat waves to create residual heat images. The air Kyoko emanated glowed with heat around her, and afterimages of her with her sword in her hand appeared all over the place. More than fifty Kyokos were laughing at the same time, not just ten or twenty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your power is indeed tremendous, but any attack is meaningless if it doesn’t hit, right? It’s like the two of us trying to see who will be hit first, isn’t it?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-172" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke looked at Kyoko, whose mouth was twisted in a bewitching manner, with a stern expression on his face. He placed a hand on Marielle’s shoulder and pulled her back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle, this way you won’t be in danger.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle recoiled at Eisuke’s words. All the residual kyoko held their swords diagonally backward. A tornado of flames engulfed the bodies of their swords.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-173" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Take this!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">And all of them at once unleashed a slash of flame. The sickle-shaped slash of flame struck Eisuke like a monster’s claw. Eisuke looked at it coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He stretched out his arms and stopped defending himself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In front of Marielle’s eyes, speechless…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Goooooo!</p>
<p class="calibre4">A searing burst of flames engulfed Eisuke’s entire body.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-174" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“M-Mister Eisuke!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle shouted as the storm of flames spread like a tower. Kyoko scoffed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hahaha, I was wondering what you were going to do, but I didn’t expect you to give up! Well, it was for the best! My flames of judgment will surely consume evil! These flames are my justice! You will be consumed along with your sins!” Kyoko’s cynical laugh echoed through the flames…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…That’s too much, isn’t it? So, who was going to burn?”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-175" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…What the…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The swirling flames were extinguished with an explosion of even greater force. Kyoko looked up in surprise at that moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…!? How are you… alive…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s whole body was on fire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s black silhouette, burning in the lotus-red flames, approached her easily, who was reflexively backing away. Eisuke smiled through the flames.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not going to burn to death just because I’m surrounded by flames. My training has already brought me to the brink of death.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-176" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s steel body, immovable even against a sword, was able to withstand the extreme heat of the flames with ease, just like heat-resistant glass. The pain of the burns did not appeal to his sense of pain at all; on the contrary, the flames burned into Eisuke’s arms and legs, becoming a part of him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The game was to see who would be the first to fall. I will not lose, even if I am consumed by your flames. If you play too much with fire, I’ll show you the horror of its burns myself!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke ran towards Kyoko, still engulfed in flames. She clicked her tongue and ran out to face him as well. At the same time, the other residual Kyokos ran past like obedient soldiers and attacked Eisuke at the same time. A moment later they were about to swing their swords above Eisuke’s head.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-177" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s useless for you to use clones! They can all go to hell!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke swung his left arm in a wide side slash.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Goooooooo!</p>
<p class="calibre4">The burst of force from Eisuke’s arm and the flames clinging to it mingled, creating a torrent of explosive flames. Swept away by the scorching storm, all the residual images were extinguished.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Impossible…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let’s gooooo!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-178" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Without pause, Eisuke’s flame-covered kick triggered a fierce clash with Kyoko’s sword. The flames collided with each other, and the heat from the flames was released with the pressure of the sword.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tsk… don’t underestimate me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko released a torrent of fire from the palm of her left hand, which was not holding the sword. The flames reached up to Eisuke’s cheek, who shook his head and ducked, causing the ends of his hair to fly into dust.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha, that’s nothing!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-179" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke didn’t flinch, and immediately threw a right to Kyoko’s chest. A painful blow, engulfed in flames. Kyoko was thrown backwards by the heat and impact of the blow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Guhaa…?!” Kyoko rolled on the ground. Somehow, using her sword as a support, she managed to get back up… but….</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was already running toward her at full speed. On his leg, a red flame burned to illuminate the evening darkness. It was… even bigger than when she received his most powerful flame attack.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-180" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I-It can’t be possible…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Eisuke’s right leg scraped furiously against the ground, creating a friction that made the flame burn even hotter. It grew so big that it could engulf Eisuke, and it violently soared towards the heavens to consume its enemies.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Justice is only ego when you call yourself its ally! Don’t drag my companions into your foul delirium!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke said sharply and jumped up. He planted his leg straight at her and pushed with all his might. Like a dragon, the flames swirled and bared their fangs at Kyoko. The dragon’s roar was shouted instead by Eisuke, who of course meant it. His throat quivered and he roared.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-181" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s flaming kick exploded into her torso.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko flew out, scorched by the flames, and crashed into the wall of her mansion; all the debris engulfed in flames. A red glow burned in her retinas. Eisuke flipped over and landed on the spot. He shook his leg to put out the remaining fire with wind, then just said:</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Judgment flames, right? If so, you’re the sinner who should be burned first.”</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">Don, don don!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika was attacked by wave bullets summoned by the robed woman with her magic. However, moving at great speed she managed to dodge them without any problems. The woman gritted her teeth in frustration at Serika’s agility.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Kuh…. What a speed…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s time to end this!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika said fiercely and instantly disappeared from the scene. The woman was shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wh-Where is… Guha!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika’s unexpected kick landed painfully in the side of the robed woman. Serika didn’t miss the opportunity as the woman staggered. She immediately turned around and jumped in front of her….</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ceaselessly and with blinding speed, she launched kicks at the woman. Ten kicks, a hundred kicks, no, maybe it was even a thousand kicks… Kicks unleashed like a machine gun stopping at no time. Even if a woman’s kick could be much lighter, if hundreds of kicks were delivered in a few seconds, the cumulative damage would far exceed that of a single heavy blow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ga, ha…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Before she knew it, the woman had collapsed in the middle of that barrage of blows, her eyes white. Serika stopped kicking like a rain of spears and fixed her hair that had gotten messy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Ahh, I’m sweating. Although the good thing is that I’m not even tired.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The words she said so languidly were only what a person with her qualities could say. They might not be as strong as the Heroes, but they were by no means weak, of course. They, like Eisuke, had greater capabilities than the average human.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Good job, Serika.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thanks, Yui. Sorry for making you wait.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika raised her hand slightly as Yui ran towards her. Just before the confrontation with the robed woman, Serika had offered to make peace with Yui. The reason was simple. Serika looked back with an icy stare.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That idiot saw my bra, and all because of her.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, are you still mad about that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course! I was manipulated, and on top of that I was seen half naked in public!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was hung in the air by a man-eater and my panties ended up exposed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t stand this world anymore…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And having your breasts exposed is something more trivial than when Eisuke was happy when, still brainwashed, you squeezed his face with your thighs.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey look at that, they took care of that problem too! Good job!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke, who had grabbed Hero Kyoko by the neck and had brought her over, walked over and asked Serika for a high-five. Serika raised her hand to the level of her palm and…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“M̲a̲s̲o̲c̲h̲i̲s̲t̲!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And now why is that!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She slapped him in surprise. Eisuke avoided it by arching his back just in time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t avoid me, you pervert with a thigh fetish!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have no idea what you mean by thigh-fetish m̲a̲s̲o̲c̲h̲i̲s̲t̲! Yui, you said something unnecessary, didn’t you!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t think what it could have been.” Yui turned away. She had been in a bad mood since yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kyoko looked at them resentfully as they talked nonsense. She had fresh wounds all over her body from Eisuke’s attack. She didn’t feel like fighting anymore, just ducked her head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Lady Kyoko…!? What the hell is going on!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…We’ve all been tricked.” It was Marielle, with her pure white beauty exposed to the dark night, whose dignified voice rang out among the noisy citizens.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Princess Marielle…! Why are you here…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s appearance made the crowd stir even more. Marielle nodded at the ensuing silence, and turned her attention to Kyoko. In a low voice, she spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The appearance of the witches was caused by the Hero herself. It was a selfish crime, committed because she wanted to be worshipped as a Hero of Justice.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The people sounded upset. They could not hide their surprise that the Hero they trusted was to blame for the incidents. Or, rather than surprise, perhaps disappointment or dismay.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How many times have we been betrayed by them?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle asked the citizens. Her eyes were clouded with disappointment and unfocused. Eisuke looked at Marielle’s hunched back and stopped the nonsense he was doing. He walked over to her and put his hand on her head reassuringly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Mister Eisuke?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hey, Hero. I don’t think everything you said was a lie.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle and even Kyoko were surprised at Eisuke’s words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sure it’s true that you’ve always wanted to be a Hero of Justice. …But that’s not what you really wanted.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So… now what are you saying…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You went to all that trouble to find people who adored you. But that’s not what you should have done: you should have made friends with someone and that person should have been by your side.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…” Kyoko bit her lip in a low, pitiful tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Justice was not something that should be sought and claimed for oneself. Justice was the highest praise another person could give in a friendly way. What she should never have done was a show of force: she should have sought a closer, more intimate relationship with the masses.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I made a mistake, huh?” Kyoko exhaled with self-mockery. Then she closed her eyes. “What I really wanted from Princess Marielle… as you…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she cut off her words and her lips pressed tightly together. Eisuke urged Marielle. Marielle understood what he meant and then nodded. Pale light particles of seven colors emerged, and a geometric magic circle appeared at Kyoko’s feet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I hope that loneliness and that hole in your heart will be filled in the other world…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">That was the best Marielle could do at that moment to say goodbye. A round ball floated in the corner of Kyoko’s eye as the light enveloped her. Was it a reflection of the light or…?</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">…That night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With a clatter, there was a knock at the door of Eisuke’s inn. Eisuke, who had been in a shallow sleep, was awakened by the noise.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm…? Who would think of coming here at this time of night…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Standing in the doorway was Marielle, dressed in a negligee. The moonlight made her blonde hair glow fantastically… illuminating even her melancholic expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s the matter? If you have to pee, I’m not going with you. Ask Rukino instead.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re making a mistake! Please let me in!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haa…? Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“J-Just let me come in!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke invited Marielle into the room before being pushed by her as she entered. Marielle sat on Eisuke’s bed without saying a word.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…A moment of silence followed. The only sound in the room was the creaking of the wooden bed in response to Marielle’s slight movements. Eisuke, unable to stand it any longer, looked at Marielle’s face curiously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What’s wrong with you, that’s disgusting.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So I was wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hah?” Eisuke raised his eyebrows at Marielle’s words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I still can’t believe Lady Kyoko was like that. I summoned her in hopes of defeating the Demon King, and entrusted her with my power, but she was the kind of person who would do such a thing…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hearing Marielle’s sorrowful voice, Eisuke involuntarily fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thinking back, first of all, I was already betrayed by the great Heroes I trusted, and this is what happened to me. I’m sure you told me that before, Mister Eisuke, didn’t you? You told me to learn to doubt people. After all, people… can’t be trusted, right?” Marielle’s voice sounded almost like she was squeezing it out. She turned her head and clutched the hem of her negligee, you could see the pain and sadness on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke ruffled her hair and sat beside her quietly. He rested his hands on the bed and exhaled.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-182" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…As with the counterpart of things, even people have their own. It’s about the desires we hold in our hearts and the things we hide. You have the desire to be protected, and of course I have the desire to protect you. Maybe at this moment I also want to push you on the bed and give you a hug.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I beg your pardon!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m kidding, you idiot. We’re in the middle of a serious conversation.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, but wasn’t it you who made that joke without any delicacy first…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s face scrunched up, unconvinced. She patted her cheek to cool the excess heat, and Eisuke told her in a tired voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not going to say I didn’t think she was that kind of person. It’s your fault for being an idiot who lacks imagination. If you think about it, you shouldn’t trust strangers so easily.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But that’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then just pick the right people to trust.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle looked at Eisuke. He looked into her sapphire eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want to accept everything about this person, both inside and out. You can only trust a person who makes you feel this way with all your might. Trusting means having feelings for someone on the basis of time and accumulated memories. It’s not something you selfishly expect from them.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Having feelings for someone…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle remembered. She thought of Rukino, who had always been with her. Yui and Serika, who fought for her in response to her sudden summoning. And… Eisuke. The time she spent with them came vividly to her mind. She should believe in people, based on that irreplaceable time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let me repeat it in more words. …Marielle, learn to doubt people. Try to think hard about what you don’t see. And if you can see the other person clearly… only then trust that person with all your heart. Believe in yourself that you want to believe in others, not others.” Eisuke smiled softly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle had seen Eisuke smile many times. A wicked smile, as if he was up to something. Or an innocent, childlike smile, as if he was really enjoying himself. And then there were the occasional gentle smiles, like this one. That smile…Marielle loved it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle rested her head on Eisuke’s shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Marielle?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Tomorrow we’re finally going to the Imperial Capital…” Marielle looked over her shoulder at Eisuke. “…Are you going to take this country back from them?”</p><span></span>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Q649zGw/000003.png" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">Marielle asked with a tone of voice that expressed confidence in him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fighting to prove his strength. Crushing the strong for pleasure. That was Eisuke’s way of fighting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That was why Marielle dared to ask. She asked if she could trust her own feelings in Eisuke’s battles and have him take care of them. He had defeated three heroes, Ken, Hiroto and Kyoko, and had given Marielle hope.</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘…I’ll lend you a hand until you get your country back in full.’</p>
<p class="calibre4">She wanted to confirm those words once again, so she asked him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll give you a hand until you get your country back. Don’t hesitate for a moment.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke replied with a confident smile. Marielle’s heart raced, her lips tightened and she let out a small squeak. Joy, courage and love welled up in her heart and spurred her to action.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle extended her index finger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Mister Eisuke, you too…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whatever, do it too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke didn’t understand what was going on, but he did as he was told and stuck out his index finger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Their fingertips touched with a tap.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Good evening, Mister Eisuke.” Marielle, embarrassed, left the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? What was that just now?”</p>
