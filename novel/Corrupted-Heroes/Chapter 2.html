<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p class="calibre4">The five of them spent the night on the beach.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Transferred to another world, meeting the princess and her friends, and fighting Ken, the Hero…, After encountering so many different events, Eisuke seemed to have accumulated fatigue without realizing it, and although he was lying on some large leaves in the sand, where it would be very difficult to sleep, he fell asleep like a log.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…And so came the morning of the second day of life in another world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm?” Eisuke woke up with a strange feeling. What jumped into his eyes was the blue sky and white clouds. He felt comfortable waking up to such a comforting scenery. “…No…” He was wrong. That wasn’t the only thing that made him feel comfortable. There was a clearer, more comfortable feeling in his body. It was soft, smooth, and at the same time fresh…, he felt that sensation in his shoulders and waist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Suu… suu…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nn… mm…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as he was aware of this sensation, the breath of someone asleep hit his earlobe.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nn… hehehe…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mu… nn.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hehehe, my lady…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke only raised his head to check that Yui was on his right arm and Marielle was on his left. Also, Serika was hugging Yui, and Rukino was hugging Marielle, all of them asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle rubbed her face against Eisuke’s chest with her light blonde hair, tickling him as he lay there with asleep. Rukino hugged Marielle, in turn also clinging to Eisuke’s leg. Serika was doing the same, curling her healthy, meaty thighs around Eisuke’s legs and hugging Yui’s waist. And Yui…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eisuke… hehehe…”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-108" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">She was holding Eisuke’s arms tightly as if she wanted to wrap them with her big breasts disproportionate for her height.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He had girls on both arms, and girls clinging to his legs. It was a very useful composition for a harem, but Eisuke’s feeling was as if stray cats were using him as a bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke looked to the side with cold eyes. …Each of the girls had rolled and clung to him showily from where they had been sleeping. Eisuke took a deep breath and…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This way of sleeping is wrong, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“E-Eh? What’s wrong?”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/4fB8PCY/000000.png" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">“A-Are we under attack!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up and get away from me right now, you idiots!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He gave the girls a merciless shout to wake them up.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">After waking up…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I’m sorry, Mr. Eisuke.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aah… I want to die… why did I fall asleep like that yesterday…!”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle and Serika said in shame in front of Eisuke, covering their faces. Eisuke folded his arms and said resentfully to the girls, who had very red ears:</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m just warning you. Next time, I’m going to grope your breasts and buttocks without holding back.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re the worst! This guy is a real danger, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now, now. Let’s get this over with now that we’ve had a good night’s sleep, shall we? …Otherwise, I’m going to die of embarrassment.” Rukino coughed, her cheeks flushed, and in her hand was a plate served on a sheet. She had prepared a simple breakfast with berries she had picked in the forest and fish she had caught in the shallows. It was a simple meal, but it was a masterpiece that could not have been made just with random ingredients.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Rukino, did you cook this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, it’s simple. I hope it suits your palate.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Rukino is amazing! She can create a dish out of nothing! As expected of an Imperial knight…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What does that have to do with being a knight?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, it’s just delicious! You’re good, Rukino, the imperial housekeeper.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean with imperial housekeeper!? I’m a full-fledged knight!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As they teased Rukino, they all feasted on the food she had prepared. That’s when Serika tried to put a fish skewer in her mouth… and stopped short.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, what are you doing, Yui?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, don’t “what do you mean” me. You have an expression on your face like you’re in a daze.” Serika looked at Yui, who had wet eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui bowed her head… and huddled next to Eisuke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Aren’t you guys too close?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke let out a dry laugh at Serika’s frown.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haha, so you finally figured it out, Serika.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You should have been the first one to say it. …So, what are you doing, Yui? Was that guy groping your breasts and butt while you were sleeping? Hurry up and get away from him. Otherwise, he’ll get you pregnant.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No way! And this time, I haven’t groped her yet!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, hey, Rukino… If I let him touch my breasts, will I get pregnant…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My lady, please cover your ears right now! Hey, you! Don’t you dare talk about such vulgar things in front of my lady!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I really don’t care.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the midst of the banter, the three of them froze when Yui said those words. …Only Marielle, who had a bright red face, had her eyes and ears covered by Rukino. Yui said that with the same expressionless face as always.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I don’t care what Eisuke does to me…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What are you saying?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui declared without a care in the world while sticking tightly to Eisuke. The one who was most stunned was the one who was approached like that. Yui looked at him and tilted her head. Eisuke was speechless at the sight of her small animal-like beauty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No-no, now what are you talking about!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, you! What’s this all about?! You’re not threatening Yui, are you?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gah!? Let me go! You’ve got it all wrong! Don’t be confusing me with that perverted hero!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika immediately grabbed Eisuke by the chest as she didn’t understand what was going on. The latter roughly shook her off and complained in a displeased tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know why. She’s been like this ever since she found out I was the “Yankee hunter”.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? What’s with that stupid nickname?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do you want me to hit you? No, well, I didn’t give it to myself… The thing is, that’s how I was known in our original world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When she was finally free of Rukino, Marielle asked Yui.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Lady Yui already knew Mr. Eisuke? How was it that hap…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You really care about me, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui interrupted her with a deadpan tone. Then she turned to Eisuke and put her hand on his chest. Yui’s small hand caressed Eisuke’s chest, tickling him just above his heart. She looked directly at Eisuke and said plainly:</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve always liked you, Eisuke.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s why I’m asking, how did that happen!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It just happened.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was shocked. He, who had defeated the Hero all by himself yesterday, was flinching at the onslaught of a single girl.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hmm, I see, so that’s what you mean.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Lady Serika?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle looked at Serika and gave her a doubtful look. Serika’s dismay had been replaced by a mischievous smile, as if she was planning something.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Rukino, what are we going to do now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika turned to Rukino with a beaming smile. The latter was a bit taken aback by her appearance, but cleared her throat and replied in a serious tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…If you guys are really going to fight for this country, the first priority should be to retake the imperial capital. Then we can bring the Imperial Knights back to our side.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The first objective is to head to the imperial capital and kick the ass of the Hero who controls it. How far is the imperial capital from here?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke pushed Yui away and leaned forward. Rukino thought and spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“From here, we’ll have to go through two other cities… three days at most.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Two cities, huh? Is it possible there are Heroes there too?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. The Heroes have taken over each city and do what they want. I don’t know the details, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then let’s blow them away too!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re talking as if it’s going to be a walk in the park…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika was taken aback by Eisuke, who wasn’t afraid of anything. He stood up, slapping his knee.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, if that’s the case, let’s get ready! Let’s go to the first city!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hyah, ye-yes…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle frowned as Eisuke slapped her hard on the back. But her face didn’t turn sour. It wasn’t going to be an easy journey to overthrow the Heroes… Eisuke was jumping with excitement, while Yui kept attacking him. Marielle forgot about her bad feeling and started laughing, involuntarily inspired by his cheerful and jovial appearance.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">At that moment Marielle was drawn into Serika’s arms and Serika put her hands on her shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wha-what are you…, wha-what’s going on?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Can you hear me, Marielle? A very important mission just came up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Those two are very close together.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What?” Marielle’s head jerked back at Serika’s cryptic words.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">The five of them had made their way through the forest and were almost over the mountains. In an hour or so, they would reach Melwa, the first city they had to pass through before reaching the imperial capital.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eisuke, is there anything I can do for you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Well, there is something.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke said to Yui, wearily. …She was more than close, walking with her arm entwined in his.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…It’s hard to walk like this, move away from me a little.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I see, I get it…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui obediently let go of Eisuke’s arm. Just when he was wondering why…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she grabbed Eisuke’s arm and pressed it against her broad chest. He immediately withdrew his hand, using his natural reflexes to the fullest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What… hey, you idiot, what are you doing?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I thought you wanted to touch me, since I felt your gaze on my breast.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I never said anything about that, did I?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I simply asked, “Is there anything I can do for you?” Although you didn’t say it, your heartbeat, gaze and breathing told me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t use your ability for something so trivial! So, your ability really is dangerous after all!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In front of Yui Koisuke, a girl with highly developed senses, even the arrogant Eisuke couldn’t hide the inferiority complexes of a high school boy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“La-Lady Yui! A woman shouldn’t do something so embarrassing…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle, over here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh-eh!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika pulled Marielle’s dress as she tried to go to Eisuke and Yui, who were walking in front of her, to admonish Yui.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wha-what are you doing!”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Stop it, don’t tell them anything, and don’t stop them either. This is an operation.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Operation…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I already told you. We’re going to bring them together. Let’s make them lovers.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Lovers…” Marielle’s face turned red at the mere mention of the word. She was a 14-year-old girl who didn’t even know how babies were born, and she put her hands to her cheek. “Lo-Lovers means, uh, sending each other love letters…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are we in the Heian period? I don’t know how love affairs are conducted in this world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, as far as I know, that culture does not exist in this world either. My lady’s knowledge of romance is no different from that of a five-year-old child.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Rukino! Don’t make fun of me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry. You don’t need such unnecessary knowledge, my lady.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Rukino, that smile scares me. I can feel it. I can feel your strong will to keep Marielle away from men for the rest of her life.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino grabbed Marielle by the shoulders and smiled at her, but it was too terrifying to keep her from feeling fear. To which Serika sighed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You must at least know about kissing. Isn’t that what lovers do?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ki-Ki-Kissing…!? What do you mean kissing, um…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aah, so at least you know what a kiss looks like, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Um, shamelessly and gently touching the tip of your index finger to the tip of someone else’s?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s so embarrassing about that? No, it’s too annoying to even correct it, yeah, that’s it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika, who had been taken aback, responded. Marielle hid her face as she said, “Hiyawawa!” She had sexual knowledge less than that of a five-year-old.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You know? That doesn’t matter anymore, but I’m going to set that guy up with Yui anyway. I don’t know what it is about Yui, but she seems to like him, so it’s perfect.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The-Then… What about Mr. Eisuke’s feelings…? I thought love was something that both parties should be willing to do…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle said modestly, sounding unenthusiastic. Serika approached her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, Marielle. I’ll tell you one good thing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika prepared to tell Marielle with a straight face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There are romances in the world that start with boobs.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t like that kind of love!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was too vulgar to even call it a saying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But look at that. Take a look.” Serika pointed in a way that Yui wouldn’t be noticed. …Yui’s breasts were discreetly hidden by the large size of her sweatshirt, but they were still impressive enough that her silhouette stood out clearly when viewed from the side. Rukino, sweat beading on her forehead. said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ce-Certainly…. That’s a brutal force.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Perhaps Yui’s superhuman characteristics are really those?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be that, can it?!” Marielle said, groaning at Serika’s red-faced, distant gaze. “A-Anyway! Why do you have to make those two be lo-lovers in the first place anyway?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you talking about? If they become lovers, it will be easier for her to take the reins of the relationship. If Yui makes use of her romantic feelings, maybe that troubled boy will become more mature.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">If Eisuke became infatuated with Yui, he would start to pay more or less attention to her. And Yui was a girl with a good personality to begin with. If Serika could get them to become boyfriend and girlfriend, she could control him somehow. …In other words, she might be able to indirectly control that arrogant battle addict, Eisuke Tsurugi.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I see… indeed, the guy looks reliable, but there’s an air of uncertainty about what he might do if left unchecked… It might be worth a try.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right? It’s a plan that won’t hurt anyone.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle listened to Serika and Rukino’s exchange and looked vaguely at Eisuke and Yui standing together. …For some reason, a feeling of lack of conviction for Serika’s plan remained in Marielle’s heart.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">And so, Eisuke and his group arrived in the city of Melwa. For him, it was the first time he had seen a city of this other world. He shouted excitedly.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“What a beautiful city!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as they arrived in the city, they were greeted by a huge garden, a field of flowers. Red, yellow, blue and other colorful flowers were in full bloom, their petals dancing in the wind. It was a fantastic sight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Melwa used to be a thriving tourist city. There are many tourist spots, including this flower garden. …That’s why it’s famous as a place for couples to visit.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? Then it’s perfect.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? Why is perfect?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s nothing ♡.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke looked at Serika with a suspicious face as she tried to disguise it with a big smile. Marielle, who was wearing a hood so as not to stand out and be targeted by the Heroes, looked around and made a worried face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The streets are beautiful… and the people look normal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the medieval western style stone streets, there was no trace of the tyrannical domination. All the people walking the streets looked quite normal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Could it be that the Hero is gone?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey~, Hero! I’m here to kick your ass, so come on out!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, stop, you’re talking too loud! Please don’t provoke him!” Marielle scolded Eisuke, who had started shouting next to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui looked up suddenly. Eisuke noticed her reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…No, nothing…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey you guys, get away from this place now!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that moment, a panicked voice reached them. As they turned around with a suspicious look, they saw a young man running towards them from the other side. His face was distorted with a sense of urgency for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Quick! It’s not safe to be in this city!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? Who are you, and what are you saying…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A moment later, he was about to answer something.</p>
<p class="calibre4">BOGO! and the floor of the flower garden rose up vigorously, and something jumped out of it. Immediately after, several more things jumped out from the surroundings. One after another, they made holes in the ground and flew out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shaaaaaaaaaa!” A huge monster with a large mouth, which looked like a flytrap plant, emitted a strange, screeching sound. Around it, several green ivy vines writhed as if they were living creatures.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A Man-Eater!? Why is there a deep forest monster here…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Watch out, my lady!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, Kyaa!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">To Marielle’s dismay, Rukino’s warning didn’t come in time. The five of them were attacked by the vines. Eisuke, Serika and Rukino were able to use their physical fitness to avoid them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui and Marielle, who had failed to escape, were caught by the vines. Marielle was left hanging upside down and struggled to hold on to the skirt of her dress that was sliding down due to gravity, but the part she failed to hold on to exposed her thighs and buttocks. Rukino was enraged at the humiliating appearance in which her mistress had ended up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My-My Lady! You must not let go of that cloth! Your panties, the princess’s panties must not be exposed to the public!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t say “panties” out loud, you idiot! Wha-What about Lady Yui…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle glanced sideways at Yui, who was also hanging upside down in the air, her legs trapped by the vines. Her pleated skirt had slipped all the way down under gravity, exposing her black lace underwear nonchalantly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Lady Yui! You-You’re being seen!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…It’s okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How is it going to be all right?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s voice betrayed the fact that Yui’s cheeks were slightly flushed, but she kept her calm attitude with both hands hanging in the air. …Eisuke, who had turned his face away, but still had a perfect angle, let out a thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Who knew. She’s wearing something unexpectedly erotic.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is no time to talk about it! Free us!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A high school girl being caught by a tentacled monster and suspended in mid-air with her underwear hanging exposed, now that’s another world, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Not a good time to talk about incomprehensible things! This is bad…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As they joked, countless tentacles attacked them. As the three jumped aside, the tentacles landed in place like missiles and pierced the stone floor with a clatter. Serika blanched at the sheer power of the attack.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What the hell is that? If we get hit, we’re in trouble!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s what I was going to say! Man-Eaters are very powerful plant-type monsters! They’re dangerous and eat people!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tsk…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke clicked his tongue at the sight of Marielle, who was being pulled closer to the monster’s mouth every moment, picked up a stone fragment near the holes made by the tentacles. Then he waved his arm like a pitcher.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was still admiring the beautiful flower garden, hah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke threw the stone at the monster’s head with all his strength.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A fierce explosion burst into the air and a gust of wind hit the surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The pebble was launched with the ridiculous speed of a comet by the force of Eisuke’s arm, and became a small meteorite that hit the Man-Eater in the lower jaw and smashed into its head. The man-eater flinched and released Yui and Marielle from its grip.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino caught Marielle, and Serika caught Yui. The man-eater’s head was crushed and its terrible corpse covered the flower garden. Eisuke clapped his hands and looked at the ruined garden, spitting in disgust.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You ruined the flower garden, you haughty fern. Are you all right, Yui, Marielle?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui straightened her skirt and made a small bow to Eisuke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I’m sorry I gave you trouble.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It was no big deal. It’s like being praised for throwing a stone.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“As I guessed, you’re amazing, Mr. Eisuke…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle let out a half guilty look as Eisuke was forced to act. She suddenly noticed that the young man next to her, who at first warned Eisuke and the others, was trembling. His hair was somewhere between brown and black. Eisuke pointed at him with his chin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey you, you seem to know what’s going on. Tell me the whole story.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, erm…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mr. Eisuke, say things more tactfully!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle intervened, admonishing Eisuke for his irreverent attitude. The young man looked at her carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aren’t you Princess Marielle…!? How did you end up here…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, hahaha… it happens that some things occurred. But the most important thing is that you tell us about this monster. …Man-Eaters are not monsters that normally appear in a city like this. What’s going on?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle asked, and he looked down with a bitter look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s the Hero’s fault…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke narrowed his eyes. His expression lit up at the longed-for word “Hero”. At that moment, the young man muttered under his breath with his eyes lowered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This city is ruled by a Hero whose true identity is unknown. That’s why… relations between men and women are forbidden.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The five of them, in unison, tilted their heads.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">In a square with a large fountain in the city. There, sitting on a bench, Eisuke and the others asked him about the situation. The young man’s name seemed to be Marc, and he spoke with a somber expression.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“The name of the Hero who appeared in this city is… Hiroto.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hiroto… does that name mean anything to you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No… I’m sorry, I don’t remember him. There are so many heroes, and I only met them the first time I summoned them…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle said apologetically in response to Eisuke’s question. Marc shook his head at Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s impossible that you remembered them all. He’ll most likely hide his face anyway.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What did you say?” Eisuke frowned and urged him to continue the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…He wears a mask so we can’t recognize his face. He rode into town on a wyvern and told us, “I’m putting this town under my supervision from now on. There shall be no fraternization between men and women of any kind. If you are found doing anything of that kind in this town, the monsters will attack you. I will be watching this city at all times”.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why? why, of all things, can’t there be romance? Does he think he’s a celebrity or something?”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Serika asked a perfectly reasonable question. But Marc shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know. …But this town was originally a tourist town. If dating is banned, there will be fewer visitors and the city will be less vibrant than before. Just take a look around. No one talks beyond what’s strictly necessary, see?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s eyes widened when he pointed this out. There were certainly people in this city, but… she couldn’t see an atmosphere of harmony anywhere. There were no conversations to be heard anywhere, and there was no group of two people or more. …In this town people just lived.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In fact, I have seen with my own eyes many times people gathered together who disregarded the Hero’s words suddenly being attacked by a griffin or a wyvern. Even if at the time the masked Hero was not around. Even since he arrived, we have not seen him again, but whenever he smells the scent of men and women interacting, he attacks. We are… under surveillance.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be… how is it possible…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Griffins, wyverns… they are all high-ranking monsters quite difficult to eliminate. But how could they reach the city and attack people with such pinpoint accuracy…?”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle and Rukino grunted out of helplessness. Eisuke snorted, as if mocking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s clear you’re idiots. I guess what he does is “summon monsters and forcibly control them”.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino choked at Eisuke’s blunt statement. The griffins and wyverns, as well as the man-eater that appeared earlier, were monsters that normally an imperial knight alone would never be able to defeat. At the very least, they were monsters that would require a group of ten or more skilled knights to eliminate. The fact that Eisuke had finished one off with just a few pebbles wasn’t worrisome for now, but if the enemy had the ability to use such a vile monster at will, it would be quite troublesome.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Even if the Hero isn’t present, he always knows when a man and a woman are together, and sends monsters after them…? Haha, I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you think?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle frowned looking at Eisuke, who lifted the corners of his mouth in amusement. He folded his arms and raised his index finger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In fact, having the others think that the Hero is not present is what he wants them to do.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle, you should think more about how to make mischief.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes-Yes, sorry… wait, why am I apologizing…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke pointed at Marielle, who was still wondering why she was apologizing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s clear that the Hero is hiding in the city without his mask.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No one knows his real face, do they? Then he’s probably hiding in town, guarding the city G-Man<a href="#calibre_link-13" name="_ftnref1" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre1">[1]</a> style. It would be very stimulating for him to be able to see the faces of those who think they won’t be detected and are secretly getting together taking such a risk.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You have to have a very twisted character to come up with such an idea.”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Serika made a sour face at Eisuke’s reasoning, who spoke with a sly smile. Inwardly, however, everyone present was impressed by his conjecture. At first glance, he exuded an aura of savagery and rudeness, but he possessed both the overwhelming skill to defeat a Hero head-on and the thinking ability to draw accurate conclusions from bits and pieces of information. Ironically, he was the one who radiated the aura of a pre-2000s movie slasher. Eisuke pounded his fist against his palm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, now we know what we’re going to do. Guessing the identity of this Hero will be an event in this city.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But how will we do it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino asked Eisuke. It was hard to believe that the Hero would be the kind of man who would come out when you called him. Eisuke put his hand to his chin and let out a “Hmm”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Yui.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui asked in response with a flat tone. Eisuke scratched his cheek a bit and then pointed at her in an almost inaudible tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you and I pretend to be lovers, the Hero will surely send his monsters after us. That will mean he’ll be watching us where we can see him too. We’ll find him and drag him here. So… I’ll stay with you for the rest of the day, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke said, perhaps hiding his embarrassment, in a deliberately shy tone of voice. Yui’s expressionless face broke into a smile after a moment of indifference.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I understand. I’m looking forward to working with you for a long time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I told you it’s just for today.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I’m afraid the plan is a little too perfect…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haha. You think so too?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, no, it’s not about that, but it’s okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika felt even luckier that her own “plan to get Eisuke and Yui together” was also so in tune with the situation, but Eisuke didn’t know that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be…” Marielle stared at Eisuke and Yui, somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…My lady, is something wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…No, it’s nothing…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle cleared her throat when Rukino looked at her with an anxious expression. …Yui turned to look at Marielle suddenly. Marielle was startled when Yui turned her attention to her out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“La-Lady Yui? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, nothing…” Yui tried to say something, but was silenced first.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Something’s coming…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that moment, a gale hit Eisuke and the others from above. A black shadow covered the sky above them. And then it landed behind Marielle with a thud.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-109" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A deafening scream shook the whole city. The beast’s wings flapped menacingly causing the wind to blow. The upper half of its body was that of an eagle, and the lower half was that of a lion, its appearance alone unconsciously inspiring awe… Eisuke’s eyes bugged out at the legendary creature he was witnessing for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My lady!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle screamed, and Rukino quickly drew her into her arms to protect her. What appeared behind Marielle was the same griffin they had been talking about. Eisuke laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it too early!? Yui, Serika! You guys look around for suspicious people! I’ll take care of the monster!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What, you can take care of that thing all by yourself?!” Serika was overwhelmed by the griffin and worried about him at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gyaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Bashuuuu!</p>
<p class="calibre4">The griffin released a shockwave of wind from its beak like a tidal wave. Eisuke looked at the mass of air attacking him, which destroyed the pavement on the ground as if it was peeling it off.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Come on!” He shouted, and stretched his right arm out to the front.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-110" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">…The explosion he caused with his arm erased the wind blast without a trace. Eisuke gave him a hateful grin in profile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, how about that, don’t forget who you’re talking to!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, that’s right, you´re a stupid gorilla!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Who are you calling a stupid gorilla!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika clicked her tongue in disgust and disappeared from the scene, taking Yui with her. Meanwhile, the griffin attacked Eisuke with its sharp claws. A crushing blow with a force that no human could ever hope to match hovered over his head.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-111" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmph!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, Eisuke met him head-on with a hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, hey, what’s the matter, did you think you could defeat me with just that little strike?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gu, gyah…?” The griffin raised a voice in dismay. The swipe of its claws did not crush it, but only pushed it back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The griffin was a being of very high rank among the monsters. In the pyramid of biological monsters, it could be said to reign almost at the top. …But it was unlucky to be here in this city. Eisuke, who had trained so hard that he surpassed humans, was a being that easily skipped even the top of the pyramid.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-112" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s how you finish off your opponent in one blow!” Eisuke pushed the griffin backwards and grabbed it by the top as it backed up. “Take that!” A tremendous heel strike slammed into the top of the griffin’s head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gah, gyaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Baghan! A ridiculous sound of impact was heard, and the griffin crashed to the ground. Its beak and face slammed into the hard stone, hitting it with a “BECKOOM!” and the ground cratered. Just like that, the griffin made no other sound. The blow had been such that you could even feel a little sorry for it.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-113" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-You defeated the griffin… with one blow!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“U-Unbelievable…!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Neither Rukino nor Marc could even raise their voices in surprise. Even if dozens of imperial knights fought together, the odds would be 50%, but Eisuke finished off the monster with a single heel strike. This was no human feat, whichever way you looked at it. Shaking his leg slightly, Eisuke immediately turned his attention to something else.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yui, Serika, how’s it going!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-114" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Yui and Serika answered Eisuke’s call. Serika, however, shrugged her shoulders and shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well… there was no one obviously suspicious, though. I thought he’d be doing something flashy, since he controls the monsters…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What about you, Yui, did you find anything suspicious?” Eisuke looked at Yui.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui was silent for a while with her usual emotionless face. …But then she shook her head a little.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…No, me neither. There was no suspicious person.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-115" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Even you…? I see. He seems to play hide-and-seek very well, doesn’t he?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke ruffled his hair in disgust, but smiled like a child who really played hide-and-seek. He couldn’t help it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Lady Yui?” The only one who noticed Yui’s fingers twitching and looked sideways was Marielle.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">At a certain coffee shop in Melwa.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke and Yui were sitting across from each other as if they were a couple on a date. Marielle, Rukino, Serika and Marc, who had come as a guide, were watching them from a small distance.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was looking at Yui in front of him with his cheek resting on his hands, wondering why the four of them were staring at them. She picked up the parfait she had ordered and offered Eisuke a spoonful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eisuke, please say “aaah”…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t even think about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But if you don’t, we won’t look like boyfriend and girlfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re already a target just by being a man and a woman together. There’s no need to go any further.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then you give me the food.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Did you hear what I said? I’m not going to make any extra effort!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aaah…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t try to push me! I won’t do it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui parted her cherry red lips, to which Eisuke in response put his hand to his forehead, displeased that Yui didn’t seem to be paying him the slightest bit of attention.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haa…. You know, there’s another reason why I chose you as a partner.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And why was that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Because of yesterday. Come on, tell me how you know me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was indignant and pointed at her. Yui fell silent and turned her face down.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/7jnDBVx/000007.png" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">“Eisuke, it’s because you helped me.”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-116" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In the past, when I was attacked by fearsome people, the one who came to my rescue… was you, the “Yankee Hunter”.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She told him shyly. Eisuke was finally convinced by this simple reason and leaned back as if he wanted to relax.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What, so that’s what it was… Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I’m sorry. Somehow, it’s more like a habit.” Yui let out a sigh. The gesture was a bit of self-mockery. “I don’t like to talk about myself. Most of the things I see and hear, people don’t understand them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke was involuntarily silent. Yui could sense things that no ordinary human being could. Strange sounds, smells. He wondered how many people had truly believed her so far. He could certainly understand her. Humans never truly accepted what they didn’t understand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I suppose they did. But don’t think I’m the same as them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke gave her an unusually sincere look. Yui’s eyes flickered, and he said calmly:</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have abilities like yours. Even if everyone else in the world can’t understand you and doubt you, I won’t. So, you don’t have to worry about that at all. I’ll listen to whatever nonsense you have to say.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke joked with his thumb pointing at his own chest. …After a moment of silence, Yui:</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Is that a proposal? That just now, that was a proposal, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s how you’re taking it?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I really think that was a proposal, no matter who hears it, they’ll think the same.” She said with a calm face. …While hiding behind a poker face the fact that her heart was beating abnormally high inside and her chest felt weird.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since that day, Eisuke had been Yui’s fated person. The merciless and obscene sounds of the crowded streets that didn’t stop to pay attention to Yui being attacked by thugs with their nasty vulgar voices. She still remembered the sound of his footsteps, running in a straight line like a beam of light, making his way through the crowd. And she would never forget the words he said to her, like a confession of love. For Yui, Eisuke was, and still is, the only person who made her feel happy to have this unusual ability.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">I knew it, I knew that Eisuke-san was…,</em> Yui almost said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She spoke, and her complexion changed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Um, Eisuke, well, actually, for a while now…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaaaaaaaahhh!!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, Marielle’s scream resounded. Eisuke quickly stood up and turned around.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle and the others had gotten up and were looking up at the sky. In front of their gaze, a twisted black mass was floating in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is that…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui reacted before anyone else. Eisuke noticed it too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…It was a swarm of bat-shaped monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Killer bats!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marc shouted. Eisuke jumped over the tent fence and asked Rukino.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What the hell is that monster! Is it strong!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“They attack in packs and suck the blood of humans! If one of them catches you, they’ll come in droves!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha! Then I’ll make every last one of them go away before they get here! Take this!” With a roar, Eisuke waved his arms in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…With that alone, a storm raged, swallowing the killer bats in its turbulence. The winds that enveloped the killer bats blew their army straight up into the sky. …After the storm cleared, there were none of them left in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wha-What a mess….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No matter how many small fries he sent, they’ll all end up the same, just like the yankees, eh!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It sounds like a bad guy’s line…” Marielle looked at Eisuke, who laughed with a “Gahaha”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But, as I thought, this Hero seems to be quite skilled.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino gave a small snort and stood in thought. Eisuke stopped laughing and frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, killer bats are monsters that originally only dwell deep within the dangerous dungeons of this continent. The average person who doesn’t dive into dungeons doesn’t even know they exist. Even my lady wouldn’t know about them, would she?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes… I never heard of such a monster either.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle replied uneasily, remembering the killer bats. Eisuke anticipated her words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see… If he sends such a monster to us, it means he is a skilled person who has gone through a dangerous dungeon and has such monsters under his control.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He’s the kind of person who can control a griffin. Wasn’t something like that to be expected?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well… if you put it that way. No, what am I saying, seeing these monsters is really weird.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At what Serika said, Rukino folded her arms with a self-conscious look. Eisuke shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’d be in trouble if there wasn’t someone so skilled. If we’re talking about a Hero, wouldn’t it be more appropriate for him to send dragons or something, instead of those bats that no one knows about… huh?” Then Eisuke stood for a moment thinking.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong, Eisuke?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino blinked. Eisuke put his finger to his chin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If what Rukino was saying was true… there was something bothering him a little. Eisuke silently let that little thought run through his brain. Like a runaway light, the memory of the conversation reappeared in his brain, and….</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Right…! That has to be…!” Eisuke growled under his breath. …How had he not noticed such an obvious contradiction? “…Hey, Yui… don’t you already know who the suspicious guy is?”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui’s eyes widened. That reaction alone was enough. Eisuke hugged Yui’s shoulder and smiled showing his teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I knew it. You’re really amazing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I figured it out too. You’re the only one who understood.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s smile as he said this was like that of an innocent child who had found the right answer to a riddle. He turned to Marc with that smile on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, did you say your name was Marc?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, yeah, why?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Where is the biggest and easiest place to get around in this city?”</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">The largest and easiest place to move around in the city. It was a gentle hill overlooking the city of Melwa. The reddish-orange light contrasted with the shadows and illuminated the city, impressing Eisuke and his companions with its quiet beauty.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hey, Mr. Eisuke, is the Hero really in this city? Maybe those creatures came here by coincidence?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Hey you. Hero… are you here?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Huh?” Marielle couldn’t believe what she was hearing, at that moment…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m talking to you!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gufu!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Eisuke slammed his fist backwards at Marc.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marc stomped his foot and stepped back. All the women, except Yui, were stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mi-Mister Eisuke! Can you explain to me why you did it…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re Hiroto, the Hero, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle and the others turned around in astonishment. Marc was clutching his stomach, with a frown on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Guh… Wha-What are you talking about…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I became suspicious at Rukino’s explanation of the Killer Bats. Hey, Rukino, you said that Killer Bats are rare monsters, right? You said they are little known monsters that only exist in dangerous dungeons.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yes… Yes, but….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino nodded her head still hesitantly. Eisuke then spoke and then turned his doubtful eyes towards Marc.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It was because of that. It’s hard to believe that the moment the horde of monsters entered the scene, he shouted “Killer Bats!” before anyone else.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hah…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle and the others gasped in belated realization as well. How was it possible for a mere city youth to know of the existence of the Killer Bats that dwelled in the depths of the dungeons?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It just happened! I just knew about them, and…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So that was a coincidence too? I mean about you seeing the couples being attacked on their secret dates. That’s weird too if you think about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What…? And what’s so strange about that…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why are you looking at me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I mean, why would you be watching a couple secretly dating so no one would find out? And you did it more than once.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Tha-That’s…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I see…!” Serika clapped her hands. Ever since the Hero threat appeared, no one had been able to act as a couple openly in this city. They should have kept their meetings a secret. …And why would he have seen them so many times?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it strange? Unless you’re a high school kid who spies on people’s dates, or… you’re the Hero who was watching them, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke looked at him confidently. Marc gritted his teeth and replied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kuh… so what with that! I just happened to see them!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke stared at him with a steely gaze, then sighed and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’d take credit if you confessed here…. but, oh, well, I guess this time I’ll give the credit to Yui…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“To Lady Yui?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke looked at Yui, who was curled up next to him, and smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I always wondered how he controlled the monsters. We had already been attacked by them three times without warning. There were no suspicious noises or signs. So no one noticed until the monster suddenly appeared in front of us. …At least not any ordinary humans, right?” Eisuke put his hand on Yui’s side. Then he pointed his chin at her with coarse assurance. “But this girl here could hear you. It was a sound we couldn’t hear… it was a mosquito-toned sound<a href="#calibre_link-37" name="_ftnref1" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre1">[1]</a> to call the monsters, emitted at a volume that normal humans couldn’t hear… that’s how you summoned them!”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Marc… no, Hiroto, was finally exposed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui Koikase. She was a girl whose hearing and vision was better than that of the ordinary human. She had been able to hear him clearly all along. The strange sound that often emanated from the direction where Marc was. She had noticed the connection between the sound and the monsters flying out of nowhere right after. Yui narrowed her eyes and uttered in a low voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…You were the first one to warn us. That’s why I thought you were a good person. I also wondered if I was just… hearing some nasty thing again. …But it was like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke smirked and cracked his knuckles. He approached Hiroto… and started the fight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I finally found you, Hero. The hide and seek game is over. The next game… will be a real tiebreaker with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn it…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hiroto raised his hand, gritting his teeth. But nothing happened immediately. …No, they couldn’t sense it. The low sound to call the monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eisuke, something’s coming…!” Yui shouted, almost at the same time.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">…Something flew behind Eisuke and the others at speeds close to Mach, like a jet plane, and hijacked Marielle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaa!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-It’s a wyvern!</p>
<p class="calibre4">A flying dragon, a wyvern. It was only the size of a horse, but it was a subspecies of dragon. Its streamlined body shape and knife-like triangular wings were the result of evolution to reduce air resistance as much as possible, and it was a powerful monster that could be called an intelligent fighter without exaggeration.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The wyvern kidnapped Marielle by grabbing her by the collar of her clothes with its mouth and then glided directly at Hiroto. The latter nimbly jumped on his back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha! So you saw right through me! That’s right, I’m Hiroto, the Hero!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean, “You saw through me”! Don’t act so interesting!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But that’s too bad, because I’m better than you!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hiroto activated his skill again. He summoned and attacked from the sky with a horde of Killer Bats. While Eisuke and the others were stunned by the sudden appearance, Hiroto used his wyvern to fly high in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kyaaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle! Tsk, you won’t escape!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, Eisuke!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino stopped Eisuke from waving his arm and trying to ward off the Killer Bats with another blast. He turned to her with an angry expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s the matter now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Calm down! Can’t you see that My Lady is in the sky too? You’re going to blow them both away!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“S̲h̲i̲t̲, it’s true…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke suddenly realized. Beyond the Killer Bats, there was the wyvern with Marielle in its mouth. If he were to send the Killer Bats flying with another gale, it would be inevitable that the wyvern and Marielle would be caught in it. Hiroto anticipated this and took Marielle hostage. Eisuke’s expression showed the rage he felt, right after that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll do it.” It was Yui who said with a cold tone of voice, pulling out her guns from her hood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eisuke, you take care of the Hero. I’ll take care of the Killer Bats.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s eyes widened. Yui’s indifferent eyes met his gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Okay, I’m counting on you!” As soon as he said that, Eisuke jumped up. He went in a straight line towards the wyvern that was passing the Killer Bats. The horde of monsters approached him to block his path…</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Yui raised both guns as she watched Eisuke’s back.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">…Eisuke said he believes in me. He said he wouldn’t doubt me.</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">Recalling the words he said to her when she became a freak who had taken her abilities to a superhuman level.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-117" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">…So I will respond. I will fight. With all my strength, I will use this power. For you…</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">“For Eisuke’s sake…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In her indifferent eyes, she carried the fire of her fighting spirit. Her feelings burned, but her thoughts were cold. She shot through the target with a precise gaze and put all of herself into the finger that pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Dadadadadadadadadadadadan!</p>
<p class="calibre4">A series of shots.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-118" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">She fired one gun, and as she kept firing, she fired the other. She iterated this action over and over again. A divine feat that would be possible only through extreme concentration. At no time did she take his eyes off any of the Killer Bats. Her bullets were surely finishing them off in one hit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…The total number of bullets was twelve, adding the bullets from both guns. All of them… they must have hit and killed the Killer Bats that stood in the way of Eisuke’s jump.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Come on, Eisuke…!!!” Yui muttered as if saying a prayer.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-119" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m coming…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thanks to Yui’s exquisite technique, Eisuke was able to escape from the swarm without being caught by the Killer Bats. Hiroto, who had kidnapped Marielle with his wyvern, was already only a couple of meters away from him. Eisuke pulled on his own arm as hard as he could in response to his astonishment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Here goeeeees!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke reached his fist to Hiroto’s jaw. The latter lost consciousness, so he took the opportunity to hit the wyvern as well, delivering a blow even faster.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-120" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“There you go!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…The wyvern’s head fell as if it had been cut off with a knife.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh…?” Marielle gasped as she suddenly lost the sensation of being lifted. “Kyaaaaaahhhh…!” She fell headfirst, following gravity. Just before she hit the ground…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oops, just in time!” Eisuke grabbed Marielle by the collar of her clothes and just in time kept her from crashing to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wasn’t there any other way to save me?!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-121" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t want to listen to orders from the one who let herself be captured!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke retorted to Marielle, who took it out on him after receiving the spectacular sensation of floating. On the hill they returned to, Rukino was finishing off the remaining Killer Bats with her rapier, and Serika managed to keep them at bay with her kicks. Thanks to Yui, there were hardly any Killer Bats left, and they were almost under control.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eisuke…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke raised his hand towards Yui, who rushed towards him. Yui immediately understood what that meant. She tucked the gun inside her sweatshirt and… Pang! They gave each other a high-five.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-122" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Yui’s cheeks melted into tears at Eisuke’s smile. His innocent smile, filled with a familiar innocence befitting his age. The two seventeen-year-old students had truly connected with each other through battle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uwaaaaaaa…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Right next to him, with a thud, Hiroto crashed down next to his wyvern who had lost his head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gah…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, since his physical abilities had been enhanced when he became a Hero, it seemed that he was still safe despite having fallen from a great height. Eisuke glared at him as he crawled over and threw him a challenge again.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-123" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s what you get for trying to run away, you piece of trash. I really want to fight you. Summon the most powerful monster you can call right now. I’m going to crush it head on.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t, guh…! Don’t get carried away…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hiroto raised his hand in a half-hearted attempt to restrain him. In the same way he also summoned the monsters. A few seconds later…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What the…! It’s the biggest one so far…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui’s low voice trembled. No one answered. The reason was that, even without her saying it, everyone heard the mighty roar approaching from afar. That huge black silhouette, beating its wings against the setting sun, was….</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-124" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Groaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It let out a roar that shook the atmosphere violently. Majestic wings stretched out from his massive crimson body, wicked eyes so twisted that snakes would look almost cute, and jaws lined with sharp fangs. Everything about it was terrifying to behold.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…The strongest monster of all… a dragon was towering over Eisuke and his friends.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hahaha! Did you see that? This is a Hero for you! It’s easy for me to call the strongest creature a dragon!”</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-125" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Seeing Marielle and the others trembling, Hiroto regained the will to fight and shouted triumphantly. However, Eisuke’s resounding laughter roared as if to drown out his shout.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, yes, I love it! This world is full of romance, I’ll be able to fight dragons!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The word fear didn’t seem to exist in his dictionary. Eisuke laughed fiercely and jumped towards the dragon hovering in the air. Just one of the dragon’s claws was as big as all of Eisuke. It was like facing a battleship. But he was undeterred…</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Let’s go!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Dogo!</p>
<p class="calibre4">…He gave the dragon a powerful blow on the nose. The tremendous impact shook the atmosphere with the sound of an explosion. The dragon’s head jerked up from its neck… but….</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whoa!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The dragon, which was the strongest monster of all, did not fall, but spat extremely hot flames towards Eisuke. Eisuke twisted in the air, but the flames engulfed the right half of his body. Eisuke was blown away by the torrent of flames and fell to the ground.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-127" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“It burns, it burns, you b̲a̲s̲t̲a̲r̲d̲! Are you going to burn my jacket, too?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke said in frustration as he punched his jacket to put out the fire. Although his clothes were burned, the bare skin underneath was mostly intact. There was only black soot and a faint red scar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“¡Groaaaahhhhh!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The dragon again shot a blast of fire from the air. The flames were so intense that they engulfed the entire hill where Eisuke and the others were standing. Everyone was stunned.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-128" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, we’re going to be nothing but ashes!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mr. Eisuke!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I got it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rushed by Serika and Marielle, Eisuke threw a forehand with all his might on the spot. Then, he nullified the flames with a blast. It wasn’t an exaggeration. I say it again, it was a deplorable spectacle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t fly over me, you damn lizard!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke shouted, and jumped at the dragon again. This time, he delivered a strong punch to its abdomen. As the dragon staggered, Eisuke climbed onto the dragon’s back with the grace of an acrobat.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-129" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">And then…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Take thiiiiiiis!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke brandished his arms crosswise toward the dragon’s back. His sword-hands split the atmosphere and created a vacuum rupture, violently slicing through space.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…And slashed the dragon’s huge wings from their bases.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, he cut its wings…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika muttered in astonishment. Eisuke’s sword-hands, sharper and more violent than any blade, had cut the dragon’s wings in one blow, as if they were butter.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-130" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Gryaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The dragon screamed so loudly that it vibrated the atmosphere. Eisuke, who jumped from its back to throw it, somersaulted in the air. He let out a fierce breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was hoping for a bit more, but I guess I have no choice but to keep fighting humans! Just go!!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke, in position for a somersault, launched a kick over the dragon, which had lost its wings. The dragon flew off almost at the speed of sound and disappeared into the distance. Soon the battle was resolved as the sky twinkled with stars that were still very early in the night.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-131" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Hiroto was horrified to see the whole ridiculous battle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It was a dragon, and you used nothing but your body?! Wha-what the hell are you!? Are you a monster!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not a monster. I’m just a high school student who got too strong.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s no way you’re a normal high school student!”</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre8">He’s right… </em>Marielle silently agreed with Hiroto, who was ranting as much as he could.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-132" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke laughed flippantly and clenched his fists.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That means you don’t have anyone else to call anymore? …Then grit your teeth.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke’s fist, without holding back, slammed into Hiroto’s brain. With that blow, he was knocked out and fell to the ground like a rock.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">Returning to the center of the city of Melwa, Eisuke and his group gathered the citizens and held Hiroto, bound with ropes, before their eyes.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“This is the Hero who has been threatening your city. I have already defeated him, so from now on you can sleep without fear.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke said irreverently. The citizens just looked at him and his group in disbelief at the sudden turn of events. Eisuke sighed and looked at Marielle. She removed the hood she was wearing, exposing her beautiful blonde hair to the dark night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Pri-Princess Marielle! Why are you here?”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“You-You’re safe…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The citizens became instantly noisy. Marielle spoke to them calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Dear people of Melwa. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for allowing the Hero to reign for so long due to my inability to stop him. But we have already captured him here. By the hands of those I have recently summoned and trusted.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The attention of the citizens naturally turned to the people Marielle pointed out. When the citizens saw the defeated Hero, the questioning eyes that had been fixed on Eisuke and the others were replaced by respectful glances. Marielle raised her voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You need no longer fear the Hero. I pledge that, with the cooperation of these people, I will restore this country and bring true peace. Let us begin here in Melwa! The restoration of the Arestine Empire by our hands!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The citizens looked at each other at Marielle’s lofty declaration. …But soon, there was a burst of applause from the crowd. It spread quickly and gradually grew louder. Soon, loud cheers joined the applause, and a festive mood spread throughout the place.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I am very happy for you, My Lady…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, so am I.” Marielle responded to Rukino’s soft tone with a tear on her cheek, not taking her eyes off the excited citizens. This was a big first step. It might not be long before this scene could be seen in the Imperial City… Marielle had such expectations in her heart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, and why did you do it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika casually asked Hiroto, who was still tied up and tilting his head back. Hiroto was silent for a moment, then answered with an exhalation.</p><span></span><span id="calibre_link-133" class="calibre7"></span>
<p class="calibre4">“…Because I hate couples…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you very much for that simple and arguable reason.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t want there to be any romantic feelings in this world. Only humans have romantic feelings while animals do not. That’s why there are so many problems in the human world. I wanted to create a world without the need for love here…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hiroto said while grunting. Sometimes romantic feelings could cause excessive jealousy. Sometimes problematic lust could be mistaken for romantic love. Those problems, which did not exist in animals, occurred among people who had romantic feelings. Hiroto was not wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…But there are times when you can give your best because you have feelings for someone, like romantic feelings.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…It was Yui who said those words to Hiroto. She put her hand on her chest as if to confirm her feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want to communicate with them. I want them to respond to my feelings. That feeling can turn into unlimited power. I want to do my best for this person. I want to move forward together. Just by thinking about that special someone, everything around you can become positive. I think that’s why people… fall in love…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Saying this, Yui tightly grabbed Eisuke’s sleeve. Eisuke seemed to hesitate at the sudden gesture, but Yui smiled softly. Hiroto’s mouth dropped open at the sight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll return you to the world you came from.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle’s body was enveloped in a holy light. Pale light particles of seven colors gushed forth, and a geometric magic circle appeared at Hiroto’s feet. He looked at Eisuke for the last time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you want now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let me tell you something.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke frowned. Hiroto laughed and said a few words to him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You make me jealous.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ma-may the Goddess bless you in your future life?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With Marielle’s confused parting words, Hiroto too was enveloped in the dazzling light and returned to his old world…</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Fuaaaaaaaaaa…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle, diving into the bathtub, had an expression of pure happiness on her face, her cheeks relaxed and she let out a pleased voice. Serika laughed at this princess who seemed to be at the zenith of her life.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Marielle, what a face that is!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ple-Please don’t say that! It’s been several months since I’ve had a chance to soak in hot water! And it feels so good…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s been a while since I’ve been able to soak in a tub either, so I understand how you feel.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle and the girls were able to rent an inn in Melwa, and since their escape from the imperial capital, they were finally promised a way to spend the night that wasn’t out in the open. …This was the women’s bathhouse. There were no other guests, and Marielle, Yui and Serika had the place to themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui was submerged in the tub with her eyes closed. Serika was standing in the tub with a towel around her head, stretching. Marielle looked at the two of them and said quietly:</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I am truly happy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I told you, you’re exaggerating.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm, that’s not true. I was forced to flee my country and I lost everything, but… here I am, I met people like you, bathing in the same bathtub as if we were ordinary friends. What else could I call this if not happiness?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui and Serika looked at Marielle, who laughed softly. She was an ordinary princess, but one who had suffered a tragic fate. But, even so, she was no more than a 14-year-old girl. She should have the right to laugh with girls like Yui and Serika in an age-appropriate way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You guys even gave me a chance to hang out like a regular girl. I really can’t thank you enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let me say it again. Lady Yui, and Lady Serika as well. Thank you so much for being by my side…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marielle, have your breasts grown since we met?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, is that true!? I mean, why are you saying that so suddenly! I was being serious, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle got up from the tub with a start and scolded Serika, who was looking at her limbs. Droplets of water fell gently down Marielle’s shiny white limbs, from her collarbone to her thighs, with nothing obstructing them. …Although she was growing according to Serika, it made no difference that she was still developing. Marielle stared at Serika.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why are you looking at me like that?”</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle looked Serika’s body up and down. She was tall for a girl, barely over 1,8 meters, and the soft curves that ran from her breasts to her waist and buttocks were sculpture-like. She didn’t shy from Marielle’s steady gaze, and she brought her hands to her hips in an imposing way, something she couldn’t do if she didn’t have confidence in her body. Marielle was 14. Serika was 17. The age difference between the two was nowhere near three years.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Lady Serika, are you lying about your age?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I think I should be angry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, no! I don’t mean that in a bad way! It’s just that you have a very mature body!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika shot an incredulous look at Marielle, who was waving her hands in the air and trying to fix things.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If that’s what you think of me… then what comes to your mind when you see those floats?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika ogled at Yui’s breasts. The tops of these floated out of the water, imposing great dominance. Yui looked down at her own breasts with a puzzled look, where she finally realized Serika’s lousy metaphor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Please don’t call other people’s breasts that way.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But that’s what they look like. You don’t seem to know how unusual it is to have them that size. What are you feeding them or what?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t say it like they’re pets.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui complained with her eyes closed. …Marielle could say no more. Humans, whoever they were, were becoming powerless in the face of something so great.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika slowly immersed herself in the tub, starting with her toes. The quality of the warm water was no different in this other world. A lovely voice escaped naturally from her throat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fuaaaa… But you know, Marielle, you’re still growing, aren’t you? If you eat a lot, lead a healthy life with no inconveniences like us in our original world… hmmm…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika stretched. Marielle clasped her hands together in front of her chest as if anticipating what was to come.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I wonder if one day… I’ll really be able to live a normal life again?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sure you will.” Yui said briefly. Then, for some reason, she said out of nowhere and proudly as if referring to herself. “Because we have Eisuke.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmph, though I’m not so sure how you can say that so confidently. …Well, when you think you have someone on your team who can send a huge dragon like that flying into the sky, you can have high hopes.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika said with surprise. The image of Eisuke fighting a dragon while laughing nonchalantly flashed through all three of their minds at the same time, and they all laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not sure how he could become so strong, it makes you wonder if he really is like us. Did he train so hard because he wanted to fight a stronger opponent? What is he, some kind of man of a warrior race or something?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe, but there could also be something else.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Something else…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui said, looking at her face reflected on the surface of the water.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I think Eisuke wanted to protect the weaker ones by fighting the stronger ones. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have faced only yankees and delinquents…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At first glance, Eisuke was a frivolous guy who only cared about fights. But Yui already knew him. She knew his true personality was the one who put that expression that wasn’t scared of anything on his face when he gave her words of comfort before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think that’s why Eisuke is helping Marielle.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yui’s smile as she said it overlapped with Eisuke’s trustworthy smile that Marielle remembered. Those words of his stuck in her brain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘…I’ll give you a hand until you get your country back completely.’</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I see. Eisuke must be a really kind man.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Marielle laughed sheepishly. Serika deliberately stuck out her tongue in disgust.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, really? Wait, you two, aren’t you a little too charmed by him?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not true. So I don’t think you need to use me to control Eisuke’s reins, Serika.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Bwah!? Ho-how did you know about the plan!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Serika was taken aback, and Yui let out a small laugh, then swept her hair aside with a bewitching gesture, revealing her beautiful ears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have hellish ears.” Said Yui, feeling like she was bragging about her power.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">While the three girls were bathing, Eisuke and Rukino were on the streets of Melwa.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you okay being the only one who didn’t go to bathe?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I plan to go in later.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm… are you sure? I thought you might want to bathe with Marielle.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course I do. To record My Lady’s daily growth on my retina. She’s my reason for living, you might say.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Coming from you, I’m not surprised.” When Rukino said that nonsense with such a straight face, Eisuke could only frown.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But I’m sure My Lady would also like to have a nice chat with girls her age without me from time to time. …And if possible, I don’t want her to be overworked…” Rukino’s eyes narrowed as she sincerely thought of her mistress. With her calm eyes, she smiled at Eisuke. “…Not long ago, I thought my mission was to never leave My Lady’s side, not even for a moment. But now there are you. I am more than relieved that you protect her with your power.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">…It was clear that Marielle and Rukino must have gone through many hardships. The imminent threat, the desperate difference in strength and the Heroes against whom they were no match. They probably hadn’t had a moment’s peace since fleeing the capital.</p><span></span>
<p class="calibre4">Placing his trust in Eisuke, Eisuke felt the two girls gradually regaining their luster. The ridiculous strength in his arms was turning into someone else’s vitality. That’s what he felt…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Not bad.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s nothing. Don’t act so arrogant, you clumsy housewife.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Clu-Clumsy housewife?! I cook and sew clothes! Don’t you dare call me clumsy!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So it’s okay for me to call you a housewife, then?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Haa.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke opened the door of a store with the surprisingly natural Rukino at his heels. As soon as he opened the door, they were both greeted with praise from the people in the store.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, if it isn’t the heroes who saved this city!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was one of the largest taverns in the city of Melwa. Perhaps because the Hero was gone, the tavern was full of customers of both sexes. The two sat at the counter, shaking hands with people who asked for them. A burly man sitting next to them clapped Eisuke on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t believe such a small boy beat a Hero!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hahaha, they say good things come in small packages, right? You want to arm wrestle, old man?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke rolled up his sleeves and laughed. Rukino smiled politely as she nudged Eisuke, who had a rather serious look on his face. Next to Rukino, a woman of unidentifiable age came to sit down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m so glad to hear that Princess Marielle is alive… It’s such a relief…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Have you been able to find out what has happened to the Imperial City since the princess left?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino asked. She had been questioning what had happened since they escaped the imperial capital. But the woman shrugged by way of apology.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, we were enjoying the peace so much that such news did not come… Are you heading to the imperial capital now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rukino nodded deeply at the woman’s question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, first of all, we have to take back the capital from the clutches of the Heroes.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So you’re going from here to Balletta, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Balletta was the name of the city that served as a transit point on the route connecting Melwa and the imperial capital. Eisuke peered over the side.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then it’s Balletta. I wonder what kind of fourth-rate Hero they have there.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, the truth is…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The woman’s gaze shifted. In a calm manner, she said to the intrigued Eisuke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I heard this from someone who came back from there, but… the one who rules there is a “Hero of Justice”.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eisuke and Rukino frowned at the puzzling phrase.</p>
