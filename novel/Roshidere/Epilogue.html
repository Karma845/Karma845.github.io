<h3>Epilogue - Moving Forward</h3>

<p>&quot;...It would be a lot cooler if I could achieve my goal.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika and Alisa&apos;s voices echoed each other in the quiet corridor.</p>


<p>After the end-of-semester ceremony was over, the two of them became the center of attention and were praised by many students, especially from classmates, for their brilliant speeches.</p>


<p>Masachika and Alisa managed to get through it all by using their communication skills to the fullest, and after homeroom hours were over, they also finished the last meeting with the student council. And finally, they came to see the announcement of the exam ranking list displayed in the school hallway. The name that was prominently written on the far right was Alisa&apos;s, and next to it was Yuki&apos;s name. Then from there, a list of thirty people lined up in order, but&hellip; Masachika&apos;s name was not among the list.</p>


<p>&quot;33rd place, huh... what a lame result.&quot;</p>


<p>While staring at the report card in his hand, Masachika muttered that with a wry smile. Considering the fact that he had ranked 202nd out of 254 students in the last midterm, the current rank was a great achievement. However, Masachika was only six points short of his target of wanting to rank in the top 30.</p>


<p>&quot;Well, I guess things didn&apos;t go as expected.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...How come, you don&apos;t seem too disappointed?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hm... well that&apos;s about it.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika nodded half-heartedly at Alisa, who raised her eyebrows. It was true that he did not feel too disappointed. On the contrary, he was relieved that he was not ranked in the top 30.</p>


<p>(Although I feel reluctant to say this, but I can&apos;t dare say that I was really focused on studying for the exam...)</p>


<p>Masachika realized that he really couldn&apos;t focus on studying to the best of his ability during the exam period. During study time, he kept losing his concentration many times and his study efficiency would decline, and you could say that he had had enough of studying. That&apos;s why he was relieved with this result. If he could somehow achieve his goal without exerting himself... Masachika once again felt that he was really mocking life.</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm, well, even this genius has his limits...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Aren&apos;t you ashamed to say that yourself?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa looked at Masachika who narcissistically flicked his bangs. In front of Alisa&apos;s cold gaze, Masachika shrugged his shoulders with a slightly serious expression.</p>


<p>&quot;Well, I just didn&apos;t put in enough effort. I&apos;m sorry, I couldn&apos;t produce results that would make me proud as a vice chairman candidate.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s fine...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, just take this as my reflection. Next time, I&apos;ll try .... better.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika said that while staring at the student ranking list with a serious gaze. In response, Alisa asked in a low voice.</p>


<p>&quot;Do you regret this result?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Thank goodness, if that&apos;s the case.&quot;</p>


<p>As she turned around and said so, Alisa urged Masachika not to worry too much about his grades.</p>


<p>&quot;Let&apos;s go home? A lot happened today, so I&apos;m a little tired.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ah, that&apos;s right...&quot;</p>


<p>While walking side by side next to her, Masachika&apos;s gaze wandered erratically. The reason why he was acting like that was because...</p>


<p>&quot;...Umm, Alya.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;It&apos;s nothing, it&apos;s just that... what about the stakes? The bet where the loser has to comply with one request of the winner...&quot;</p>


<p>When asked by Masachika, Alisa stopped her steps for a moment... and immediately continued walking again while averting her eyes.</p>


<p>&quot;...I&apos;ll think about it later.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Didn&apos;t you say that you had already thought about it? If I&apos;m not mistaken you said something in Russian.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That time... I just randomly said something random.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa muttered and looked away. Then she grumbled in</p>

<p>Russian.</p>


<p>{What the... it&rsquo;s because I thought, you&hellip;}</p>


<p>At first glance, her words sounded a little inexplicable, but Masachika could somehow understand the situation.</p>


<p>(Aah... this girl didn&apos;t think that she would win...)</p>


<p>Masachika felt awkward because Alisa was putting too much hope on him, and at the same time, he felt guilty for not being able to fulfill those expectations.</p>


<p>(Ah, umm... What did she say the other day? If I&apos;m not mistaken, she said something along with the word &quot;name&quot; right?)</p>


<p>(TN: I forgot which chapter but in the previous chapter when asked what she would do if she won the bet, she muttered smth like &quot;name&quot; or smth along those lines)</p>


<p>Feeling awkward, Masachika recalled Alisa&apos;s words. When he thought about it for a moment... he made a guess.</p>


<p>(In other words... is that what she meant? No, but... isn&apos;t it very embarrassing if I were to bring it up? I&apos;ll be thought of as a super narcissistic guy...)</p>


<p>He was so anxious that he felt like his head was spinning... but Masachika made up his mind. Thinking that this was another way to punish himself for losing the bet, he decided to throw away his embarrassment.</p>


<p>&quot;Umm... Alya?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Because... the speech at the end-of-semester closing ceremony is over, and we are officially recognized as a pair of candidates for the student council president election .... How about we call each other by our first names to show our closeness...?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika yelled while prancing around in his brain because he felt embarrassed as he mysteriously proposed that in a polite tone. Because not daring to look at Alisa, he just looked straight ahead and waited patiently for an answer. After a few seconds that seemed an eternity, Alisa&apos;s small voice reached his ears.</p>


<p>&quot;...Well, I don&apos;t mind anyway&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Uh, oh, really?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Y-Yes?&quot;</p>


<p>Although they did not look at each other, they seemed to agree with each other. However, when Alisa coughed and cleared her throat, Masachika also turned his gaze towards Alisa as well.</p>


<p>&quot;Alright, then...&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa then opened her mouth hesitantly, and peeked slightly to the side with a blushing expression.</p>


<p>&quot;Masachika... kun?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Umm, yes...&quot;</p>


<p>Her slightly shy demeanor while calling her name made Masachika&apos;s entire body tingle.</p>


<p>&quot;O-Oh... well, is that okay?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;R-Really? Then, from now on, I will call you like that...&quot;</p>


<p>And then, at the same time, she quickly averted her gaze and said so. Unable to bear the awkward and sweet atmosphere that hovered between them, Masachika raised his voice in vain when she saw the approaching entrance.</p>


<p>&quot;Ah, right! I should change my shoes!&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;T-That&apos;s right.&quot;</p>


<p>If you think about it calmly, a natural reaction would make anyone ask,</p>


<p>&quot;Why did you bother saying that?&quot;, but Alisa nodded her head without seeming bothered. Then, as they reached out to the shoe boxes lined up above and below simultaneously, they began to act awkward again.</p>


<p>Amidst this sweet and sour, amused and explosive atmosphere, Masachika and Alisa traced their way home while chatting about trivial matters.</p>


<p>During this time, they never looked at each other, and Alisa never called Masachika by name.</p>


<p>After a while, they finally arrived at an intersection and somehow they both stopped at the same time.</p>


<p>&quot;Then... I&apos;m going home this way.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes... then, until--&quot;</p>


<p>Yes, she intended to say it casually. But, Masachika suddenly realized. Starting tomorrow, it will be summer vacation. Greetings &quot;see you soon&quot; will be a long time coming. ...if this continues.</p>


<p>&quot;See you soon...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;O-Oh...&quot;</p>


<p>Without looking at each other, Alisa headed towards the crossing area. And just the moment her feet stepped onto the highway - that&apos;s when it happened.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya!&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika half-reflexively called out to her. Then, upon realizing that Alisa was staring back out of the corner of her eye, she quickly looked away.</p>


<p>&quot;Well... Even though it&apos;s already summer vacation, there are still various preparations for the election campaign, right? Unlike Yuki and Ayano who are always together...&quot;</p>


<p>While facing the wrong direction, Masachika spoke with a stammer.</p>


<p>&quot;So, umm... how about we occasionally... meet up during the summer vacation too?&quot;</p>


<p>Having said all that, Masachika&apos;s embarrassment had reached its limit. He could feel Alisa standing in front of him when he looked back, but he didn&apos;t dare look at her. He was desperately trying to restrain herself from screaming and running away.</p>


<p>&quot;Masachika-kun.&quot;</p>


<p>From a short distance away, he heard Alisa&apos;s voice calling his name. Masachika turned his face and replied with a &quot;Hmm?&quot;. He could see from the corner of her his that Alisa was smiling a little bit at his pathetic way of handling this situation.</p>


<p>&quot;Непада ом!&quot; (Look ahead!)</p>


<p>Masachika reflexively looked forward when he heard the sentence being spoken in Russian. Then, as soon as Masachika saw the innocent smile in front of her, Alisa said...</p>
