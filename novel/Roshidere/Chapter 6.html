<h3>Chapter 6 - The Heat is Rising in Many Ways</h3>

<p>In reality... nothing dramatic happened.</p>


<p>There were no special events such as being abused by my mother, or my mother having an affair with another man. On the contrary, if I think about it now</p>

<p>I think that she was a very gentle and kind mother. Although things happened between her and dad, mom was still kind to both of us. She would praise me when I got good grades, and sometimes she even made snacks for me. I&apos;m sure that from the general public&apos;s point of view, she was a very good mother.</p>


<p>Both my sister and I used to love our mother like that.</p>


<p>...... The trigger was just something very trivial. I&apos;m sure that many</p>

<p>people in this world would be dumbfounded and ask,</p>


<p>&quot;What? Is that all?&quot; ... but when I think about it, it&apos;s really no big deal. However, one day... my mom suddenly stopped looking directly in my eyes. My mom, who had always looked straight into my eyes and stroked my head while saying, &quot;You did your best,&quot; and &quot;That&apos;s really great.&quot; started... turning her face away. Many times, her gentle smile would become awkward ... and that&apos;s when I started to realize that mom was pushing herself. (TN: how tf is that not a big deal lmao? Having your mom not look you in the eye when speaking to you sounds pretty devastating to me...)</p>


<p>I was sure that she wasn&apos;t satisfied with me at this level. I still wasn&apos;t trying hard enough. I needed to get better and better results. So that I can make Mom happy from the bottom of her heart. Hey mom, please look at me. I got a compliment from the flower arrangement teacher the other day, you know? I&apos;ve even earned a black belt in karate. I&apos;ve also learned junior high school-level subject matters, and I also play the piano which mom loves--</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s enough, stop it!!&quot;</p>


<p>.... I don&apos;t want to see that look in her eyes anymore. I just...</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p>


<p>&quot;Ughh...&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika woke up with a whimpering voice due to the heat and pain that enveloped his entire body.</p>


<p>&quot;Ahh......&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika layed on the bed, feeling as if the slightest movement would make his head dizzy and send pain throughout his body. The truth was, he already had a bad feeling about this last night, but ...... it seemed like his fever was only going to get even worse.</p>


<p>He realized that his throat was sore, and more importantly, his body was very lethargic. He was sure that his temperature was quite high.</p>


<p>At that moment, the alarm clock on his bedside table began to ring, and Masachika lifted his heavy arm to stop it. He picked up the smartphone sitting next to him and rolled over to his right side. He felt pain in his upper right arm and shoulder, but fortunately it was</p>

<p>not as severe as the pain when lifting his hand.</p>


<p>&quot;This is useless...&quot;</p>


<p>After activating his smartphone, Masachika tried to contact the school to report his absence. However, he could not find the contact address. He thought he had written it down somewhere, but he couldn&apos;t remember it. Masachika considered looking up the school&apos;s phone number on the Internet... but he felt that it would be too troublesome.</p>


<p>&quot;Takeshi... No, maybe Hikaru instead?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika decided to ask one of his two best friends to deliver the message to the homeroom teacher, and chose Hikaru based on his trustworthiness. The illusion of Takeshi protesting &quot;Why!&quot; appeared in his head, but he didn&apos;t care. He didn&apos;t have time to</p>

<p>worry about him.</p>


<p>[...Hello, Masachika?]</p>


<p>&quot;Oh... sorry Hikaru, I seem to have a fever.&quot;</p>


<p>[Eh? Are you okay?]</p>


<p>&quot;Well... I&apos;m off today to rest. Do you think you could tell that to our homeroom teacher later?&quot;</p>


<p>[Okay. I understand. ...... How about we go visit you after school? You&apos;re home alone right now, right?&quot;]</p>


<p>&quot;No need, I&apos;ve already asked someone for help... Thank you very much.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I see... I hope you get well soon.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes~&quot;</p>


<p>After finishing the call with Hikaru, Masachika mobilized his strength and sent a message to Yuki.</p>


<p>[Sorry, I seem to have caught a fever. Can you ask Ayano to bring me some medicine?]</p>


<p>After struggling to type that much and sending it, Masachika dropped his cell phone and laid on his back again.</p>


<p>&quot;Huh...&quot;</p>


<p>At the very least, he wanted to drink a glass of water, but even getting out of bed was too much for him. Fortunately, he still felt sleepy, so he decided to go back to sleep.</p>


<p>(For some reason, I feel like I just had a bad dream...)</p>


<p>Perhaps it was from seeing his mother yesterday after not seeing her for so long. Masachika felt that he was dreaming of the past which he usually never</p>

<p>remember anymore.</p>


<p>(Or rather, lately there&apos;s something that seems to remind me a lot of the past...)</p>


<p>His memories of when he was Suou Masachika were something that he didn&apos;t want to remember now. The unpleasant things, the sad things, and painful things. Because when he remembered them, an uncomfortable feeling spread in his heart.</p>


<p>(No, quite the opposite... maybe it&apos;s because I didn&apos;t try to remember them, huh)</p>


<p>Masachika usually never remembers the details of the past. Every time he tried to remember it, he would stop himself. Even though Masachika believes that memories of the past were not always something painful.</p>


<p>But, inevitably, he still remembers them. Memories of breaking his relationship with his mother, or the breakup with that girl. In order to avoid associating them with each other, he put all the old memories together and sealed them away into his memory.</p>


<p>In this way, the image of the &quot;past&quot; as something &quot;unpleasant&quot; remains, and whenever the</p>

<p>unpleasant&quot; remains, and every time he tries hard not to remember it, it becomes stronger.</p>


<p>(Many people say that anger and hatred gradually fade away over time... But it can&apos;t be that easy, can it?)</p>


<p>The current Masachika has a strong impression of the sadness and pain of that time, even though his memories of that time have faded. What exactly was so sad and painful was that time was no longer clear.</p>


<p>Even now, when he tries to remember the past, he experiences a strong sense of rejection.</p>

<p>Masachika just wanted to turn away and did not want to touch the memories of the past.</p>


<p>(...Haa, never mind.)</p>


<p>Masachika forced himself to stop thinking, because now was not the time to think about it.</p>


<p>Why would he make herself even more depressed when he himself is not well?</p>


<p>He just happened to meet her yesterday, and he had no plans or intention to deal with his mother again in the future.</p>


<p>The past was no longer worth remembering. Kuze Masachika did not need to remember the times when he was Suou Masachika.</p>


<p>That was what he told himself... and then Masachika fell back asleep.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p>


<p>Pingpong.</p>


<p>&quot;Uhh...?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika woke up to the sound of the intercom. In a state of half-awake, he wondered if Yuki or Ayano had come, but he soon realized something was wrong.</p>


<p>Yuki had the key to this apartment room unit. Whether it was Yuki or Ayano, they could enter without ringing the doorbell. Besides...if he was not wrong, the sound he just heard was not the front door bell, but the sound from the apartment entrance.</p>


<p>Even if they rang the doorbell to announce their arrival, they wouldn&apos;t have to bother ringing the intercom at the apartment&apos;s entrance.</p>


<p>&quot;What the heck, did she send the medicine via package delivery...?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika tried to get out of bed with a sluggish body,</p>

<p>but his body already felt tired after turning over for a while. The thought of using the answering machine crossed his mind, but at that moment, the doorbell of the entrance bell rang again.</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, yes... just a moment~&quot;</p>


<p>Partly because he thought it was time to get up, Masachika tried to get up from his bed with all his might. While frowning at the dizziness in his head as he took each step, Masachika opened the door to his room and headed for the intercom machine. Then, upon seeing the figure that the intercom screen displayed... Masachika widened his eyes in surprise.</p>


<p>&quot;...Huh!?&quot;</p>


<p>Her shiny silver hair and blue eyes were caught by the intercom camera. Her appearance was so neat as if it was a lie. That&apos;s right, there was Alisa</p>

<p>standing at the entrance of the apartment building in her casual clothes.</p>


<p>&quot;...Uh, haa? How come?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika had never told Alisa his home address. Of course, he never invited Alisa to his home either.</p>

<p>Those kinds of questions popped into his mind, but for the moment time, Masachika pressed the answer button first because the call would be cut off</p>

<p>if he didn&apos;t answer quickly.</p>


<p>&quot;...Alya?&quot;</p>


<p>[Ah, Kuze-kun? Are you okay?]</p>


<p>&quot;Umm... did you perhaps hear something from Yuki?&quot;</p>


<p>[Yes... Yuki-san asked me to bring you some medicine because she said that you were sick with a fever...]</p>


<p>&quot;Oh, I see... for now, I&apos;ll open it first.&quot;</p>


<p>[Ah, yes]</p>


<p>He pressed the unlock button and watched Alisa enter the entrance. After that, Masachika returned to his room and picked up the smartphone lying on the bed.</p>


<p>Then, as he turned on his smartphone... Masachika saw a message from Yuki displayed on the screen and immediately threw his smartphone back on the bed.</p>


<p>Oi, oi, what&apos;s wrong? This event is taken care of by a beautiful silver-haired girl, right? You should feel happy.</p>

<p>That was the message written on the screen along with a grinning face icon.</p>


<p>&quot;At least... tell me first~~!!!&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika layed down on the bed again while shouting his frustration at Yuki. Even though he wanted to lie down and rest, Masachika knew that he</p>

<p>had to at least wash his hands first before Alisa arrived, so he gathered his strength and headed for the bathroom. Then, right after he finished relieving himself and washing his hands, the front doorbell rang and Masachika headed for the front door while holding on to the the wall.</p>


<p>He was wearing thin pajamas on the top and bottom, and his hair was disheveled because he hadn&apos;t had time to tidy it up. Although it was an</p>

<p>inappropriate appearance in public, Masachika had given up. He was already in a state of not caring too much about his appearance.</p>


<p>&quot;Yes~.&quot;</p>


<p>Just as he was about to open the front door with his sandals, Masachika thought</p>

<p>that he should wear a mask.</p>


<p>(No, but... where did I put the mask, huh?)</p>


<p>He was a little confused for a moment. But, Masachika decided that it wouldn&apos;t be good to keep Alisa waiting, so he turned the knob and reluctantly</p>

<p>opened the door. Immediately, the intense heat and the buzzing of cicadas rushed in.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya...? Umm, thank you so much, huh? For going to all the trouble of coming here... ...&quot;</p>


<p>As if using the door as a shield, he peeked slightly through the gap of the door opening. To be honest, keeping the door in this half-open state was very difficult for Masachika&apos;s current state, but he had to endure it. However, Alisa&apos;s face still showed her surprise and she slightly averted her gaze.</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, that&apos;s... fine. But it looks like you&apos;re in a worse state than I expected, huh?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Ah, did you just think, It turns out that even a fool can catch a cold, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Of course not.&quot;</p>


<p>As Masachika tried to make a joke out of his situation, Alisa sighed slightly and glanced at the bag of groceries in her hand.</p>


<p>&quot;Do you mind if I go in for a while?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh? Ah no, I just need to get my medicine...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;...Yuki-san asked me to take care of you, you know.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa said that while her lips were slightly pouting, Masachika couldn&apos;t help but complain to Yuki in his heart.</p>


<p>(Imouto yo... I don&apos;t mind if you imagine with your fantasy, but don&apos;t involve other people too...)</p>


<p>{Actually, that was a lie}</p>


<p>(Ah, sorry. For accusing you, Yuki.)</p>


<p>As Alisa glanced at him while playing with the ends of her hair, Masachika apologized to Yuki in his mind. Yuki was just used as an excuse to hide Alisa&apos;s embarrassment.</p>


<p>&quot;Umm there&apos;s no need, I&apos;ll probably get better if I take some medicine and go to bed.... ...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;But it&apos;s much better if you fill your stomach with something. You don&apos;t have the energy to cook for yourself, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s true... but I wouldn&apos;t feel good if you caught a cold ...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry, okay? Because I already brought a mask.&quot;</p>


<p>While saying that, Alisa took out a mask from the grocery bag and put it on just as she said. Even at a time like this, she was still beautiful and yet so serious. This cautious attitude of hers... made Masachika&apos;s feelings mixed up.</p>


<p>(It&apos;s true, but...)</p>


<p>For some reason, he felt very disappointed. It felt like he was becoming a pathogen, or rather he was disappointed that the &apos;being nursed by your female classmate&apos; event was turning into a normal medical procedure.</p>


<p>(After all, &apos;the event where a beautiful girl from my class took care of me back to health without a mask is just a fantasy!&apos; Something like that, yes ....)</p>


<p>Once again, Masachika is made to realize that there is a difference between real life and 2D life, and his gaze became different.</p>


<p>&quot;Moreover... I&apos;ve already brought a lot of stuff, so how could I just go straight home, right?&quot;</p>


<p>After saying that, Alisa held up a shopping bag full to the brim. Apparently, she had brought various groceries and other things besides medicine. Of course, it would be too much to tell her &quot;I don&apos;t need it, so just go back,&quot; after making her carry the heavy luggage under the hot sun. Even though it wasn&apos;t what he asked for.</p>


<p>&quot;Umm, that&apos;s right... then, well, I guess I&apos;ll be in your care for a while...&quot;</p>


<p>Because his energy and physical strength had reached the limit, Masachika greeted Alisa with resignation.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, excuse me.&quot;</p>


<p>As Alisa entered the front door and slammed it shut, Masachika suddenly became agitated. The buzzing of the cicadas outside disappeared, and silence suddenly enveloped them. At the same time, Masachika became aware of the fact that he was alone with a girl, and that even the act of closing the front door alone made it seem like he was doing something wrong.</p>


<p>&quot;Kuze-kun.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Y-yes?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;For now, wear a mask first.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ah, yes.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika felt a little uneasy, but when Alisa gave him the mask, the expression on her face immediately turned flat. It was like... he was being told, &quot;Put the mask on, you idiot.&quot;. No, Alisa would never think that way. He thought that masks were the big enemy of romantic comedies.</p>


<p>(Well, I can&apos;t even kiss with a mask on... First of all, not being able to see half of her face is enough to be fatal in a romantic comedy... No, lately it seems that there are heroine characters who completely hide their faces with masks. However, they look cute because I can see their facial expressions even through masks due to special effects and things for manga and anime, and when looking at them in person in real life, they just look scary. On the other hand, if she wants to hide her face, I personally prefer her having a blindfold covering her eyes instead of her mouth, but if Alya actually wears one, she would look like a criminal, and that sense of indecency is what I&apos;ve been waiting for in the development of the novel, duh what the hell was I thinking?)</p>


<p>While wearing a mask, Masachika&apos;s otaku-style imagination ran wild. Alisa looked worried when she saw Masachika staggering around with a dazed look.</p>


<p>&quot;Kuze-kun? Are you okay?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;So that&apos;s what it looks like, immoral feelings with a scent of criminality. That makes the heroine wearing an eye patch look so attractive.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Looks like you&apos;re not okay, huh?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...I think so too.&quot;</p>



<p>Feeling awkward with Alisa&apos;s gaze looking at him with pity, Masachika led the way to the living room before he could say something even stranger.</p>


<p>&quot;Over there is the restroom, then this one is the toilet, that room... well, please don&apos;t go in there. Then my room is over there. And this one is the living room. You can leave your luggage around there. Well, if you feel thirsty, you can take some water and barley tea from the refrigerator and use the cup however you like... do you have any questions?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm, well. I&apos;ll ask when I think of something, but it&apos;s better if you should lie down as soon as possible.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I also intend to do that...&quot;</p>


<p>Even standing up like this was quite difficult, so Masachika obeyed Alisa&apos;s words and returned to his own room. As he collapsed on the bed and picked up his smartphone to place it next to his pillow, his smartphone vibrated and a message from Yuki was displayed on the screen.</p>


<p>[Don&apos;t imagine Alya wearing an eye patch, okay?]</p>


<p>&quot;What are you, a psychic?!&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika instinctively shouted at the timing and content of the message which made him think that Yuki was reading his mind. Then, his smartphone vibrated again and a new message was displayed.</p>


<p>[I&apos;m not psychic. It&apos;s all thanks to the power of love.]</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t you feel embarrassed for saying that yourself?&quot;</p>


<p>[Don&apos;t you feel ashamed of babbling incoherently to yourself in front of your smartphone?]</p>


<p>(TN: Masachika here isn&apos;t texting but rather talking to himself. Yuki is just predicting what he is saying)</p>


<p>&quot;Whose fault is it! You really can read my mind, can&apos;t you!&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika unconsciously retorted with all his might and coughed because of the pain in her throat.</p>


<p>[Your throat hurts, doesn&apos;t it? Don&apos;t push yourself, okay?]</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>I mean, aren&apos;t &quot;psychic&quot; jokes too old-fashioned? No one uses that word anymore. Masachika didn&apos;t have the energy to do tsukkomi and slammed his smartphone a little roughly under his pillow.</p>


<p>At this time, he pretended not to see the message</p>


<p>&quot;Ouch! don&apos;t hurt your smartphone&quot; was displayed on the screen. Although they were not twins, his younger sister was too good at reading her brother&apos;s mind.</p>


<p>(When I get better, I&apos;ll make sure that this room doesn&apos;t have any surveillance cameras or listening devices...)</p>


<p>While silently deciding that, Masachika lay limply on the bed.</p>


<p>&quot;Kuze-kun? Can I come in?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm?... Yes.&quot;</p>


<p>After looking around the room for a moment and making sure that there was nothing</p>

<p>he didn&apos;t want her to see, Masachika began to respond.</p>


<p>(It&apos;s okay. I don&apos;t hide erotic books under the bed like in shounen manga, or hidden picture frames like in shoujo manga.)</p>


<p>If you rummage through the cupboards of this house, you might find something indicating that Masachika was once a member of the Suou family. However, there is no such thing in a place where you can see it normally. Naturally, Masachika himself would keep such things out of sight.</p>


<p>&quot;Excuse me.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa entered the room with a slight hesitation and her hand carrying an unfamiliar water bottle. Alisa seemed to be having a hard time where to look and she handed the water bottle to Masachika nervously.</p>


<p>&quot;Here, black tea that has been mixed with honey. If you don&apos;t mind, please drink it?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh, thanks... sorry, can you place it by that desk drawer, or maybe a shelf? If you pull it, it&apos;ll turn into a small table...&quot;</p>


<p>As Masachika said, Alisa took out the wheeled shelf on Masachika&apos;s study table and moved it to the bedside to place the water bottle on it.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, umm... do you want to eat something? Even if you have the energy to eat.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ah, yes. I mean, you don&apos;t have to be so nervous.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I&apos;m not nervous, really. It&apos;s just that... I&apos;m a little restless.&quot;</p>


<p>True to her word, Alisa mumbled, {This room smells boyish...} as her gaze wandered restlessly.</p>


<p>(Don&apos;t say that in a whisper! Don&apos;t look shy when you say it!)</p>


<p>Masachika also felt uneasy when Alisa&apos;s gaze glanced here and there while playing with the ends of her hair and looking increasingly uncomfortable.</p>


<p>Like in a romcom scene, Alisa opened her mouth shyly.</p>


<p>&quot;Umm, ... then, which would you prefer, porridge or borscht?&quot; (Borscht is a type of soup which, if I&apos;m correct, originated in Ukraine and is popular in Russia and eastern european countries. It&apos;s mainly made from beetroot which also gives it its distinctive red color)</p>


<p>&quot;What are those two choices?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika instinctively shouted tsukkomi when presented with two extremes. Then, Alisa spoke with a slightly annoyed expression.</p>


<p>&quot;It&apos;s really good for your body, borscht. It&apos;s easy to eat even if your body is weak because the vegetables are boiled until soft, the garlic and onions will boost your immunity, and it can help with digestion, so it&apos;s very good for your stomach or intestines--&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ah, I see, I see. Don&apos;t say something that sounds like what grannies from the countryside would say next time...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>It felt a bit harsh to say that to a young girl, but Alisa seemed to be speechless and silent. Perhaps it was really something her Russian grandmother would say.</p>


<p>&quot;So, which one do you want?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm... Then, while there&apos;s that choice, I&apos;ll go with Borscht instead...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I see. Then, hmmm... if you want to wait about four hours-&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;So I have to wait that long?!&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika reflexively retorted about what he thought was a joke. However, Alisa lowered her eyebrows as if she hadn&apos;t meant to make a joke.</p>


<p>&quot;But borscht dishes have a lot of ingredients... I might be able to save time by using a pressure cooker, I&rsquo;m not familiar with that idea, though.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not familiar with that process either. If that&apos;s the case, I choose porridge instead. Ah, it may seem rude to say that, but I&apos;m really sorry for troubling you so much...&quot;</p>


<p>It was getting harder and harder to speak, so Masachika lowered his tone of voice and laid back down on the bed.</p>


<p>&quot;Alright, I understand. Then, I&apos;ll make some porridge first...I&apos;ll borrow your kitchen then.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes~...&quot;</p>


<p>He replied with a nod of his head and looked at Alisa&apos;s back. Then when opening the door, Alisa took out her smartphone and started typing something with her eyebrows raised. When he saw the movement of her fingers... Masachika starred in a distant direction.</p>


<p>&quot;...Gosh, you&apos;re just finding out now how to make porridge, huh.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika&apos;s languid tsukkomi echoed in the room where Alisa had left.</p>


<p>(Whereas you can just cook rice with water or broth and add salt...? Where&apos;s the element of guilt...)</p>


<p>That&apos;s what Masachika was thinking silently.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p>


<p>&quot;I see... So I need to season it with salt instead of sugar. Right, right, it&apos;s not kasha after all.&quot; (TN: Kasha is a type of food popular in Russia which is similar to porridge, but isn&apos;t porridge. Confusingly, in the West, or more accurately in countries outside Asia, kasha is referred to as, or commonly, called porridge, while Asian porridge/the porridge mentioned here is referred to as congee.)</p>


<p>It turns out that there was a lot of room for error. By the way, kasha is a made with oatmeal and horse grain* instead of rice, milk instead of broth, and sugar instead of salt.</p>


<p>It&apos;s a good thing she checked it first. Otherwise, the a conversation like,</p>


<p>&quot;Ewww! You put the salt in wrong and swapped it for sugar!&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh? I didn&apos;t put it in wrong, did I?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>


<p>,would have happened between them.</p>


<p>&quot;Ummm, if I use packaged rice... Can I put it all in the pot? Oh, I have to heat it up in the microwave first.&quot;</p>


<p>While holding the smartphone in her hand, Alisa put the packaged rice she bought into the microwave.</p>


<p>&quot;&apos;Then put in the water&apos;, more precisely how many liters of water is needed, anyway...&quot;</p>


<p>While complaining about the vague description, Alisa looked at some recipes and filled the pot with water.</p>


<p>&quot;Oh, the rice is already warm... ouch, it&apos;s hot!&quot;</p>


<p>She was first shocked by the heat of the packaged rice, and then shocked by the heat of the steam that rose up when she opened the lid. Somehow she managed to grab the end of the packet and bring it to the top of the pot, but in her haste to avoid the heat, she tilted the packet and the thick rice fell into the water with a bang, splashing the water everywhere. Moreover, since the package was tilted toward her, the splashing water was directed toward her stomach.</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>Water splattered on the kitchen table and her clothes were too wet to cover. Alisa stared at the scene as if she was frozen... but, she suddenly raised her face slowly and wiped her clothes and the kitchen table with her handkerchief.</p>


<p>&quot;It&apos;s fine...everything is safe if I wear an apron.&quot;</p>


<p>She took out an apron from her bag, then quickly put it on, and continued cooking as if nothing had happened. If asked what was safe, perhaps the answer was safe for Alisa&apos;s dignity. Perhaps. As long as no one anyone found out, then there was no problem.</p>


<p>&quot;...Approximately how much water was splashed?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa was a little worried about the amount of water in the pot, but she still managed to manage the amount of water and put the pot on the stove.</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>She put the pot on the heat and waited for the rice to boil and waited.</p>


<p>&quot;...Is this all? Somehow it feels like I&apos;m forgetting something...&quot;</p>


<p>As soon as there was nothing to do anymore, Alisa became anxious for no obvious reason. She opened the lid and stirred the contents, then repeatedly checked the recipe to see if there were any flaws...</p>


<p>&quot;&apos;Wait for it to thicken&apos;, for how long exactly, anyway? There&apos;s no easier way to describe it, like letting the water evaporate completely?&quot;</p>


<p>And so, while complaining constantly, she somehow managed to make some porridge.</p>


<p>&quot;I guess this is enough...?&quot;</p>


<p>She decided that she would let Masachika adjust the saltiness of the porridge, then serve it on a plate, and finish it off with a sprinkling of green onions (which took 5 minutes to cut). With a spoon and a bottle of salt, Alisa headed to Masachika&apos;s room.</p>


<p>(Why is this side a little dented...?)</p>


<p>While silently commenting on it and tilting her head as she looked at the slightly dented area under the door knob, Alisa called out to her before entering the room.</p>


<p>&quot;Kuze-kun? I brought some porridge for you.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh... thank you.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika lay limply on the bed. His voice sounded a little hoarse and his eyes were somewhat dazed as he looked at Alisa. Seeing the appearance of</p>

<p>Masachika&apos;s weakened and uncharacteristic appearance, Alisa...</p>


<p>(I want to pet him...)</p>


<p>A maternal instinct arose within her. But then, she immediately shattered that thought. She trampled on it until it shattered to pieces and threw it out of the space in her brain. Meanwhile, Masachika slowly raised his right hand and held up his thumb.</p>


<p>&quot;For your appearance in an apron, thank you very much.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...It looks like you&apos;re doing quite a bit better than I expected.&quot;</p>


<p>Thanks to the mask that hid her cheeks and mouth, Alisa said as she averted her gaze and moved her feet that had stopped. ... Alisa did not notice that the tips of her ears, which were not covered by the mask, turned red. But Masachika noticed it very much.</p>


<p>&quot;...Can you eat?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hm... Yeah.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika tried to get up and sat on the edge of the bed. After Alisa placed the porridge in front of him, Masachika took off his mask and picked up the spoon.</p>


<p>&quot;...Aren&apos;t you going to &apos;fu~fu~&apos; to cool down the porridge?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Do you want me to do it?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Sorry, I was just joking.&quot;</p>


<p>With a frivolous and silly smile, Masachika muttered &quot;Itadakimasu&quot; and brought the porridge to his mouth. In front of Alisa, who was sitting in a chair watching the scene, Masachika ate his porridge and then said.</p>


<p>&quot;...It&apos;s delicious.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p>


<p>Although she doubted whether the porridge tasted good or not, Alisa was already happy that Masachika didn&apos;t say that it tasted bad. For a while, she watched Masachika eat the porridge, but then Alisa felt that it was rude to stare at other people eating, so she</p>

<p>turned her attention around the room.</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>The first thing Alisa noticed when looking around Masachika&apos;s room was that his room was cleaner than she had expected... or rather, his room didn&apos;t have had a lot of stuff. As an open otaku, Alisa had thought that Masachika&apos;s room would be filled with a large shelf of manga and light novels as well as a few figurines lined up on the study table... but she found nothing of the sort.</p>


<p>There were indeed manga, but those were just a few piled up on the study table.</p>


<p>&quot;...If you&apos;re looking for otaku stuff, it&apos;s all in another room.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh, umm, I see.&quot;</p>


<p>As if guessing her thoughts, Masachika told her and Alisa turned her face forward awkwardly. Then, to change the subject, she said something that made her curious.</p>


<p>&quot;Umm... where are your parents?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;My father is busy with his work. I don&rsquo;t have a mom.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh...?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well, not that I&apos;m trying to hide it anyway, but... my family, it&apos;s just me and my dad.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Uh, so... that&apos;s it...&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa felt regretful about the words that came out of her mouth thoughtlessly. However, Masachika continued on as if it wasn&apos;t something important.</p>


<p>&quot;It&apos;s not like she died, okay? It was just a normal divorce. It&apos;s not something strange in this day and age.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Is that so...&quot;</p>


<p>He was probably feeling a little tired due to his feverish illness. However, when Masachika talked about his mother in such a troublesome manner, Alisa felt a little sad.</p>


<p>Now Alisa understood why his grandfather had gone to the parent-teacher meeting yesterday and felt a little disappointed with her own stupidity. At the same time she realized that she didn&apos;t know much about Masachika.</p>


<p>(By the way... I didn&apos;t even know Kuze-kun&apos;s birthday until recently...)</p>


<p>The two of them have been sitting next to each other for over a year now, but she didn&apos;t even know that. And Alisa was even more disappointed that she didn&apos;t realize it until she was told. The fact that he didn&apos;t hide it meant that information... Of course, his childhood friends, Yuki and Ayano, must have known about it.</p>


<p>The thought that Yuki and Ayano might be celebrating Masachika&apos;s birthday at this house without her knowledge, made Alisa&apos;s heart become gloomy. However, if Yuki had not told her today, Alisa would probably never find out about Masachika&apos;s family situation. At that thought, perhaps she should... thank Yuki. Even though she was a little confused.</p>


<p>(Next time, I&apos;ll talk about things with Kuze-kun)</p>


<p>As Alisa quietly decided to do just that, Masachika finished eating his porridge.</p>


<p>&quot;Thank you for the food... It was delicious. Oh, this tea too.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;You&apos;re welcome... The tea is from Masha, so I&apos;ll let her know that you appreciate it very much.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Please do.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Then... next, take the medicine, yes. Oh, but before that, do you want to change first?&quot;</p>


<p>When Alisa said that while looking at Masachika&apos;s pajamas soaked in sweat, Masachika chuckled in a cute way.</p>


<p>&quot;Oi,oi, the event of wiping sweat and changing clothes is fan-service because the girls do it, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t say such silly things, quickly change your clothes. I&apos;ll bring you some medicine and water.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Yes.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Do you need hot water and a towel?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, no need. I&apos;ll wipe my sweat with these pajamas.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I see... oh yes, where is the thermometer?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh, I put it in the--&quot; (TN: not a miss-TL)</p>


<p>After hearing from Masachika where the thermometer was kept, Alisa took the empty bowl and left the room. She then washed it in the sink and while casually putting it into the drainage basket...</p>


<p>&quot;Ah...&quot;</p>


<p>There, Alisa found the mug she had given Masachika the other day a while ago.</p>


<p>(So... he uses it, huh)</p>


<p>This made Alisa&apos;s heart feel warm. She subconsciously took the mug and smiled happily... About 10 seconds later, she regained her composure and hurriedly put it back down. She quickly looked around to make sure that no one had seen her, and then pretended to cough.</p>


<p>After calming down, she returned to Masachika&apos;s room while carrying water, medicine, and</p>

<p>other items.</p>


<p>&quot;May I come in?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Yes.&quot;</p>


<p>When she entered the room, Masachika, who had already changed into his new pajamas,</p>

<p>was sitting on his bed and waiting. Alisa could not find the pajamas he had taken off, but perhaps Masachika was too embarrassed to have his dirty pajamas seen, so he hid them somewhere.</p>


<p>&quot;Okay, here&apos;s the medicine and the fever-reducing compress plaster... then, here&apos;s the</p>

<p>the thermometer.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika tucked the thermometer under his arm and poured the medicine with water. Then while waiting for a while, the thermometer made a sound.</p>


<p>Then, Masachika tried to take out the thermometer... and grinned as if he had discovered something.</p>


<p>&quot;What do you think the temperature is?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Already, don&apos;t keep joking around...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Muu... well, alright. Yosh! 38.4 degrees!&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Mmm! That was close! It&apos;s 38.6 degrees! U-Uhukk!&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t keep doing silly things, go to sleep.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Uhukk, ... yes.&quot; (TN: &quot;uhukk&rdquo; was the sound effect for coughing btw)</p>


<p>As soon as he shook off his bangs, Masachika placed a fever-reducing compress plaster</p>

<p>on his forehead, and he fell on the bed. Masachika wriggled to find a comfortable position on the bed, lifted the mask to his nose and relaxed his whole body.</p>


<p>&quot;...Really, thank you very much, yes. I&apos;ll return the money later, so please leave the receipt on the table.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t think too much about it, it&apos;s only this much.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, I want the matter of money to be returned properly, that&apos;s the way it should be.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, yes. I understand.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Then, I&apos;m going to sleep again... You can go home now. Umm, the key ...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it. I&apos;ll study in the living room later.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, you don&apos;t need to go that far...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Sick people shouldn&apos;t worry about things so much.</p>

<p>Come on, let&apos;s go to bed.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Okay~...&quot;</p>


<p>The lights in the room were turned off and Masachika closed his eyes as if he had given up. Then he could hear Alisa&apos;s footsteps that he thought had left the room.</p>


<p>(Oh, so she wanted to take the thermometer and cup that she forgot...)</p>


<p>Contrary to Masachika&apos;s expectations, he heard the sound of a chair creaking right next to him, then he felt a hand on his chest which was patting it gently.</p>


<p>&quot;...Alya-san?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;What.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika opened his eyes when he saw Alisa&apos;s behavior as if she was putting a child to sleep and tried to say, &quot;Stop, it&apos;s embarrassing...&quot;, but when he saw Alisa&apos;s gaze, he swallowed those words back.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/KXHKr51/image-026.jpg">

<p>&quot;It&apos;s nothing... Thank you so much for everything.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t think too much about it... it&apos;s because you&rsquo;re always helped me...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Indeed, I&apos;m the one who&apos;s always helping you, aren&apos;t I?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika closed his eyes again. Then, perhaps because of the sensation of a gentle pat on his chest, he felt that his sleepiness was increasing rapidly.</p>


<p>&quot;Things like that...compared to your help in the election campaign, this is still nothing... Besides, there are many other things...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it...it&apos;s because I just wanted to do it.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika interrupted Alisa&apos;s words with his consciousness increasingly blurred by the approaching drowsiness. This way the conversation was over, it was time to sleep... when Masachika thought that, contrary to his expectations, Alisa still said something.</p>


<p>&quot;Because you want to do it? What does that mean...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm? What is it...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Why are you always helping me?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s, because I... to you...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Kuze-kun?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>(Alisa seemed to say something. I have to answer her)</p>


<p>The thought was swept away by the drowsiness that struck. Then Masachika really fell into a deep sleep... But right before that, Alisa&apos;s whisper sounded softly in his ear.</p>


<p>&quot;Good night... Masachika-kun.&quot;</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p>


<p>&quot;Ugh...&quot;</p>


<p>When Masachika opened his eyes again, it was already dark outside.</p>


<p>&quot;Ahh...&quot;</p>


<p>Perhaps the medicine worked, Masachika felt that he was in a much better condition than during the day. His body was still a little sore and his head felt dizzy, but that was probably because he had slept too much. By the time he looked at the clock, it was already past 8pm. It looked like he had slept for more than 5 hours. Considering the amount of sleep in the morning, he had clearly slept too much.</p>


<p>(Alya... must have gone home already, right?)</p>


<p>With such thoughts, Masachika took out his smartphone out of habit before leaving the room and frowned at the lock screen that was activated. The screen displayed 2 messages from Yuki, which read, &quot;What&apos;s your order? a maid? I&apos;ve ignited a spark ZE ☆ .&quot; (TN: I&apos;m so sorry but I have no idea wtf she&apos;s saying here)</p>


<p>Feeling a bad premonition, Masachika opened the door to his room... and turned away looking forward to the day after tomorrow to escape reality. Because in his living room, there were two beautiful girls who were secretly ... yes, secretly glaring at each other.</p>


<p>(I see, so this is called a cold war, huh? I didn&apos;t know that there would be a cold war between Russia and Japan)</p>


<p>Masachika thought silly things as if escaping reality, but he was forcibly pulled back to reality when the two people called out to him at the same time because they heard the sound of the door opening.</p>


<p>&quot;Kuze-kun, are you okay to get up?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Masachika-sama, how are you?&quot;</p>


<p>One of them was Alisa, while the other was... Ayano who was wearing full gear (?) with her hair pulled back and her forehead exposed, and wearing a maid uniform. By the way, the model of Ayano&apos;s maid dress had a lace and has the feel of a maid uniform from Akihabara, but this is just a preference of Yuki&apos;s, not a maid outfit of the Suou family. (TN Akihabara is a shopping district in Tokyo)</p>


<p>The Suou family&apos;s maid uniforms were much simpler and had no headdresses. This was the result of Yuki&apos;s direct request &quot;I think young girls should wear more cute clothes!&quot; to her grandfather, but on the condition that &quot;she should only wear it when there are no guests&quot;, the maid uniform was made by Yuki herself.</p>


<p>(It really does look cute, but... it&apos;s not suitable for this place)</p>


<p>Masachika looked distant in many ways when he saw the appearance of Ayano&apos;s maid outfit after such a long time. Meanwhile, Ayano who was sitting across from Alisa, stood up quickly and silently, and then with an skillfully, she easily slipped under Masachika&apos;s arm.</p>


<p>&quot;Please, you can lean on my shoulder.&quot;</p>


<p>Without realizing it, Ayano had already curled up on Masachika&apos;s right side. Ayano&apos;s left arm was wrapped around Masachika&apos;s waist, and her right hand was on his chest.</p>


<p>&quot;No, you don&apos;t have to go that far.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;You don&apos;t need to be all shy.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika tried to distance himself, but Ayano&apos;s arms quickly wrapped around his waist, and Ayano&apos;s body was pressed against his right side.</p>


<p>&quot;Calm down Ayano. The only person who is allowed to embrace a maid&apos;s shoulders are only underworld organization bosses who have slaves as their samurai, you know?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;You&apos;re the one who should stay calm. And Kimishima-san, quickly get away from him.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, this is already my duty as a maid.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;You&apos;re not Kuze-kun&apos;s maid, but Yuki-san&apos;s, right?&quot;</p>


<p>After hearing Alisa&apos;s words, Ayano was suddenly stunned... During that pause, Masachika gently tried to move her body away. However,</p>


<p>&quot;...Yuki-sama has ordered me to take care of Masachika-sama. So, this is my duty as a maid.&quot;</p>


<p>Ayano pushed her body again to hug Masachika tightly. Seeing that scene, Alisa&apos;s eyebrows rose.</p>


<p>&quot;Therefore, I will take over Masachika-sama&apos;s care. Since it&apos;s getting late, Alisa-sama can go home first. The Suou family car will take you home.&quot;</p>


<p>(Ooii the way you talk! I know that you didn&apos;t mean it, but your words just now sounded as if you were driving her away!?)</p>


<p>As for Ayano, she was probably really sincere in saying &quot;Since it&apos;s late, let me take care of the rest. Good night, okay?&quot; she must have meant.</p>


<p>However, when she was in the position of embracing Masachika, it sounded more like &quot;Since he already has me, you&apos;re no longer needed. I&apos;ve already prepared a car for you, so why don&apos;t you go back home?&quot;.</p>



<p>In fact, Alisa raised her eyebrows at Ayano&apos;s words and simply gave Ayano a sharp look. However, Ayano did not budge and returned her gaze with a flat expression.</p>


<p>(Eh? She didn&apos;t take offense...huh?)</p>


<p>Normally, if you don&apos;t have any ulterior motives, you&apos;d just tilt your head as if you don&apos;t understand why someone is glaring at you. Ehh? Is this maybe a shuraba? Is there going to be a shuraba? Doubts arose inside Masachika, and at the same time, Yuki&apos;s message,</p>

<p>reappeared in his mind. Although it was said to be a spark but it gave him goosebumps, Masachika wondered if it was because he had a fever or something else? (TN: shuraba is a phrase which means &ldquo;scene of bloodshed&rdquo;)</p>


<p>&quot;Besides, isn&apos;t Alisa-sama busy preparing for tomorrow&apos;s activities?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa&apos;s eyebrows twitched at Ayano&apos;s words. But... Masachika didn&apos;t know what they were talking about.</p>


<p>&quot;Tomorrow? Did something happen?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Nothing. It&apos;s just an activity at school.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa immediately answered as if trying to cover it up, and Masachika felt a little curious about it ...</p>


<p>&quot;...Between us, who does Kuze-kun prefer to be taken care of?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa&apos;s next words dispelled any doubts she had.</p>


<p>(What the hell was that question!?)</p>


<p>Masachika screamed inwardly at the trick question, which no matter how he answered it, would always offend one of the parties.</p>


<p>(If I had to choose, Ayano is probably more used to this kind of thing, and I don&apos;t feel like bothering Alya all the time, so the answer would be Ayano, right? However, she definitely doesn&apos;t want to hear an answer like that...)</p>


<p>This is not a matter of logic. In situations like this, women want to hear what you actually feel, and not what you think makes sense. Masachika herself is well aware of that.</p>


<p>(What I really feel, huh...)</p>


<p>With his head slightly dizzy from the returning fever, Masachika asked himself. What he really wanted. He wanted to be taken care of by whom... The answer naturally came out of his mouth.</p>


<p>&quot;I want to try a harem.&quot;</p>


<p>What an asshole answer. He was really a jerk. Hearing such an answer, Alisa&apos;s gaze lost its light in an instant.</p>


<p>&quot;Ah no, that was...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Understood. Do I need to call Yuki-sama to join me here?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t just agree right away, oi.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Then, Alisa-sama, please help Masachika-sama&apos;s left shoulder.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No need, you don&apos;t have to.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;You don&apos;t need to feel all shy, you know? I&apos;m well aware that men prefer to have more women.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Can you not keep picking on me without a hint of ill will!?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika yelled at Ayano, who was looking at him with clear eyes that were different from Alisa&apos;s. Immediately afterward, Alisa&apos;s long sigh reached his ears, and Masachika moved his body away from Ayano.</p>


<p>&quot;...If you can scream that loudly, I think you&apos;re a bit better.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ah, Alya-san?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I&apos;m going home first. Oh, there&apos;s borscht in the kitchen, so you can eat it for dinner.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Bo-Borscht? Oh, so this smell is from that dish huh?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika looked around at the familiar scent spreading in the living room. Nodding silently in affirmation, Alisa packed up her luggage and turned to leave the living room.</p>


<p>&quot;A-Ayano? Can you move away a bit since I&apos;m having trouble walking?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Understood.&quot;</p>


<p>He managed to get Ayano to move away and Masachika followed Alisa. When caught up with her at the entrance, he lowered his eyebrows and apologized to Alisa.</p>


<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m sorry. Even though you&apos;ve come all this way, it turned out to be like this... But I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.&quot;</p>


<p>When Masachika thanked her, Arisa&apos;s expression softened slightly.</p>


<p>&quot;It&apos;s okay... I, too, just wanted to do it.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Hmm?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Don&apos;t think about it too much.&quot;</p>


<p>When she took her eyes off Masachika who was tilting his head, Alisa looked at Ayano who was standing diagonally behind Masachika.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, I&apos;ll leave Kuze-kun&apos;s care to you, okay?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, just leave it to me.&quot;</p>


<p>Nodding slightly at the bowing Ayano, Alisa looked at the face of Masachika again.</p>


<p>&quot;?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa&apos;s gaze was filled with determination. Masachika tilted his head in strong will as if he had decided something.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Then Kuze-kun, see you soon.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh, yes... see you again.&quot;</p>


<p>However, Alisa did not respond to Masachika&apos;s call of question. Alisa turned around and pushed the front door open, then walked out.</p>


<p>Masachika looked away with an inexplicable feeling, but his worries were interrupted when Ayano stepped out from behind her and closed the front door.</p>


<p>&quot;Are you okay? As I thought, do you need me</p>

<p>to support your shoulder?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, no need.&quot;</p>


<p>As Masachika stood there in a daze, Ayano closed the distance again, and Masachika backed away.</p>


<p>&quot;I mean, just now it felt like my foot hit something... Is there something in your pocket?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika said so while stroking the outside of his thigh in pain. Then, Ayano stopped moving, then tilted her head slowly and blinked as if she had just realized something.</p>


<p>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s...&quot;</p>


<p>Then, she suddenly grabbed the skirt of her maid uniform and directly lifted it up without showing the slightest hesitation.</p>


<p>&quot;Wait-, what are you doing!?&quot;</p>


<p>In front of Masachika, Ayano&apos;s knees were wrapped in white knee socks, open, as well as her smooth thighs could be seen... clearly...</p>


<p>&quot;What the hell is that?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika&apos;s face turned serious when she saw the object wrapped around Ayano&apos;s thigh.</p>

<p>However, it was only natural for her expression to turn serious. Because there were two black ribbons wrapped on each of Ayano&apos;s thighs and an object that looked like a silver pen was inserted into them.</p>


<p>&quot;This is a weapon.&quot;</p>






<p>&quot;What the hell is that!?&quot;</p>


<p>In front of Masachika who was yelling and screaming, Ayano swung her right arm to flutter her skirt. The skirt fluttered vividly, showing off an area of absolute attractiveness that seemed to be visible. Ayano&apos;s right hand was raised... in front of Masachika who couldn&apos;t help but be dumbfounded at the sight that no boy could resist.</p>


<p>&quot;This is a weapon.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, you told me what it is.&quot;</p>


<p>There were three metal mechanical pencils with pointed tips between Ayano&apos;s fingers. It was true that if she stabbed them into someone&apos;s neck with all her might, it would be enough to kill a person... Why would such an object be kept in her skirt?</p>


<p>&quot;Yuki-sama said... that this is &apos;good&apos;.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, I know.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yuki-sama said that the maid uniform is a combat outfit, so I should be ready for battle at all times...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I see. What on earth is she trying to fight?&quot;</p>


<p>Resignedly, Masachika returned to the living room without commenting further.</p>


<p>&quot;Do you have an appetite? Just now Alisa-sama said that she had prepared borscht for you...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ah, then I&apos;ll eat it.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Understood. Please wait a moment.&quot;</p>


<p>While sitting on the chair, Masachika measured his body temperature and waited, and then a delicious scent wafted into her nose.</p>


<p>&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting. Do you still have a fever?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh... 37.4 degrees. Well, I&apos;m doing much better than before.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Thank goodness then... I&apos;ve warmed it back up, please</p>

<p>enjoy.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>


<p>When Masachika looked at the plate with the spoon in his hand, he saw the soup that looked like borscht. Apparently, it was made simply by stewing vegetables without meat, probably in consideration of the sick person&apos;s state.</p>


<p>&quot;Then... itadakimasu.&quot;</p>


<p>As soon as he tasted the soup, the strong sourness immediately stimulated his tongue. However, the sweetness of the vegetables soon spread and he felt that his tongue, which was dulled by the fever, recovered quickly.</p>


<p>&quot;Delicious...&quot;</p>


<p>His appetite was instantly increasing, Masachika scooped up the next vegetable. All the vegetables were well-cooked and melted in his mouth without being chewed again. The cabbage and onions tasted sweet and the grain ingredients were barely smelled of soil.</p>


<p>(When I was a child, when I ate this dish at Jii-chan&apos;s house, I didn&apos;t like the earthy smell... Jii-chan actually laughed and said that he liked that smell, but I definitely prefer this one.)</p>


<p>He ate it with gusto, and before he knew it, Masachika had already finished it all.</p>


<p>&quot;There&apos;s still some borscht left in the pot... Would you like some more?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Then, can you get some for me?&quot; He also finished the rest of the food. Masachika was a little surprised, because he did not expect that he could eat that much by herself.</p>


<p>&quot;Thanks for the food... I guess I should thank Alya.&quot;</p>


<p>If I&apos;m not mistaken, Alisa herself said that it would take about four hours to make. Masachika could only be grateful that she had taken the time and effort to make this for him.</p>


<p>&quot;Fu...&quot;</p>


<p>After finishing her meal, Masachika started to feel sleepy again. Maybe it was because his stomach was full, or maybe it was because his fever had gone up again...</p>


<p>&quot;Masachika-sama, please, here&apos;s the medicine.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh, thank you.&quot;</p>


<p>After taking the medicine given by Ayano, Masachika tried to stand up. He stopped Ayano who was trying to help him , and slowly returned to his room and laid down on his bed.</p>


<p>&quot;Hwahaaaaa...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Masachika-sama, how about a bath?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm~ today probably not...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;In that case, at least let me wipe your body.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I think I&apos;ll just take a shower instead.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika immediately retracted his previous statement to Ayano who clenched her fists with a motivated look in her eyes. Somehow, he had a feeling that it would be very bad if he left Ayano in such a state.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, washing your back--&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No need, no need.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll wear the blindfold properly.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Didn&apos;t expect that a blindfold flag would appear here? No, I have a bad feeling about you washing my body with a blindfold.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Then... without the blindfold.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I still have a bad feeling about it.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;You don&apos;t have to worry. As a servant, I promise that I will never ever look at Masachika-sama with a sexual gaze.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oi, what kind of declaration is that?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;In case I break this promise, you are free to do whatever to my body.</p>


<p>&quot;What a heavy promise.&quot;</p>


<p>After that, Ayano tried desperately to take care of Masachika by all means necessary, but at the time of getting ready for bed, Masachika felt tired in many ways.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, Masachika-sama... Good night.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh. .. good night.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika pretended not to notice Ayano, who still seemed to be dissatisfied in some way, and waved his hand in the air.</p>


<p>&quot;I guess, if we sleep together...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;You don&apos;t need to do that, you&apos;ll get sick later.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;At least, I&apos;ll sing a lullaby...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No need, no need.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>


<p>Ayano still hadn&apos;t closed the door. Masachika sighed lightly at the maid who was staring through the gap in the slightly opened door and sharpened her gaze slightly.</p>


<p>&quot;Ayano.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;! Yes, do you need anything?&quot;</p>


<p>&apos;You do, don&apos;t you? You want me to sing you a lullaby, right?&apos; was the message the twinkle in Ayano&apos;s eyes conveyed</p>


<p>&quot;This is an order. You must sleep in Yuki&apos;s room.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;! Understood. Have sweet dreams, Masachika-sama.&quot;</p>


<p>As soon as Masachika said the word &quot;order,&quot; Ayano&apos;s body jerked, then immediately lowered her head and closed the door.</p>


<p>&quot;...I should have done this from the beginning...&quot;</p>


<p>With a wry smile, Masachika picked up his smartphone before going to sleep. Then, there was a message from Yuki that said &apos;Battle between girls, round one: Ayano vs Alya-san, winner is Ayano.&apos;</p>


<p>&quot;No, there&apos;ll really be a second round, huh?...&quot;</p>


<p>While commenting on that, Masachika put down his smartphone and turned over to sleep. Although he had slept so much, he thought it would be difficult to fall asleep again, but it turned out that his sleepiness came very quickly. Masachika did not fight the sleepiness and slowly fell asleep.</p>


<p>... Yes, he was fast asleep. The discomfort he felt from Alisa&apos;s attitude was left unsaid. He did not even think deeply about the meaning behind Yuki&apos;s message.</p>


<p>By the time Masachika realized what was really going on, everything was already over... yes, it was too late.</p>
