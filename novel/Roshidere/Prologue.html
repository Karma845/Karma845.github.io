<h3>Prologue </h3>

<p>There was a luxurious house located in an &ldquo;elite residential area&rdquo; where other large houses are lined up.</p>

<p>The Western-style house with its well-landscaped garden gave it a historic feel.</p>
<p>Compared to the other houses in the vicinity, this prominent building is the residence of the Suou family, a well-respected family with hundreds of years of history.</p>

<p>Inside one of the rooms of the building, three members of the family living in the</p>
<p>the house were eating dinner. A long table in a spacious room with an elegant and calm atmosphere. The person sitting in the chair at the far end with his back to the fireplace was the current head of the Suou family, Suou Gensei.</p>

<p>Although he was already 69 years old, his body was sturdy, it did not look</p>
<p>weakened with age, and combined with his straight back, he gave an aura of</p>
<p>authority. The wrinkles on his face give the impression of dignity, and did not show any weakness. He is similar to a tree that lasted to harsh conditions of constant rain and wind.</p>

<p>The people sitting side by side in front of Gensei were his daughter, Suou</p>
<p>Yumi, and his granddaughter, Suou Yuki. The two of them were a mother-daughter pair who looked very similar, except there was a big difference in their height and style. As Yuki continued to grow older, she would look just like her mother. The only difference is only the eyes. As for the nose, face, and contours, they both look exactly the same.</p>

<p>Unlike Yuki, her mother, Yumi, had droopy eyes and a mole under her</p>
<p>her right eye. Her rather moody eyes and expression gave her a shy impression that contrasted with her father, Suou Gensei.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;A few days ago, it seems like there was a Student Council Debate, huh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they had tasted some of the dishes to some extent, Gensei started the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard that the participants were Masachika and the daughter of Taniyama</p>
<p>Heavy Industries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Although to be more precise, Onii-sama is Kujou-san&rsquo;s Vice President.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuki tried to correct it just in case, while thinking that that information should have been told to her grandfather from Ayano who was standing behind her. But as expected, her grandfather was not interested in such trivial information and simply snorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In middle school, I wondered what kind of person she was since she was the only one who ran against me to the end&hellip; but I heard that she ran away in the middle of the debate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. There must have been some circumstances that made her do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmmp! Whatever the reason, the result made Masachika the favorite candidate for next year&rsquo;s student council president.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gulped down his drink in annoyance and placed the empty glass on the</p>
<p>on the table. Ayano&rsquo;s grandmother, who was standing behind him, immediately poured the wine into the empty glass. While waiting, Gensei turned his gaze</p>
<p>towards Yuki.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this to heart. No matter who your opponent is, you cannot lose.</p>

<p>You must become the student council president of Seirei Gakuen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand that very well. Ojii-sama.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In terms of talent, you are no match for Masachika. But you know the responsibilities of a talented person. Regarding that matter, Masachika cannot understand that. Although he has the best talent and was blessed with a special environment, he abandoned it.&rdquo; As Gensei said this bitterly, Yumi gently lowered her gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember well. This world is not equal. Wealth, family environment, appearance, and talent. There is a clear division between those who are born</p>
<p>with those factors and those who do not have them. Yuki, you were born</p>
<p>as the owner of all those aspects. Therefore, you should contribute to the</p>
<p>contribute to the world with what you have. That is the responsibility</p>
<p>of a blessed person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is the teaching that has been instilled in Yuki and her brother since childhood. That was the absolute value of Suou Gensei.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know very well that those who are talented but let them rot</p>
<p>without utilizing it is a sin. Those who have talent have the responsibility to use it for the good of the world. You must not lose to men who abandon that responsibility. You understand, right, Yuki.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuki&rsquo;s heart churned at the harsh words directed at her brother. However, Yuki still put a gentle smile on her face without revealing her inner feelings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand, Ojii-sama&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, she could only nod slowly at her grandfather&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yuki-san&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;?? Okaa-sama?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she finished eating and was about to return to her room, her mother suddenly called out, and Yuki turned around in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there something Okaa-sama wants to talk to me about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;..&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Yuki asked what she wanted, her mother only looked down and was silent for a for a while. However, after waiting patiently, her mother suddenly</p>
<p>looked up her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder &hellip;. if you get along well with Masachika-san&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yumi nodded slowly while taking her eyes off her daughter who was</p>
<p>replied with a bright smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umm, what&rsquo;s wrong with Onii-sama?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing &hellip;. After this, you have Chinese lessons, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, online.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see&hellip; do your best&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuki bowed beautifully and left for her room with Ayano. Yumi continued to</p>
<p>staring silently at her daughter&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fu&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>After reaching her own room, she closed the door and let out a small sigh.</p>
<p>a small sigh. Yuki then turned her head forward and called out to Ayano who was standing behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Ayano&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Yuki-sama&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please be a bolster pillow for a while&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ayano nodded familiarly at the instructions that would probably not be believed</p>
<p>by strangers if they heard them, and said, &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; as she lying down on the bed. Yuki then quietly leaned over, hugged Ayano from the front and buried her face in Ayano&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>In such a position, Yuki rubbed her head left and right while embracing Ayano. During that time, Ayano just stood still as instructed as she was told. She neither hugged Yuki&rsquo;s body back nor stroked her head. Doing so would hurt Yuki&rsquo;s pride as her Master. Because she knew that, Ayano kept quiet and allowed herself to be hugged. A few minutes later, Yuki lifted her face up with great vigorously, knelt on the bed, and exhaled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yosh, I&rsquo;ve recovered!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you. Seriously, Oppai is the greatest gift ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuki headed for her computer desk as she got out of bed, while saying saying things like that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me fix your hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm, please~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ayano used a comb to tidy up Yuki&rsquo;s hair which was messy from rolling around on the bed.</p>

<p>The touch of her hands was always gentle, and her eyes were filled with endless affection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just tidy up as needed, okay? After all, it&rsquo;s only up to my shoulder. Instead, please make me a drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understood. Would you like some coffee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have onii-chan and the anime is tonight. Moreover, onii-chan is definitely watching that masterpiece.</p>
<p>Hehehe~ I won&rsquo;t let you sleep tonight~, Onii-chan~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuki smiled happily as she thought of the anime that aired at a late hour and their impression-making sessions afterwards.</p>

<p>Ayano left the room silently, while inwardly feeling relieved that her master had completely back to normal.</p>
