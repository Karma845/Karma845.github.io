<h3>Chapter 11 - Cooking and Reasoning</h3>



<p>&quot;How was your summer vacation, Kuze? Did you have enough fun and enjoy it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, not bad. How about the chairman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess I was similar. I&apos;m sure that had a pretty meaningful vacation.&quot;</p>

<p>Inside the men&apos;s room on the second floor of the villa. There was a trivial conversation going on between two men facing each other on two beds side by side. There were only two men here, and although there should be plenty of things to talk about, right now they were not particularly interested in having a conversation. That&apos;s how it should be. Because 80% of both of their consciousness... especially Touya&apos;s, was being directed towards the kitchen downstairs.</p>

<p>Inside the spacious kitchen area of the Kenzaki family villa, there was now a special battle between the five girls. Although it sounded exaggerated, what was happening was basically a culinary battle. It all started when they were on the train heading to their destination. At Yuki&apos;s suggestion, the girls decide to prepare one dish each for dinner today. And since just doing that would be boring, they decided to keep it a secret who made the dish and have the two men choose which dish is the best..... The suggestion was quickly agreed to, especially by Chisaki, who looked very enthusiastic, and that&apos;s exactly how it happened.</p>

<p>That&apos;s why, to be fair, the two boys were forced to wait inside their room while the five girls were busy cooking in the kitchen. However, since the kitchen was not big enough for five people to cook at once, they had to be divided into two or three groups and cook in turn.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh~... yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Touya looked around at the door of the room while making meaningless sounds. His attention was completely distracted and agitated. But, it was only natural that he reacted that way. After all, unlike Masachika who could comfortably evaluate the dishes... In Touya&apos;s case, one of the dishes served was made by his beloved Chisaki. Yes, for Touya, the most important thing was not which dish was the most delicious. It was about finding out which dish was made by Chisaki!</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, by the way, Chairman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever eaten the dishes that Sarashina-senpai made...?&quot;</p>

<p>.....never.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ohh...&quot;</p>

<p>For now, they were at least told to choose which dish was the most delicious, but there was still a possibility that they would be asked &quot;Then which dish is the second second most delicious dish?&quot; Or rather, if Touya guessed Chisaki&apos;s dish incorrectly at the initial turn, there was a high chance that he would be asked that question. If he got it wrong, guess again... Just imagining it was scary enough. Masachika himself didn&apos;t even want the two of them to get involved in a heated relationship. *No one wants to see the beautiful blue sea turn bright red, right?</p>

<p>(TN: Probably an idiom/proverb in Japanese lost in translation, but I guess you can understand it)</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, I&apos;m sorry if what I said sounds a bit offensive, but isn&apos;t Sarashina-senpai.... good at cooking?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know? But the fact that we&apos;ve never talked about it before, there&apos;s a possibility that it is...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But when Yuki suggested a cooking competition, she seemed very enthusiastic....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Chisaki always has an enthusiastic reflex when it comes to competitions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh....&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika nodded his head when remembering his partner Alisa, who also showed her competitive spirit when it came to matches. Then, to regain his composure, he said excitedly.</p>

<p>&quot;But if that&apos;s the case, here&apos;s your chance, Chairman! Although this sounds polite, you can choose dishes from people who are clearly not used to cooking!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... it sounds complicated when you say that, but is it?&quot;</p>

<p>When Touya looked up while looking at the ceiling, Masachika nodded his head vigorously.</p>

<p>&quot;First of all, Ayano can cook normally. And according to Alya, Masha-san is apparently a good cook. Alya is not a bad cook, and Yuki is too...... Well, sometimes she fails, but she doesn&apos;t make bad food. Maybe I can recognize Yuki and Ayano&apos;s cooking when I try them. Alya&apos;s cooking too...... she has a habit of cutting vegetables carefully and such, so maybe can recognize it when I see it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohhh, I see... I mean, have you ever tried the dishes from the three of them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yes, because Yuki and Ayano are my childhood friends. As for Alya, I&apos;ve only tasted it once...&quot;</p>

<p>After slightly awkwardly messing up his words, Masachika cleared his throat once and continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Therefore... As for the cooking of the three of them, I will give the signal to the Chairman once it is known. Once the dishes of the three of them are known, the choices will be Sarashina-senpai&apos;s and Masha-san&apos;s. In case Chairman guesses wrong the first time, you can still follow up on the other dishes. Right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, ohhh, you can be very reliable, Kuze.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... Well, the problem is when Yuki or Ayano cook something strange.&quot;</p>

<p>Touya smiled as if seeing a glimmer of hope, but Masachika lowered his tone of voice and expressed his anxiety. Yes, after all, the person who proposed this cooking competition was Yuki. She might decide that if she made a dish that was so ordinary, Masachika might be able to recognize it right away, so there&apos;s a possibility that she&apos;ll serve a dish that she&apos;s never made before. And there was a possibility that Ayano would follow Yuki&apos;s orders.</p>

<p>&quot;...Aren&apos;t you overthinking it? How could she make a dish like that in the competition that she proposed herself, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let&apos;s hope so...&quot;</p>

<p>Touya&apos;s opinion was quite reasonable. However, Masachika knew his sister&apos;s temperament very well. His younger sister was the type of person who cared more about making the competition more interesting than her own victory.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way... I&apos;ve heard on TV that Russians are very fond of mayonnaise, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>(Hi! If you are reading this from another site like lightnovelreader.me, please leave it and read it from my website here <a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://glucosetl.wordpress.com/">https://glucosetl.wordpress.com/</a>.)</p>

<p>&quot;Hm? What&apos;s with that?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika tilted his head against Touya&apos;s words, who said them while looking up as if searching his memory.</p>

<p>&quot;They say that Russians will add mayonnaise to any dish. If so, I thought it might be a clue to distinguish the dishes of the Kujou Sisters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Adding mayonnaise to any dish... not sour cream or something like that? No, I&apos;ve never heard of it, and my grandfather who went to Russia never mentioned it either...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if the food for tourists isn&apos;t like that, maybe it&apos;s home cooking?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm~~ how much can we trust the information from the TV .... Besides, Russia is a big country, isn&apos;t it. Even in Japan, the food culture is very different between Kanto and Kansai. Especially with such a big country, surely the food culture is more diverse, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm..... That&apos;s right. Come to think of it, can&apos;t deny that &apos;people in Japan love soy sauce&apos;, but if someone asked me if Japanese people would add soy sauce to any dish, would definitely answer no....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. Well, I don&apos;t think that information is very reliable, you know?... But, if the dish is covered with mayonnaise, it&apos;s a different story.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If it&apos;s just covered with mayonnaise, won&apos;t like it.&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika also smiled a little at Touya who smiled bitterly. After that, Masachika looked at the door of the room and glanced at Touya&apos;s face.</p>

<p>&quot;...How about we check on them for a bit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Check up on them? But we&apos;re not allowed to enter the kitchen....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;ll just say we&apos;re going to the bathroom, really. Maybe we can get some clues after hearing the sounds and noises coming from there, right?&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: Two dudes going to the bathroom together? Idk man seems sus)</p>

<p>&quot;So that&apos;s what it looks like, huh.&quot;</p>

<p>They nodded to each other, and together left the room, with their bodies slightly bent over. Then, while descending the stairs very carefully, they concentrated their hearing behind the door that led to the kitchen and the living room. Then, they could faintly hear the sound of cooking.</p>

<p>Was it the sound of a knife cutting something with a steady rhythm? Shuwaaaaaa... There was also the sound of something cooking in a frying pan. Then suddenly came the voice of Maria&apos;s voice, and they stopped to listen carefully.</p>

<p>&quot;It smells so good... The more you saut&eacute; vegetables, the better they taste, right?~.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The more better...? I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Maria&apos;s voice was answered by the voices of Ayano and Chisaki, and then accompanied by the sound of &apos;gosugosu&apos; that continued. As Masachika and Touya tilted their heads at the inexplicable sound, all the sounds coming from the kitchen suddenly disappeared. And, an instant later...</p>

<p>Shukiiiiiiiiin</p>

<p>A guttural metallic sound echoed from the kitchen. The continued silence seemed to drown out the remaining sounds. After a few seconds, the sound of cooking gradually returned, as if the BGM sound had faded away.</p>

<p>&quot;(...Chisaki, what did you end up cutting?)&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;(...Does cooking have to be like a performance of special moves?)&quot;</p>

<p>Touya and Masachika looked at each other in the distance while in the middle of the stairs. Then they heard Ayano&apos;s voice again.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, it would be better to stir it a little harder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stirring......?...... Isn&apos;t it too soft because it&apos;s so easy to cut like this? It could be more persistent~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Chisaki-chan...? Why are you talking bad about vegetables?&quot;</p>

<p>......... For some reason, her voice alone sounded terrible. When he turned around, Touya had completely turned away from him. Masachika also understood that feeling very well.</p>

<p>(...... Not to think about it)</p>

<p>Masachika remained silent and lightly placed his hand on Touya&apos;s shoulder to convey his sympathy. Then Touya turned to walk up the stairs with a distant look in his eyes and walked back to his room with a large body bent over. After looking at his back, Masachika really did go to the toilet even though he used it as an excuse..... When he stood up, Masachika saw Alisa looking at him with cold eyes from the side of the stairs.</p>

<p>They stared at each other in silence. After exchanging glances for a few seconds, Masachika slowly walked down the stairs, approached Alisa, and took both her hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...&quot;</p>

<p>Then, while whispering to calm her down, he led Alisa away from the living room and said, with a stiff face.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t take this the wrong way, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, it doesn&apos;t make any difference, does it? Besides, don&apos;t just touch me.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa pulled her arm and slapped Masachika&apos;s wrist with a look of disgust on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Oops, sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>In the corner of his head, Masachika suddenly thought, &quot;Didn&apos;t you say {you can touch them} in Russian the other day...?&quot; while releasing his hand. Then Alisa rubbed the arm that had been gripped and muttered in a bad mood.</p>

<p>(Don&apos;t hold it too roughly}</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika had no other choice but to apologize honestly about this matter. At the same time, if he lowered his head while asking, &quot;If I ask sincerely, am I allowed to touch it?&quot;..... Alisa&apos;s majestic mountains naturally entered his field of vision.</p>

<p>(No, well, I just rudely touched an even more amazing place, right?)</p>

<p>Inevitably that kind of thought flashed through his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Ohh, you&apos;re wearing underwear properly this time&quot; came back to his mind.</p>

<p>&quot;What a brat...&quot;</p>

<p>As if she could read Masachika&apos;s mind, Alisa&apos;s cheeks twitched in disgust and glanced at Masachika with a contemptuous look. She backed away slightly while covering her chest with both hands, and let out a disgusting expletive.</p>

<p>&quot;In addition to being a pervert, you also like to eavesdrop too, you can&apos;t be saved anymore...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, no, being accused of being a pervert is too much, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, but you don&apos;t deny eavesdropping, huh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s just...&quot;</p>

<p>After a little hesitation, Masachika sighed lightly and decided to speak honestly.</p>

<p>&quot;Leaving me aside, the Chairman will get into trouble if he can&apos;t guess Sarashina-senpai&apos;s cooking correctly, right? So was just thinking of doing a little reconnaissance to help him...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps somewhat convinced by Masachika&apos;s argument, Alisa removed her hand from her chest and raised one eyebrow.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I see what you mean ..... but think, even Sarashina-senpai wouldn&apos;t feel happy if her cooking is known first by the judges in a serious competition, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, hmmm. That&apos;s, well.... indeed...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all, even if she loses, she can try harder next time so that she can be judged on her own merits, or else she&apos;ll lose the chance to be chosen based on her abilities and she will lose the opportunity to grow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uuhmmm~, what you&apos;re saying has a point...&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa&apos;s argument made so much sense that Masachika could only groan. But this time the case was quite different. Masachika then smiled widely without saying his intention that it would be better to avoid a situation that would ruin the atmosphere of the long-awaited trip.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll give you an honest assessment without prejudice. Even if I find out which one is your dish, I won&apos;t change my judgment.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa also smiled provocatively at Masachika&apos;s smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Ara, how could you guess which one is my dish when you&apos;ve only eaten my cooking twice?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s possible, isn&apos;t it? Because I&apos;ve picked up some of your habits from eating your food.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm~?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa raised her eyebrows and smiled as if to imply &quot;If you can do it, just try it.&quot; Masachika also responded with an arrogant smile. Without realizing it, Masachika felt that he was in the flow to find out which dish was her&apos;s. However, he was originally tasked with the mission to find out Chisaki&apos;s cooking. Although it was increased to two people, it didn&apos;t change much at all.</p>

<p>(But, it&apos;s getting more and more exciting... let&apos;s guess which dish it is then and who cooked it, as well as showing her my good points)</p>

<p>Masachika&apos;s motivation was even more burning, even though that was not the purpose of the cooking competition. Seeing his reaction, Alisa shrugged her shoulders lightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well fine, without being told even once, even if you can figure out which is my dish, you don&apos;t have to find out everything, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay. Then, I&apos;ll look forward to it.&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Masachika turned his back on Alisa and tried to return to the second floor.....</p>

<p>{Because I&apos;ll make you choose me}</p>

<p>(Hmm, hmm~! She means &quot;my cooking&quot;, right?)</p>

<p>...then he heard an unexpected surprise from behind in a Russian phrase that was similar to a &quot;declaration of love&quot; from an aggressive girl, and his steps were slightly staggered.</p>

<p>0000</p>

<p>&quot;Then, Chairman, Masachika-kun, please enjoy the meal.&quot;</p>

<p>An hour later, Touya and Masachika sat around the dining table, and Yuki spoke on behalf of the others. And after that, the girls, including Yuki, immediately fell silent. Apparently, they intended not to comment or react when the boys ate it so as not to give them any clues about which dish belonged to whom.</p>

<p>..Itadakimasu&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Touya and Masachika clasped their hands together in a strange atmosphere while being stared at silently by the five girls from across the room. While doing so, Masachika looked at the plates lined up on the table.</p>

<p>(For now... none of the dishes contain mayonnaise, huh)</p>

<p>On the contrary, none of the dishes seemed to be unsuccessful. Though Masachika could hear the sounds of their chaos while cooking.</p>

<p>(Thankfully... I didn&apos;t see any burnt, intoxicated dishes that usually appear in manga)</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are no dishes that you can immediately tell who made them just by looking at it.... At first glance, the names of the dishes from left to right are fried rice, fried chicken, boiled gyoza, hamburg steak, and... a mysterious soup.</p>

<p>(What the heck is that?)</p>

<p>Not only Masachika, but also Touya became fixated on the food on the far right. The large bowl was filled to the brim with a reddish-black soup. French bread was served with the dish, and it turned out that the bread needed to be dipped in it. There are small tomato slices in it, so maybe the red color came from there... There was also a kind of lemon slice floating in the soup.</p>

<p>(Since there is a lemon wedge, does that mean the soup is cold? No, it was steaming... well, soup with lemon slices and tomatoes must be quite sour... yup, don&apos;t have the the courage to taste that just yet)</p>

<p>Masachika came to that conclusion, then exchanged glances with Touya, and lightly communicated with him. Touya pulled out a plate of fried chicken and placed it on a small plate for each of them.</p>

<p>(The dish looks ordinary... The garnish is lettuce and onions, yes. Well, fried chicken usually doesn&apos;t have any strange additions.)</p>

<p>It looked good, but to distinguish between Chisaki&apos;s cooking... or Alisa&apos;s, the lack of garnish was a negative point.</p>

<p>(Well, for now, it&apos;s better to try it first...)</p>

<p>First of all, Masachika tried the fried chicken first. As he bit into the crispy batter, the flavors of soy sauce and garlic, as well as the deliciousness of the chicken meat, spread in his mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... it tastes good&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it&apos;s delicious.&quot;</p>

<p>The two of them naturally gave their impressions. At the same time, Masachika quickly glanced at the girls&apos; reactions, but unfortunately.... they didn&apos;t react at all.</p>

<p>(Well, how could they divulge it so easily... No, but this really delicious)</p>

<p>Next time, if you wrap it with lettuce and onions, it will definitely taste good too. Because the fried chicken has a strong flavor, it goes well with vegetables.</p>

<p>(Well, this flavor itself is probably made with some kind of pre-made fried chicken stock but it&apos;s also quite difficult to fry crispy food. I guess the person who made this must be a good cook, right?)</p>

<p>He almost tasted it again, but he refrained and moved on to the next dish. Touya then picked up the fried rice plate located on the far left.</p>

<p>(The ingredients consist of...egg, spring onion, cabbage, .... no meat, huh? Apparently this is pretty simple fried rice.)</p>

<p>However, daring to serve such a simple fried rice in a cooking competition, it means that the person who cooked this dish is probably quite confident in their skills.</p>

<p>(This might be a bit of fun)</p>

<p>With some anticipation, Masachika brought a small plate of fried rice to his mouth. And the result.......</p>

<p>(Hmm, well it tasted good anyway... but lacked flavor...)</p>

<p>To be honest, it was a little disappointing. Maybe because he ate fried chicken first which was quite strong, but even so, the flavor of this fried rice was still rather light. At best, it was elegant, but from the perspective of Masachika who usually prefers fried rice with the addition of garlic at home, the taste was less than satisfying.</p>

<p>(Well, it might be nice to be able to eat it without getting bored, but... I want to add some pickled radish or something)</p>

<p>While thinking that in his heart, the fried rice itself wasn&apos;t bad just because it wasn&apos;t his favorite, Masachika just said &quot;It&apos;s delicious&quot; for a formal compliment. The girls standing there still didn&apos;t react.</p>

<p>Next, Touya picked up a plate of gyoza. There were no special side dishes, just a plate of dumplings and enough broth to submerge about 70% of them. The distinctive feature was that there were no creases on the edges of the dumplings.</p>

<p>(While eavesdropping earlier, felt that Sarashina-senpai used vegetables in her cooking. Based on that information, it seems that this one is not Sarashina-senpai&apos;s cooking.)</p>

<p>While thinking like that, Masachika brought the dumpling into his mouth...</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm......!?&quot;</p>

<p>He was very surprised by the unexpected filling.</p>

<p>(In-It&apos;s not ground meat anyway... but mashed potatoes!)</p>

<p>(TN: I beg your pardon?)</p>

<p>The soup tasted like consomm&eacute;, which was surprising in its own way, but the flavor of the gyoza itself was completely unexpected. It didn&apos;t taste like meat that he had expected, and the faint sweetness of the sprouted potatoes that absorbed the broth caressed his tongue.</p>

<p>(Seriously... No, but something like this tastes delicious too)</p>

<p>While sharing his surprise with Touya, Masachika tartly said &quot;It tastes delicious&quot;. However, this shook his theory that this dish was not from Chisaki. No, quite the contrary, if the potatoes were cut and mashed, it would explain the strange unexplained sound during the cooking process.</p>

<p>(Wow... I guess this is more difficult than thought? If only Alya and Masha-san were cooking easy-to-understand Russian food...)</p>

<p>Instantly, a flash of inspiration like a divine revelation crossed Masachika&apos;s mind.</p>

<p>(l-isn&apos;t this... it&apos;s true!)</p>

<p>He didn&apos;t realize it right away because it looked like ordinary gyoza. But perhaps, there&apos;s no doubt about it. This was not gyoza, but rather...</p>

<p>(Russian food... Pelmeni!)</p>

<p>(TN: A type of Russian dumpling dish)</p>

<p>This is one of the famous Russian dishes in Japan. Masachika himself only knew it from words and had never actually eaten it. However, he realized that there was a possibility that this dish was Russian.</p>

<p>(If I&apos;m not mistaken, Jii-chan once said that pelmeni can be filled with a variety of ingredients... I see, so this...)</p>

<p>So there was a high possibility that this was Alisa&apos;s or Maria&apos;s dish. The flavor itself is something that Masachika has never tasted, so there should be no way that it was made by Yuki or Ayano.</p>

<p>(It&apos;s possible that my guess is correct, isn&apos;t it?)</p>

<p>As stated, Masachika was excited with the hope that he might be able to recognize Alisa&apos;s food and be able to taste the pelmeni dish for the first time. However, when he saw the next dish that Touya offered, he felt that his excitement had diminished.</p>

<p>(Oh... it&apos;s finally this turn, huh)</p>

<p>Touya pulled out the mysterious soup located on the far right. The ingredients consisted of tomatoes, bacon, and shredded vegetables here and there...</p>

<p>(What&apos;s that green thing floating on the surface... basil? No, I can&apos;t imagine how it tastes...)</p>

<p>He stared intently at the soup in the bowl, putting aside the French bread that accompanied it for time being, and tasted it with a spoon.</p>

<p>&quot;12&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment, Masachika was startled. Touya, who was next to him, also widened his eyes in surprise. It showed how unexpected the flavor of the soup was. In short, the flavor...</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t this pizza...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right...&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika proceeded to taste it once more. The flavor that spread in his mouth was still the taste of pizza...</p>

<p>(Pizza-flavored soup... No, it&apos;s really a mysterious soup)</p>

<p>But it was delicious. This dish was really good. This time, he took a slice of French bread, dipped it into the soup, and ate it.</p>

<p>&quot;In addition, this is also still delicious...&quot;</p>

<p>With each bite of bread, the broth that seeped into the coarse dough of the French bread seeps out. The slightly stronger acidity of the soup combined with the sweetness of the bread creates a synergy of deliciousness.</p>

<p>(This is amazing... Eh? Is this one too...?)</p>

<p>Suddenly, a piece of knowledge appeared in Masachika&apos;s mind.</p>

<p>Russians usually eat soup and bread for lunch. After all, he&apos;d heard that there were many kinds of soup in Russian food. When he thought that this soup was one of them, it made sense. But......</p>

<p>(It&apos;s dinner time and... Russians usually use black bread...)</p>

<p>Even if this soup is Russian food, would the real Russians, Alisa and Maria, serve this combination for dinner? Instead, it&apos;s much more natural to think of it as something made by a halfway knowledgeable person who checked the recipe over the internet and made it for the sake of distraction...</p>

<p>(Well... anyway, it&apos;s better to think about that after eating the last course)</p>

<p>Having concluded that much, Masachika suspended judgment and moved on to the next dish.</p>

<p>The last thing left was a Japanese-style hamburg steak with grated radish and red bean paste on top. The garnish consisted of mushrooms, broccoli, and bell peppers. One of them was quite large, so he decided to cut it in half and share it with Touya.</p>

<p>(This dish is similar to the fried chicken from earlier, not very distinctive in appearance, but.....)</p>

<p>It was a regular hamburger steak dish with no cheese in it. When I tried eating it, the flavor was also mediocre, but still delicious.</p>

<p>&quot;I usually eat it with demi-glace or tomato sauce, but the Japanese-style hamburg steak is also delicious.&quot;</p>

<p>The grated radish that had absorbed a lot of the bean paste was sweet and went well with the hamburg steak. The flavor of the hamburger itself seemed unremarkable, but the combination of ingredients was delicious to Masachika.</p>

<p>(But, if asked whose dish this was...)</p>

<p>Masachika couldn&apos;t be sure because he had never eaten it before. While feeling indecisive, Masachika finished his portion and put down his chopsticks.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, how about we start the assessment?&quot;</p>

<p>And when Touya finished eating, Yuki shouted happily. Finally, it was time for the decisive moment, but...... Masachika couldn&apos;t identify Chisaki&apos;s cooking.</p>

<p>(I think the only thing that sets it apart is the pelmeni... I&apos;m sure that either Alya or Masha-san made it. And that mysterious soup seems to be the same but I can&apos;t rule out the possibility that Yuki made it.......)</p>

<p>Clearly, both dishes were probably not made by Chisaki. That information was then conveyed to Touya by gesturing to himself under the table...</p>

<p>But all that was left was fried chicken, hamburg steak, and fried rice, the three most favored dishes of boys in the world. According to Masachika&apos;s taste, the fried rice dish is one notch below...</p>

<p>(Was it an accident to make it taste light, or was it intentionally made lighter? Depending on which, the story could be different...)</p>

<p>If it&apos;s the former, there&apos;s a good chance that it&apos;s Chisaki&apos;s cooking. But if it&apos;s the latter the latter...</p>

<p>&quot;...Okay, I&apos;ve decided.&quot;</p>

<p>While Masachika was still thinking about it, Touya who was next to him said so, and Masachika looked at him in surprise. Masachika had not narrowed down his list of candidates. However, Touya looked straight ahead firmly and spoke his answer clearly.</p>

<p>&quot;In my opinion, the fried chicken was the most delicious.&quot;</p>

<p>The atmosphere was instantly quiet. A moment of tension occurred that didn&apos;t seem like a moment. Then....</p>

<p>&quot;Hooray!&quot;</p>

<p>In the next moment, Chisaki&apos;s voice was filled with excitement. She jumped up from her chair and raised her fist to the ceiling. Before Masachika could give his answer, Chisaki had already revealed her dish, and the other girls slightly lowered their eyebrows with troubled faces, but still congratulated her.</p>

<p>&quot;Congratulations, Chisaki-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Congratulations, as expected, as a couple, you two are very suitable for each other.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Congratulations on the success.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank goodness. Congratulations.&quot;</p>

<p>While clapping with the girls, Masachika smiled in a different way.</p>

<p>(What the heck, it turns out that the Chairman doesn&apos;t need my advice... haha, I really can&apos;t stand this~)</p>

<p>For some reason... in a different sense than food, he already felt full.</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu Touya... was it really that good?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it tasted really good, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... I guess it was worth it to train hard just to cook only fried chicken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Only?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu, if it tastes that good... I&apos;ll keep making it for you, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohh, I&apos;m really looking forward to that?&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki slapped Touya on the back with a hue of excitement, and Touya talked while desperately swallowing something that came up with his surprise.</p>

<p>The look in Masachika&apos;s eyes became soft in the presence of the very happy couple....... By the way, in the not too distant future, Touya will be given a kind of ultimate fried chicken lunch box by Chisaki every day, which contents consist only of white rice, fried chicken, and fresh vegetables...... but that&apos;s a story for another time.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, back to the topic of judgment, what does Masachika-kun think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hm? Ahh...&quot;</p>

<p>Prompted by Yuki, Masachika turned to face forward. He could see Yuki smiling happily and gracefully, then Ayano with an expressionless face, then Maria with her big smile, while Alisa had an ordinary expression, but with a serious look as if to imply &quot;I&apos;m not interested, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika opened his mouth in front of the gazes of the four people looking at him....</p>

<p>&quot;I think that soup tastes really good.&quot;</p>

<p>She told them honestly about her judgment. Then .....</p>

<p>&quot;Ara, really? I did it.&quot;</p>

<p>After looking a little surprised, Maria put her hands together and exclaimed happily. At the same time, he could see Alisa furrowing her brow, but... what else. As Alisa had said, this was a serious cooking competition.</p>

<p>&quot;It turned out to be Masha-san&apos;s cooking, huh? No, it&apos;s really good, really. I&apos;ve never tasted anything like this before... Was this Russian food?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right this dish is called Solyanka, you know~.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Solyanka, yes..... sorry, I&apos;ve never heard of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm~...&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing Masachika&apos;s words, Maria put her index finger on her chin as if she were thinking a little, she then tilted her head and said.</p>

<p>&quot;If borscht is like Russian miso soup, then solyanka is like a Russian tonkatsu?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, seriously? Tonkatsu? This dish?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s what it looks like anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>Maria said that desperately while waving her hands up and down. As Masachika smiled wryly at the adorable sight, Yuki returned to call out to him again.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, do you know who the other dishes belong to?&quot;</p>

<p>It was a rather cruel question, but Masachika grinned back confidently. Because he had originally intended to identify everyone&apos;s dishes, Masachika felt confident when the other two dishes were identified.</p>

<p>&quot;First of all, this fried rice is from Ayano, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika pointed at the fried rice and said so while looking at Ayano, then Ayano nodded in return and looked down slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that&apos;s right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew it. You deliberately made the taste lighter because the others made their dishes quite flavorful, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes... I thought it was better to cook a dish that can be eaten with other dishes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha, even though it&apos;s a cooking competition, you still put other people first, it&apos;s like Ayano&apos;s nature.&quot;</p>

<p>As he said this and smiled gently, Ayano shook her shoulders slightly shyly. With a widening smile, Masachika then pointed to the hamburg steak.</p>

<p>&quot;Next, this is Yuki&apos;s.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Exactly. It&apos;s great that you were able to figure it out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I thought you were trying to win this time. It seems like you&apos;re deliberately disguising it lightly, right?&quot;</p>

<p>The dish itself was done properly, but the seasoning was changed so that it wasn&apos;t recognizable who cooked it, which is what made Masachika confused to recognize it. However, Yuki said with an indifferent face, &quot;It&apos;s already summer. This time tried to spice it up with flavors that are refreshing and light.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then next... this dish belongs to Alya.&quot;</p>

<p>With a smile full of satisfaction, Masachika laughed proudly and pointed at the remaining dish.</p>

<p>...... correct answer.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Alisa nodded with an expression of dissatisfaction, but a little pleased. She might feel happy that Masachika could recognize her cooking, but she also had mixed feelings about being recognized so well.</p>

<p>(But, well, thanks to that mysterious soup... what was it called... Solyanka? I can identify it because know that it&apos;s Masha-san&apos;s cooking, right?)</p>

<p>Masachika smiled wryly inwardly, but being unaware of such a situation Ayano innocently gave her a heartfelt compliment.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s amazing, Masachika-sama. You have an amazing talent for taste as well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Well, because Alya&apos;s cooking is easily recognizable, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>While feeling a little better thanks to Ayano&apos;s glittering eyes, Masachika looked at Alisa with a proud smile.</p>

<p>&quot;At first, I thought that it was just ordinary gyoza, but... after eating it, I recognized it right away. It&apos;s a pelmeni, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika smiled with a satisfied grin and showed off as a man</p>

<p>who could distinguish that much. However, Alisa raised her</p>

<p>eyebrows slightly and said curtly.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s called varenyky, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, what was that?&quot;</p>

<p>Instantly, a surprisingly awkward atmosphere prevailed in the living room.</p>
