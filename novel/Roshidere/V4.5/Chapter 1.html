<h3>Chapter 1 - Roses and Yuri</h3>

<p>&quot;Anyway, I don&apos;t mind using any buildup during the scene of the reunion between siblings! It would be nice if there was a heartwarming reunion where they were always thinking about each other&apos;s feelings, but it&apos;s also quite suspenseful when they reunite and discover that the two of them have become enemies!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. The fact that the two of them are siblings will add a lot of drama to their relationship.&quot;</p>

<p>After Masachika and Yuki&apos;s relationship as siblings was revealed, Sayaka talked excitedly with Yuki at the amusement park food stall about [The talk of siblings living apart].</p>

<p>Ayano was secretly eating churros beside them, but neither of them paid any attention to her and were engrossed in their otaku talk. However, after ten minutes, Sayaka gradually calmed down.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I&apos;m sorry..... from earlier, it was just me who kept talking. don&apos;t have people around me that</p>

<p>can talk to about this kind of thing...&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka felt ashamed for having let out all her pent-up feelings all at once, due to secretly being an otaku after such a long time. She looked fidgety as she pushed up her glasses, moving her lips and shoulders. Yuki had never never seen Sayaka&apos;s behavior like this before, as she usually acted always serious and stern.</p>

<p>(Kuhh-Isn&apos;t this really fun?)</p>

<p>Yuki smiled softly while trying not to show her inner feelings,</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s okay, don&apos;t worry. I understand your feelings too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... Really? Thank you very much.&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka thanked her with a slightly awkward smile, but inside heart she still felt that she had made a mess.</p>

<p>Many hidden otaku in the world were very wary of showing off their otaku hobbies themselves. That principle does not change easily even if the other party turns out to be a fellow hidden otaku. Yes, because closet otaku have a strong feeling that &quot;their otaku hobbies&quot; = &quot;something they are interested in&quot;, which is why they harbor a mysterious obsession that &quot;they cannot be more otaku than the person they are talking to&quot;, even if they are talking to someone who has a fellow otaku&apos;s hobbies</p>

<p>(TN: Reminds me of that absolute banger manga series &quot;Wotakoi&quot;. I seriously recommend you read it. I think it has an adaptation too.)</p>

<p>And even more troublesome, there is also the realization that &quot;the other party must not realize what they are hiding&quot;. Don&apos;t let the other party sense that you are uncomfortable with your own hobby. Because that&apos;s the same as denying the other party&apos;s hobby.</p>

<p>For Sayaka and Yuki who have been hiding their hobbies until now, it has become a common thought. So, what would happen if two such people meet? meet?</p>

<p>As a result, the two of them were both trying to determine the other party&apos;s level of otakuness. Sayaka and Yuki quietly looked at each other while both smiling faintly. As for Ayano, she was still enjoying the churros in silence. As the tension between them increased..... Sayaka was the first to speak up.</p>

<p>&quot;..... By the way, Suou-san. What anime are you watching this season?&quot;</p>

<p>It was a trial attack that was smoothly released. A malicious move that urged the other party to unilaterally reveal her level of otakuness by disguising it as a normal topic of conversation. The number of anime the other party watched would be used as a measure of their level of otakuness, and the content of the anime is used to analyze his/her taste. Does the other party like the genres fantasy, romantic comedies, slice of life.... or the type of person who would like erotic genres?</p>

<p>With this one casual question alone Sayaka could obtain a lot of information without any risk. Taniyama Sayaka, a talented young girl who had already defeated many rivals with her skillful speeches in debates.</p>

<p>Sayaka quirked the corner of her mouth. Yuki with an unreadable smile. And Ayano folded the paper wrapping of the Churros snack.</p>

<p>&quot;Ummmm, that&apos;s right. For this season...&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki opened her mouth to respond to Sayaka&apos;s first attack. Of course, even Sayaka didn&apos;t feel that question alone was more than enough to determine the game. If Yuki mentioned some safe tities and asked back</p>

<p>&quot;What about Sayaka-san herself?&quot; Sayaka had anticipated that. But, there was no problem. Because Sayaka had prepared a powerful answer by &quot;I guess we&apos;re the same. Because watch that anime too.&quot;</p>

<p>(The safest strategy in this conversation is to place myself right behind the opponent and track the</p>

<p>answer. Once I took the initiative to ask first, there was no way I could lose)</p>

<p>Feeling confident of her overwhelming superiority, Sayaka casually waited for Yuki&apos;s answer. But......</p>

<p>&quot;First of all, the anime &quot;Blade hazard&quot; and &quot;Ano Yume&quot; are a must-watch. In the review before, the anime &quot;Blade hazard&quot; was said to be the best anime of this season, but the first episode of &quot;Ano Yume&quot; was so perfect that it quickly became a candidate for the best anime ranking. Then, the anime &quot;Rens&quot; and &quot;Isekal Tunnel&quot; have a stable plot and are already finished. Personally, think that the best performing underdog this season is the anime &quot;Hamezon&quot;. was originally curious how extreme expressions in the original story would be adapted in the anime, but the adaptation turned out to be much better than expected. Also, it seems that the momentum of &quot;Gambaruon&quot; hasn&apos;t waned even in the second season......&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: dahm what an optimistic view. Whenever new anime are released, I&apos;d often complain about how the source material is better. On a related note, if Project 9 content skips and ruins Otonari no Tenshi like they did with Higehiro, I will throw hands)</p>

<p>&quot;12&quot;</p>

<p>In that situation, Yuki unexpectedly applied tactics without guards. Yuki&apos;s answer really revealed everything, without any secrets. From fantasy gene to romantic comedy, from heartwarming anime to robot anime, and finally to erotic dark fantasy. Sayaka&apos;s eyes widened behind her glasses as the information was revealed so quickly.</p>

<p>Sayaka looked confused. Yuki secretly chuckled. As for Ayano, she went to buy churros for the third time.</p>

<p>&quot;So, what about Sayaka-san herself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, umm, that...&quot;</p>

<p>The question was asked, as she had anticipated. However, the development was so unexpected that Sayaka could not answer it right away. In this situation, the powerful answer &quot;I guess we&apos;re the same, because I also watch that anime&quot; couldn&apos;t be used either. Because there are some anime that Yuki mentioned where Sayaka has never seen. But, can she honestly admit that? Because indirectly it is tantamount to denying the other party&apos;s hobby.</p>

<p>In front of Sayaka who looked upset and depressed... Yuki, who was still smiling, began to mutter something.</p>

<p>&quot;It has begun...&quot;</p>

<p>At first, she wondered what Yuki wanted to say. Sayaka&apos;s shoulders shook when hearing a sentence that had no context and made no sense...... but tickled her inner being. Yuki then continued her attack.</p>

<p>&quot;White darkness...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ransom for great power...&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka&apos;s body naturally reacted to the beautiful words that were spoken in rapid succession. Seeing her playful reaction, Yuki chuckled and said with a joking tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Looks like the early stages of chuunibyou, huh. recommend that you seek treatment as soon as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?......!&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka reflexively tried to refute the disease name &quot;Chuunibyou&quot;, which was often avoided by most otaku. However, it was true that she was a little excited by Yuki&apos;s words... and when Sayaka stammered, Yuki&apos;s smile widened even more as she spoke to her.</p>

<p>&quot;How about we stop second-guessing each other, okay? I&apos;m sure that you already realize that my knowledge as an otaku is better than Sayakasan&apos;s. So, Sayaka-san doesn&apos;t need to hide it either. okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After revealing how brainy she was without hiding it at all, Yuki then asked Sayaka to throw away her shyness and reluctance. It was a proposal that Sayaka never expected. Or it should have been....but Sayaka felt that the proposal was not a relief, but rather triggered competition.</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu...I see? Of course, I might lose out if you look at the number of works that I&apos;ve touched...... But my feelings of love in each work will never be outdone, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka smiled boldly while slowly pushing up her glasses. On the other hand, Yuki responded with a</p>

<p>calm smile. And then the debate began.</p>

<p>&quot;On last week&apos;s episode of &quot;Blaze hazard&quot;, the voice actor&apos;s performance in the final scene was amazing. That voice actor also gave an awesome performance in Gandero....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you say so, I myself would prefer a voice actor who played the antagonist...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, did you notice the special ending of last week&apos;s &apos;Ano Yume&apos; episode? There was a</p>

<p>meaningful cutscene that I&apos;ve never seen before....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that obvious? I would never do something like skipping the opening song and the ending song. I was thinking that...&quot;</p>

<p>The composition is completely the opposite of the previous one, and this time the two of them were competing to see who was more otaku than the other party. Where did their calm and serious figures at school go? There were only two otaku who were arguing and showing off their knowledge. After about 20 minutes of arguing. Yuki suddenly closed her mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Oops, excuse me.&quot;</p>

<p>She then took out her smartphone from her pocket as she asked her to wait for a moment. When looking at the vibrating smartphone screen, Yuki&apos;s eyebrows twitched.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, I need to make a call first for a moment.&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Yuki got up from her seat and walked away with the smartphone to her ear. Apparently, she received an urgent phone call.</p>

<p>Then, Sayaka and Ayano were left alone. Sayaka then stared at Ayano in silence. Ayano who received that gaze immediately stuffed the fourth churro into her mouth at once.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, you don&apos;t have to rush to eat them, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka said that in a worried tone, but Ayano took all the churros into her mouth as if she was in a hurry. After adding more milk tea into her mouth, she swallowed all the churros in her mouth in one gulp.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmgh!...&quot;</p>

<p>She then straightened her posture as if nothing had happened, and stared straight at Sayaka. Flinching slightly under her gaze, Sayaka lightly cleared her throat and straightened herself up.</p>

<p>&quot;Once again, Kimishima-san. Although it feels a bit late, allow me to introduce myself again, my name is Taniyama Sayaka. Although we are classmates, we haven&apos;t talked much before, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that&apos;s right. I think this is the first time we&apos;ve met face to face and exchanged words like this.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s right... then, ummm I&apos;ve heard that Kimishima-san is Suou-san&apos;s personal maid, is that true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Personal attendant... That&apos;s right. Ahh...&quot; Then, as if suddenly remembering something, Ayano looked up and slowly stood up. She then</p>

<p>suddenly covered half of her face with her right hand, crossed her arms and assumed a sort of pose,</p>

<p>and then told Sayaka who was blinked repeatedly, with a cool (expressionless) expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Written in the letters &apos;childhood friend&apos; and read as &apos;maid&apos;. Kimishima Ayano.&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano&apos;s way of introducing herself was so eccentric that it made Sayaka stunned with her mouth gaping. In front of Sayaka who was also showing a very rare expression, Ayano then changed her pose even further without showing any expression and continued in a monotone tone.</p>

<p>&quot;The status of childhood friend and defeated heroine is only a temporary form to trick the eyes of the world. Masachika-sama will be protected by me, the real sub-heroine!&quot;</p>

<p>After striking a stunning pose against the backdrop of the summer sun, Ayano sat back on the chair</p>

<p>with a sense of accomplishment in her eyes. Then, she bowed her head towards Sayaka</p>

<p>&quot;....I&apos;m really sorry. Yuki-sama should have been the first to say [Written with the letters &apos;childhood friend&apos; and read as &apos;younger sister&apos; Suou Yuki!].&quot;</p>

<p>*...Eh? Uh, she wants to do that? Suou-san herself? With the pose you just did just now!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...? Yes, because they say this is the formal way to reveal true identity.&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka secretly shuddered in horror at Ayano, who felt neither suspicious nor embarrassed. She couldn&apos;t see any opportunities or gaps where she could compete, as she was only in the early stages of Chuunibyou</p>

<p>(W-What a terrifying attack... to shake the opponent&apos;s mentality and take the initiative in the conversation at once)</p>

<p>While pressing down on her chest that ached from the invisible attack, Sayaka bit her lips and clenched her hands tightly. She then asked Ayano, who was (apparently) casually looking at her, a question as if she was challenging her.</p>

<p>&quot;So, from the perspective of Suou-san&apos;s personal servant... or maid? According to Kimishima-san herself, what kind of relationship is usual between Suou-san and Kuze-san?&quot;</p>

<p>In response to her question, Ayano looked back at Sayaka as if to find out her true intentions. She was probably thinking about how to answer, since she considered Sayaka as a potential opponent in the election of the new student council president. But in reality, the question did not mean anything.</p>

<p>Because the question has nothing to do with the election campaign..... instead it was just Sayaka&apos;s personal curiosity. In the past, Masachika and Yuki were Sayaka&apos;s best rivals. There were no feelings of hatred or resentment, instead there was a sense of trust and mutual recognition of each other. And her defeat in the election campaign turned it into pure respect.</p>

<p>Or to put it bluntly, she was a fan of both of them. She thought that the two of them were an ideal couple, and had even thought, &quot;Hurry up and get married. No, it&apos;s okay to take it slow, and wish you guys a happy marriage.&quot; If someone were to interfere with their relationship, she would do everything in her power to eliminate them as a representative of the fans.</p>

<p>Then, how did Sayaka respond when she learned that &quot;The two of them are siblings and can&apos;t get</p>

<p>married&quot;?...</p>

<p>(No problem. On the contrary, it&apos;s more savory that way!!)</p>

<p>(TN:)</p>

<p>...... That was her response. If so, then...</p>

<p>(I want to hear... about the episode of their closeness as siblings!)</p>

<p>As a fan of theirs, how could she pass up this golden opportunity. However, Ayano would not be so easy to divulge information.</p>

<p>*...I&apos;m just a servant, I cannot reveal information about my master without her permission.&quot;</p>

<p>No matter what Sayaka&apos;s intentions were, of course that was the reply she received. But it was still within Sayaka&apos;s expectations</p>

<p>&quot;Ara, I see. In that case, I&apos;ll ask someone else, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...... Other people?&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing Ayano tilt her head in confusion, Sayaka continued in an indifferent attitude while taking a sip of her drink.</p>

<p>&quot;If Kimishima-san won&apos;t talk to me about it, can just ask someone else, right? If I can find someone close to Suou-san or Kuze-san, there should be at least one person who knows that the two of them are siblings. That&apos;s right, for example..... Kujou Alisa-san?&quot;</p>

<p>It was a contrived and long-winded threat as if to imply &quot;If you won&apos;t speak up, I&apos;ll reveal to others that</p>

<p>the two of them are sisters.&quot; However, the innocent Ayano did not realize this.</p>

<p>&quot;That... would be a bit problematic.&quot;</p>

<p>That was why she said it honestly. Without thinking that her too honest answer would give information to the other party.</p>

<p>(So apparently, they even kept it a secret from the people around them that the two of them were</p>

<p>siblings. Kujou-san didn&apos;t even know this either.)</p>

<p>Had she been confronted by Yuki or Masachika, they would not have pointed out the gap so easily. The statement &quot;it will be a little problematic&quot; is tantamount to telling the other party that it was her weak point. If Sayaka tried to pry information out of Yuki or Masachika, both of them would at least try to evade skillfully, or else, they would both threaten back and take control of the situation.</p>

<p>(I was a little surprised at first, but... as long as I don&apos;t get carried away with the tempo, she&apos;s an an easy opponent to deal with)</p>

<p>While evaluating the situation inwardly, Sayaka relentlessly pushed the matter of the problem. Let me be clear once again, she only wanted to gain valuable inner satisfaction as their fan. Sayaka had the makings of an otaku idol.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, do you mind telling me? Don&apos;t worry, I have no intention of revealing Suou-san and Kuze-san&apos;s private lives. I&apos;m just curious how the two of them usually spend their time.&quot;</p>

<p>From outward appearances, Sayaka asked the question with an indifferent attitude, while inwardly she was filled with a sense of excitement and waving both hands while holding an idol fan. Then, when Ayano remained silent, she slightly softened her tone of voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Then let&apos;s talk about today&apos;s events. What were those two doing before we bumped into each other?&quot;</p>

<p>At the compromising attitude shown by Sayaka, Ayano looked around and ..... she opened and closed her mouth a few times, then lowered her gaze as if in contemplation. Feeling confident of her victory, Sayaka smiled, and inwardly prepared to get into position to swing the idol fan as hard as she could....</p>

<p>&quot;Masachika-sama was pulling Yuki-sama who couldn&apos;t get out from under the bed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh, what did you just say?&quot;</p>

<p>Her expression immediately gaped. The Mini Sayaka inside her also had the same expression while holding the fan in her hand. She asked back half-reflexively, and with the same expression, she swallowed Ayano&apos;s words with her confused head.</p>

<p>(Under the bed? What kind of situation would that be? Anyway, that&apos;s not what wanted to ask... Oh, disinformation? To confuse me?)</p>

<p>When she realized this, Sayaka regained her composure. At the same time, she put aside her previous judgment regarding Ayano being &quot;easy to control&quot; and turned to face Ayano once more.......</p>

<p>&quot;We almost had trouble pulling her because Yuki-sama was like a bagworm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As I told you, what are you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki in the form of a bagworm appeared in Sayaka&apos;s brain and was instantly filled with (???) signs in her mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayano? Let&apos;s not go too far with the jokes, okay? Sayaka-san too, please don&apos;t tease Ayano too</p>

<p>much, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>It was at that moment that Yuki returned. She shouldn&apos;t have heard the flow of the conversation up to that point, but she was nonchalantly commemorating Sayaka as if she had heard everything. Sayaka immediately responded with an obvious smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Ara, I just had a little chat with her, really? Maybe my questions were a little blunt&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so? How strange for Sayaka-san who has always been calm to be blunt like that. What were you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just wanted to confirm that Suou-san and Kuze-san are really siblings. Because I&apos;m still not sure if</p>

<p>it&apos;s the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ohh, so that&apos;s what you&apos;re talking about. Well, if you don&apos;t believe it, that&apos;s fine too anyway? Because technically, we really are childhood friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Is it because they were originally rivals in the election, or is it just a matter of compatibility?</p>

<p>When they opened their mouths, they naturally began to investigate the other party&apos;s intentions. They try to dig up information on each other while obscuring their true intentions indirectly. However, such an exchange ended once again with a single question from Yuki.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, is Sayaka-san the type of person who likes BL?&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: BL = boys love = yaoi)</p>

<p>In response to such an abrupt change of topic, Sayaka raised one eyebrow and slowly raised her glasses as she sat deeper in her seat.</p>

<p>&quot;Suou-san.... there are only two types of women in this world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...? And that is....?&quot;</p>

<p>Then, with the lenses of her glasses mysteriously shining. Sayaka calmly affirmed.</p>

<p>&quot;Women who like BL and women who don&apos;t know BL.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So that&apos;s it. What a wise remark.&quot;</p>

<p>The two of them exchanged glances with each other and grinned with a foul smile. Ayano, a woman whom Sayaka referred to as a woman who did not know BL, blinked her eyes at the foul atmosphere that suddenly began to spread in the air, but she breezed off to buy churros for the fifth time without paying much attention. Sayaka didn&apos;t care either and put her hand on her chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, by the way, didn&apos;t Kaito reject Nakusha&apos;s confession in last week&apos;s episode of Blaze hazard last week?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, indeed there was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That must be because he&apos;s dating Geruga, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Most Blaze Hazard viewers would have said, &quot;Of course not!&quot;, but somehow the two of them communicated with each other. Perhaps feeling flattered by the approval, Sayaka continued to talk about the reasons why she thought so,</p>

<p>&quot;I felt certain about this when saw Geruga&apos;s gentle gaze at the beginning of the second episode while watching Kaito talk about his dream.&quot;</p>

<p>That was just an unfounded assumption.</p>

<p>&quot;And it became even more obvious when the weapons they used were</p>

<p>There&apos;s no doubt that it&apos;s a baseless guess.</p>

<p>&quot;When he said in the battle in the desert, &quot;I will give you my back!&quot; wasn&apos;t that clearly an indirect way of proposing, was it?!&quot;</p>

<p>Her delusional power was also quite strong.</p>

<p>&quot;...So that&apos;s it!&quot;</p>

<p>Even Yuki could do nothing but nod in agreement.</p>

<p>Although Yuki had always enjoyed BL titles, she had never once fantasized about BL, so she could hardly follow what Sayaka was saying. After all, from the very beginning. Yuki was just joking when pretending to be a fujoshi, and in fact that she liked yuri more than BL, but that didn&apos;t stop Sayaka.</p>

<p>(TN: A fujoshi is a female who likes yaoi/BL genre)</p>

<p>&quot;But I think the most exciting and suspenseful situation is the one where childhood friends become jealous and go on a rampage. The part where the childhood friend who has held the position of best friend for a long time forcefully attacks the main character out of jealousy is the most moving part.&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki&apos;s eyes became a little distant as she heard the words that didn&apos;t seem to be from a member of the disciplinary committee. As her gaze looked into the distance... she was was immediately brought back to reality when she saw the figures of Masachika and Nonoa who were walking towards their place.</p>

<p>(Whoops, this is bad~~~~!!)</p>

<p>In front of her eyes was the figure of Sayaka spreading her brain virus. That was not a figure that could be shown to people she knew. At first, she seemed to be wary that she was an otaku, but now she was even revealing it openly.</p>

<p>&quot;And then, once he found its momentum, he would open up and let his obsession run wild....., what a feeling that is, even if it&apos;s not forgivable between a man and a woman, but it&apos;s forgivable if between men.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Th-That&apos;s right. In shoujo manga, no matter how good the childhood friend is, if they attack the</p>

<p>protagonist, it&apos;s a bit.........&quot;</p>

<p>When Sayaka spoke with a somewhat excited expression on her face, Yuki quickly tried to correct the flow of the conversation. Then, Sayaka&apos;s expression turned gloomy.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, indeed... Moreover, there are many patterns where when he pushes the protagonist down, they come back to their senses at the sight of the protagonist&apos;s frightened face. They&apos;re all too kind! Although he always likes the protagonist, and always puts the protagonist&apos;s happiness first..... Then what about him? What about the happiness of the childhood friend!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... Well, since most of them come to the conclusion that &apos;XX-chan&apos;s happiness is my happiness</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s just a form of resignation! He&apos;s just lying to himself! Moreover, the protagonist is the same way. Instead of dealing with the annoying handsome guy, she&apos;ll definitely be happier with a childhood friend who always cares about her!&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka clenched both hands on the table and shouted as if to venting her pent-up annoyance.</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously, my favorite couple failed to set sail again and again with the official party... Do you understand my feelings!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yes...well, if you support ship romance with a childhood friend, that&apos;s what will happen...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why is it that everyone is more interested in transfer students or classmates they just met! Rather than those kinds of people who are unclear in nature, it&apos;s better to choose a childhood friend!! A childhood friend who constantly watches over the protagonist! want her to be given happinessssssss!!!&quot; (TN: foreshadowing in this novel???)</p>

<p>&quot;A, Ahaha...&quot;</p>

<p>With a wry smile, Yuki glanced at Masachika, who was staring at Sayaka with an indescribable expression on her face, and sweat pouring down her back.</p>

<p>(Fyuh that was a close call!!!)</p>

<p>Yuki was secretly relieved that she managed to change the subject just in time. Then, to let Sayaka know that the two of them were back, she turned to her brother who was staring at her from afar.</p>

<p>&quot;Which mouth has the right to say that? Onii-sama.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t read my mind!!!&quot;</p>

<p>It was just a normal conversation. However, the part of the word [Onii-sama] was still ringing in Sayaka&apos;s mind.</p>

<p>[Onii-sama! J</p>

<p>In a field filled with white clover flowers, little Yuki called out to Masachika while carrying a flower crown in her hand.</p>

<p>[Onii-samaaaa! J</p>

<p>Frightened by the sound of thunder, little Yuki called Masachika with teary eyes while hugging her stuffed animal.</p>

<p>[Mouu~, Onii-sama! J</p>

<p>With a slightly blaming expression, the grown-up Yuki fixed Masachika&apos;s tie.</p>

<p>&quot;See you again in the new semester.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okeee~ see you again, yeah~~~&quot;</p>

<p>After exchanging greetings, Sayaka and Nonoa quickly left the place. Then, when she completely disappeared from Masachika and Yuki&apos;s sight, she immediately squatted down and covered her face with both hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Haaa, really messed up...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, what&apos;s wrong Sayacchi? Are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I might not be too fine... Ahhhh, was too happy that Suou-san turned out to be a friend who had similar interests, so I overdid it...&quot;</p>

<p>While letting out a voice filled with regret, she smiled again as she recalled the conversation between</p>

<p>Yuki and Masachika.</p>

<p>&quot;But that was precious....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh~~ I see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you very much... this way can work hard for another month...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of logic is that?&quot;</p>

<p>When Nonoa asked a question that left her puzzled, Sayaka who was was squatting down and putting her hands together, immediately responded by opening her eyes wide</p>

<p>&quot;Moe brings color to everyday life, and appreciation gives vibrancy to life!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I totally understand~&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka gazed somewhere with distant eyes, without caring about Nonoa&apos;s blatantly monotone reaction. &quot;There is something precious that can only be digested by looking at the closeness of siblings related by blood.</p>

<p>&quot;Hard to understand~&quot;}}</p>

<p>After saying that while playing around with her smartphone, Nonoa suddenly raised her face.</p>

<p>&quot;... By any chance, is that the reason why you often stop by my house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh...&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka quickly averted her eyes. Nonoa shifted her gaze to the back of her head. After a few moments of silence, Sayaka muttered something in a somewhat awkward tone of voice.</p>

<p>*...Rea-chan and Leo-kun also look very close, the sight of the two of them always makes me smile.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Are they really that close?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because they&apos;re twins, that alone is precious!&quot;</p>

<p>At the moment Nonoa tilted her head, Sayaka turned around with a loud exclamation. Hearing her best friend&apos;s response, Nonoa could only say &quot;I see&quot; while shrugging her shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Even though they fight a lot, the feelings of affection they have for each other can be felt behind the</p>

<p>quarrels. The sense of trust is so strong. That&apos;s what makes it so precious.........</p>

<p>&quot;I see... well putting that aside for now, I think it&apos;s time for you to stand up, isn&apos;t it? Because for some reason, we&apos;ve become the object of interest. Other people are staring&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, Sayaka realized that she was attracting the attention of the people around her while squatting in the garden, and she stood up while clearing her throat. She then said with an expression awkwardly.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, I don&apos;t want you to misunderstand me just yet, but.... The reason went to visit Nono-chan&apos;s house wasn&apos;t just to meet Rea-chan and Leo-kun, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand... You want to see my closeness with Rea-chan, right?</p>

<p>&quot;G-guh, I don&apos;t know... You understand what I&apos;m talking about, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Nonoa grinned at Sayaka, who was looking at her as if she was blaming her ignorance.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm-? I don&apos;t know~? want to hear it straight from Sayacchi&apos;s mouth~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uuuu, never mind!&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Sayaka turned around with a frown and started walking away leaving Nonoa behind. However, after walking a few steps, she then turned around to see Nonoa who had not moved from her spot with a smirk on her face, and Sayaka grinned, and raised her voice as if she had been pranked.</p>

<p>&quot;Moo- Nono-chan! Don&apos;t be naughty!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahaha, sorry, sorry~&quot;</p>

<p>Instantly, Nonoa ran towards her with a smile and easily hugged Sayaka&apos;s arm. She then asked Sayaka who was turning her face away as if she were sulking, with a slightly serious voice.</p>

<p>&quot;But- are you okay with leaving Kuzecchi and the others?</p>

<p>Even though you also have the choice to play with them, right?&quot;</p>

<p>In response to Nonoa&apos;s question, Sayaka glanced at her before looking forward and spoke calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;That would really hinder them. After all, our relationship isn&apos;t that close to the three of them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh I see... but can&apos;t you use this as an opportunity to get to know each other? After all, we&apos;re not candidates in the election for student council president, right?&quot;</p>

<p>*...I think it&apos;s better not to do that either. Even though we&apos;re not candidates anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm, I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka spoke calmly and clearly, in contrast to the excited state of mode of her brain. Sayaka seemed to be returning to her usual self. As long as it wasn&apos;t because of otaku hobby and her tantrums, Sayaka was actually a very intelligent girl.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, from the beginning, had no intention of wanting to be close friends with those two.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, did you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I just wanted to appreciate the precious interactions of the two of them as a spectator.&quot;</p>

<p>She really is a smart girl. No, seriously. Nonoa squinted beside her as if to imply &quot;What are you talking about with such a serious face? like that?&quot;, but that&apos;s exactly how she felt.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, I came here because wanted to play with Nono-chan. There&apos;s nothing more important than that.&quot;</p>

<p>Sayaka said that casually while shrugging her shoulders. Upon hearing her words, Nonoa opened her eyes wide... and laughed merrily.</p>

<p>&quot;Sayacchi really likes me too, huh~~&quot;</p>

<p>..it&apos;s obvious, right? Because you&apos;re my best friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehehe so yeah- I also really like Sayacchi, huh~?&quot;</p>

<p>Nonoa brought her body closer to Sayaka while smiling. Sayaka did not refuse, although she lowered her eyebrows slightly. After walking for a while, Sayaka breathed out as if to regain her composure and looked around her.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, where to next-&quot;</p>

<p>It was at that moment...</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu, that was really scary, huh~ Onii-sama?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How creepy was it really?! You obviously enjoyed it a lot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, there&apos;s nothing like that. In fact, it&apos;s all thanks to Onii-sama&apos;s reliable arm, you know~?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika looked at her with a scornful gaze, while Yuki spoke in an Ojou-sama-like suspicious style while hugging his arm. And then there was Ayano too.</p>

<p>Sayaka and Nonoa crossed paths again with the three of them who had just exited the haunted</p>

<p>house. This was the second unexpected encounter.</p>

<p>This time they realized each other&apos;s existence at the same time and stopped at the same time. An indescribable atmosphere enveloped them. In the midst of it all, Sayaka slowly pushed up the frames of her glasses and said a word while maintaining a smart expression....</p>

<p>&quot;Please continue.&quot;</p>

<p>... while trying to hold back the nosebleed coming out of her nose.</p>
