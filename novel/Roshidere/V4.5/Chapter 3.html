<h3>Chapter 3 - Mood and Appetite</h3>



<p>On that day, Alisa was seen in front of a ramen shop. The name &quot;The Cauldron of Hell&quot; was written in horrible red letters on a wooden board.</p>

<p>It was a shop that specializes in super-duper spicy ramen so Alisa, who had previously entered with Masachika and Yuki, had almost seen hell as the name of the stall implied.</p>

<p>So, why was Alisa now trying to set foot in a place she had once experienced hell in?... It all started during her date with Masachika the other day... or not. When she gave an exercise similar to a pre-date to teach the naive Masachika what a woman&apos;s heart was, Masachika then told Alisa that he liked spicy food.</p>

<p>(No, it&apos;s not like I want to understand Masachika-kun&apos;s food tastes or anything!)</p>

<p>Alisa made that kind of excuse in her head. Yes, it&apos;s just because she thought that if there were some people who liked it, then spicy food would have its own flavor of deliciousness. This was just an attempt to bring more variety in her daily diet. The challenge is based on the idea that if she can learn to understand the deliciousness of spicy foods in addition to sweets, she might be able to multiply the enjoyment of her meals.</p>

<p>Well, as a side effect of that? I wonder if I can enjoy the food with other friends that&apos;s what Alisa thought. Of course, the friend in question was not Masachika, but Yuki.</p>

<p>&quot;Yosh, alright!&quot;</p>

<p>After finishing making up excuses and preparing herself, Alisa then opened the door slide.</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh!&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately, the air with pungent ingredients began to stimulate her eyes and her nose, and although she had prepared to a certain extent, Alisa reflexively squinted her eyes. reflexively narrowed her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome~!&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa blinked her eyes as she heard the store employee&apos;s energetic voice, and turned her attention to the female shop employee who approached her... but suddenly, Alisa double-checked the familiar face that appeared in the corner of her vision.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, Kimishima-san?&quot;</p>

<p>.? Ah.&quot;</p>

<p>In response to Alisa&apos;s voice, Ayano who was sitting at the table for two near the entrance, looked up from the book in her hand and her eyes widened slightly. The female store employee who had approached Alisa earlier, looked at the two of them in turn, and said,</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, are you with this customer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh, umm, yes.&quot;</p>

<p>How should she answer in such a situation? Alisa was embarrassed by her unclear answers due to her lack of experience. However, since she had said that she was with her, Alisa then stepped towards Ayano&apos;s table.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, can join you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, please.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa asked permission somewhat reluctantly and sat down opposite her. Ayano also put the book in her hand into her bag.</p>

<p>And then silence. The two beautiful girls were both silent while looking at each other.</p>

<p>(Ummm...)</p>

<p>In this indescribably awkward atmosphere, Alisa tried to say something... but she didn&apos;t know what to say and closed back her mouth that was about to be open. In the past, Alisa didn&apos;t often start her own conversations. Besides... she and Ayano still had a very ambiguous relationship.</p>

<p>(Can I assume that we&apos;re... friends? No, right? Because we almost never talk to each other anyway, at best we&apos;re just fellow members of the Student Council... But as an opposing candidate, you could say that she&apos;s a friend and enemy. But, Yuki and I are already friends, so...)</p>

<p>What is the right term to describe the relationship between her and Ayano? Of course, for Alisa herself, she was not unwilling to be friends with Ayano. But she wasn&apos;t asked to be friends, and she also lacked the confidence in her personality to refer to herself as a close friend..... Alisa kept worrying about that kind of thing like a person suffering from a communication disorder.</p>

<p>Rather, would the other party want to start the topic of conversation first... when thinking so, Alisa immediately gave up after seeing the look in Ayano&apos;s eyes. Because she had a completely straight gaze. Her face did not exude the slightest of awkwardness. She put her hands on her legs and straightened her back, she was already in the perfect position to listen, Alisa could even almost hear her inner voice saying, &quot;Go ahead, I&apos;m ready to listen to whatever you have to say, alright?&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Here&apos;s your water. Please call me again when you&apos;ve decided on your order~&quot;</p>

<p>The mysterious gaze contest was interrupted when the female employee from before came in with a glass of water. After averting her gaze from Ayano, Alisa then picked up the menu book. She smiled wryly at the names of the dishes that were still brutal-looking. Alisa then glanced at Ayano and asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Which dish did you choose, Kimishima-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I chose--&quot;</p>

<p>Just as Ayano was about to answer Alisa&apos;s question, having mustered up all her courage, the answer just appeared on the tray.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry for keeping you waiting~. Here. The &apos;Pincushion of Hell&apos; you ordered~&quot;</p>

<p>A bowl of bright red soup with a pile of garlic as thin as needles and piled up like a mountain was brought to the table. The second dish from the top of the menu. Ramenlt was a ramen that had a spiciness one level above the &apos;Blood Pond of Hell&apos; that Alisa had eaten before.</p>

<p>&quot;...this is my order.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So......&quot;</p>

<p>Looking at the ramen served, Alisa immediately thought for a few seconds. Originally, today Alisa had intended to order the Blood Pond of Hell that she had eaten before. But when she saw Ayano ordering another level of spicy ramen, the thought of &quot;It&apos;s not like I won&apos;t make any progress if I keep eating the same thing?&quot; crossed Alisa&apos;s mind. And well, if she ordered the least spicy ramen here, she felt that she would lose. This wasn&apos;t a match, though.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, excuse me. I&apos;d like to order the same menu as her.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa ordered so when she stopped the female employee who was trying to leave the ramen and return to the kitchen. Then she turned to Ayano and urged her to eat first.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, I accept your kind offer.&quot;</p>

<p>When she put her hands together and said that, Ayano used her chopsticks to dip a heap of garlic into the soup while pulling the noodles out from inside and slurped it up without making a sound.</p>

<p>&quot;Gh!!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;??&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Then, after pausing her movements for a moment, Ayano began to stuff the noodles into her mouth slowly. She then quickly wiped her lips with a paper napkin and chewed. Her facial expression did not change at all.</p>

<p>(T-That&apos;s incredible! I didn&apos;t expect her to be able to eat ramen that looks so spicy-looking without moving an eyebrow... Kimishima-san must love spicy food too...)</p>

<p>(TN: no, I think she just lacks the ability to express emotions)</p>

<p>With a sense of horror, Alisa felt impressed and a little impatient. She still vividly remembered the destructive spicy flavor of the ramen the other day. Alisa wondered if she could finish ramen that was spicier than that....</p>

<p>(I-It&apos;s okay! After all, I&apos;m used to spicy flavors, and last time, it was my own fault for adding spiciness halfway through eating the ramen!)</p>

<p>When she glanced at the edge of the table while cheering herself up, there was a small jar that gave a suspicious impression among other condiments such as soy sauce and peppercorns. It was a super spicy condiment called Demon Tears.</p>

<p>(As long as I don&apos;t touch that thing, should be fine...!)</p>

<p>In front of Alisa who said that to herself and boosted her morale fighting spirit, ... Ayano was chewing her second mouthful of ramen.</p>

<p>(Spicy...so spicy, hiks, hiks...)</p>

<p>But inwardly, she was literally bursting into tears Yes, actually, Ayano doesn&apos;t like spicy food at all. So, why did she bother going to such a restaurant? There was only one reason. All these efforts were made so that she could eat the super spicy food that her two beloved masters favored.</p>

<p>In order to achieve that goal, Ayano secretly visits restaurants that serve super-spicy spicy food on holidays and keeps trying to practice to get used to it. Thanks to her efforts, she has become much more tolerant of spicy food than two years ago when she started her training in spicy cuisine, but still... for Ayano, this extremely spicy ramen was quite challenging.</p>

<p>(So hot, so spicy... hiks, my mouth is burning...)</p>

<p>The spiciness was obvious from the first bite. It&apos;s as if the residual spiciness in the mouth has been ignited by the heat of the noodles. The combination of the spiciness and the heat of the noodles caused an an explosion that scorched the inside of the mouth. She herself didn&apos;t know anymore whether she was feeling hot or spicy.</p>

<p>(Fuu, huu, hau, fuuuu...)</p>

<p>If she could, she would like to open her mouth and take a deep breath. However, such a breach of manners should not be committed as it would tarnish her principles as a super maid. If she was alone no problem, but she was with Alisa who was sitting in front of her. How would she do such a disgraceful act in front of her beautiful classmate and rival of her master, Yuki.</p>

<p>&quot;Fuu...&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano managed to swallow what was in her mouth without changing her expression and let out a small sigh. She instinctively wanted to take a sip of water, but based on her her experience so far, it was not very effective in relieving the spicy taste in the mouth, so she tried to restrain herself. Instead, she decided to taste the relatively safe onions.</p>

<p>(Compared to the noodles that have been soaked in the soup... Let&apos;s taste a little onions that have not been exposed to the soup)</p>

<p>With that in mind, she brought the onion to her mouth and... immediately regretted it. Because, when she chewed the crispy green onions, the spicy flavor of the green onions pierced his tongue like a needle.</p>

<p>&quot;!!?&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano&apos;s eyes became wet as she felt the spiciness of the onion that was clearly not from ordinary onions. The piercing spiciness was very different from the the searing heat of chili peppers. Chemically speaking, the spiciness does not come from the substance capsaicin, but from aniline. If described in elements, the elements would consist of fire and wind. The two completely different types of spiciness exploded in her mouth and almost brought tears to her eyes.</p>

<p>(TN: capsaicin is a chemical compound which makes chillies spicy. Aniline is found in onion and is one of the compounds which contributes to its distinct &quot;tangy&quot; or &quot;chillingly burning&quot; sensation when eating it, hence why the author here described the sensation to that of fire and wind. Interestingly, capsaicin is meant to be a defense mechanism to prevent animals from eating the chili pepper itself, but for some reason we humans (mostly asians) find that shit addicting).)</p>

<p>(S-So apparently... so this is what the Pincushion of Hell is called...)</p>

<p>Two kinds of spiciness that attacked from completely different directions without clashing with each other. Ayano immediately closed her eyes as she realized that this double spiciness was what this ramen was all about. She nodded her head and suppressed her lacrimal glands to stop the tears, as if she was enjoying the meal with her eyes closed. Then she swallowed what was in her mouth and slowly reached for the glass to take a sip of water. Ayano opened her mouth as she exhaled in relief at the sensation of her mouth being washed clean.</p>

<p>&quot;The flavor is really delicious. Despite the spiciness, the flavor of the vegetables and meat taste really good.&quot;</p>

<p>By the way, Ayano did not mean to lie. After a long period of practice Ayano can taste umami well underneath the spiciness. So, she wasn&apos;t lying at all. It&apos;s just that she&apos;s not telling the truth that umami was so difficult to feel that she was unable to enjoy such a delicacy like that.</p>

<p>However, Alisa was completely unaware of Ayano&apos;s inner thoughts.</p>

<p>&quot;S-So yeah... then, I&apos;m really looking forward to it.&quot;</p>

<p>With a slightly awkward smile, Alisa was secretly frightened.</p>

<p>(I-I can&apos;t believe she can keep eating it so casually... Kimishima-san, you do like spicy food, huh...)</p>

<p>As Ayano started sipping her ramen again in silence, Alisa became increasingly anxious. It was possible that they could shorten the distance between them in front of the enemy together while saying something like, &quot;Uhh, this ramen is really spicy~&quot; and being &quot;Really, it&apos;s so spicy~&quot;... but that kind of faint hope quickly disappeared. Ayano is a veteran warrior who doesn&apos;t need a partner. From the very beginning, she was the only one who was a new soldier.</p>

<p>(Uhh...)</p>

<p>Although it was too late, Alisa felt regretful for sitting with Ayano. If one tried to complain &quot;spicy~ spicy~&quot; in the presence of a warrior, it was only natural that she would get a look that implied, &quot;why did you come here?&quot;. If that&apos;s the case, it&apos;s better if the ramen is only brought in after Ayano had finished eating and left the shop... Well, how practical could that be?</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry for keeping you waiting~. Here&apos;s the &apos;Pincushion of Hell&apos; you ordered~&quot;</p>

<p>When Ayano had finished about half the portion, the ramen was served in front of Alisa. Having no other way to escape, Alisa decided to resolve, and picked up her disposable chopsticks as if she was a soldier heading into battle with a gun in her hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&lt;img src=&quot;&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;Itadakimasu&quot;</p>

<p>First of all, first contact is important. This first bite will determine the next step...</p>

<p>&quot;!? Ufuguphtsh!&quot;</p>

<ing src="https://i.ibb.co/TWdPdGh/u67551-de8af79c-e366-4bc1-b503-a8a389f513d6.jpg">

<p>As Alisa slurped her noodles, the capsaicin compound immediately hit the back of her throat and made her choke. She almost spit the noodles back out, but she couldn&apos;t stop gagging.</p>

<p>&quot;Ukgh! Ukguh! Ukugh!&quot;</p>

<p>She repeatedly coughed while holding the noodles in her mouth. After she managed to calm down, she carefully brought the noodles to her mouth with her chopsticks. She carried it...... and secretly felt pain from the spicy flavor that seemed to burn inside her mouth.</p>

<p>(Unnn ~~~~!?)</p>

<p>It was spicy, hot, and painful. Are they all that stupid? Both the person who made this food and the person who ordered it.</p>

<p>(In other words, me too, stupid...!)</p>

<p>Alisa hurriedly wiped her lips with a paper napkin, her mind raging because the ramen was too spicy. She could understand it well upon making first contact. This food was truly her nemesis.</p>

<p>(I-I feel like I can&apos;t finish it...)</p>

<p>Alisa swallowed her first mouthful with a feeling of despair. Then Ayano called out to her with a slightly worried look in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay? It looks like you coughed pretty hard earlier...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I&apos;m fine, really.&quot;</p>

<p>When asked in a worried tone, Alisa replied in a strong manner.</p>

<p>&quot;The soup just fell down my throat. I think I slurped it a bit too hard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I&apos;ve experienced that too. That&apos;s what happens when you&apos;re not careful.&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: if anyone has eaten soup which is spicy, you might have experienced this at least once. For some reason, involuntarily swallowing the soup for some reason makes it 10x more spicier than normal)</p>

<p>After replying with a faint smile to Ayano who nodded in agreement, Alisa then looked back down at her ramen bowl... She almost despaired when she saw her path to finishing the spicy ramen was still very long. Alisa stopped her chopsticks involuntarily. Ayano continued eating</p>

<p>(l-if I try to put the onion in just once, it might be a little less spicy)</p>

<p>And then she fell into the same trap of following the exact same as Ayano.</p>

<p>(Sp-Spicy as hell, ugh, uhuk!)</p>

<p>Alisa&apos;s poker face almost collapsed from the spiciness of the scallions that hit the tear glands from inside her mouth. However, when Alisa maintained her expression vigorously, she soon sensed that the more she bit into the onion, the more spicy it became. After minimizing the amount of chewing, she half-heartedly swallowed it with water.</p>

<p>Then, the coldness of the ice water and the piercing spiciness of the onion combined to create a strange, tingly sensation on the tingle in his mouth.</p>

<p>(I can use this!)</p>

<p>She knew that it was just a fake refreshing sensation. But, even if it was just her imagination, she couldn&apos;t continue eating without relying on this. After deciding on that, Alisa began to eat as fast as she could, slurping up as much noodles as much as possible while adding as little broth as possible. All for the sake of defeating as many enemies as possible while the fake invincibility time continued. Ayano looked surprised when she saw Alisa moving her chopsticks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(S-She ate so many of them one after another... it was amazing. It seems that Alisa-sama also likes spicy food, huh.)</p>

<p>It was just a misunderstanding. They completely misunderstood the situation because of their fake endurance they have with each other.</p>

<p>(I can&apos;t lose either...!)</p>

<p>After all, she was inspired by the sight of her opponent. Ayano continued eating without stopping her chopsticks because she didn&apos;t want to lose to Alisa. Seeing that scene, Alisa too...</p>

<p>(She ate it so casually... I have to struggle too!)</p>

<p>It was really a picture of hell. As a result of misunderstanding each other because the opposing side was able to keep up, the option to surrender had already disappeared from both of their minds. If that was the case again, all that remained was to push forward with determination and pride. Until they passed through this hell. Not long after...</p>

<p>&quot;Fyuuhh... gochisousama.&quot;</p>

<p>In the end, Ayano successfully conquered the Pincushion of Hell&apos;s ramen. While feeling a sense of accomplishment that made her want to raise the flag, Ayano was as intoxicated by ice water, and not victory wine.</p>

<p>(For some reason, Kimishima-san looks very satisfied...? Wh-Was it that delicious? I can&apos;t understand it... but I have a little bit left too!)</p>

<p>After seeing Ayano make it to the top one step further, Alisa also put in her last effort. She plunged her chopsticks into the portion of noodles that had the amount of which had been drastically reduced--</p>

<p>Alisa stopped her chopsticks when she felt an unpleasant sensation at the tip of her chopsticks. It was a mistake Alisa made because she was still a</p>

<p>beginner in the field of super spicy ramen. What touched the tip of her chopsticks was a collection of chili peppers and ground meat that had settled at the bottom of the bowl because she had didn&apos;t stir the ramen soup during the meal.</p>

<p>(TN: Isn&apos;t eating chashu pork/sliced meat with ramen better than ground meat though?)</p>

<p>(?What?)</p>

<p>And because she was still a beginner... Alisa made an even more fatal mistake. The strange sensation touching her chopsticks caused her to unconsciously scrape them and peek into the depths of hell. As a result...</p>

<p>(W-what, uh, this...!?)</p>

<p>A lump of spicy material that settled at the bottom and half hardened... The demon swarms that had been sealed at the bottom of hell began to be released. Now the amount of soup itself has already decreased, the density is not comparable to before. She hurriedly pulled out the noodles, but it was too late. The noodles she lifted up were covered with so many pieces of red chili and grains of black pepper that they were no longer in a condition where they could be removed by blowing.</p>

<p>(...Uh, should eat it? This?)</p>

<p>Alisa felt as if her peak had erupted when she was already on the brink of the peak.</p>

<p>However, she couldn&apos;t keep looking at it like this forever. Her goal was in sight. Ayano, who had already reached the top first, was waiting right in front of her.</p>

<p>(I will not lose. I will definitely finish with her...)</p>

<p>Alisa boosted her fighting spirit while staring at the noodles with a slightly horrified expression. That&apos;s right, if she backed down now, she would never know why she struggled desperately through this tongue torture. For what reason was she willing to do all this... for the sake of her competition with Ayano? For her own satisfaction? No, since the beginning...</p>

<p>(I also want to be able to enjoy spicy food with Masachika-kun!!!)</p>

<p>In the depths of hell, Alisa finally revealed her true intentions. And then, she stuffed the noodles into her mouth.......</p>

<p>◆◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh!...?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa suddenly found herself sitting on the park bench that she had visited before. She looked around while blinking constantly and saw Ayano sitting right next to her, looking at her with a worried gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;...Are you alright, Alisa-sama?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? Umm, I...&quot;</p>

<p>She tried to remember why she came to be here, but unfortunately she could not remember as if there was a fog covering her consciousness. Ayano slowly opened her mouth to Alisa, who tilted her head while frowning.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually... after you ate the ramen, Alisa-sama was acting as if your soul was drained...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, ah, so, that&apos;s what it looks like...&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa glanced at Ayano while cowering in indescribable</p>

<p>embarrassment and awkwardness......</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, thank you very much, Kimishima-san. You brought me this far, didn&apos;t you...? Oh yeah, payment! I haven&apos;t paid for the ramen yet...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For the time being, paid for your share too...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, I&apos;m sorry! I&apos;ll repay you right away! Umm, about how much was it?...&quot;</p>

<p>After the money exchange was completed, Ayano suddenly asked her in a tone that was slightly reluctant.</p>

<p>&quot;Alisa-sama, you umm... don&apos;t really like spicy food, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uhh~......</p>

<p>She wanted to deny it right away, but she couldn&apos;t bring herself to deny it when she had just woken up from a stupor. Alisa averted her eyes for a moment and then nodded resignedly.</p>

<p>&quot;... Yes. I don&apos;t really like that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see....&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa, who was already prepared for the question, &quot;Then, why did you go to that restaurant?&quot; was taken aback by hearing something completely unexpected.</p>

<p>After the money exchange was completed, Ayano suddenly asked her in a tone that was slightly reluctant.</p>

<p>&quot;Alisa-sama, you umm... don&apos;t really like spicy food, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uhh~......</p>

<p>She wanted to deny it right away, but she couldn&apos;t bring herself to deny it when she had just woken up from a stupor. Alisa averted her eyes for a moment and then nodded resignedly.</p>

<p>&quot;... Yes. I don&apos;t really like that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see....&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa, who was already prepared for the question, &quot;Then, why did you go to that restaurant?&quot; was taken aback by hearing something completely unexpected.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, I&apos;m the same way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I tried my best to eat the same food as Yukisama and Masachika......, but it was hard to get used to it.&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano then shared the same motives and feelings as herself. In Alisa&apos;s mind, her sympathy and interest in Ayano began to surge sharply. She felt like she had finally met a living person, as there were only the demons playing merrily around her in the depths of hell.</p>

<p>&quot;Ac-Actually, I&apos;m the same way... I want to be able to enjoy the same food as my friend Yuki-san...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa&apos;s agreement brought a pleased look to Ayano&apos;s eyes. The look was exactly like finding a comrade on a deserted battlefield. After all, perhaps the thing to do in human relationships is to be honest.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, if you don&apos;t mind... from now on, would you like to continue practicing spicy food with me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh...?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa was immediately stunned when she heard Ayano&apos;s suggestion. To be honest, Alisa was not in a state where she could think of anything further.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, because I was thinking that the two of us could encourage and help each other....&quot;</p>

<p>However, looking at Ayano who was struggling to express her words while looking down and stealing glances at her, Alisa couldn&apos;t bear to reject her.</p>

<p>(Maybe... I can make more friends)</p>

<p>The rest, well, she had a bit of an ulterior motive of sorts.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes alright, I understand. From now on, please get along with me, okay? Kimishima-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah--yes!&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa accepted the offer without much thought. As a result, from now on Alisa and Ayano will undergo a long and painful training journey together, ..... but that&apos;s a story for another time.</p>
