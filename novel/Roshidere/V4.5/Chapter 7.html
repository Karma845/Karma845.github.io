<h3>Chapter 7 - Constellations and Kneeling</h3>



<p>&quot;...Umm, then, shall we start the investigation?&quot;</p>

<p>It was around 7pm, when the club activities at school had ended. Inside the student council room, Masachika reluctantly looked to his left and right after finishing an early dinner with food bought at the convenience store.</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohh~~....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let&apos;s get this over with as quickly as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>With an obviously trembling waist, Maria raised her fist. While Alisa, with her arms crossed while wearing an indifferent expression, tapped her fingers restlessly. Before departure, Masachika was already overwhelmed with anxiety.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm Masha-san, are you okay? Or rather, you don&apos;t look fine....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;E-Ehh~~? That&apos;s not true, really? I&apos;ll do my best!&quot;</p>

<p>With a subtle twitch in her eyes, Maria pursed her lips and tightly clenched both hands. Her appearance was full of enthusiasm, looking a little adorable, but...</p>

<p>&quot;The moment you tried to say you were fine made it clear that you were not okay...&quot;</p>

<p>That statement alone was an admission that she was scared. In response to that attitude Masachika could only say, &quot;Please don&apos;t push yourself too hard,&quot; and turned his attention to Alisa on the other side.</p>

<p>&quot;So, is Alya herself feeling okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m fine, really? Unlike Masha, I&apos;m not a scared person.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa raised one eyebrow hesitantly and looked at Maria slightly dumbfounded.... But was it just Masachika&apos;s imagination if she was just pretending to be calm. However, there was no point in bringing that up now, so Masachika sighed and opened the student council room door.</p>

<p>Then the motion sensor reacted and the lights in the hallway started to turn on. Shrugging his shoulders, Masachika turned his head to look back.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, Masha-san. The lights are coming on. It&apos;s still not too dark outside, really. So you&apos;re not too scared, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.......</p>

<p>Nodding to Masachika&apos;s words, Maria timidly went out into the hallway. With a slightly dumbfounded expression on her face, Alisa also went into the hallway and closed the student council room door.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, let&apos;s go to the art room first. After that, we can go around the school building to look for the whereabouts of the &quot;red schoolgirl&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A-Alright...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, let&apos;s do that.&quot;</p>

<p>After confirming that they nodded, Masachika continued and....</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, wait a minute!&quot;</p>

<p>...... But suddenly, his right hand was grabbed from behind. When he turned around, Masachika saw Maria who was glancing at the window with a face that already looked like she was about to cry.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t go first, I&apos;ll be scared, you know~~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...no, that&apos;s why Masha-san was able to wait for us in the student council room earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I&apos;m alone, I&apos;ll definitely get attacked!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What!? School ghost stories are not jumpscare horror stories, you know!?&quot;</p>

<p>Maria shouted in an uncharacteristically fast voice, and Masachika told her that she must have mistaken it for a horror story about being chased by a serial killer. But Maria didn&apos;t believe him at all and repeatedly glanced toward the window. The slender hand holding Masachika was also visibly trembling with fear.</p>

<p>&quot;I know that this...... kind of thing usually comes out of the blue with a bang from outside, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, this is just an ordinary ghost story, not the type of story with sudden attacks from outside.... haaa, is this enough?&quot;</p>

<p>Sighing, Masachika moved to a position next to Maria, guarding her from the window area. Then Alisa also moved to the opposite side of Maria while sighing.</p>

<p>&quot;...Here. Now you don&apos;t have to worry about anything coming out from inside the classroom, right? Even though nothing came out, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-yes... thank you, Alya-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>While nodding awkwardly, Maria also took Alisa&apos;s left hand. Although she raised her eyebrows for a moment, when her gaze met with Masachika&apos;s eyes above Maria&apos;s head, Alisa gave up and simply shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>Maria&apos;s hands were held by Masachika and Alisa from both sides. The composition really resembles the sight of a parent and child, as the person in the middle was shorter than those on both her sides. But in reality, the person in the center was the oldest.</p>

<p>&quot;This kind of thing too... can be included in the clich&eacute;d scene of a horror movie, when a person is holding hands with both sides, and without realizing that the person being held has been replaced by something else... Ah, sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as Masachika muttered that in a low voice, Maria looked at him with an unbelievable look in her eyes and he immediately apologized to her. However, Maria suddenly looked surprised and turned to Alisa quickly. Then, she spoke to her with a terrified expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Alya-chan...? You&apos;re the real Alya-chan, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Don&apos;t take Masachika-kun&apos;s jokes seriously.&quot;</p>

<p>Maria suddenly spoke in Russian to Alisa, who looked completely dumbfounded.</p>

<p>{If so, where is the most prominent mole on your body? } (Masha)</p>

<p>{... What&apos;s the deal with that question?} (Alya)</p>

<p>{It doesn&apos;t matter, Kuze-kun won&apos;t understand it anyway} (Masha)</p>

<p>(TN: Maria knows he does but is continuing anyway. Dahm she really did Alya dirty)</p>

<p>No, he understands. He completely understood the conversation between the two of them, but.... Alisa took a quick glance at Masachika and looked away with a snort, she then said...</p>

<p>{...... on the right leg thigh} (Alya)</p>

<p>(......Hou~)</p>

<p>No, what the heck are they talking about? At best, Masachika could only mutter in her heart &quot;it turns out Alya has a mole too, huh...&quot;.</p>

<p>However... inevitably his gaze always fell on the thighs hidden under her skirt. At the same time, he recalled a scene in the sports equipment warehouse that happened during the day and tried to verify in his brain, &quot;I wonder, is there really a mole there?&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Yup! There&apos;s no mistaking it, you&apos;re the real Alya-chan!&quot;</p>

<p>However, when Maria suddenly turned her head towards him, Masachika hurriedly raised his face. To be honest, he was not sure if he managed to turn his face away in time, but...... Maria didn&apos;t seem to care much and tilted her head with a groan.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, now it&apos;s Kuze-kun&apos;s turn.......&quot;</p>

<p>After a few seconds of thinking. Maria covered her mouth with both hands with a shocked expression on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Wh-What should do! I can&apos;t think of a question that can distinguish whether this Kuze-kun is real or fake!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh... yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about Alya-chan? Are you able to come up with good questions to distinguish between real or fake!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh...?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa frowned with an exasperated expression, but she looked slightly at Maria&apos;s overly desperate appearance. Then, she looked at Masachika with a mischievous smile on her mouth as if she had just thought of something.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then... Are you able to tell me what you really meant when you offered to be my partner in the election campaign?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H-Hah, what&apos;s with that question?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What&apos;s wrong? If you&apos;re the real Masachika-kun, you should remember it, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika&apos;s cheeks twitched at Alisa&apos;s blatantly grinning face.</p>

<p>(Yeah, I do vaguely remember it... I remember that said something crazy and super embarrassing! And you want me to rephrase that sentence right here!?)</p>

<p>When Alisa demanded a horrifyingly humiliating answer under the pretext of identifying his identity, Masachika tried to demand a change in the question.... but after seeing Maria&apos;s teary-eyed gaze, and gently keeping a distance from himself, he immediately shut up. When stared at with a look like &quot;Eh, that&apos;s not true, isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s a lie, isn&apos;t it?&quot;, he instinctively wanted to do something about it.</p>

<p>(Haaa... gee, I guess I have no other choice)</p>

<p>In this case, if you feel embarrassed about it, you&apos;re the one who loses.</p>

<p>(Because you asked for it yourself... so, don&apos;t regret it, okay? Feel this!)</p>

<p>Having made up her mind, Masachika made a serious face after clearing his throat and looked straight at Alisa as he said.</p>

<p>&quot;If I&apos;m not mistaken, said, [I won&apos;t leave you alone anymore. From now on, will support you]?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...More precisely, you said [I won&apos;t leave you alone again] [From now, I will stand by you and support you]&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, ah, that&apos;s right.&quot;</p>

<p>When Alisa corrected her with a dissatisfied expression, Masachika&apos;s face turned serious. Immediately afterward, he quickly blushed because of the embarrassment that was creeping into his heart.</p>

<p>(Uehh? Seriously? Uh, what the hell is she doing? Does she remember everything say? This isn&apos;t embarrassing for her anymore!?)</p>

<p>The fact that she could accurately recall the words of his own black history, and the fact that it was engraved in Alisa&apos;s brain as an important memory made Masachika fell over inwardly.</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you blushing all of a sudden?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa glared at him, but it seemed that her embarrassment came too late from Masachika, and even her own cheeks flushed slightly. Perhaps realizing this, Alisa turned her gaze away from Masachika and turned to Maria in a way that was deceptive.</p>

<p>&quot;See, I knew that he was the real Masachika-kun... so let&apos;s go quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>She said it with a clear expression and a relaxed tone, but Maria tilted her head with a smile that was very different from the one she had just given.</p>

<p>&quot;Alya-chan, so cute~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H-Huh? What do you mean cute, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, so young... oh well, how about this?&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Maria pulled Masachika and Alisa&apos;s hands, which were clasped in her both hands, and half forced them to join hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Good. Fellow good friends, should hold each other&apos;s hands, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, isn&apos;t the conversation going to be different?&quot;</p>

<p>They both commented simultaneously and quickly released their hands from each other. Then Maria lowered her eyebrows slightly while laughing softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Fufu you two are both shy...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don&apos;t understand what you mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all, from the beginning, wasn&apos;t it Masha-san herself who asked to hold hands because you were scared, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right, really~? Therefore, you two let&apos;s hold hands?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry. I didn&apos;t understand the meaning of &apos;Therefore&quot;. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Use the conjunction properly.&quot;</p>

<p>The two of them brought that up to Maria, who skillfully skipped over their reasoning. But instead, Maria looked dissatisfied and walked to the other side of Masachika, then took his left hand.</p>

<p>&quot;If you keep saying that, let me hold hands with Kuzekun, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you, why do you say that!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This conversation is completely out of sync...&quot;</p>

<p>It was Masachika who shouted in a loud voice, and Alisa put her hand on her forehead as if her head hurt. However, after seeing Maria holding Masachika&apos;s left hand and somehow looking pleased with herself, the two of them abandoned their understanding at the same time. After exchanging tired glances, they then held each other&apos;s hands again.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, then, let&apos;s go~~!&quot;</p>

<p>Upon seeing that, Maria nodded her head contentedly, and pointed to the forward with a joyful mood, while still holding Masachika&apos;s hand in her right hand.</p>

<p>For a moment, Alisa looked at Maria with one wide eye like a thug and as if to imply, &quot;I thought you&apos;d let go of his hand when I was holding him!&quot;. However, she soon realized that it was futile, sighed, and looked ahead.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, let&apos;s get started... and finish quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Ohh~~&quot;</p>

<p>With a resigned expression, Masachika began to walk with a faraway look in his eyes. On to his right was Alisa&apos;s slender and slightly cold hand, while to his left was Maria&apos;s warm and soft hand.</p>

<p>(Hmm? What&apos;s with this situation? Harem? Hooray~~ I&apos;m holding two beautiful girls in both hands~ finally, spring has arrived in my life~)</p>

<p>Regardless of the stupid things he said in his brain, inside his mind, Masachika felt quite nervous. Although he had held hands with Alisa a few times, the number could still be counted, and this was the first time Masachika was holding hands with Maria.</p>

<p>Then at the same time, Masachika didn&apos;t know: &quot;should I swing my arms if my hands get sweaty, is my walking speed right, or is this the right way to hold hands?&quot;. He worried about such matters and couldn&apos;t feel at ease.</p>

<p>(I-It&apos;s about that anyway... Ahh, I&apos;d better get it over with quickly)</p>

<p>Sandwiched between Maria, who was strangely in a happy mood, and on the other side, Alisa looking a little sullen, Masachika decided to end the investigation early. As a result...</p>

<p>&quot;The art room! No abnormalities! Next place!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cherry blossoms behind the school building! Still not blooming! Next!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that too perfunctory!?&quot;</p>

<p>When Masachika drew conclusions in less than ten seconds after a glance, Alisa couldn&apos;t help but criticize him. However, Masachika seemed didn&apos;t really care and shrugged his shoulders with a relaxed face.</p>

<p>&quot;From the beginning, this investigation was done to make sure there were no abnormalities, so there&apos;s no problem, right? Don&apos;t worry, I also didn&apos;t forget to take photos for proof.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s true anyway...&quot;</p>

<p>Due to her serious nature, Alisa muttered in frustration and seemed less convinced. However, when she glanced at Maria, who was on the other side of Masachika, she sighed.</p>

<p>&quot;Masha... that&apos;s enough, don&apos;t be afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, e-even though you say so~~&quot;</p>

<p>At Alisa&apos;s unreasonable request, Maria shrugged her shoulders pitifully. She then looked around with fear at the environment that was finally darkened and quietly brought herself closer to Masachika&apos;s body. Seeing the scene, Alisa furrowed her brows.</p>

<p>&quot;After all, the investigation is starting now, right... it&apos;s only natural that I feel so scared.&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps afraid to talk about the details, Maria cut off her words and.... moved closer to Masachika. With her right hand gripping Masachika&apos;s left hand, she tightly embraced Masachika&apos;s forearm with her left hand. Naturally, their arms were completely attached to each other, and Maria&apos;s breasts tightly against Masachika&apos;s elbow. Masachika&apos;s face immediately turned bright red, while Alisa frowned.</p>

<p>&quot;...Let&apos;s quickly leave and continue the investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa said this with a mixture of annoyance and pulled Masachika&apos;s hand as she started walking with large strides. However, Maria still clung tightly to Masachika&apos;s right arm and did not move away, and Alisa furrowed her brows even more as she looked over her shoulder to confirm this... With that being the case, they walked back to the school building and started walking down the corridor.</p>

<p>&quot;O-Oi, walk a little slower...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? We&apos;re going around the main school building, right? Shouldn&apos;t we go around as quickly as possible so that it doesn&apos;t take too long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s true, anyway...&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika felt a slight sense of discomfort as Alisa hurried on with her gaze fixed on the path ahead, she then asked timidly.</p>

<p>&quot;...aren&apos;t you pushing yourself too hard?&quot;</p>

<p>At this point, Alisa&apos;s hand twitched as she grabbed Masachika&apos;s hand. However, when Alisa still wouldn&apos;t turn around, Maria whispered to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Alya-chan is being a hard ass...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh, what, I knew it, you&apos;re really scared, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Not really, really?&quot;</p>

<p>She said it with an indifferent tone of voice, but she still wouldn&apos;t turn around. And suddenly, her walking speed began to slow down. When they managed to catch up with her, Alisa snorted and turned her head to the side to hide her expression.</p>

<p>&quot;... You&apos;re afraid of horror, aren&apos;t you? Though during the bravery test during school festival preparations last year, I thought you looked fine...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That said, I don&apos;t feel scared at all, really...&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa stubbornly kept denying it while turning her face away, but then Maria came back with an explanation.</p>

<p>&quot;You know, Alya-chan is ~ if she&apos;s just scared, it&apos;s fine, but if she hears scary stories, she&apos;ll get scared, you know~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh... I see. So you&apos;re the type of person who gets scared by your own imagination, huh.&quot;</p>

<p>When Masachika sounded convinced, Alisa glared at Maria, but she quickly turned her face away again. After</p>

<p>seeing that easy-to-understand reaction, Masachika could only smile wryly as she said, &quot;If that&apos;s the case, guess it&apos;s only natural.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the seven mysteries, only the mystery of [The figure of the red girl] was clearly more serious as a ghost story than the others. Just like the famous ghost stories Kuchisake Onna and Teke-Teke, there are many witnesses who have seen sightings of the red schoolgirl figure.</p>

<p>It is said that she often appears inside the main school building after school hours. The figure wears a Seirei Gakuen uniform, and her ribbon is green.</p>

<p>She has waist-length black hair and is called the &quot;Red Schoolgirl&quot; because she always bleeds from somewhere on her body.</p>

<p>If you meet her, never call out to her or occasionally help her because you feel worried. If you help her, she will say &quot;Thank you, I&apos;m fine.&quot;, then go somewhere. And the person who hears those words, in a few days, will get hurt in the same place as the girl.</p>

<p>That&apos;s right, it&apos;s as if the wound from &quot;The figure of the red girl&quot; was transferred exactly as it is...</p>

<p>(Anyway, just because you&apos;re injured doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re going to die, it&apos;s just that part is strangely too realistic... the fact that it can only happen in a few days adds to the uncertainty...)</p>

<p>In addition, there are ways to deal with it if one encounters such a figure, whether it&apos;s true or not. First of all, never approach it. Then, leave the school building immediately.</p>

<p>In addition to the above-mentioned characteristics, the way to distinguish her from an ordinary female student is motion sensors that don&apos;t respond, so be careful if you see her standing in a dark hallway....that&apos;s how to deal with it.</p>

<p>(Well, to be honest, have a strong feeling that it could just be a warning, but... there have already been actual victims of that figure.)</p>

<p>Touya told them that he had information about the two victims. The first case happened last November. A male student from the running club met with the &quot;Red Schoolgirl&quot; with an injury to her right leg, and three days later, the man suffered a laceration to his heel.</p>

<p>(TN: laceration means deep cut btw)</p>

<p>The second case occurred in June this year. The vice president of the drum band club was hospitalized with with appendicitis surgery after encountering the &quot;red schoolgirl&quot; with blood stained on the center of her uniform... Because the vice president of this club is a very popular and well-liked person, rumors quickly spread, and it seems that his case was the one who triggered the viral gossip of the seven mysteries.</p>

<p>(In other words... The mystery of this &quot;red side girl&quot; is the origin and the culmination of the seven mysteries of the school. Ahh, come to think of it, it seems a little cool that so)</p>

<p>Masachika laughed lightly at the idea that was similar to a chuunibyo&apos;s fantasy. In contrast with the Kujou sisters, Masachika has a fairly relaxed attitude because he basically doesn&apos;t believe in ghost stories.</p>

<p>It&apos;s not uncommon for members of the running club to have heel injuries. And regarding the appendicitis surgery, Masachika thought that it was just a normal complication. First of all, neither case was accompanied by bleeding. This made it impossible to say that the injury from the &quot;red schoolgirl&quot; was transferred.</p>

<p>(In fact, it&apos;s much more credible that they had stab wounds or cuts~)</p>

<p>After summarizing his views on the seven mysteries rumor, Masachika shrugged his shoulders and looked at Maria.</p>

<p>&quot;From the beginning, most of the seven mysteries were just hoaxes. You didn&apos;t hear the sobs of a woman in the club building, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yes... well, I didn&apos;t.&quot;</p>

<p>As Masachika had said, Maria and the others investigated &quot;The sound of sobs in the club building&quot; during the day, but after searching around for an hour, they did not hear any such sound. So, they had no choice but to open the windows slightly and concluded that the sound of the wind blowing</p>

<p>&quot;Huuuuuuuuuu&quot; is the true identity of the mystery ..... or more accurately, that&apos;s what they insisted on.</p>

<p>Regardless, of the six mysteries, the only one that was clearly identified was the cat in the warehouse, and the rest were hoaxes, that&apos;s how their investigations have turned out so far. Therefore, it is likely that this last ghost story is also a creation from students.</p>

<p>&quot;After all, the Seven School Mysteries are more or less bound to be so. I&apos;m sure that it was just a student experiencing something strange, and then told it in an exaggerated way.&quot;</p>

<p>Looking at Masachika who didn&apos;t seem to feel the slightest bit of fear, they both seemed to have lost some of their fear. Maria nodded slowly as she moved her body away from Masachika slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... when you put it like that, it&apos;s true, though...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, isn&apos;t it? First of all, it&apos;s not like female students are the most common. Why is it that this type of urban legend is mostly female? Let&apos;s call them the ghost legends of Hanako-san, Kuchisake-onna, Teke Teke, Yashaku-sama... ...On the contrary, it would be more novel and believable if a greasy bald old grandfather would appear.&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: Excuse me, but if I were to die from a ghost, I&apos;d choose letting a highschool girl stomp me than being stabbed by some bald old man)</p>

<p>&quot;That should be reported normally.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</p>

<p>Arisa teased Masachika with a serious look on her face, causing the three of them to chuckle. Maria pretended to think a little while relaxing her expression.</p>

<p>&quot;But right, there&apos;s also a youkai who&apos;s a grandpa, right?... umm, if I&apos;m not mistaken his name is Konafuki-jiji?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, the correct one is Konaki-jiji. What&apos;s with the youkai that seems to match with Akaname&apos;s youkai?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That one might be more of a hunter than that greasy bald-headed grandpa...&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: I don&apos;t read Japanese yokai stories so I can&apos;t explain or give backstories to the ones they mentioned unfortunately)</p>

<p>The tension that had built up between the three of them was almost completely obliterated by Maria&apos;s naturally witty reply. Then Masachika realized that the search that started on the first floor had already reached the center of the third floor hallway. In a relaxed atmosphere, the three of them walked down the hallway while occasionally looking into the classrooms....</p>

<p>&quot;......Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>As they approached the classroom at the far end, Masachika&apos;s pants pocket became slightly warmer. It was as if there was a body warming plaster inside.</p>

<p>&quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it&apos;s nothing....&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika put his hands in his pockets as he answered Alisa&apos;s question with a vague reply. He then took out a heat source that touched his fingers.</p>

<p>&quot;Ara, what is that thing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I borrowed it from Sarashina-senpai. But, for some reason...... this thing, over time became very hot.....&quot;</p>

<p>It was a black prayer bead (Juzu) with a very scary name, which he had brought along just in case. It was vaguely hot in his hand. As if trying to tell Masachika about something.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey... stop it quickly. Don&apos;t keep trying to scare me, anyway... the jokes aren&apos;t funny, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? No, no, I didn&apos;t mean it that way... well, in horror movies, this pattern usually indicates that a vengeful ghost is approaching, anyway...&quot;</p>

<p>Right after Masachika said that jokingly while making excuses to Alisa, who raised her eyebrows angrily..... a hand appeared from the corner of the hallway a few meters away.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh--&quot;</p>

<p>A strange white hand reached out from behind the corner and gripped the wall. The attention of the three of them was immediately drawn to that hand.</p>

<p>The three of them stared at each other in silence, the fingers of the white hand gripping the wall firmly. At that moment, Masachika had a premonition that something horrible was about to appear behind that corner. His instincts loudly warned to leave this place right now. But against his will, his legs simply wouldn&apos;t move.</p>

<p>The same was true for Alisa and Maria, whether consciously or unconsciously, they both clung tightly to Masachika&apos;s arm and did not move a step from that place.</p>

<p>And in the end, the figure appeared from behind the hand gripping the wall. While wearing a Seirei Gakuen uniform with a green ribbon. Her black hair flowed long to the waist. And peeking through her black hair... The face of a girl covered in blood.</p>

<p>&quot;Kyaaaaaaa!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No-No.&quot;</p>

<p>To her right and left, Maria and Alisa let out shrill screams. To be honest, Masachika also wanted to scream. However, the warmth of their bodies and the feeling on both of his arms, temporarily pushed away Masachika&apos;s fear. With a cool head that even he himself felt surprised by, Masachika thought quickly about how to get out of this situation.</p>

<p>(Would it be better if the three of us just ran away? No, let alone Alya, I don&apos;t think Masha-san can even run. On the contrary, his legs are already weak to the point that even now it&apos;s difficult for him to stand up. Besides, this will probably be a traumatic experience for Masha-san-- in that case, I guess I&apos;ll just have to.....hup!!)</p>

<p>After making a quick decision, Masachika let go of their hands and walked away while putting a smile on the corner of her lips. He approached the female student who appeared covered in blood. Then, through his trembling throat, Masachika let out a shocked voice.</p>

<p>&quot;O-O-Oi, oi, oi, oi! This is too scary, you know! Who told you to go that far!?&quot;</p>

<p>His voice sounded relaxed and cheerful, in contrast to the tension of the place. He felt that his actions could relieve the two people behind him.</p>

<p>Masachika&apos;s decision is...... to make this &quot;red schoolgirl&quot; considered a surprise that he had prepared. While walking with an attitude like &quot;I guess I&apos;ve have gone a little overboard on the surprise,&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika gripped the black juzu that he had borrowed from Chisaki. In this way, he could maintain his calmness on the surface and sharpen his thinking with a cool head.</p>

<p>All it takes is a readiness to get hurt and not hesitate to use violence. Consciously, Masachika pushed aside all other emotions.</p>

<p>(Ahh I might die)</p>

<p>That kind of thought occurred to him as if it was someone else&apos;s business. Although he wouldn&apos;t die, he felt that he wouldn&apos;t be safe just like that. Masachika instinctively knew that it was a real ghost. On the other hand, he only had a piece of juzu in his hand, which he didn&apos;t even know if it would work or not.</p>

<p>The odds were too low. However, how could he just retreat without putting up a fight. After all, the &quot;red schoolgirl&quot; that appeared was injured in the face.</p>

<p>If the ghost stories were true, then Alisa and Maria would probably have facial injuries. He wouldn&apos;t let those two people&apos;s faces get injured... As their friend, and his pride as a man, he would not forgive that.</p>

<p>(For the time being, I&apos;m going to push her around the corner and hit her with this juzu... Even if that doesn&apos;t work, the only person hurt by the &quot;red schoolgirl&quot; is the person who approached her. And the effect will only be seen after a few days. If I was really hurt, I could have hid it during summer vacation.)</p>

<p>There was a possibility that he would not be able to participate in the training camp. However, if he could protect both their minds and bodies, Masachika felt that all his efforts were worth it.</p>

<p>(That&apos;s why... let me be her opponent!)</p>

<p>Then, as he prepared to face the &quot;red schoolgirl&quot;, Masachika turned his attention to the female student&apos;s body to look around for where he should attack....but suddenly, he noticed something strange.</p>

<p>(Hmm? How come there&apos;s blood on her waist... Hmm? If you look closely again, her right leg and arm are also injured...)</p>

<p>Aren&apos;t there too many wounds?</p>

<p>A moment later, such questions crossed his mind. Then a hand that stretched out from the other side of the corner, gripped the neck of the &quot;red schoolgirl&quot; from behind tightly. And the owner of that hand appeared with a bitter expression on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;I finally caught i.... Hmm? Kuze-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>The person who appeared was their student council vice president, who shouldn&apos;t be here. The unexpected appearance of this person made Masachika stop suddenly and stunned.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, there&apos;s Masha and Alya-chan too, huh. Good job to you guys-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, uh, yes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Th-Thanks for the hard work too?&quot;</p>

<p>The Kujou sisters also responded awkwardly, as if they didn&apos;t know how to react to the unexpected situation that happened in quick succession. However, Chisaki did not seem to care much about it, and continued with her usual normal tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Because I was feeling worried~, I stopped by for a while because the meeting ended early.... Well, for now, can you leave it to me? I won&apos;t let her escape again this time.&quot;</p>

<p>When Chisaki turned her attention to the &quot;red schoolgirl&quot;, her body immediately thrashed about. Her bloodshot eyes turned toward Masachika, and her hands stretched out in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>&quot;H-Help me....&quot;</p>

<p>However, Chisaki immediately dragged her away and the female student disappeared around the corner. &quot;D-Don&apos;t overdo it, huh~&quot; Masachika said with a somewhat doubtful tone and..... tilted his head.</p>

<p>(Ummm... so, what does this mean? Ehh? Maybe she&apos;s not a real ghost... but just a student who barged in without permission, and got beat up by Sarashina-senpai? No, whichever way you look at it, that one is much more realistic... ...Putting aside the question of whether Sarashina-senpai would use her fists on a female student).</p>

<p>Or maybe it was a bad surprise that didn&apos;t involve Masachika. There might be someone pretending to be the &quot;red schoolgirl&quot; and trying to frighten someone... When thinking like that, it can be concluded that the reason why there was blood smeared on her face was because she wanted to hide her true identity.</p>

<p>(Yup, I feel like that&apos;s the case. Owaahh~~ was just in a hurry to make a decision, huh~. I feel ashamed that I came forward so bravely and took it so seriously.~~ hahaha....)</p>

<p>Masachika concluded this while trying his best to turn his attention away from the fact that there was an amulet wrapped around Chisaki&apos;s left hand like a glove. Then, as he scratched his head to cover up his embarrassment... there were two hands firmly gripping Masachika&apos;s shoulders from behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Masachika-kun... What is the meaning of this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuze-kun~? I wonder if you can explain it to me, hmm~?&quot;</p>

<p>A cold voice sounded from behind him. When turning around to look back back stiffly, Masachika saw Alisa&apos;s face, which was smiling faintly with eyes that did not smile at all, and Maria with an unnatural smile. The expressions of the two of them were far more frightening than the &quot;red schoolgirl&quot; that he had just seen earlier.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, uh, umm... I-In order to surprise you two, I&apos;ve prepared a special surprise, really? Probably~ it was too much, and I actually got a lesson from Sarashina-senpai....?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika, who couldn&apos;t swallow his own saliva, was forced to explain the situation. Instantly, Alisa&apos;s gaze narrowed and Maria&apos;s smile deepened. In addition, both of their fingers gripped his shoulders tightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, then, I need to catch up with Sarashina-senpai first to make sure that she&apos;s not overdoing it...&quot;</p>

<p>After telling that, the grip of the two of them did not loosen at all. After that, they both lectured him severely. Even though he wasn&apos;t really involved with the incident.</p>

<p>(Hah, well, that&apos;s okay... A man is something that does not ask for something in return...)</p>

<p>While sitting on his knees before the two of them, Masachika looked out the window with distant eyes. How nice it was to be able to see the beautiful constellation of stars with two beautiful sisters, while sitting on their knees, today......</p>

<p>&quot;Masachika-kun! Did you hear what I said!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuze-kun, you must contemplate this properly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>.....Seems to be a bad day. It&apos;s not good to keep running away from reality.</p>

<p>A few days later, the topic of the Seven Mysteries at school dropped in less than a week, as the results of the Seven Mysteries investigation were disseminated through the student council contacts.</p>

<p>As for the most talked-about ghost story of the &quot;red schoolgirl&quot;, they announced it with half-joking sentences like &quot;Vice Chairwoman Sarashina has exterminated it&quot;, and strangely... the students accepted it quite normally.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not like this one is more suitable to be the Seven mysteries, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</p>

<p>After watching the whole story, the two siblings muttered whether it really existed or not.</p>
