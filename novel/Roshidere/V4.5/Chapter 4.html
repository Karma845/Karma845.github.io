<h3>Chapter 4 - Brocon and Siscon</h3>



<p>&quot;Hah, finally home...&quot;</p>

<p>A man in a polo shirt stood in front of a Japanese-style house. He had a tall straight back and a fairly fit physique. The look in his gentle eyes was that of an intelligent and kind middle-aged man with an atmosphere that made people who confronted him feel comfortable. Although his hairline looks a little suspicious. But don&apos;t ever bring it up because it&apos;s something he&apos;s worried about.</p>

<p>The man&apos;s name is Kuze Kyotarou. He is the father of Masachika and Yuki who had just returned to Japan from his diplomatic duties after many years.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s been a long time since visited here....&quot;</p>

<p>Kyotarou raised his head slightly, which was a little heavy due to jet-lag, and mumbled emotionally in front of his parents&apos; house, which he had not visited for a year. Then, as he opened the gate and stepped inside the yard, a large white dog sleeping in the doorway of the house suddenly woke up.</p>

<p>&quot;Long time no see, Rir. Do you still remember me?&quot;</p>

<p>The dog named Rir approached Kyotarou lazily, sniffed him and then whimpered.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, yoshi, yoshi.&quot;</p>

<p>While stroking his head, Kyotaro smiled a little and wondered &quot;Will he be able to fulfill the role of guard dog at this rate?&quot;</p>

<p>This dog was a male stray that Masachika and Yuki had picked up three years ago. To be more precise, Yuki found a puppy with an injured hind leg and suggested rescuing him, which Masachika agreed to, and they together brought him back to their grandparents&apos; house. This sounds like a beautiful story that makes one smile, but...what Yuki was actually saying at that moment was...</p>

<p>There&apos;s an injured white puppy, it&apos;s definitely a teenage Fenrir! Let&apos;s take him home and make him our servant! J</p>

<p>that&apos;s how it really happened. As a result of Yuki&apos;s wish, the former stray dog changed his name to Rir. The expectations placed on the injured puppy were too heavy.</p>

<p>After all, three years had passed since then, and although he had grown up, Rir still didn&apos;t show any signs of resembling a holy wolf. Instead, there was a feeling that he was becoming more and more lazy as time passed.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too heavy expectations were stunting her growth. But if he returned to the wild, he would soon die.</p>

<p>&quot;Geez, who do you look like anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>Kyotarou watched Rir&apos;s back as he slipped back near the door of the house, and said to himself with a wry smile. Then, after regaining his composure, he went to the front door, opened it, and called out to the back of the corridor that stretched straight at the end.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m home~!&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately after that, the sliding door on the left side of the corridor opened and Yuki appeared.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, father is home. Welcome back~!&quot;</p>

<p>Then, with a big smile, she ran up to Kyotarou and hugged him. Kyotarou closed his eyes and looked at the ceiling as he felt deeply touched by his daughter&apos;s unchanging expression of affection.</p>

<p>(Oh, my daughter is the sweetest girl in the world!!)</p>

<p>He had heard that fathers in the world often felt saddened by the fact that their daughters dislike them when they reach their teenage years, but...... there was no sign of that with his beloved daughter. The lack of rebelliousness worried him a little, but it was just a trivial matter of facing this adorable face of hers. Kyotarou returned the hug lightly, his cheeks relaxing in the arms of his beloved daughter.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m home, Yuki. You... have grown up, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? What does the pause mean?&quot;</p>

<p>When she calmly looked at Yuki&apos;s height and slightly muttered, Yuki immediately smiled at him.</p>

<p>&quot;No... I feel that your height hasn&apos;t changed much, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t this size just right! Doesn&apos;t this size that fits my arm look even cuter!&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki, who seemed to have no complex with her own physique, made strong arguments like a thug. Kyotarou, who was a little worried about his daughter&apos;s growth, had no choice but to nod at his daughter&apos;s adorable statement.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, well... it&apos;s true, Yuki is really cute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right, isn&apos;t it~?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki immediately looked proud and snorted &quot;Ehem~&quot; while crossing her arms across her chest. Masachika and Tomohisa then appeared from the other side.</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome back, father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you&apos;re back, huh? Kyotarou!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I returned a moment ago.&quot;</p>

<p>After exchanging a brief greeting, Masachika soon returned to the room.</p>

<p>Compared to Yuki&apos;s enthusiastic greeting, this one was very simple indeed.</p>

<p>(Yes... my son is still acting as ignorant as ever)</p>

<p>Although Kyotarou felt a little saddened by his son&apos;s indifferent attitude after not seeing each other for the first time in a while, he thought that such a reaction was normal for a teenager of his age.</p>

<p>(While on the other hand...)</p>

<p>&quot;What about England? Are there many beautiful women there? Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Dad still can&apos;t calm down like he used to.&quot;</p>

<p>Kyotarou&apos;s gaze turned soft as his father approached him while putting on a flirtatious smile. He thought that a father in his old age would not usually look like this.</p>

<p>&quot;Geez, Ojii-san, is that the first thing you ask your own son when he comes home after so long? Welcome home, Kyotarou-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m home, mom.&quot;</p>

<p>Kuze Asae, Kyotarou&apos;s mother, came out from behind with the same dumbfounded expression on her face like Kyotarou. Although both his wife and son were staring at him dumbfounded, Tomohisa did not seem to respond and raised her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you talking about! When a man sets foot in a foreign land, what else is he supposed to do but taste local wine and beautiful women!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dad&apos;s not an alcoholic...&quot;</p>

<p>Kyotarou&apos;s expression grew even more dumbfounded, but he kept his mouth shut when he saw his mother&apos;s surprised smile turn into a frightening smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Ojii-san......?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You say that as if you do it often...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No, that&apos;s not true at all, really? I&apos;m only loyal to Asae-san...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Ojii-chan, Ojii-chan used to say that foreigners are different, and their hips have a nice shape, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!? No, I meant Westerners... that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch, ouch, geez Ojii-san, you had to teach that to Yuki-chan? Wah, wah, wah....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, no, Asae-san?&quot;</p>

<p>Tomohisa hurriedly chased after Asae, who was retreating backwards with an unpleasant smile on her face. Kyotarou was half relieved and half dumbfounded as he saw his parents&apos; behavior was the same as usual. Yuki then turned around and said with a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;So, what about it? Are there beautiful blonde women with an extraordinary style?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yuki got curious too... Well, let me put my luggage first for now.&quot;</p>

<p>With a wry smile on his face, he left from the front door and entered the Japanese-style room on the left, and placed his luggage in the corner of the room. Meanwhile, Yuki clung to Kyotarou&apos;s back, and continued to pester him to talk about beautiful English woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, did you see a maid? England is the home of maids, right? Don&apos;t you have a photo of a real maid?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did see one... but I didn&apos;t see that kind of young maid, really? Instead of a maid, there&apos;s an ordinary nanny...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehhh~~? Aren&apos;t there any beautiful blonde maids who are boing-boing, like that~~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t think something like that exists...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What the~, so boring. Oryaaaa~&quot;</p>

<p>While complaining, Yuki threw herself at the feet of Masachika who was playing a smartphone game on the seat.</p>

<p>&quot;Ouchh, it hurts, what the heck?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ora, ora, even though dad has already come home, you still keep on playing with your smartphone.&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki pointed her fist at Masachika&apos;s stomach who was staring at her while raising his smartphone up.</p>

<p>(As usual, they still look close)</p>

<p>Kyotarou watched the scene with a smile. He had heard that siblings of the same age often did not talk to each other or look at each other, even when they were at home. But there were no such signs between the two of them.</p>

<p>Instead, perhaps because they usually lived apart from each other, when they were together, they got along as if they were true friends.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh my god.&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika raised his eyebrows, then put down his smartphone while grabbing Yuki&apos;s fist to stop her, as if he had something in mind. Then Yuki quickly picked up his smartphone and directly operated the screen while lying on Masachika&apos;s thigh.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you&apos;ve already reached chapter 5. You&apos;ve done well without paying~.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t just play with other people&apos;s smartphones willy-nilly!? Did you forget your own words earlier?&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: I think this is a reference to an earlier chapter in volume 4)</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? Which one? What about foreigners having a different pelvis, so their hips have a nice shape?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know! Anyway, what&apos;s up with that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haaa! Does that mean Alya-san and Masha-san too...? I&apos;ll have to check this out at the upcoming training camp!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean &apos;I have to check it&apos;, you cretin!? Hurry up and give me back my smartphone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No way~&quot;</p>

<p>When Masachik a tried to snatch back his smartphone, Yuki turned 90 degrees with difficulty and took a kneeling position facing Masachika&apos;s stomach.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t say that, even Aniki is looking forward to it, right? Alya-san&apos;s appearance and Masha-san in their swimsuits~♡&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t write the word &quot;&quot; on the thigh!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Too bad! It&apos;s &quot;q&quot; not &quot;&quot;!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t really care!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? You don&apos;t really care~? Come on, don&apos;t be so stubborn... You really look forward to it when you think of the two of them in their swimsuits, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I really don&apos;t care that much...I mean, seriously, I&apos;m not really looking forward to it, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fumu, it looks like your crotch doesn&apos;t stand out, guhaaaa-!?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki was hit on the temple with an elbow blow and groaned in pain on the tatami mat. While sitting in front of the table, Kyotaro was impressed by the scene and then suddenly thought.</p>

<p>(No, aren&apos;t they... too close?)</p>

<p>Rather than looking like close friends, their conversation sounded like one of a &quot;baka-couple&quot;. Overhearing the conversation that seemed to show their intimacy made Kyotarou want to comment &quot;Eh, you two are dating, huh?&quot; with a flat face.</p>

<p>(TN:</p>

<p>(No, no, it can&apos;t be true. It&apos;s not like in the manga anyway...)</p>

<p>How could that kind of thing happen to my children? .....While shaking his head, Kyotarou casually opened his mouth to remove the thought.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, do you guys have a significant other?&quot;</p>

<p>In response to Kyotaro&apos;s question, Masachika looked at him with a suspicious look, and Yuki looked up slightly while holding her head.</p>

<p>&quot;I still don&apos;t have one... Didn&apos;t I say that last time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I still don&apos;t have one. Besides, I have no intention of getting a boyfriend.&quot;</p>

<p>(Hmmm~~?)</p>

<p>No, well, he had expected it. Because he often exchanged messages with both of them, and they had said that too. However, the only thing that bothered him was Yuki&apos;s comment that &quot;she has no intention to find a boyfriend.&quot;</p>

<p>(I heard that even middle schoolers are used to having boyfriends nowadays..)</p>

<p>With Yuki&apos;s cuteness, I&apos;m sure there are a lot of guys asking her out? No, of course I don&apos;t want her to date just any guy!)</p>

<p>While Kyotarou was thinking about this, Yuki, who had recovered, began to approach him in a crawling position. Then, she looked at Kyotarou with a smile grin that looked similar to Tomohisa&apos;s.</p>

<p>&quot;So, what about you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The conversation earlier! Did you meet a beautiful blonde woman? Diplomats often attend parties, right? Did you not get introduced to a nice young lady from the British government~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That story, yes... no, well, there are some beautiful people I met, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, Kyotaro sometimes attended parties accompanied by his partner because of his position as a diplomat. In some cases, he would ask his female junior to act as his partner, but mostly he attends alone. On such occasions, it was not unusual for someone to tell him something like, &quot;Oh, are you single? Then how about my daughter?&quot; However, Kyotaro took it as mere pleasantries and didn&apos;t take it seriously.</p>

<p>When he summarized all that, Yuki only replied &quot;Hee~~?&quot; with a tone that was filled with doubt.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that really just a pep talk~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course. That guy&apos;s daughter is in her mid-twenties, you know? It&apos;s obvious that he was just joking.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, it&apos;s not like he had never been in a strange situation with that woman while drunk. Kyotarou suspected that it might be one of the &quot;honey trap&quot; tactics, given the fact that a major international conference was just around the corner. By the way, fortunately at that time, he was saved thanks to his junior, whom Kyotarou always asked to act as his partner, who rushed to the scene.</p>

<p>Afterwards, that junior of his warned him,</p>

<p>&quot;Since Kuze-san is weak to alcohol, please be more careful with those kinds of people!&quot;</p>

<p>Since then, that junior of his accompanied him more often than before as a countermeasure to the honey trap, but...... Kyotarou thought it was his younger and prettier junior who should be more wary of honey traps.</p>

<p>(Well, since she&apos;s a strict person and I&apos;m sure that she wouldn&apos;t discuss sensitive information with others during her assignment...)</p>

<p>While thinking about that, he simply said, &quot;No one wants a middle-aged man who has children,&quot; because it wasn&apos;t something he would talk to her daughter about. That was his true intention, and even if there was a woman who was interested in him, Kyotarou had no intention of remarrying. However, Yuki did not seem to be discouraged and continued to approach.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, how about a beautiful widow? Are there no beautiful widows who have children?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh~? Hmm~ well, think there was one like that, a French diplomat met at that conference...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is, huh?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A beautiful woman from France!&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki&apos;s excited voice overlapped with Masachika&apos;s tsukkomi.</p>

<p>&quot;No, well, it seems she also left her daughter in her country to work, too, you know, so we just chatted for a while, that&apos;s all and nothing more, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>Kyotarou said this to calm down Yuki who was excited about something, but then Yuki suddenly narrowed her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;But, you said &quot;there is&quot;, not &quot;there was&quot;, right? Does that mean you&apos;re still having some kind of interaction with that woman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh!? No...&quot;</p>

<p>Kyotaro unconsciously held his breath at the suddenly sharp point of view. Then came another follow-up from his son who was sitting nearby.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it possible that it&apos;s the person I sent the otaku stuff to about half a year ago?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!? Uh, y-yes, is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Ahh~~! That letter from back then!&quot;</p>

<p>Kyotarou looked away for no reason because of his two children&apos;s correct guesses. In fact, the daughter of the French diplomat seemed to be fond of Japanese otaku culture, and she asked if she could get otaku goods of a certain kind of work through her mother.</p>

<p>The letter was written in awkward Japanese, exuding a trace of effort that was extraordinary. The diplomat&apos;s daughter&apos;s enthusiasm was so great that he could not refuse her request, and Kyotarou sent the request to Masachika.</p>

<p>In addition, the items were not too difficult to obtain in Japan, so Masachika accepted his father&apos;s acquaintance&apos;s request. Then, an enthusiastic message of thanks was conveyed through his father, so Masachika and Yuki still remember it too.</p>

<p>&quot;Nufufu~ Dad, you can&apos;t lie to me, you know~? It turns out that Father is still interacting with that French diplomat~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I told you that&apos;s not the case. As a thank you, we&apos;re just been having dinner, okay? First of all, as representatives of our respective countries, we always try to find each other&apos;s true intentions--&quot;</p>

<p>Kyotarou made that excuse, but Yuki&apos;s grin did not stop at all.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh it doesn&apos;t matter, right~? Diplomats from different countries can fall in love with each other, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it&apos;s not forbidden, but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No problem, right~? You can remarry a beautiful blonde and send your stepdaughter, a beautiful French girl, to this place for no particular reason, that&apos;s fine, isn&apos;t it? Onii-chan and the beautiful blonde girl who suddenly became his half-sister started living together within three seconds after their first meeting, right~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that a light novel plot?!&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: I was going to say the same thing)</p>

<p>Masachika took out a tsukkomi from behind to Yuki who was in otaku mode.</p>

<p>However, Yuki ignored him and urged Kyotarou to ask for more information.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, how old is the daughter of the French Diplomat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, if I&apos;m not mistaken she once said she was 14 or 15 years old?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hou~? In other words, a little sister, huh? wonder if there will be a war between me and her?! Onii-chan, between me and her, who would you choose?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you say so, you will definitely get along with that girl, alright.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then, a fierce romantic comedy battle over Onii-chan between the blonde half-sister and the silver-haired classmate will begin!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t start it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Silver-haired classmate? Is she not the girl that you were talking about the other day, umm her name if I&apos;m not mistaken...&quot;</p>

<p>As Kyotarou groped his memory and muttered a little, the sliding door of the room suddenly opened with a bang. Looking in that direction, Tomohisa, who looked exhausted, stood with a sweet smile.</p>

<p>&quot;You mean Kujou Alisa-san, right! What, have you made any progress? Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>Then, while saying the correct answer, he rushed into the room.</p>

<p>&quot;No... because nothing happened as you expected.&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika looked away while grimacing in disgust at the curious gazes of his father and grandfather. But then, Yuki immediately revealed the gossip story.</p>

<p>&quot;Onii-chan said he did his summer homework with that girl. At home, just together, for days!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoho~!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hee~ you&apos;re not bad, huh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I told you that I only did my summer homework...&quot;</p>

<p>While becoming increasingly fed up with the three people who were blatantly increasing their tension, Masachika reasoned that he wasn&apos;t doing anything out of the ordinary. However, his little sister wouldn&apos;t stop at that.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s the defendant&apos;s defense, but what&apos;s the reality? The last time I went to Onii-chan&apos;s room-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who are you calling the defendant?!&quot;</p>

<p>Without caring about Masachika&apos;s tsukkomi, Yuki put her hand on the side of her mouth as if telling a secret, and leaned her body towards Kyotaro and Tomohisa. Then, after successfully attracting the interest of both of them, she then grinned and dropped a bombshell.</p>

<p>&quot;I found Alya-san&apos;s silver hair on Onii-chan&apos;s bed! Kyaa~ I wonder what they were up to, huh~?! Are they studying the reproduction chapter~!?</p>

<p>&quot;Hoho~ that can&apos;t be ignored~? Hmm? Did you study hard? Did you fulfill your credits and graduate?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t do that! Don&apos;t just jump to conclusions! It&apos;s disrespectful to Alya too!&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika refuted Tomohisa&apos;s vulgar remarks. Yuki then placed her hand on his shoulder with a gentle face.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand, really. Because Onii-chan is a cowardly virgin who doesn&apos;t have any guts, so you don&apos;t dare to touch Alya-san, right? Yup, I understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Are you asking for a fight, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s impossible. I&apos;m on your side, aren&apos;t I? Therefore, I will help you to get closer to Alya-san at the upcoming training camp camp, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You interfere too much, you know&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For the time being, which would you prefer, Alya-san&apos;s swimsuit getting washed away by the waves or the two of you stranded on an uninhabited island?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of idiot are you? Of course I&apos;ll choose both.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, then, I&apos;ll get Alya-san&apos;s swimsuit washed away, and then leave Onii-chan and the Chairman stranded on an uninhabited island, huh~~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute. What&apos;s with that horrible situation?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Because I didn&apos;t say that Aniki and Alya-san would be stranded on the island...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it, I didn&apos;t expect to fall into this rudimentary trap... No, where did the request for that come from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are requests among fujoshi. Then, there was a request from people who didn&apos;t want some bastard to get into the sight of girls frolicking in swimsuits.&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: fujoshi = female yaoi fan)</p>

<p>&quot;Huh, so they mean me, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So that&apos;s how it is. If Onii-chan wants to blend in too, you have to turn into a woman first, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: That&apos;s not possible. Yes I just said what I said, cope.)</p>

<p>&quot;That &apos;first&apos; hurdle alone is very difficult.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry. Even if you&apos;re just an ordinary guy at first, you&apos;ll become a beautiful girl when you take on a female form.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if that&apos;s the case, how are you going to explain it to the other student council members?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess I have no choice but to introduce you as my cousin, Kuze Masachika-chan*, right?&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: In the raws, the Kanji here is written different but it&apos;s still read as &quot;Masachika&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;You have no intention of changing my name!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry! Because I&apos;ll call you Chika-neechan!&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing Yuki trying to help his brother&apos;s love life while joking, Kyotarou felt his worries begin to dissipate.</p>

<p>(What the heck... I guess did think about it too much.)</p>

<p>Thinking that these siblings were in an illicit love affair was a ridiculous and absurd fantasy. Kyotarou felt ashamed of himself for making such a malicious guess, even if only for a moment.</p>

<p>(The two of them are just very close siblings. Yeah, isn&apos;t that something adorable?)</p>

<p>While thinking back to that, Kyotarou warmly watched them together with Tomohisa... At the end of their sight, Yuki was hugging Masachika&apos;s back. Both their arms and legs were tightly entwined.</p>

<p>&quot;Is something wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, for some reason... since I&apos;ve already hugged father, so I thought should hug Onii-chan too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Instead of hugging, it&apos;s like riding a piggyback... plus, you&apos;re heavy, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Did you just tell a girl that she&apos;s heavy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did I say that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You bastard!!!&quot;</p>

<p>While shouting angrily, Yuki opened her mouth and bared her teeth, she then aimed for Masachika&apos;s neck...</p>

<p>&quot;Bite bite&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t bite, don&apos;t bite!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm I think it&apos;s around rank A2~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm! It feels so hard to comment on it... you can at least tear it up if it&apos;s F1 rank.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s no such thing as F1. It&apos;s not a car anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, that&apos;s something already knew. But most of the ones like this are usually F-ranked, right? Something like &apos;My sister teases me for having an unrivaled F rank in the school cafeteria&quot;?&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: I have no idea what these alphabets mean. I&apos;m sorry. If someone knows please feel free to tell me)</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s more or less like that... wait a minute, did you say school cafeteria?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, that was just a subheading, and the main title is &apos;Reincarnation of Beef&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not like it&apos;s going to be eaten! What kind of work is that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The main character reincarnates as a Minotaur in another world, cooks himself in the school cafeteria that was hit by a food shortage, and made the heroine take off her clothes while saying &apos;Yummi~!&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t think that you can get people to read it just by taking off pretty girls&apos; clothes, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, by the way, all the heroines are monster trolls.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a disgusting image!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you talking about? It&apos;s a touching work in which two different species understand each other through the joy of eating, a joy common to all living things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would be touching if it didn&apos;t have the element of cannibalism.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At the end of the story, when the main character gives his remaining right hand to the headmaster&apos;s granddaughter and says with a sad smile, &apos;Ah, guess I can&apos;t cook anymore&apos; you won&apos;t be able to hold back your tears, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only psychopaths would read such a work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And in the end, the main character repays the sister who mocked her with the best dish ever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that the worst kind of revenge?!!! That&apos;s disgusting!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, since her sister is also both a Minotaur and a herbivore, she can&apos;t eat that dish.&quot;</p>
