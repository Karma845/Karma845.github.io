<h3>Chapter 9 - Merciful and Ore-sama</h3>



<p>&quot;I wonder if hypnosis will work on Onii-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>One day during summer vacation. While sitting on the bed in her room with a book on hypnosis in her hand, Yuki suddenly mumbled the words.</p>

<p>The title of the book was &quot;Anyone Can Learn Hypnosis~ Starting Today, You Are Also A Hypnotist!~&quot;. It was the book that had once caused the incident in the student council room. After that said incident, Yuki promised Masachika that the hypnotism described in this book would be sealed forever, but...... why would Yuki let go of this kind of interesting thing just like that since she had failed once.</p>

<p>She bought the book with her own money, and from then on she had tried out various hypnosis techniques on Ayano as her guinea pig. Ayano, who had reached the maximum level of loyalty and would obey any order without the need for hypnosis, could not be used as a good example. When Yuki thought, &quot;I want to try it with other people too-but if it&apos;s with a friend and it fails, it&apos;s a bit awkward~&quot; and at that moment the existence of Masachika appeared in her mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Nee~ What do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nyaan?&quot;</p>

<p>When asked by Yuki, Ayano, who was curled up with her head on her thigh, raised her face. She looked at Yuki&apos;s face with curious eyes and pushed her bangs away from her eyes when she woke up.</p>

<p>&quot;Aaahh....&quot;</p>

<p>She made a dazed sound, and Yuki raised both her hands and tried to clap her hands with a pyaak sound... then, Ayano suddenly stopped moving.</p>

<p>Then, she looked at Ayano, who was sitting in a typical &quot;girl sitting style&quot; on the bed, and suddenly rubbed her breasts.</p>

<p>(TN: Basically sitting kinda kneeling ish? But in the way where her legs are to the side and where her thighs and butt are touching the surface of the ground.)</p>

<p>&quot;Mu, mumu? Have they... grown a little?&quot;</p>

<p>Tilting her head and looking at Ayano curiously, Yuki rubbed Ayano&apos;s breasts with a serious expression on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;O-O-Ohhhh~? Uwooohhh~ it&apos;s growing well.... It feels so soft and supple ....&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki pushed Ayano&apos;s breasts from below and sounded rather impressed. After that, Yuki spent a few minutes admiring Ayano&apos;s breasts before clasping her hands together in satisfaction. Then instantly, Ayano&apos;s movements stopped for a moment. She then blinked slowly and tilted her head.</p>

<p>&quot;...Did you succeed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, everything worked out without any problems on the target&apos;s behavioral changes... So do you think this will work on Onii-chan too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To Masachika-sama? ...I guess that&apos;s pretty difficult?&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano tilted her head, seemingly not too bothered by the fact that she had just been hypnotized into a cat. Yuki then responded with a shrug.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. It is a common belief that the hypnotist will acquire resistance to hypnosis... Oops, guess it&apos;s time for violin lessons-.&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Yuki got up from the bed and started preparing for her lessons. lesson. While helping her, Ayano&apos;s lips were tightly sealed as if she had already decided to do something.</p>

<p>◆◆◆◆</p>

<p>A few days later, as Yuki was getting ready to go visit the Kuze residence, Ayano suddenly approached her.</p>

<p>&quot;Yuki-sama.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Regarding the hypnosis matter the other day, .... I&apos;ve prepared some items that might be able to help you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? Hypnosis......?...Ahhh! You mean something that will work</p>

<p>on Onii-chan! You went to all the trouble of preparing something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. If you intend to hypnotize Masachika-sama, I think you might need some tools to strengthen your hypnotic effect.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah~ some kind of enhancement item? That would be helpful, indeed~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ve been researching various things regarding that... and first of all, this thing.&quot;</p>

<p>While saying that, Ayano took out a dark pink candle from her maid&apos;s shirt pocket.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s said to be an aromatic candle that can calm the mind and make one easier to hypnotize.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that what often appears in erotic doujinshi!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then next,... this one.&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano operated her smartphone and passed it to Yuki. The screen displayed a suspicious image with a wavy effect around large eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;...What is this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It looks like it&apos;s a hypnosis app.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that what also often appears in erotic doujinshi!?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki repeated the same tsukkomi, and then Ayano took out,... some kind of rough collar necklace.</p>

<p>&quot;...What is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems to be a collar that forces the wearer to obey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that something that often appears in isekai fantasies! Well, you intend to put that kind of thing on Onii-chan!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I hope I can wear this for you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don&apos;t need it anyway, do you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see...yes...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oi, why do you look so disappointed?&quot;</p>

<p>With her head starting to feel dizzy and putting a hand on her forehead, Yuki looked at the collar that was strangely shaped and sticky. The collar had several objects similar to colorful power stones attached to it, giving it a strange presence that made the collar not look like an item for a joke.</p>

<p>&quot;First of all... where did you get all these objects that look suspicious?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, that... the other day when I went shopping, I was approached by a hooded street vendor... Although I didn&apos;t say anything, he gave me this and said that I didn&apos;t have to pay for it</p>

<p>&quot;Oops? Apparently it&apos;s not an isekai fantasy, but modern occultism? Don&apos;t use that once, okay? If according to the sect, the person who wears it will somehow inexplicably break and the street vendor will laugh at him while saying something like, &apos;Humans are indeed stupid creatures...&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a moment. Isn&apos;t that a scented candle too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For this one, I bought it from a 100 yen store.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously, you. The 100-yen store is a one-stop shop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I bought it for 200 yen, though...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that a little expensive? How come?&quot;</p>

<p>After throwing out all her tsukkomi, Yuki realized that Ayano looked a bit discouraged.</p>

<p>(Ah... maybe I said it too much. Even though she went to the trouble of preparing it for me...)</p>

<p>Contemplating that in her heart. Yuki lightly cleared her throat,</p>

<p>and opened her mouth as she turned her attention to the candles.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, but... how about we give it a try? The candle and the app.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;! Yes, with pleasure!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, thank you so much for looking for everything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, this kind of thing is no big deal.&quot;</p>

<p>While laughing at her servant who looked instantly happy, Yuki inwardly smiled wryly &quot;I think a five yen coin with a string is still much more effective...&quot;.</p>

<p>◆◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;There are times when I think like that too.&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki muttered to herself, then her gaze fell on Masachika who was sitting on the bed with blank eyes. Last night, she handed a scented candle to Masachika while saying &quot;a scent that can improve sleep&quot;, after spending the whole night inhaling lots of smoke, Yuki then used the hypnosis app on Masachika who was in a daze...... Unexpectedly, she managed to hypnotize her brother.</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously, here......&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Congratulations. Your hypnosis was successful.&quot; &quot;Ah, yes... ummm, let&apos;s just open the window for now, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, understood.&quot;</p>

<p>When Ayano in maid mode opened the windows and doors leading to the living room, the strangely sweet air in the room faded away as hot air passed through the room. However, even so, Masachika showed no signs of returning to his sanity. He simply stared blankly at a single spot on the floor with a blank expression.</p>

<p>&quot;......Hmmm, what&apos;s up~?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki didn&apos;t know what to do from here because she didn&apos;t expect that her hypnosis would work. However, after cooperating with Ayano, how would she end it with &quot;Since already know that this can work, so let&apos;s end this.&quot;?</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm~~...&quot;</p>

<p>After thinking for a moment, Yuki made an &quot;Aha~&quot; expression as if she got a good idea and started operating her smartphone. Then, while showing the screen that hypnosis app towards Masachika, she began to make suggestions.</p>

<p>&quot;You will become a loving ikemen guy. You won&apos;t be able to control your overwhelming feelings of love!&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, she then tapped the screen and a strange hissing sound came from her smartphone, causing Masachika&apos;s body to jerk. Then, as his eyes gradually came into focus... Masachika suddenly smiled sweetly at Yuki.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello Yuki... You look cute today, too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uwaahh so dirty.&quot;</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/DrwwNFp/u67551-cd27eb22-1272-486b-8f17-c9d6ff5d1cd0.jpg">

<p>Yuki was shocked, and immediately made a scathing comment. Masachika, who seemed unperturbed by his sister&apos;s shocked state, began to turn his attention to Ayano.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayano looks cute, too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;T-Thank you very much?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu, what&apos;s wrong with you, you look so strange... oya?&quot;</p>

<p>Then Masachika suddenly realized something and got up from the bed, then gently grabbed Ayano&apos;s black hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, your hair here is tangled, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, f-forgive me! For showing such an embarrassing appearance...&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika gently placed his right hand on Ayano&apos;s cheek. Then, when he gently made Ayano look up, he whispered sweetly with a warm and affectionate smile.</p>

<p>&quot;You don&apos;t have to worry about that, okay? Because it shows how hard you work... on the contrary, think Ayano can relax a little, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No, that kind of thing...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so? Ayano really is a hardworking girl, huh... Thank you for everything. I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano&apos;s eyes opened wide and almost fell at Masachika&apos;s confession of love who was gently caressing her cheek...</p>

<p>&quot;Fuhyuu~~~...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A-Ayano!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oops!&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika quickly supported Ayano, whose knees looked weak and eyes were foggy. Then, in an instant, Masachika picked her up princess-style, and gently laid her down on the bed while caressing her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Fufu, Ayano is really cute.&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Masachika then turned to Yuki as if asking for her approval. But Yuki quickly steeled herself against it. Masachika began to approach her with a sweet smile as Yuki sat back down and held her hand in front of her chest.</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohh, what? Do you intend to do it to me too? If you think that I&apos;m going to be intimidated by a casual confession of love, you&apos;re sadly mistaken, okay? Yes, it&apos;s a big deal if you&apos;re scaring me. Unlike Ayano, I won&apos;t... ahh, wait...&quot;</p>

<p>-- Five minutes later.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you... I love you more than anyone in this world, Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ohyohyohyohyo! What the hell! There&apos;s a strange sound coming out of my mouthhhhh~~~!&quot;</p>

<p>There was the figure of Yuki sitting on Masachika&apos;s cross-legged legs while being whispered to with words of love while being hugged from behind. Sweet words were chanted near her ear as she was gently hugged on her stomach and her hair and cheeks were caressed. Yuki, who couldn&apos;t take it anymore, started moaning and squirming while making strange sounds.</p>

<p>At first, she felt uncomfortable with Masachika who was acting very affectionate, but when he did ikemen-style movements without feeling embarrassed, Yuki felt that everything was useless. After all, it seems to be true that if you feel embarrassed, you are the one who will lose.</p>

<p>&quot;What&apos;s wrong? How come you can&apos;t calm down like that...are you feeling shy, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fueehh, anooo, ummm~ can you stop whispering in my ear? It&apos;s giving me goosebumps...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? Then... why don&apos;t you look over here? I want to talk while looking at Yuki&apos;s beautiful face.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don&apos;t want to~! Because my face is looking weird again right now~~~~!!!&quot;</p>

<p>She stretched her arms and legs forward, wriggling and thrashing. But that still wasn&apos;t enough to escape Masachika&apos;s embrace.</p>

<p>Or rather, his grip was unusually strong despite his soft hands. Yuki could feel Masachika&apos;s strong desire to never let go.</p>

<p>&quot;Ku-Kukuku, that&apos;s okay too. I never thought that you could make me this shy...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu, really? As long as can see Yuki&apos;s cute figure, will say my feelings of love for you over and over again, really? Because I love Yuki more than anything in this world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fuhyaa, you, mugugu, don&apos;t get your hopes up, Onii-chan. If you think that I won&apos;t fight back, you&apos;re very wrong, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>With a fearless smile on her face, Yuki crossed her hands on Masachika&apos;s arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Feel this, Onii-chan! An eye for an eye! Teeth for teeth! Hypnosis for hypnosis! I&apos;ll fight you in my latest new mode that I learned the other day!&quot;</p>

<p>Although she used the words &quot;new&quot; and &quot;latest&quot; at the same time, Yuki did not care about that at all, she curled her body into a ball to increase her aura, and then she pushed her right arm into the sky with all her might.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on! Activate! Angel Mode--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you don&apos;t do that, Yuki is always my angel, really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fueeeaaaaaa&quot;</p>

<p>Arguably, Masachika deliberately destroyed the forbidden transformation. Masachika, who was in doting mode, didn&apos;t wait for the long transformation scene. Yuki, who failed to make the change, became stiff to the point where the aura that was raised with great effort was wasted. Masachika hugged Yuki affectionately and rested his chin on Yuki&apos;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;My angel who always loved her family more than anyone else and always worked hard for her family... I really feel happy to have a little sister like Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohhh...&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki really felt embarrassed by the mercilessly snappy remark during her stiffness, she couldn&apos;t even make a joke. At that moment, a faint voice was heard behind Yuki who was blushing with a flat face.</p>

<p>&quot;U-Ughh... umm...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A-Ayano! You&apos;re awake, aren&apos;t you!? Please help me for a moment!&quot;</p>

<p>Looking over Masachika&apos;s shoulder at Ayano, who had lifted herself up on the bed, Yuki tried to ask for help. However, Ayano turned her gaze rudely to Masachika, who was looking at her in the same way....</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, really... I&apos;m going to prepare breakfast......&quot;</p>

<p>She said quickly and left the room, ignoring the pleas of help from her master.</p>

<p>&quot;A-Ayanooooo, you traitor~!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, hey, you can&apos;t say that, you know? We&apos;re all family, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you not to whisper in my ear!&quot;</p>

<p>Munyaa, Yuki raised her voice with a furious expression while wriggling wildly like a cat.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, to-toilet! I&apos;m going to the toilet!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Is that so? Well then, go ahead.&quot;</p>

<p>In response to Yuki&apos;s words that sounded desperate, Masachika easily let Yuki immediately get up and she hurried to the bathroom. After arriving, she then exhaled a long breath.</p>

<p>&quot;This is really bad....really really bad.&quot;</p>

<p>The sweet behavior of her brother, who had lost his shyness,</p>

<p>made Yuki unable to hide her excitement. It was very different</p>

<p>from an idol video where a handsome man just whispers sweet</p>

<p>words. After all, the words and Masachika&apos;s words and actions</p>

<p>right now were... unmistakably... his true intentions. It was</p>

<p>undoubtedly because Yuki herself hypnotized him with the suggestion, &quot;You won&apos;t be able to control your overwhelming feelings of love!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yikes Oh my, seriously, huhhh~? Onii-chan, you love me too much~~&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki held her cheeks with both hands and wriggled her body while teasing Masachika. If she didn&apos;t do so, she was afraid of losing control of the itchy feeling that attacked her whole body.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn, damn... Onii-chan is really cute.&quot;</p>

<p>After a while of writhing in the bathroom and calming down a bit, Yuki returned to the living room. Once back......</p>

<p>&quot;I like the way Ayano cooks... your hands look so skillful, I can&apos;t</p>

<p>help but be mesmerized when I see it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, ummm...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing, asshole, you guys look like newlyweds!&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki immediately said a tsukkomi as soon as she saw Masachika hugging Ayano from behind while whispering sweet words. However, she did not dare step forward at the thought that her brother&apos;s attention might focus on her again. Yuki gritted her teeth and ventured to step into the kitchen entrance.</p>

<p>While on the other side, Ayano, who was now being coddled by Masachika, was completely frozen with a raw egg in her hand.</p>

<p>Her eyes were rolling around expressionlessly, and her face gradually began to turn red.</p>

<p>&quot;Newlyweds, huh.... Fufu, whoever can marry Ayano must feel lucky. She&apos;s so cute and kind, and can do her housework perfectly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A-Awa, awawawawawa...&quot;</p>

<p>Upon hearing Masachika&apos;s sweet praise, there was a trembling sound that had never been heard from Ayano&apos;s mouth, and her hand holding the egg began to tremble violently. Perhaps sensing the danger that the raw egg would slip out of her hands, Ayano raised her voice tremulously.</p>

<p>&quot;Ma-Ma-Masachika-sama! You can&apos;t do that! The egg, it&apos;s going to drop&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Umm? Ahh... you can&apos;t do that, it&apos;s dangerous, you know. Look, can you hold it properly?&quot;</p>

<p>While saying that, Masachika gently grasped Ayano&apos;s hand that was holding the egg with his right hand, while his left hand held Ayano&apos;s stomach. Immediately, Ayano&apos;s body trembled violently and made increasingly dangerous sounds.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, no! The egg will come out! The egg--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t start getting ready to conceive Onii-chan&apos;s child!!!&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: This sounds so fucking sus man)</p>

<p>Unable to bear it, Yuki stepped into the kitchen and pulled the Masachika from Ayano.</p>

<p>&quot;Hora! Onii-chan should just watch TV! Don&apos;t disturb Ayano from cooking!&quot;</p>

<p>She then forcefully removed Masachika from the kitchen area and looked back at Ayano, who had slumped down at the kitchen table and was still clutching the egg in her hand.</p>

<p>&quot;...So? Can you continue making breakfast?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yes...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t stroke your stomach in a way that makes others misunderstand.&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano stroked her lower abdomen with her flushed cheeks, and Yuki looked at her with a dumbfounded look.</p>

<p>◆◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;...Hmm~~&quot;</p>

<p>After finishing breakfast, Yuki tilted her head when she saw Masachika was watching TV leisurely.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? What&apos;s wrong? Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ve had it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;??&quot;</p>

<p>When Masachika tilted his head with a sweet smile, Yuki said clearly with a sour face. It had been an hour and a half since she had hypnotized her brother to be an affectionate ikemen. She had gotten used to his sweet words and deeds. Or to put it bluntly, it started to become annoying over time.</p>

<p>Even during breakfast, he tried to tease her with &apos;ahhhhh~&apos; and wiped her mouth with a tissue, so naturally Yuki felt stuffed. In a different sense from food.</p>

<p>(Besides, when will he wake up from his hypnosis? Maybe it&apos;s better if I open the window wide, huh...)</p>

<p>Since morning, it was quite hot and sultry today, so she closed all the windows and turned on the air conditioner after ventilating the room sufficiently, but it turned out that there was still a scent of candles still lingering in the air. Even Masachika&apos;s hypnotic state showed no signs of returning to his sanity.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... Maybe it&apos;s time to give another hypnosis~?&quot;</p>

<p>As Yuki fiddled with her smartphone while muttering to herself, Masachika came around the table and hugged her from behind.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing? Are you playing a new game?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, that&apos;s right. Check this out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hm? What the...&quot;</p>

<p>While dismissing her brother&apos;s question, Yuki showed the screen of her smartphone. Then, Masachika&apos;s voice faded quickly and began to stare at the screen without blinking. When Masachika was once again in a state of hypnotic induction, Yuki gave her the next suggestion.</p>

<p>&quot;You will become an Ore-sama-type ikemen guy. You&apos;ll be always confident and acting frivilous. But don&apos;t worry, because the people around you really like you~&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that carelessly, Yuki then tapped on the screen, then a strange a strange hissing sound came out from her smartphone, and Masachika&apos;s arm jerked and shook. Then, his eyes gradually came into focus.... and he suddenly lifted her chin with a flash and looked at Yuki with a smug smile on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Oi, oi, even though you&apos;ve been hugged by me, you&apos;re busy playing with your smartphone. You have guts too, huh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uwaah.... this is bad&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki expressed her honest impression with a flat face to her brother who raised her chin while laughing frivolously. Unlike the affectionate type before, this &apos;Ore-sama&apos; type was not too serious in Yuki&apos;s view. After all, it will be over soon. Instead, she felt a little annoyed.</p>

<p>&quot;What&apos;s wrong? Are you pouting because I&apos;m paying too much attention to Ayano?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki couldn&apos;t help but pick up her smartphone as she saw her brother&apos;s increasingly annoying behavior after being hypnotized into the type of &apos;Ore-sama&apos;. Then, just as she started recording, Masachika lifted his body and flicked his bangs while turning around.</p>

<p>&quot;Oi, oi, what&apos;s wrong with you all of a sudden? I understand your feelings of wanting to take a picture of me, but.... If you want to take a picture of me, can&apos;t you do it when I&apos;m a little more fashionable?&quot;</p>

<p>While saying that, Masachika unbuttoned the top button of his shirt, sat on the chair with a thud, and turned his troubled-looking gaze to the lens of Yuki&apos;s smartphone.</p>

<p>&quot;Uwaahh so sly~ ... I mean, isn&apos;t the character &apos;Ore-sama&apos; according to the description of Onii-chan a bit disgusting? I wonder what his reaction will be~ after seeing this when he wakes up?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki smiled cruelly when thinking of such a thing as retaliation for being embarrassed by her brother who was hypnotized into loving brother mode. Since it was Yuki who caused the problem in the first place, it was really a shameless slander. Yuki looked away from the unpleasant truth without the slightest of hesitation.</p>

<p>It took a while for Yuki to photograph her brother in a series of poses. Then suddenly, the sound of the intercom rang softly, and Yuki raised her face. At the same time, she felt a little uncomfortable because Ayano, who was usually ready to answer the call, did not move at all.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayano?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki then took a quick glance to her side, and saw the figure of Ayano who was sitting on the chair with a somewhat dazed expression. Yuki thought that she was just blending into the air but it turned out that she still hadn&apos;t recovered from Masachika&apos;s attacks of affection. Reluctantly, Yuki put down her smartphone and got up from her seat to answer the intercom.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, who is it...?&quot;</p>

<p>She peeked at the intercom screen thinking it might just be a courier.... but Yuki&apos;s body instantly froze when she saw the shadow of the silver-haired girl standing there.</p>

<p>&quot;...Ehh?&quot;</p>

<p>Her brother had never told her that Alisa was coming today. Maybe he forgot? Impossible. First of all, because there was a study session with Alisa yesterday, Yuki deliberately came to stay overnight thinking that she wouldn&apos;t come today. If she planned to come for two days in a row, how could Masachika have forgotten about it. If so, this might be a surprise visit by Alisa herself... but it was still 10:30 in the morning. It was still too early to visit a friend&apos;s house.</p>

<p>(Uh, Alya-san? Uh, why?)</p>

<p>Yuki was immediately in a state of panic, stuck in front of the intercom in an unexpected situation. From behind her, Masachika suddenly stood up quickly. He then stretched his hand over Yuki&apos;s shoulder, and pressed the answer button before she could stop him.</p>

<p>&quot;What&apos;s wrong? Alya.&quot;</p>

<p>[Ah, Masachika-kun? I&apos;m sorry for visiting so suddenly. It seems that I left my smartphone at your house yesterday...]</p>

<p>Yuki was convinced by the reason for Alisa&apos;s sudden arrival. However, at the same time, she then thought....</p>

<p>(For someone who just came to pick up her smartphone, her</p>

<p>makeup is pretty fancy too.)</p>

<p>From a fellow girl&apos;s point of view, Alisa&apos;s outfit clearly seemed to be intentionally shown to the opposite sex. That would be fine if she usually dressed fashionable enough, but it felt like there was something more to it than that.</p>

<p>&quot;No problem, come up then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!!?&quot;</p>

<p>While he was staring at Alisa with a gentle glance at the intercom screen, unexpectedly, Masachika had already opened the apartment gate and invited Alisa, who seemed to feel something strange about Masachika&apos;s way of speaking, entered the apartment without saying anything.</p>

<p>&quot;No, isn&apos;t this serious?&quot;</p>

<p>Muttering that sentence with a flat face, Yuki turned her head quickly. If asked what was serious? First of all, Masachika&apos;s hypnotized state alone was already serious. In addition, the presence of herself and Ayano in the Kuze residence this early would make matters worse. On top of that, Ayano was now wearing a maid uniform, and Yuki herself was wearing loose casual clothes.</p>

<p>She immediately thought of that and had to change clothes first ..... while she was contemplating that and was about to take a step, Masachika started heading towards the front door.</p>

<p>&quot;Ughh~~~~ the hypnosis must be released first!&quot;</p>

<p>After feeling indecisive for a while, Yuki immediately grabbed her smartphone.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayano! Quickly stop Onii-chan... No, hide my shoes and yours first!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;.....Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>As Ayano headed for the front door, Yuki activated her smartphone.</p>

<p>(For the time being, it&apos;s better to hide my shoes and Ayano&apos;s shoes first, and have Onii-chan, who is already awake, to meet Alya-san at the front door...)</p>

<p>While formulating the next plan at high speed, Yuki launched the hypnosis app and activated it...</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, how do release the hypnosis!?&quot;</p>

<p>Not knowing how to release it, Yuki shouted in frustration. Now that it had already come this far, she had no other choice but to try the usual hypnosis release... and just as she was about to do so, the doorbell rang, and Yuki&apos;s body froze.</p>

<p>&quot;Yoo~ she finally came.&quot;</p>

<p>Moreover, after that, she could hear the sound of the front door being opened and Masachika&apos;s voice welcoming Alisa. Faced with the worst situation, Yuki clenched her back teeth tightly......</p>

<p>(~~~~First of all, need to disguise myself first!)</p>

<p>She ran to her own room, took off her ponytail, and changed her clothes as quickly as possible. Then, with a graceful smile on her face, she headed for the front door.... Then her body froze when she saw the scene in front of her eyes.</p>

<p>There, she saw Alisa&apos;s figure cornered against the wall and the tip of her chin lifted by Masachika behind the door. And then there was Ayano who watched the scene without showing any signs of trying to hide.</p>

<p>&quot;No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,...&quot;</p>

<p>For some reason, Yuki tried to interrupt by passing by Ayano who was standing dumbfounded. Masachika then told Alisa with a sadistic smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Come make babies with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, what kind of nonsense are you saying!&quot;</p>

<p>...... Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oooooooeeeiiii!? She said yes!?&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as she replied to Masachika&apos;s &apos;Ore-sama&apos;-style selfish sentence with a straight face, Yuki was almost surprised by Alisa&apos;s unexpected approval. Then, after staring at Alisa&apos;s face with wide eyes, .... Yuki began to understand the situation when realized that Alisa had a blank and hollow expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn! This person is so easy to hypnotize!&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps she was affected by the hypnotic scent that still lingered in the house. Even so, she didn&apos;t expect it to flow near the entrance, but... how susceptible was she to hypnosis? Or perhaps, it had become a habit to be hypnotized by Masachika? While Yuki was pondering that, Masachika walked towards her while putting his arm around Alisa&apos;s waist. Alisa also leaned back in Masachika&apos;s embrace with a dazed expression on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, no... wait a minute, oi.&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki grabbed his shoulder and stopped him with a straight face as Masachika tried to sneak past her and head towards the living room. Then, Masachika glanced at her with a faint smile, and said in a reprimanding tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Yuki... freshen up a bit. Okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want to do, you bastard!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Accompanied by a loud shout, Yuki immediately swung her fist. She mercilessly attempted to punch Masachika&apos;s jaw from his right side and tried to immobilize him. However, before she could hit her target, her wrist was grabbed by someone and was grabbed by someone and stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;Oops, that&apos;s dangerous. I hate girls who don&apos;t listen to me, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell! Come back to your senses, you fucking cheat!!! Ayano! Oni-, Masachika-kun....... Ayano?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki tried to ask for her cooperation after seeing the existence of Ayano, who was standing upright and kept stepping forward in front of Masachika. However, when looking at the look in her eyes, Yuki had a bad feeling.</p>

<p>&quot;Masachika-sama... Yes. I&apos;m going to give birth to Masachika-sama&apos;s child....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You too!!!!!&quot;</p>

<p>When she thought that Ayano always looked absent-minded, it seemed like the scent was slowly working on her as well. As for how that could happen...</p>

<p>(It&apos;s definitely my fault!)</p>

<p>It was none other than Yuki herself who made Ayano&apos;s resistance to hypnotism weaken by often using her as a guinea pig. While feeling worried inwardly, Yuki hurriedly gave orders when saw Ayano trying to lean her body against Masachika.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayano! Sit down!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shit, she won&apos;t stop! Is this the difference in talent!?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki spread out both her hands and stood in front of Masachika while dismissing her hands and shouted in despair. She then glared at Masachika, who was holding Alisa and Ayano in both hands, as if to challenge him.</p>

<p>&quot;The moment I touch your shoulder, you will be released from hypnosis! Listen carefully? Ready? One, two-pyak!&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki told her clearly, then tapped Masachika on the shoulder and shook it as if in prayer. But....</p>

<p>&quot;Yuki... what&apos;s wrong with you, jealous? Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll always be your big brother, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It didn&apos;t work! Ahhhhh damn it, what should do here?&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as she yelled out violently, Yuki felt a grip on her wrist and her body was suddenly lifted into the air. Then Yuki found herself lying on her back in the hallway.</p>

<p>&quot;...Ehh?&quot;</p>

<p>She didn&apos;t feel any pain at all, thanks to her semi-conscious passive attitude and Masachika&apos;s actions that gently knocked her down. But no matter how careless she was, she couldn&apos;t even react until just before she fell to the floor. Yuki felt frightened by that fact, but when she realized that her brother, who had done this, had already turned around and headed for his own room, she hurriedly chased after him.</p>

<p>&quot;O-Oi, seriously, please calm down first, okay? Ecchi hypnosis is not really erotic doujinshi. No, isn&apos;t it weird that the guy is also in a hypnotic state too? No, no, going straight for a threesome on the first experience, isn&apos;t this not the harem route bonus after conquering all the routes multiple times!? If that&apos;s the case, you can only do it after you&apos;ve conquered the individual routes!?&quot;</p>

<p>She grabbed his shoulders from behind and tried desperately to stop him. But unfortunately, Yuki&apos;s small body was just dragged in vain.</p>

<p>&quot;~~~~kuhh! Ahhh, I guess what can do!&quot;</p>

<p>Then, when entering the living room, Yuki let out a desperate voice......</p>

<p>◆◆◆◆</p>

<p>Hmm? Uh, guh! Ow, it really hurts! Ouch, huh, is it because my sleeping position is wrong so it hurts like this?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika groaned from the intense neck pain when he woke up.</p>

<p>&quot;Owwww, it really hurts, why is it...hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>He woke up clutching his neck and realized that somehow he had fallen asleep on his bed in his regular clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;Why... Whoa!?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika looked around the room with questions on his mind and was surprised when she saw Ayano beside his bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? What? What happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m really sorry....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Apologize for what? Uh, wait, I have absolutely no idea what really happened.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Actually...the scented candle I gave to Masachika-sama yesterday was meant to make it easier to hypnotize you...Masachika-sama has been hypnotized by Yuki-sama since this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Hypnotized?...&quot;</p>

<p>In Masachika&apos;s mind, the half-naked figure of Alisa in the student council room reappeared inside his head....and he hurriedly pushed it away. At the same time, Masachika recalled that Alisa had lost her memory during the hypnosis at that time.</p>

<p>&quot;A-Ahhh~... uh, what does that mean? Was hypnotized by Yuki and....experienced memory loss?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.... most likely so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...&quot;</p>

<p>To be honest, Masachika still couldn&apos;t accept the situation he was in, and made an unenthusiastic sound. Actually, it&apos;s not surprising that his reaction was so, because he himself didn&apos;t realize that he had been hypnotized and didn&apos;t remember it</p>

<p>&quot;... Then, for some reason my neck hurts a lot, why is this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s because....I can&apos;t say for sure because my memory is also a little fuzzy...but when Yuki-sama was trying to stop Masachika-sama, she said that she did a wrestling submission move from behind...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>As expected, Masachika still didn&apos;t quite understand the situation.</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, that&apos;s okay. By the way, where is Yuki herself again? I mean, it&apos;s not your fault, so just raise your head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, because I was the one who prepared the aromatic candles and the hypnosis app...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Hypnotic application?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This one...&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Ayano held out her smartphone which displayed an image of large closed eyes, accompanied by a faint and suspicious vibrating sound.</p>

<p>&quot;... What the hell is this? What&apos;s this sound anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, this is a sound wave to release hypnosis? It seems so. By using this and letting the sleeping Masachika listen to this... Oh yeah, regarding Yuki-sama, yes. Yuki-sama, umm, she returned to the Suou residence first...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Umm... I was entrusted with this and had to hand it over to Masachika-sama...&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano very reluctantly held out a folded piece of paper. When opening it, Masachika only found the words &quot;SORRY YA&quot; written there in large letters typical of Yuki&apos;s handwriting. &quot;...What does this mean? No, wait a minute. Trying to stop me?</p>

<p>Uh, did I do something that needs to be stopped?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s... I think you should check it yourself...&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, Ayano glanced at Masachika&apos;s smartphone placed next to the pillow. With a bad feeling, Masachika began to turn on his smartphone, and a row of messages from his senpai from the student council group appeared on the screen.</p>

<p>[Kuze, what&apos;s wrong with you? If you have any problems, I&apos;m willing to hear you out, huh?]</p>

<p>[Kuze-kun, are you okay? Maybe you were possessed by something during the investigation of the Seven Mysteries the other day...]</p>

<p>[No, I think it&apos;s cool, really?]</p>

<p>There were messages from Touya and Maria showing their concern. And a message of comfort from Chisaki.</p>

<p>One step back from there brought up a single video file uploaded by Yuki. When Masachika tapped on it....</p>

<p>Oi, oi, what&apos;s wrong with you all of a sudden? I understand your feeling of wanting to take a picture of me, but.... If you want to take a picture of me, can&apos;t you do it when I&apos;m a little more fashionable? J</p>

<p>&quot;Wha-!?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika was instantly speechless when he saw his own appearance on the screen, which did not resemble him at all. On the screen, he was posing one after another in a narcissistic style. The video was so unbearable that he turned off the screen of his smartphone, but that didn&apos;t change the fact that the video had already been seen by his senpais. Masachika immediately felt his entire body become hot.</p>

<p>&quot;Yu, Yuukii~~... What the.... What have you doneeeee...!&quot;</p>

<p>He gritted his teeth on the bed and desperately endured the embarrassment. And then Masachika suddenly realized. He had yet to receive a message from Alisa.</p>

<p>(In other words, there was still one chance that Alya would see it-- Ah yes, That&apos;s right! Alya forgot to bring her smartphone home yesterday, so she hasn&apos;t seen it yet! In that case, should delete this video before she sees it...!)</p>

<p>The person he least wants to see hasn&apos;t seen this video yet. With a glimmer of hope that suddenly appeared, Masachika ran out of his room, thus forgetting the fact that Yuki had already left.</p>

<p>&quot;Oi! Yuki-&quot;</p>

<p>Then, while jumping out of her room and.... finding Alisa in the living room, flopping on the table and her back trembling slightly, Masachika&apos;s body instantly froze at the sight.</p>

<p>&quot;Uhu, kufuh, fufufufu~~~~!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa buried her face in her left arm and made her back flinch while letting out a slight laugh. In the right hand that was thrown on the table... there was Alisa&apos;s smartphone, which should be on Masachika&apos;s desk.</p>

<p>Oi, Oi, more photos again kukuku... Ahh, see. You want to see me with your own eyes, and not through the lens of your smartphone, right? Kuhh, what can do... J</p>

<p>His own voice, which was not like his, was playing on the smartphone. Masachika immediately fell to his knees on the spot.</p>

<p>&quot;Yu-Yuki... Yukii~~~~!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Then, while crawling on all fours, he shouted a voice from the bottom of his stomach.</p>

<p>&quot;What have I done~~~!!!&quot;</p>

<p>The sound of Masachika&apos;s soulful scream was covered with Alisa&apos;s stifled laughter. At that moment, his smartphone vibrated in his hand. A message from Yuki was displayed on the screen, saying, &quot;You&apos;re becoming very popular, huh&quot;.</p>
