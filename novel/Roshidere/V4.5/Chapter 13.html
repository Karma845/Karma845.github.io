<h3>Chapter 13 - Masachika and Alya</h3>



<p>A train traveled through the countryside that stretched as far as the eye could see.</p>

<p>The train ride home on the last day of the student council training camp was filled with a calm atmosphere.</p>

<p>Perhaps due to its rural location and the fact that it was already half past three in the afternoon, there were no other passengers in the main carriage Masachika and the other student council members were traveling in. And there were no conversations amongst the student council members; the only sound that could be heard was the clatter of the moving train.</p>

<p>Perhaps due to the soothing vibrations of the train, Yuki, who was sitting to the right of Masachika, tilted her head and rested her head on Masachika&apos;s shoulder with her eyes closed. Shortly after that, Ayano who was on the other side also looked sleepy as well.</p>

<p>(Well, everyone feels tired, so guess it&apos;s only natural...)</p>

<p>Masachika thought so while leaning his body on the passenger seat. Last night she had stayed up late at the festival, and this morning she had frolicked on the beach for the last time. After lunch, she cleaned and tidied up the villa before taking the train home. So it would be expected if she fell asleep due to exhaustion. It&apos;s okay, but...</p>

<p>(But Yuki, you&apos;re still awake, right?!)</p>

<p>Staring at his sister&apos;s head leaning against him, Masachika lightly pushed Yuki away with his elbow. However .....</p>

<p>&quot;Uuu~~~~n...&quot;</p>

<p>At the moment when Masachika lightly moved his arm to the side, the left arm of Yuki slipped through the open gap and grabbed his arm. Yuki then hugged Masachika&apos;s right arm and carefully positioned her head to return to the sleeping position again.</p>

<p>(What a little sister...)</p>

<p>Masachika&apos;s cheek twitched at his sister&apos;s bold and outrageous decision to sleep on his shoulder. She might indeed be trying to sleep but this overly aggressive sleeping style was clearly very dangerous.</p>

<p>(This is not the right way to sleep unless we&apos;re lovers, you know! You must be deliberately doing this to show off to Alya, right!)</p>

<p>While shouting inwardly like that, Masachika glanced to his left side. Then there was also...</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, come on Masha, move away a little.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa&apos;s arm was also entangled in her sister&apos;s arm as she leaned against her. Masachika&apos;s cheeks twitched as he was stunned, because he didn&apos;t expect there to be someone who was as natural, and did the same thing, as Yuki.</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh&quot;</p>

<p>Soon after, Alisa let out a resigned sigh and stopped resisting. Then, after looking at Yuki who was also leaning on Masachika and furrowing her brows for a moment, she then smiled ironically.</p>

<p>&quot;This is really annoying, huh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha, haha...&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika laughed awkwardly at Alisa, who said that while glancing at Maria. Because the sight of Maria&apos;s head moving on Alisa&apos;s shoulder made him recall the events of yesterday morning.</p>

<p>(Y-Yes, delirious Masha-san does look amazing in many ways...)</p>

<p>Recalling the sight of Maria who gracefully fell asleep on top of him, Masachika turned to face forward guiltily.</p>

<p>As someone who had realized Alisa&apos;s feelings of affection towards himself yesterday, he couldn&apos;t help but feel guilty about the fact that he and her sister had shared the same bed.</p>

<p>(No, I didn&apos;t do anything weird...)</p>

<p>After making such excuses in his heart, Masachika suddenly realized that he was in a situation where he was alone with Alisa.</p>

<p>Of the five people sitting side by side, the other three were (allegedly) sleeping. It&apos;s not an exaggeration to say that it was just the two of them. Then how about the President and Vice-President of the Student Council? If anyone was looking for the two of them, they were sitting in the two-person seats at the very front of the carriage, the only seats facing the direction of travel, and were too busy in their own world.</p>

<p>(E-Ehhh? Isn&apos;t this situation dangerous enough?)</p>

<p>Slowly, a bad feeling began to creep up his spine, and caused Masachika&apos;s cheeks to twitch.</p>

<p>Last night, after the fireworks were over, he joined the other members and kept the kissing incident a secret, then gave a brief explanation that he needed to kidnap Alya for a while as part of the game&apos;s punishment.</p>

<p>(TN: The game being referred to here was the takoyaki Russian roulette)</p>

<p>After that, Touya and Chisaki continued to tease them, then Yuki politely bombarded him with questions, so they didn&apos;t have a chance to be alone together.</p>

<p>Today it was somehow difficult for them to see each other, so he didn&apos;t dare to be alone with her... and this was the first time he was in a situation alone with Alisa since that time. Then, the topic was naturally about...</p>

<p>&quot;The fireworks last night... They were beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>(It was definitely about that, wasn&apos;t it!)</p>

<p>Masachika felt his stomach churn at the expected topic of conversation.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes. It was indeed beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>But Alisa didn&apos;t say anything to Masachika&apos;s obviously unenthusiastic tone. Perhaps that was only natural, since what she really wanted to talk about wasn&apos;t fireworks.</p>

<p>Masachika knew that, and as a man, he also understood that he could not run away from her. But right now, this was not the right time. Because there was only one reason.</p>

<p>(Yuki, this little sister, I&apos;m sure she&apos;s still awake!)</p>

<p>As long as there was his younger sister who could eavesdrop freely, the topic was very serious. Super duper serious. Never ever bring up the topic of kissing, even if it&apos;s wrong. Never..........</p>

<p>&quot;So, ummm...&quot;</p>

<p>(Sooner or later, that talk is likely to be mentioned!)</p>

<p>Masachika inwardly shouted at Alisa, who averted her eyes as if she was at a loss for words. Then, after wracking his brain in an instant, Masachika decided to be a dense guy who couldn&apos;t read the atmosphere with all his might.</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of fireworks! Are there fireworks displays too during the festival in Russia?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? Ah, well... yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heee, is it different from Japanese fireworks?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, ummm, I haven&apos;t really noticed, but... I guess it&apos;s not too different?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? Ah, then, what are the names of the fireworks? All fireworks have pretty interesting names in Japan, but is it the same in Russia?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika&apos;s communication skills immediately improved by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>From the start, Masachika&apos;s speaking ability was much better than Alisa&apos;s. Once you master the flow of the conversation, it&apos;s easy to avoid certain topics.</p>

<p>&quot;.... Hey, are you trying to avoid something?&quot;</p>

<p>However, the results will sting back if you do it blatantly. If she said something like that with furrowed brows and a quivering look in her eyes as if slightly hurt, Masachika would have no choice but to remain silent.</p>

<p>&quot;You don&apos;t have to try to blatantly avoid it either. It&apos;s not like we both agreed that we would pretend that nothing happened yesterday....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I&apos;m sorry. Can you calm down for a while?&quot;</p>

<p>What the heck.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously, please calm down for a while.&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika raised his left hand with a serious expression and interrupted Alisa&apos;s words.</p>

<p>Then, Masachika suddenly took his cell phone out of his pocket, turned up the speaker volume, and played a video.</p>

<p>Oi, oi, what&apos;s wrong with you all of a sudden? I understand your feelings of wanting to take a picture of me, but.... If you want to take a picture of me, can&apos;t you do it when I&apos;m a little more fashionable? J</p>

<p>&quot;!!?&quot;</p>

<p>Then Masachika-sama&apos;s voice in &apos;Ore-sama&apos; mode sounded from his smartphone. While Alisa&apos;s gaze widened at the video that suddenly played, Masachika looked around to see the reactions of the other three people.</p>

<p>Then, after confirming that there were no particular reactions, he stopped the video.</p>

<p>(TN: 300 IQ move)</p>

<p>&quot;Yup, looks like they&apos;re really all asleep, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-What kind of confirmation was that.&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika nodded in satisfaction, and Alisa, with a very unusual expression on her face, asked him a question as she scratched her cheeks and tried desperately to contain her laughter. Masachika then responded somewhat distantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Because of this video, if you were still awake, you would have reacted, right? You also reacted like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-You dare to say that yourself? Or rather, you&apos;re still keeping it, huh...&quot;</p>

<p>The video shared with the student council members was deleted after he explained the situation: &quot;I tried hypnosis with Yuki and ended up like that&quot;. That&apos;s why the playback of the video this time was really surprising...</p>

<p>&quot;Even though you said that, you actually still have it too, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Of course not. I deleted it properly, it&apos;s fine.&quot;</p>

<p>When he looked at her, Alisa replied with a denying look. But Masachika did not miss the moment when her gaze shook violently for a moment.</p>

<p>(So you&apos;re still keeping it...)</p>

<p>Masachika returned to the topic while feeling the continuing damage to his mental health when reminded of his black history.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, well... I&apos;m sorry. Because I&apos;m still not sure what to say when we are together, so that&apos;s what happened... no, that one sounds like an excuse.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s true that there are reasons like that. But in reality... he did not have the courage to face Alisa&apos;s feelings of love. Because he had no desire to respond to it or be determined to accept it. So it wouldn&apos;t be wrong to say that he was trying to avoid it.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I&apos;m sorry. To be honest, did try to avoid the topic, but it&apos;s not like I&apos;m pretending that it never happened. However... I still can&apos;t sort out my feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>When Masachika looked straight into Alisa&apos;s eyes without messing around and said so sincerely, Alisa&apos;s eyes wavered slightly and turned forward. And then she opened her mouth in a low voice.</p>

<p>&quot;You don&apos;t need to exaggerate it with something like .... sorting out your feelings or something. That incident last night was just .... right, it was kind of like a kiss of grace.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Grace?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. Last night.... you did a lot to cheer up Masha and me, but you were a little down because you messed up, right? So umm, kind of like a consolation prize or something..... even though it didn&apos;t go well, but that kiss just means &apos;I had enough fun and enjoyed it, really&apos;. Got it!?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa gradually moved closer to his face while speaking faster and in an increasingly loud voice that was only getting louder.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, ah yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Honestly, he felt like he could either understand it or not understand it, but Masachika nodded because of the momentum. Or rather, he had to nod his head here because he had a premonition that if he answered &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot;, his stomach would definitely be elbowed.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s a very big reward for me too, yes. That means my efforts were really worth it, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika slightly regretted what he had said, having been prompted to say something a little strange.</p>

<p>&quot;...Hmmph, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa looked sharply at Masachika and turned away with a frown. Then, while glancing at Masachika, she continued in a dull voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Just so you know, I wouldn&apos;t do that to anyone. Yesterday, that situation occurred due to the weight of Yuki-san&apos;s order and the romantic atmosphere of the fireworks display.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, I know that.&quot;</p>

<p>While nodding in agreement, Masachika inwardly thought, &apos;Well, maybe that&apos;s the limit? [I wouldn&apos;t do that with &apos;anyone&apos;] maybe that&apos;s the best she could do to show her good intentions. As for Masachika, who had noticed Alisa&apos;s love for him, he felt somewhat relieved.</p>

<p>(Well, I don&apos;t know if she really didn&apos;t realize it, or maybe she already realized it herself and pretended not to notice, but... she&apos;s still unwilling to admit it honestly, huh?)</p>

<p>Masachika didn&apos;t know which part Alisa liked about him, but for Alisa who had such high self-esteem, how could she admit so easily that she was in love with a slacker like Masachika.</p>

<p>(To be honest, I&apos;m more grateful about that...)</p>

<p>He was still not ready to face Alisa&apos;s feelings of love. So at least until he feels ready, Alisa too.....</p>

<p>{Because I&apos;ll only do that with you}</p>

<p>(... Yup, I wish that you wouldn&apos;t only use Russian when you&apos;re feeling shy-?)</p>

<p>Whether that remark was just a tease, or an expression of her honest feelings... Masachika couldn&apos;t tell the difference at all, so he asked as if it was a given.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, what did you say earlier?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said, &apos;I&apos;ll only do that with you.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohh, hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika was surprised at the completely unexpected answer. When Masachika was stunned, Alisa turned around with an expression that seemed to cover up her embarrassment with dissatisfaction. She then said in a tone as if she was complaining.</p>

<p>&quot;I told you before, didn&apos;t I? won&apos;t do it with anyone. I would feel offended if you think that I&apos;m a girl who&apos;s influenced by the environment and atmosphere, so I&apos;ll tell you firmly... because only with you alone, well, thought I could at least give you a kiss on the cheek, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohh... am I being honored?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I also need to say this firmly, this has nothing to do with romantic feelings or anything like that. I trust you to a certain extent as my partner, okay? I also respect you quite a bit? And most importantly, well, consider you as my closest friend... that&apos;s it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, yes. Thank you?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa&apos;s cheeks turned bright red as she glared at Masachika&apos;s face and said it quickly, she snorted lightly at Masachika who thanked her awkwardly and turned to face forward.</p>

<p>Masachika couldn&apos;t help but giggle at this awkward way of conveying her intentions which was akin to asking for a fight. Somehow, it felt like it described Alisa&apos;s nature.</p>

<p>But, because of that... those words reached his heart.</p>

<p>That statement must have been Alisa&apos;s true feelings. Perhaps Alisa still hadn&apos;t realized her faint feelings of love. However, she was able to convey the answer she found by facing her heart in her own way. While exerting all her courage. With all her ability and sincerity.</p>

<p>(Gosh, what kind of cute creature is this? She looks so adorable)</p>

<p>These thoughts naturally came to his mind when he saw Alisa pouting with the tips of her ears turning red. And he immediately reflected on the ridiculous impression he had made, even if it was only in his mind.</p>

<p>(Huh... that&apos;s really a bad habit of mine. Jumping into playing around, making jokes, and trying to obscure my true feelings)</p>

<p>That&apos;s how Kuze Masachika defended himself. He lost his affection with his mother, lost love with that girl, even lost his pride, and became the Kuze Masachika that he is now. Then without realizing it, he didn&apos;t dare face anyone directly. Always joking, teasing, pretending, and not connecting deeply with anyone.</p>

<p>If he didn&apos;t connect deeply, he wouldn&apos;t feel sad if he lost them.</p>

<p>If he didn&apos;t connect deeply with others... Others will not be able to know this human named Kuze Masachika. If others do not know it, then he does not need to deal with it. To himself, whom he hated so much.</p>

<p>(But... just for now)</p>

<p>Just for now, he needed to face it without trying to avoid it. For the courage and sincerity shown by the girl in front of him... At the very least, he wanted to be sincere for his own sake as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Me too....&quot;</p>

<p>The voice that came out of his throat sounded hoarse and trembling. He said it honestly from the bottom of his heart and conveyed his affection sincerely.</p>

<p>Even though it was just that, it felt very difficult to do. The corners of his mouth smirked to himself and he tried to laugh. The voice in his heart nagged him to make a fool of himself by making jokes like he always did.</p>

<p>He desperately tried to hold it in, and managed to utter the words that got stuck in his throat.</p>

<p>&quot;Me too... since I did it with Alya, I wanted to kiss as well...&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: He&apos;s referring to when he kissed her on the hair)</p>

<p>Hearing Masachika&apos;s words, Alisa turned around and stared at his increasingly pathetic expression she had never seen before.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m sure if it was with someone else, I would have joked around like I usually do and pretend not to know. But because it was you.... for doing it with Alya, I want to return the kiss as well. Well, there&apos;s no way I can just kiss on the cheek, and when asked what my kiss meant, had a little trouble answering... Well, maybe it&apos;s because I got a little carried away too?&quot;</p>

<p>In the end, it ended up being rather silly and a bit of a joke. He intended to speak a little better. Why did the mouth that usually chartered smoothly turn into this?</p>

<p>&quot;...Uuuu, geez. What the hell was that?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa also sounded dumbfounded at Masachika whose voice gradually became slower and sadder. And as Masachika&apos;s face became more and more downcast..... Alisa&apos;s right hand grabbed Masachika&apos;s cheek, and gently pointed him towards her. Then Alisa looked straight into Masachika&apos;s face and laughed happily from the bottom of her heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu, even Masachika-kun can make a face like this, huh?&quot; &quot;...What the hell? What kind of face did I make?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika was sure that his face looked pitiful. That kind of thinking caused him to sound like he was sulking. Immediately, he felt even more embarrassed by his childish reaction.</p>

<p>Masachika slightly averted his gaze in silence. To which Alisa responded with a smile mixed with a hint of mischief.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm right... your face looks pretty cute, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Urgh!&quot;</p>

<p>An evaluation of &quot;cute&quot; that was immediately thrown out bluntly. The smile of the little devil who was staring at him from a close distance made Masachika&apos;s spine feel a sweet shudder. In order to cover it up, he raised his eyebrows with an exasperated face.</p>

<p>&quot;...You must be teasing me, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Although Masachika said it in an upset tone, Alisa did not flinch at all.</p>

<p>&quot;No I&apos;m not, you know? Even so, yes.... I was wondering why you chose to kiss my hair~ but you just felt awkward, right?&quot;</p>

<p>(... No, you&apos;ve also realized it, right. You yourself clearly instigated me with that &quot;You have no guts&quot; taunt)</p>

<p>Masachika opened his mouth in a reproachful manner at Alisa who was trying hard to confirm it.</p>

<p>&quot;Gosh, it&apos;s only natural to feel awkward, right? Even doing it in the hair is still too personal... You yourself must not like having your cheek kissed in a punishment game, right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know~?&quot;</p>

<p>While raising one eyebrow and saying so, Alisa removed her hand from Masachika&apos;s cheek and poked her own cheek with her finger.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/7C78L8d/u67551-de3d2e01-e4d5-4d74-abd4-a29055f77535.jpg">

<p>Masachika gasped when he heard those words. Even his heart felt like it stopped beating for a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;What did you say?&quot;</p>

<p>Even replying with such pleasantries made him wonder if his voice didn&apos;t sound awkward. Even Masachika did not have enough time to analyze whether his expression showed signs of anxiety.</p>

<p>&quot;I just said, &apos;I don&apos;t know know?&quot;</p>

<p>But fortunately, Alisa didn&apos;t seem to care much and lied as usual with a smile. Then, she lowered her right arm, then easily wrapped it around Masachika&apos;s arm and then rested her head on Masachika&apos;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohh...&quot;</p>

<p>After that provocation, Masachika stiffened when his body was allowed to relax too naturally. Whether or not she realized that Masachika was completely at her mercy, Alisa began to make small yawns.</p>

<p>&quot;Fuwaaaahh~, I&apos;m getting sleepy too... Will you wake me up when we get to the station?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...In other words, I can&apos;t sleep?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, are you sure you can sleep this close to me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I don&apos;t think I&apos;m that bold.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa chuckled when she heard Masachika&apos;s words and closed her eyes. In fact, Masachika was so nervous that his words were no joke... However, he tried to rest his body as soon as he realized that Alisa&apos;s attack had ended.</p>

<p>(Haa... this is not very good for my heart)</p>

<p>While facing forward, he muttered to himself inwardly.</p>

<p>The gap between the two of them was quite large due to their mutual teasing as usual. Masachika was sure that half of it was just her banter.... But when realizing that there were feelings of love behind her actions, he wasn&apos;t sure how serious he was about Alisa.</p>

<p>(Geez, I wonder how much she understands what she&apos;s doing)</p>

<p>He looked to his side with a relaxed smile and saw Alisa&apos;s sleeping face which looked very comfortable. The seriousness and alertness that had always appeared on her face were replaced by a comfortable and peaceful face..... A warm but hectic feeling welled up in Masachika&apos;s chest.</p>

<p>The feeling of wanting to protect, cherish, and not wanting to hurt her appeared in Masachika&apos;s mind. This feeling was probably a desire to take care of her and love her.</p>

<p>(I knew it... it&apos;s not a feeling of love)</p>

<p>This feeling is different from the feelings he had for that girl... or so he thought. This feeling is different from the feelings he has ever had for that girl... or so he thinks. he thought. Although he couldn&apos;t say for sure because he couldn&apos;t remember the feeling of love itself now. Ever since that girl left him...</p>

<p>(Ehh, wait?)</p>

<p>There, Masachika questioned his thoughts.</p>

<p>(Was I... really abandoned by that girl?)</p>

<p>Even as he tried hard to remember, the thick fog that floated by his memories made it unclear. The girl&apos;s smile remained hidden behind the fog. Masachika still could not remember it. And yet... inside, he knew very well that their love was not over.</p>

<p>(Somehow... I kept it bottled up)</p>

<p>Even though he tried to forget it, he still kept remembering it. It reminded him of something. It must be because Masachika himself didn&apos;t want to forget that girl from the bottom of his heart. Because he still has regrets and continues to miss that girl in his memories.</p>

<p>{Masaaachika!}</p>

<p>The strange nickname was still ringing in his head. The innocent voice that called out to him from behind the fog made his heart ache and tighten.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm......&quot;</p>

<p>But then, a faint voice from his left side brought Masachika back to reality. When Masachika blinked his eyes, Alisa, who was small in stature while leaning on his left arm, returned to tightly embrace his left arm. Masachika felt comforted by the soft feeling that enveloped his hand.</p>

<p>(...I have to finish it properly)</p>

<p>When he saw Alisa&apos;s face, he naturally made that decision. In order to face the girl in front of him, who was in love with his current self, properly, he would have to really end his first love with that girl and ask her to take back the love that was still trapped inside him. If he did that, then...</p>

<p>&quot;....&quot;</p>

<p>Then suddenly, Yuki gently raised her head. She glanced at her brother who turned around silently, and looked at Alisa, who was sleeping while tightly hugging Masachika&apos;s left arm. After seeing that scene, Yuki started nodding with full understanding.</p>

<p>&quot;I see, so this is what is called netorare (NTR), huh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You better sleep forever, you little shit.&quot;</p>
