<h3>Chapter 2 - Princess and Goddess</h3>


<p>&quot;Onee~! Please fix my hair!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm~?&quot;</p>

<p>One day during summer vacation, Nonoa was relaxing in her room when the door to her room opened with a bang. A strong-looking beautiful girl with dark brown hair and slightly slanted eyes, jumped into the room. She was one of one of Nonoa&apos;s two younger twin siblings, Miyamae Rea.</p>

<p>Nonoa, who was playing with her smartphone on her bed, turned her gaze towards her younger sister who entered without knocking.</p>

<p>&quot;Rea... Knock on the door first before--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s not important now! Nee~ please!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yes, yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing her sister pleading while putting her hands together sweetly, Nonoa gently lifted her body from the bed. She then let her sister sit in front of the dressing table and plugged the power plug of the curling iron into the outlet.</p>

<p>&quot;...So? What style do you want to do today?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm~ I want the hairstyle that Onee wore in the photo shoot last week!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay~&quot;</p>

<p>As she combed her sister&apos;s hair while trying to remember, a little boy peeked through the open door.</p>

<p>&quot;Oi, hurry up a bit. We&apos;ll be late, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So fussy! Don&apos;t force a girl to hurry. You won&apos;t be popular, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Who said that? I&apos;m popular.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy who replied in an exasperated tone was Rea&apos;s twin brother, Miyamae Leo. He was a bishounen-type boy who was very similar to Rea, and his comment about being popular wouldn&apos;t have seemed strange if he had said it himself. In fact, he is active as a junior twin model with Rea, and was quite popular among the girls. However, this was something natural for the three siblings.</p>

<p>(TN: Bishounen roughly means &quot;beautiful boy&quot; who may possess feminine traits. They&apos;re often seen in shoujo manga and anime (I don&apos;t read or watch shoujo please don&apos;t take it the wrong way, that was purely based on a google search).)</p>

<p>&quot;Today you want to play with your fellow models~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, with the people met at the last photo shoot~~ Ahh, does Onee want to join in too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm~? No, because I already have my own plans today.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see~ then, I guess I&apos;ll be the only winner today~?&quot;</p>

<p>Rea smiled like a little devil as Nonoa styled her hair. Looking at her expression reflected in the mirror of the dressing table, Leo, who was leaning against the door frame, blatantly frowned.</p>

<p>&quot;What a slut.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haa~? I don&apos;t want to be told by you who always changes partners all the time~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just let them approach me, and I don&apos;t seduce anyone like you!?&quot;</p>

<p>The twin siblings glared at each other through the reflection of the mirror and spoke ill of each other. Seeing the behavior of the two of them through the mirror, Nonoa opened her mouth as if she didn&apos;t really care.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you two, just don&apos;t overdo it okay. Mama told you, right? Remember--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I understand. Don&apos;t worry too much, okay? I&apos;m still keeping my last line of defense, really. After all, from the beginning, don&apos;t really like ikemen guys, you know~? Guys who are overconfident and act arrogant, don&apos;t know why~&quot;</p>

<p>(An ikemen guy is a &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;frivolous&quot; guy often seen in shoujo anime or manga (Again, I&apos;m not into shoujo manga, just searched this up).)</p>

<p>&quot;Then, don&apos;t flirt carelessly with people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s just it. It feels pretty good when you&apos;re flirting with a handsome guy&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yuck!&quot;</p>

<p>Leo clicked his tongue in annoyance, but when Nonoa looked at him through the mirror, She averted her eyes as if feeling a little guilty.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ll go to the front door first.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, he pulled his body away from the door frame and turned around. When she saw him who was about to leave, Nonoa then called out to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you bring handkerchiefs and tissues?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a nagger, I prepared them already. Don&apos;t treat me like a child, Neechan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;?? I&apos;m not treating you like a child. I&apos;m just treating you like my brother, really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t understand what you mean at all.&quot;</p>

<p>When he replied angrily to his sister&apos;s rebuttal, Leo then walked away quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;...Is that called the rebellious period?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe~? Gosh, he&apos;s such a kid.&quot;</p>

<p>Rea said with a snort, even though she herself was the same age as Leo. Nonoa did not respond to that comment, and then put down the curling iron, then stepped back to examine the ends of Rea&apos;s hair.</p>

<p>&quot;How about this, pretty?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, thank you very much! Then, I&apos;ll leave first~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, be careful on the way&quot;</p>

<p>After seeing her sister leave the room with a coquettish smile, Nonoa glanced at the clock in her room.</p>

<p>&quot;...I think I&apos;d better get ready soon too.&quot;</p>

<p>Nonoa then sat on the chair where Rea had been sitting, straightening her hair with a curling iron, and braided it to cover her shoulders.</p>

<p>Next, she opened the three-meter-wide wardrobe, and inside were many branded clothes hung in rows. She herself couldn&apos;t imagine how much the whole thing cost. Without caring about that at all, Nonoa took out blouses and a plain skirt from the boxes piled up on the floor. Then from another cabinet, she took out a plain bag, a hat, and black-rimmed glasses and started wearing those items.</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, I guess this kind of look is enough?&quot;</p>

<p>The result was a coordinated look resembling a celebrity in disguise. The overly flashy glittery look was suppressed, and more of a clean and neat appearance.</p>

<p>After checking it in front of the mirror and practicing her facial expressions lightly.</p>

<p>Nonoa finally left the house. Her destination was a karaoke place located in a</p>

<p>secluded area behind the station.</p>

<p>To be honest, the place was not clean and smelled like cigarettes, but the karaoke place was often used by kids and couples with little money since there were no surveillance cameras with very few employees who were willing to patrol the area.</p>

<p>(TN: Sex. They are using it for sex.)</p>

<p>&quot;Ueeh, hiks, hiks....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;??&quot;</p>

<p>As she walked down the complicated back alley towards the store, she heard a a small sob, and Nonoa averted her eyes. Then a boy who looked to be about five or six years old walked out from around the corner. He seemed to have gotten lost, his face was wrinkled with tear marks, and wandering aimlessly.</p>

<p>&quot;Fuee, hiks...&quot;</p>

<p>A little boy was crying and wandering around a place that wasn&apos;t very safe. Nonoa took a quick glance at the boy... and left it at that without being too worried at all. It wasn&apos;t that she was in a hurry, but she felt that she shouldn&apos;t bother to help the boy.</p>

<p>She understood that the idea of &quot;one should be kind to children&quot; was said in the views of the general public, and if there was an acquaintance in the vicinity, Nonoa would probably do so according to that ethic. But right now, Nonoa&apos;s acquaintances weren&apos;t around here. And most importantly, her parents also told her to [be nice to your younger brother and sister], but not to [be nice to small children]. Therefore, Nonoa had no reason to help the lost child. What about the emotions moved by the cries of a child? That kind of thing had never existed since she was born.</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome~, how many people are there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah sorry, I have an appointment with my friend. Umm, the room number...&quot;</p>

<p>After arriving at the karaoke place she was looking for and telling the aloof employees that she would be joining a friend who had come first, Nonoa followed the room number sent through her smartphone and went up to the third floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Nonoa-chan! I&apos;ve been waiting for you for a long time~!&quot;</p>

<p>Then, when she entered the meeting room, a girl who was running approached her as if she was going to jump on her. While on the other hand, Nonoa showed a very friendly and bright smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, huh? Umm, am I the last to arrive?&quot;</p>

<p>While saying that with a different, more polite pronoun, and with a different gentler tone of voice than usual, Nonoa looked around the room.</p>

<p>(TN: As I mentioned before in previous chapters, there are many ways you can refer to yourself in Japanese, and they are ranked in a hierarchy of formal to informal)</p>

<p>As if to respond to her gaze, the three boys who were sitting on the sofa smiled kindly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but yeah, don&apos;t think about it too much? Because we&apos;re the ones who invited you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right, that&apos;s right. We&apos;re sorry, okay? Even though today is your day off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because there&apos;s something really want to tell you as soon as possible... well</p>

<p>anyway, just sit down first.&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as one of the boys pointed to the place next to him, the eyes of the other two boys immediately emitted a dangerous air.</p>

<p>&quot;Oi, what kind of ulterior motive are you hiding to tell her to sit next to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gosh, I need to be more vigilant...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, boys, let&apos;s not make a fuss here. Nonoa-chan, how about you sit here with me?&quot;</p>

<p>The girl who had given the three boys a cold stare turned around and smiled at Nonoa, then invited her to sit next to her.</p>

<p>This time, it was the boys&apos; turn to look at her with a cold gaze, as they were taking advantage of her position as a fellow girl. However, she ignored them. The girl then took another list tablet in her hand and handed it to Nonoa.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, let&apos;s do some karaoke first, shall we? I want to hear Nonoa-chan sing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s a good idea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I want to hear it too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Try singing just one song first, Nonoa&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ummm~? Okay. But I want to order some drinks first-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, let me order it then? What would you like to drink?&quot;</p>

<p>Nonoa&apos;s words instantly made the four of them move in unison, and when she started to sing, everyone became excited as if they were attending an idol concert. The scene didn&apos;t seem to be much different from what always happens at school, but in fact there is a slight difference.</p>

<p>The difference is Nonoa&apos;s behavior and the reactions of the people around her. If Nonoa&apos;s behavior at school was that of a queen followed by her cronies, then the Nonoa of today is like a princess who is babysat by her servants.</p>

<p>&quot;Fyuhh...&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, Nonoa sang a ballad, and the four of them applauded for her. It was an old-school song that wouldn&apos;t attract praise at karaoke, but no one cared about that. However, even if Nonoa sang a heavy metal song or an anime song, their reaction would still be the same. Even if Nonoa is tone-deaf, they would still applaud wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>&quot;You-You guys, that&apos;s enough.....&quot;</p>

<p>Nonoa fanned her blushing face with her hands at the excessive applause directed at her. Then, the four of them stopped clapping as instructed, and made expressions as if they were witnessing a scene that was soothing to the heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah~ I&apos;m really nervous. Singing in front of people does make you nervous, huh~&quot;</p>

<p>Nonoa smiled shyly when she received the gazes of the four of them, as if she was looking at something that made her smile softly.</p>

<p>Nonoa&apos;s shy smile, combined with her plain and different clothes from usual, seemed to arouse people&apos;s desire to protect her. In fact, the hearts of the four of them were already brilliantly entangled, and they all stared at Nonoa with passionate gazes. Nonoa seemed to feel awkward under their gaze, and wriggled her body.</p>

<p>&quot;.....u-uuh, you guys are also singing, right? If it&apos;s just me, I feel embarrassed, you know...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohh, I see, that&apos;s true too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ummm then, guess should take a risk and sing a rock song?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s good. The three of us can take turns to sing it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ll go get the tambourine first, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: A tambourine at a karaoke?)</p>

<p>Nonoa encouraged the other four people to sing with hand gestures while turning away to avoid their gaze. Then the four of them chose a song in a hurry and started pretending to liven up the atmosphere. As if they were treating a precious princess, the four of them were overly sensitive to Nonoa&apos;s every move and showed excessive attention to her. However, it was only natural that they would act like that.</p>

<p>That was because, around the four of them, Nonoa acted like, &quot;a timid and shy girl who feels suffocated by her parents&apos; insistence that she should work as a model and belong to the normies group, but in reality felt suffocated by such circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p>That, of course, is contrary to reality. The persona of &quot;shy and timid girl&quot; is just a fabrication made by Nonoa to gain sympathy from these four people. In fact, it is the four of them who feel suffocated by their outward appearance and way of life at the school, as well as being disturbed by their inability to show their true selves. Nonoa skillfully approached them while revealing.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, I&apos;m the same.&quot;</p>

<p>In this way, she brings together people who are excluded from the lower caste of high school to create a five-member group. Those who were usually depressed at school, were quickly attracted to their first true friends, and above all, the person who understands them best turns out to be Nonoa.</p>

<p>&quot;Only we know the true nature of Miyamae Nonoa.&quot; &quot;To Nonoa, the normies at school are just fake friends, and we are her true friends.&quot; This secret illusion gave them a sweet sense of superiority, the affection and trust Nonoa showed them gave them a feeling of versatility and excitement like a narcotic drug........ and that&apos;s how Nonoa became a goddess among the four of them.</p>

<p>&quot;That was amazing. You guys are really good at singing! Yeay~&quot;</p>

<p>Nonoa high-fived the boys who had just finished singing while laughing with a cheerful voice. The four people lost their liking for behavior that was difficult to show at school.</p>

<p>However, the four of them did not just invite Nonoa to play with them. When the atmosphere had relaxed to a certain extent, they looked at each other and one of the boys spoke on behalf of the others.</p>

<p>&quot;Ummm, Nonoa... The real reason why we invited you to karaoke today is because we have something to talk about...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you guys want to talk about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That.... you introduced us to your new friend before, right? That&apos;s Kinjou-kun from class 1-F...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes. Kinjou-kun, huh? So how was it? Do you think you can get along with him? Since Kinjou-kun seems like a lonely person... so was hoping that you guys would want to be friends with him too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, that&apos;s just...&quot;</p>

<p>Nonoa&apos;s friendly smile made the four of them simultaneously pursed their lips in an awkward manner. But not long after, the girl sitting next to Nonoa began to open her mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, it&apos;s about Kinjou-kun...&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it, neither Suou nor Kujou are on social media..... do they want to show off that they intend to become student council president, but don&apos;t want to get attention? They want to act cool, huh! That really pisses me off.&quot;</p>

<p>In a room of a luxury apartment building, there was a guy in front of his computer, muttering something full of negative emotions. It was Kinjou of the 1- F Academy that Nonoa and her friends were talking about at the moment.</p>

<p>His appearance...... To put it bluntly, was one that could be considered ugly in the eyes of the public. He had a short body for his age group, his body had grown horizontally, with sagging cheeks full of pimples and a pig nose with prominent nostrils. Up to this point, he looked like a plain fat guy who would be bullied at school, but.... his eyes and mouth, which unleashed bottomless cruelty, turned his impression into something completely different.</p>

<p>Instead of being a harmless little pig, he looked like a rude and cunning snake. In fact, he is the type of person who vents his insecurities by humiliating others, and always tries to beat up people who are &quot;better&quot; than him, both on the Internet and in real life, and slandering them by spreading bad gossip or rumors.</p>

<p>&quot;Hahh!? What the hell is this girl doing traveling to Guam? Lately, this person seems really cocky... Try diving into his account first and find out if there are any comments that could set his beard on fire... Hmm? Pfftt, what the hell is this guy, I guessed right on the right on target and got annoyed myself. Yup, she&apos;s just an ugly bitch whose picture was edited~&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: Holy shit this chapter is full of people who need to get their shit together, touch grass and reconnect with him, the divine and holy spirit, god.)</p>

<p>Today was the same as usual, he was busy wandering around the social network accounts of students and celebrities in the same school, making fun of and annoying them..... but at that moment, the smartphone placed on his desk rang because of an incoming call.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah...? Oh...&quot;</p>

<p>Upon seeing the name displayed on the screen, Kinjou&apos;s cheeks relaxed as he answered the call.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, huh.. karaoke...? Gosh, what can do.&quot;</p>

<p>Contrary to his words, Kinjou got up from his seat with a joyful expression and quickly began to get ready to go out. Then, within five minutes, he left the house and headed for the karaoke place.</p>

<p>It was no surprise that Kinjou was hated at school like a snake or a scorpion, due to his bad personality, and had no one he could call a friend. No, he used to have no friends. Until about a month ago, when he was approached by Nonoa at school.</p>

<p>[Kinjou-kun... Is it true that you&apos;ve always been compared to your younger sibling who&apos;s great? Actually, I&apos;m the same...]</p>

<p>Nonoa spoke to him in a completely different atmosphere from the one she usually showed at school. And then Nonoa told him something. She was forced to act cheerful and glamorous in order to fulfill her parents&apos; demands.</p>

<p>Even so, she was no match for her younger brother and sister who were true normies, and she didn&apos;t feel at home. Even at school, she felt suffocated by not being able to get rid of the characters she had already played.</p>

<p>[I think.... that Kinjou-kun is just like me...]</p>

<p>When Nonoa said that in an anxious tone and looked up to her, Kinjou&apos;s heart was instantly made helpless. And Kinjou herself began to tell about his situation. His father and stepmother doted on his half-brother too. People often said that his brother was brilliant, but that was because his parents gave him more opportunities in education, and he himself would have been much more brilliant if he had had the same opportunities. However, neither his parents, teachers, nor everyone around him realize his excellence.</p>

<p>(TN: the victim mentality is real)</p>

<p>Nonoa gently nodded her head and confirmed everything to Kinjou, who expressed all his pent-up dissatisfaction in his heart. After that, Nonoa introduced him to the 3 guys and 1 girl with similar circumstances, and he immediately felt that he fit in with them.</p>

<p>[I heard, Kinjou. It&apos;s said that you really don&apos;t support Kujou at the public debate the other day]</p>

<p>[I understand how you feel, really? The representative of a traditional school should must be pure Japanese, right~]</p>

<p>[I feel happy that there are people who share the same experience as us... Because the other students are all just a bunch of fools who only look at her face and think that she&apos;s a &quot;princess&quot; or something]</p>

<p>There&apos;s no other reason than because they&apos;re all equally antagonistic towards</p>

<p>Alisa. Sharing something you hate can sometimes create a stronger connection than sharing something you love. than sharing something you love. In Kinjou&apos;s case, that&apos;s exactly what happened.</p>

<p>(The idiots at school have no brains at all. They&apos;re all just trash who can only judge people based on their outward appearance.)</p>

<p>(TN: isn&apos;t that what he&apos;s doing?)</p>

<p>But they were different. They praised Kinjou&apos;s courage in facing the upper caste alone. They were eager to hear about the many heroic stories Kinjou had accomplished so far, and their eyes lit up with admiration when they heard his stories.</p>

<p>For Kinjou, who usually maintained a sense of self-assertion by looking down on others, the praise directed at him was accompanied by a deadly euphoria. He who fundamentally distrusted others altogether at all, began to open his heart and mind to them.</p>

<p>&quot;But I&apos;ve never been to karaoke or anything like that... well, since they went to the trouble of inviting me, I guess I&apos;ll just have to enjoy it,&quot;</p>

<p>Although he could not hide her joyful smile at all, Kinjou entered the designated karaoke place, and spoke to himself in a haughty manner.</p>

<p>He then took the elevator to the third floor and stood in front of the room that had been transmitted via his smartphone.</p>

<p>(Hmm? Somehow it feels quiet?)</p>

<p>For a moment, he wondered why he couldn&apos;t hear the voice of the person who was singing, but without worrying too much about it, Kinjou opened the door and stepped inside in a self-absorbed fashion.</p>

<p>&quot;Heyy, what&apos;s with you guys suddenly asking me to karaoke? Yeah, I just happened to be free, so I came here~&quot;</p>

<p>While saying this, Kinjou looked around the room and finally realized there was something strange. There was a heavy atmosphere enveloping the room. Nonoa looked very sad while the girl next to her hugged her shoulder. The unexpectedly dark atmosphere made Kinjou frown for a moment, and then she forced the corners of her mouth to up</p>

<p>&quot;Oi, oi, what&apos;s with this strange atmosphere. What, is Nonoa crying again? Ehh~~ what have you guys done~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kinjou, shut your mouth for a moment&quot;</p>

<p>When his words were suddenly cut off by an angry voice, Kinjou turned around stiffly. Then, the three boys greeted him with hostile gazes, making him involuntarily flinch. Nonoa slowly looked up and called out to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Kinjou-kun...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohh, what&apos;s wrong, Nonoa?&quot;</p>

<p>Nonoa looked at him with a hurt expression, as if she had been betrayed by someone she trusted. Seeing Nonoa&apos;s expression like that made Kinjou take half a step back.</p>

<p>&quot;Kinjou-kun... Six months ago, was it really you who slandered the model Mimiko-chan on the internet and forced her to retire?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? A-Ahh... umm, about that~...&quot;</p>

<p>Somehow, he could see that things were going to be bad for his assertion here. here. However, how could he lie when those four people were glaring at him as if implying, &quot;You said that the other day, didn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, maybe that kind of thing happened once?&quot;</p>

<p>As a result, Nonoa bit her lip and grimaced as Kinjou gave a short speech.</p>

<p>&quot;O-Oi, what&apos;s wrong? After all, what exactly are you talking about-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kinjou-kun... you know what? Mimiko-chan is my precious friend, you know...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh...&quot;</p>

<p>In a tone saddened by tears, Nonoa told the stunned Kinjou.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimiko-chan is a very kind girl who accepts me as am... but she was so hurt by your slanderous comments on the internet that she doesn&apos;t want to see me at all...!&quot;</p>

<p>Then, as if she could no longer stand being there, her voice trembled and brushed by Kinjou and walked out the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah...&quot;</p>

<p>Kinjou stretched out his hands in the air as he stared absentmindedly at Nonoa&apos;s back who was getting farther and farther away. Then..... there was a large hand gripping his shoulder from behind. When he turned around, he saw a group of four people with cruel smiles on their faces.</p>

<p>&quot;So that&apos;s how it is, Kinjou. The person you destroyed for fun before was someone precious to Nonoa.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, no, I didn&apos;t know that at the time--&quot;</p>

<p>He made excuses in a pathetic manner and walked backwards, but in the small private karaoke room, he soon discovered that there was no way to escape from</p>

<p>this situation. The four of them immediately surrounded Kinjou. &quot;Don&apos;t think you can get away with saying you don&apos;t know, okay? After all, it&apos;s not</p>

<p>just that model you&apos;re victimizing, is it? Didn&apos;t you proudly talk about it the other</p>

<p>day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, just so you know, I&apos;ve recorded the entire conversation at that time, okay? Also, I checked afterwards and found... You often slander celebrities and students from our school here and there, right? wonder what would happen if I revealed your identity to them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wh-Why... wasn&apos;t it yesterday, you guys were praising me so much...&quot;</p>

<p>A gaze full of contempt pierced through the stammering Kinjou who could not comprehend the situation she was in.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that obvious? We were all just acting. really doubt your sanity to proudly talk about such nonsense.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, let me tell you first, if you really are a kind-hearted person like what Nonoa said, we would also accept you, you know? Well but as it turns out, you are actually a rotten guy and a jerk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s why I told Nonoa-san about your true nature.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nonoa-chan is a very pure and kind girl. So, we have to protect her from trash like you.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, after thinking about Nonoa with a gentle gaze, the four of them turned around and put on cruel smiles again.</p>

<p>The difference in their expressions just now was too great. The dangerous gleam in their gazes seemed like madness, and caused Kinjou to slump to the ground. He instinctively understood that these four people in front of him did not even consider him a human being.</p>

<p>They did not even care about the feelings, dignity, or even the life of the human being named Kinjou. They did not hesitate at all to tread on him if necessary.</p>

<p>&quot;A-Ahh...&quot;</p>

<p>This was the purest cruelty that had never been directed at him in his entire life. The pure will to obliterate him by putting aside disgust and hostility, shook Kinjou&apos;s body to its core, a feeling of warmth and pain spread throughout his lower body.</p>

<p>&quot;So-Someone, help me...&quot;</p>

<p>As if commanded by his instincts, his throat let out a faint gasp. On the other hand, the gazes of the four of them continued to blaze and only their mouths were twitching as if seeing something funny.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahaha, what the hell was that? It feels like we&apos;re the ones trying to make you disappear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry. We won&apos;t do that, as long as you voluntarily disappear from Nonoa&apos;s presence, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You may refuse, but in that case, will expose your identity as mentioned before. Then, not just you, but your family will also die socially, okay? Or rather,</p>

<p>I&apos;m the one who will make it happen.&quot; &quot;You&apos;ve been threatening other people&apos;s social status all this time. So at least you</p>

<p>are ready for the same thing to happen to you, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uwaaaa--&quot;</p>

<p>A guy&apos;s horrified voice, tinged with fear, echoed through the karaoke room. However, it never reached anyone outside.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh-pretending to cry is really hard, huh.&quot;</p>

<p>Nonoa said to herself while playing with her smartphone in the toilet. Her face didn&apos;t show the slightest bit of sadness or anything like that. Naturally, it was all just an act. From the start, Nonoa had no grudge against Kinjou. She was not that close with a fellow model named Mimiko, and the whole reason why she was blaming Kinjou this time was to pay back her debts to Masachika and Alisa.</p>

<p>(Because papa once told me that if owe someone a favor, should return the favor properly~)</p>

<p>Nonoa had no sense of guilt or accomplishment, even though she had instilled fear into someone&apos;s heart for that reason alone.</p>

<p>Since it wasn&apos;t the first time, she didn&apos;t really feel anything right now.</p>

<p>Nonoa had already manipulated those four people to eliminate whoever was bothering her until now.</p>

<p>An upperclassman who violently harassed Nonoa out of jealousy. A life guidance teacher who made Nonoa an enemy. An opposing candidate in the campaign who slandered Sayaka&apos;s name. In each of these cases, Nonoa did not give any instructions. She simply gave information and acted in a way that triggered the desire to protect her. By doing just that, the four of them took the initiative to remove the obstacles that were bothering her. You could say that Nonoa selects and gathers members who have the strength and quality to do so.</p>

<p>(TN: Ezekiel 34:4. Nonoa shall repent for her sins of manipulation and I hope she shall find our father in heaven, the one perfect being and his divine and holy spirit)</p>

<p>&quot;Upss, I guess it&apos;s time to go out?&quot;</p>

<p>After taking the time to exit the toilet room, Nonoa arranged the expression of her face in front of the mirror before exiting the restroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Nonoa-chan!&quot;</p>

<p>And then sure enough, the four of them walked towards her. Nonoa turned to them with a weak and helpless smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone... sorry, huh? I&apos;ve calmed down a bit now...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nonoa-chan..... are you really alright?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I&apos;m sorry for getting too carried away. jumped out first before could listen to Kinjou-kun&apos;s whole story... I&apos;m sure there must be a reason, right? have to listen to what he has to say properly...&quot;</p>

<p>When Nonoa tried to return to the karaoke room after saying that, the three boys stood in front to block her entry. Then, each of them said,</p>

<p>&quot;If you go looking for Kinjou, he&apos;s already gone home, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems like he really regrets what he did and... he said that he doesn&apos;t deserve to be friends with Noana.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He wants to reflect on his actions for a while. So, Nonoa-san doesn&apos;t have to worry about it, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Really? If everyone says so, then...&quot;</p>

<p>Nonoa nodded as if reassuring herself, and the four of them looked at her kindly. According to the viewpoint of the four of them, they were knights who were trying to protect the innocent and pure princess. But from Nonoa&apos;s perspective, they all looked like radical followers who worshiped a Goddess.</p>

<p>(It&apos;s interesting to see how people make their own assumptions~)</p>

<p>Nonoa observed the four of them with a cool head while thinking about it without any particular emotion.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, until Kinjou-kun changes his mind and returns... I&apos;ll wait for him, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>And then, she showed the most innocent smile on her face.</p>
