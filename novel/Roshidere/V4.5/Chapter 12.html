<h3>Chapter 12 - Lover and Employer</h3>

<p>&quot;Then let&apos;s get the slumber party started!&quot;</p>

<p>The student council training camp was held at the Kenzaki family villa. On the first night of sleepover, inside the room where the three first-year girls slept, Yuki who was wearing her pajamas while sitting on the edge of the bed, was screaming with excitement. On the other hand, Alisa who was wearing pajamas also hesitantly responded and opened her mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it okay... on the bed, doing things like this...&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa tilted her head slightly as if her conscience did not forgive herself. Her gaze fell on the juice and light snacks neatly arranged on the bedside table. Since there wasn&apos;t much room to sit on the floor, they sat on two separate beds, with juice and snacks between them. between them...... But Alisa, who had a serious nature, felt uncomfortable sitting on the bed to eat or drink.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry~ don&apos;t worry as long as it doesn&apos;t spill, I think we&apos;ll be fine.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Yuki who was sitting across the table next to Alisa, brought a choco chip cookie to her mouth as if to calm her down. Ayano, who was sitting next to her, also picked up the individually wrapped mini-donuts and put them in her mouth in one bite, trying not to spill it. Why there was no sound when unwrapping it was still a mystery. By the way, unlike Yuki and Alisa, Ayano was wearing a thin negligee. The reason why she was wearing a negligee was obvious. If she didn&apos;t wear a skirt, she couldn&apos;t grab her weapons quickly in case of an emergency. Although it was not yet known when the emergency would arrive.</p>

<p>(TN: No gonna explain what a negligee is here, you can search it up for yourself. Uhh just make sure no one else is looking at your screen ig)</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... well, I guess I can clean it up later, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing the two people in front of her eating the snacks deliciously, Alisa seemed to find peace with herself. While leaning her body slightly forward, she took a piece of choco chip cookie in her mouth and relaxed her cheeks. Seeing that scene, Yuki began to smile widely.</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu, that&apos;s how it should be, Alya-san. Before going to bed at night, we need to enjoy sweets and juices without worrying about calories. This is the joy of a slumber party!&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa&apos;s hand stopped for a moment after hearing the word &apos;calories&apos; mentioned by Yuki. However, when she saw Ayano who was quietly bringing a mini donut into her mouth without caring about it, she then turned her gaze to her stomach, and after a few seconds of silent contemplation, Alisa reached for the chocolate cookie again.</p>

<p>Thinking about it calmly, looking at Ayano&apos;s stomach right now absolutely can&apos;t be used as a reference point at all. The calorie intake she ate now would have an effect until tomorrow, but Alisa turned away from that fact.</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, maybe I can think of this as dessert after a meal...after all, I&apos;ve also been exercising a lot at the beach today.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa mumbled while making excuses and brought a chocolate cake to her mouth. Seeing that, Yuki smiled like a demon rejoicing at the fall of mankind. However, as soon as Alisa raised her head, her smile immediately disappeared in an instant.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right, I was too engrossed in the cooking competition and made the mistake of not preparing dessert.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fufu... If you want, we can have a dessert match as the second round.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, that&apos;s a good idea... upss, almost forgot.&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki then picked up the cup with an expression that reminded her of something, and raised it lightly.</p>

<p>&quot;In the end, we lost to senpai... so as a consolation prize, let&apos;s have a toast.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What the heck?&quot;</p>

<p>While laughing at Yuki&apos;s suggestion, Alisa also picked up her own cup. After making sure that Ayano had also secretly picked up her cup, Yuki began to take the lead.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, as a consolation prize... Masachika-kun no baka!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!? Fufufu, baka~!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!?...Cheers?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa who was surprised for a moment by Yuki&apos;s shout immediately smiled amusedly and joined in and responded happily, while Ayano looked confused and hesitated while raising her cup. To Masachika, it was a cruel slanderous remark. However, the atmosphere between Yuki and Alisa was already getting more relaxed.</p>

<p>&quot;Geez, Masachika-kun really sucks, doesn&apos;t he~. It&apos;s true that Masha-senpai&apos;s cooking is good, but I wanted him to praise our cooking more by saying, &apos;This one is no less delicious, really&apos;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. Moreover, he misnamed the name of my dish with a cocky expression on his face, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: Gotta admit that was a true L moment from Masachika right</p>

<p>there)</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, that was really embarrassing, wasn&apos;t it~&quot;</p>

<p>The three of them present knew that they didn&apos;t really mean it, but Ayano who could not badmouth her employer even if it was just a joke, looked rather troubled and agitated. Seeing Ayano&apos;s reaction like that, Yuki smiled and turned to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayano, if you have something to say about Masachika-kun, you are free to say it, really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh!? No, no, that kind of thing... Masachika-sama is a really kind-hearted and wonderful person...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...A kind-hearted person? Wonderful?&quot;</p>

<p>When Ayano said that while shrinking her shoulders, Alisa raised her eyebrows and narrowed her eyes. She then began to recall all of Masachika&apos;s behaviors towards herself. The image that came to mind was of Masachika always teasing and pranking her whenever he got the chance.</p>

<p>&quot;...In fact, he is quite naughty, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa muttered to herself because she was a little annoyed at the image that appeared in her head. However, Ayano blinked repeatedly as if not understanding what was being talked about, and asked while tilting her head.</p>

<p>&quot;...Masachika-sama, naughty?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yes, whenever something happens, he always taunts me...&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa replied while being slightly taken aback by Ayano&apos;s gaze that was truly sincerely a question. However, Ayano only tilted her head curiously. Then at that moment, Yuki reached out for help while laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;Fufu, even if Ayano is teased, she will probably answer with a flat face like &apos;What does that mean?&apos;. Whereas on the other hand, Alya-san is always serious and gives interesting reactions, maybe that&apos;s why Masachika-kun likes to tease you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn&apos;t make me happy at all...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There, there. Isn&apos;t this similar to that? Hmmm~ something like, you want to keep teasing the person you like?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>After hearing Yuki&apos;s words, Alisa raised her eyebrows and suddenly put a calm expression on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it could be? Maybe that might be so....&quot;</p>

<p>And as she said that while playing with the ends of her hair... Alisa then recalled the image of herself who also teased Masachika.</p>

<p>&quot;No, that&apos;s impossible. That kind of thing is impossible.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa instantly retracted her previous statement and removed her hand from her hair with a sullen expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh, what&apos;s wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s nothing, really? Well, it&apos;s similar to an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, so it&apos;s nothing like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;???&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa lightly cleared her throat at Yuki who seemed unable to follow the conversation...</p>

<p>&quot;First of all, I can&apos;t understand the feelings of someone who wants to tease the person they like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s... because they want to seek attention from their crush? You see, boys often do that, right? They&apos;ll tease or make fun of the girl they like. Hasn&apos;t that kind of thing ever happened to you, Alya-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... well. I usually just ignore them. Do they think they will be liked after doing something that annoys the girl they like?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki chuckled to Alisa, who snorted in annoyance after saying</p>

<p>something so mercilessly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, no matter what age, boys always look childish sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. Even when they&apos;re in high school, they can&apos;t calm down at all, and are always doing stupid things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu, but when you see boys doing stupid things to each other, it sometimes makes you think that it looks fun, doesn&apos;t it~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I myself think that they&apos;re free to do whatever they want as long as they don&apos;t bother other people, you know? But flipping through manga magazines at school is just too much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, it&apos;s true that breaking school rules is not good. But think it&apos;s still funny if you only bring manga, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If it&apos;s just normal manga, okay? But they grin sometimes when they look at gravure magazines, you know? really wish they&apos;d stop doing that kind of thing...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm~ that kind of thing does make girls feel uncomfortable...... Speaking of feeling uncomfortable, you definitely don&apos;t want them gossiping about which girl is the cutest and which one has the biggest boobs, right...... You can even still hear it normally even if they&apos;re already whispering.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right... and if you listen carefully, they always talk about two-dimensional girls. It really makes me feel sick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...? That&apos;s right. Sometimes they&apos;ll argue about who their favorite character is in a popular anime show, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right, that&apos;s right. After all, that stuff is just fictitious, right? Seriously, I don&apos;t understand why they&apos;re so obsessed with that kind of thing. Every time they play gacha games, they would feel happy or sad depending on whether or not their favorite character appeared. not.....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm.... Aren&apos;t they obsessed because it&apos;s a fictional and idealistic character?&quot;</p>

<p>While answering like that, Yuki felt a suspicion growing within her. That suspicion was ....</p>

<p>(Ehh? We&apos;re talking about boys in general, right? Is this just my feelings? Alya-san seems to have been talking about Onii-chan all the time...)</p>

<p>That&apos;s what she felt. To prove her suspicion, Yuki tried discussing a topic that was a little closer to that.</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of boys, they&apos;re always uncooperative when there&apos;s a time based schedule, right?.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. Even though they have done their part of the schedule, they won&apos;t do more than that.&quot;</p>

<p>(Was that about Onii-chan?)</p>

<p>&quot;They must be sleeping after gym class or other classes, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. Well, they always look sleepy, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>(That&apos;s about Onii-chan, isn&apos;t it?)</p>

<p>&quot;Also, they usually play smartphone games at school, right~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. They always deny it by saying &apos;Since it&apos;s not yet class time, it&apos;s not a violation of school rules.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>(Yup, it&apos;s definitely about Onii-chan)</p>

<p>Even though they were talking about boys in general, Alisa was clearly only talking about Masachika. Yuki&apos;s cheeks twitched at this a little scary.</p>

<p>(Hahh~? How strange, huh~? In Alya-san&apos;s world, is the only boy in existence Onii-chan? Is she a princess imprisoned in a tower and separated from the outside world?)</p>

<p>If she&apos;s doing it consciously with Masachika in mind, then hurry up and get married, but if she does it unconsciously, how uninterested is she in other boys? No matter what, Yuki felt that she should not should not touch that topic. So, Yuki quickly averted her eyes and looked at Ayano who was next to her.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, Ayano, didn&apos;t you keep eating donuts all the time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, ahh... that&apos;s right.&quot;</p>

<p>Without realizing it, Ayano had already opened a new package containing mini donuts and was holding it against her stomach. Don&apos;t tell me, the reason she bought two packs of mini donuts on the shopping trip this morning was because she intended to eat them all by herself?</p>

<p>&quot;Just like the Churros at the amusement park the other day, ...... you really like them, huh? Deep-fried pastries.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yes...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I&apos;m not scolding you, really.&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano shrugged her shoulders as if apologizing, but still did not let go of the package of snacks. While smiling wryly at the sight, Yuki then turned to Alisa.</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of cookies do you like, Alya-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me? Hmmm... maybe chocolate? basically like sweets, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Alya-san has a sweet tooth, huh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, maybe? But spicy food...&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa muttered and gave Ayano a meaningful look. On the other</p>

<p>hand, Ayano also responded with a meaningful blink. Yuki did not</p>

<p>understand the meaning of that, but she felt there was some kind</p>

<p>of bond between the two of them when they looked at each other</p>

<p>and tilted their heads slightly.</p>

<p>(Is this... friendship? No, it&apos;s more like comrades in arms... no, what the hell is this?)</p>

<p>While throwing a tsukkomi inside her mind, Yuki asked the two of them about something that had been bothering her.</p>

<p>&quot;...By the way, Alya-san still calls Ayano Kimishima-san, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh? Well, that&apos;s right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ayano also still calls her Alisa-sama.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s... yes.&quot;</p>

<p>As the two of them exchanged confused looks, Yuki now felt as if they were a pair of communication disorder sufferers whose relationship had not developed at all.</p>

<p>(What the hell is wrong with these two, how troublesome)</p>

<p>Despite thinking so, Yuki still put her hands together with a smile innocently.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that kind of call very strange, even though we&apos;re sleeping in the same room like this? think we should stop calling each other by our surnames and start calling each other by our respective names.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh...? Hmm. I don&apos;t mind, really.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I also..... if Alisa-sama feels okay with it.&quot;</p>

<p>(What, are they a cat-shy couple!?)</p>

<p>In front of Yuki, who inwardly made such a joke, Alisa and Ayano exchanged glances as if they were stealing glances. And then, Alisa opened her mouth reluctantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, then... Ayano-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes. Alisa-sa...n.&quot;</p>

<p>(Their conversation was still too awkward for a flower couple)</p>

<p>Yuki&apos;s otaku brain immediately raced as the two of them made progress in their relationship, which was a bit similar to a yuri couple who had just started dating.</p>

<p>(Fumu, is this Alya x Ayano? Or maybe Ayano x Alya? Either way is good... rather, I want to be a part of them too. Any guy who gets caught in between a yuri will be killed, but if a girl gets caught in between a yuri pair, she&apos;ll definitely be forgiven, right? If necessary, how about involving Masha-san who really likes Alya-san?)</p>

<p>(TN: I&apos;m pretty sure the difference between Alya x Ayano and Ayano x Alya is that the first name is the person who is the &quot;lead&quot; or &quot;dominant&quot; partner in Yuri relationships)</p>

<p>&quot;Yuki-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, ummm...&quot;</p>

<p>When Alisa gave her a suspicious look as she had yuri fantasies, Yuki immediately asked the question that came to her mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, Alya-san. Why are you resisting so hard to be in a room with Masha-senpai?&quot;</p>

<p>Even though it was an overly forced change of topic to get rid of the yuri fantasy inside her head, Alisa just frowned without being too bothered.</p>

<p>&quot;... Because I&apos;ll be used as a pillow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Masha always sleeps with a very large pillow...or rather a large stuffed animal? So when she&apos;s traveling and doesn&apos;t have one, she sometimes gets delirious and uses anything nearby as a pillow...... Whenever on a family trip, especially at an inn, she always sneaks into my futon...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh... Then, perhaps Sarashina-senpai is being used as a bolster pillow right now, right?&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: No she isn&apos;t but someone else is</p>

<p>When Yuki jokingly said that, Alisa began to imagine that scene, and chuckled.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s possible, but Sarashina-senpai will definitely kick her out with</p>

<p>all her strength.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu, that&apos;s right. It&apos;s possible that she&apos;ll be kicked out of bed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s good. I hope that she&apos;ll learn from that incident and never use people as bolster pillows again.&quot;</p>

<p>While laughing with Alisa, Yuki thought to herself, &quot;Made into a bolster pillow by Masha-senpai? If so, I&apos;ll gladly become her bolster pillow.&quot;</p>

<p>Once flowers bloomed in her brain, it seemed to be quite difficult to get rid of. After that, Alisa and Ayano, who seemed to feel a little closer because of the change in their way of addressing each other, started talking to each other little by little. Gradually, the three of them were able to chat casually like normal girls in general.</p>

<p>(I guess it&apos;s about time...)</p>

<p>Yuki put her palms together when one of the topics was finished and seized the opportunity.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, I guess it&apos;s time to discuss the main topic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Main topic?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;???&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You two still don&apos;t understand it? The main topic of the slumber party is, of course, love talk!&quot;</p>

<p>.....What?&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing Yuki&apos;s encouraging statement, Alisa&apos;s reaction was a little sluggish. When Alisa clearly showed that she wasn&apos;t too interested in the topic... Yuki raised her voice cheerfully.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ve been dreaming of this for a long time! Gathering with my friends and chatting about love to my heart&apos;s content!&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa&apos;s cheeks twitched when she heard the word &quot;friends&quot; from Yuki&apos;s mouth. Then, she turned her gaze away from her with a not-so-interested expression and slowly brushed her hair back.</p>

<p>&quot;mmmm...hmm~? Is that so? Well then... let&apos;s do it? Chat about love.&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment, a dark smile appeared on Yuki&apos;s face, as if her inner voice saying &apos;so easy~&apos; could be heard. However, because it was just for a moment, Alisa who was looking away did not notice it.</p>

<p>&quot;Then... let&apos;s start with the ideal type of guy. By the way, mine is someone who is understanding and kind. What about Ayano?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For me... that&apos;s right. Maybe a guy who always invites me is my ideal type?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh~, Ayano isn&apos;t a strict person, anyway... What about Alya-san herself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A serious and honorable person who always strives to improve themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hee~&quot;</p>

<p>While a little surprised by Alisa&apos;s quick answer regarding such a topic, Yuki felt a little doubtful about the answer and tilted her head.</p>

<p>&quot;...Doesn&apos;t that mean that someone who is like you is Alya-san&apos;s ideal type of guy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s true. Isn&apos;t it important to have the same values?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s true, but...... considering Alya-san&apos;s personality, that type of person might be a good rival, but don&apos;t think you&apos;ll develop any romantic feelings for him.....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, in Alya-san&apos;s case, you might recognize and compete with that guy, but you&apos;ll never hold hands with him...&quot;</p>

<p>Upon hearing Yuki&apos;s words, Alisa&apos;s eyes widened in surprise and slowly put her hand on her chin. She then examined Yuki&apos;s words with a serious expression for a few seconds before nodding deeply.</p>

<p>&quot;...When I heard you say that, maybe there was some truth to it too. If that&apos;s the case, then ...a person who I can still respect, but has quite a friendly nature... Well, a person who is a bit extraordinary to the point of being unrivaled....&quot;</p>

<p>At the moment of saying that much, Alisa opened her eyes wide for a moment and raised her face. Then she combed her hair and made an indifferent face as if trying to cover up something.</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, that&apos;s not important at all. More than that, regarding Yuki-san&apos;s ideal type of guy...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What... ummm,... Do you have special feelings for someone?&quot;</p>

<p>When Alisa fiddled with the ends of her hair and glanced at her, Yuki could immediately guess her intentions and thought to herself, &quot;Ahh~ I see....&quot;</p>

<p>(I see. So she&apos;s wondering if I&apos;m going to be her love rival or not, huh?)</p>

<p>There was no doubt in Yuki&apos;s mind that Alisa had feelings for Masachika. Considering that, what Alisa really wanted to ask was, &quot;Do you like Masachika-kun too?&quot;. Plus, Yuki had once stated to Alisa that she loves Masachika. As for Alisa, she wanted to take this opportunity to confirm the truth... and that&apos;s exactly what she was doing right now.</p>

<p>(TN: iirc, Yuki said &quot;I love him a lot&quot; to Alya in V1 or V2, can&apos;t remember which. Now obviously she&apos;s saying that as a sibling but still said it anyway to troll her)</p>

<p>(Fumu.... I could&apos;ve just said firmly, &quot;I&apos;m just showing family love affection to Masachika-kun, you know~?&quot;)</p>

<p>Alisa would definitely feel relieved if she said that. Revealing their blood relation did sound quite interesting to Yuki, but....</p>

<p>(But that&apos;s too boring, isn&apos;t it~?)</p>

<p>(TN: hehe this is where the fun begins)</p>

<p>With a devilish smile in her heart, Yuki only showed a meaningful smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, I don&apos;t know~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&apos;re asking back... Isn&apos;t the point of a love chat to talk about that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehhh after all... it feels very embarrassing, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>While holding her cheeks with both hands, Yuki wiggled her body shyly. Yuki did not ignore the serious light that resided in the eyes of Alisa&apos;s eyes when she saw her.</p>

<p>(Kufufu, she misunderstood. Well that&apos;s how it is if there&apos;s a girl who behaves in this shy manner, you usually think, &quot;Don&apos;t you have the courage to say...?&quot; right~)</p>

<p>Yuki laughed evilly inwardly at the fact that she was capable of</p>

<p>making Alya misunderstand. All this for the sake of playing Alisa</p>

<p>...... no, all this for the sake of being able to help her beloved</p>

<p>brother&apos;s love life. Because the presence of a rival can always</p>

<p>accelerate the development of love. Yuki did not hesitate to play</p>

<p>the role of a rival in order to advance the romantic progress</p>

<p>between her brother and Alisa.</p>

<p>(Kuhehehe if Alya-san was officially dating Onii-chan... what kind of expression will she make when she finds out that I&apos;m actually the younger sister of her boyfriend?)</p>

<p>Yup... probably all for her own pleasure. Accompanied by an evil smile that looked like the devil inside her, Yuki pretended to be an innocent girl and looked at Alisa.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, if Alya-san wants to tell me first, I&apos;ll tell her too, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to hear Alya-san&apos;s love story.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you say that... I&apos;ve never been in love with a guy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh, really?&quot;</p>

<p>In response to Alisa&apos;s answer, Yuki opened her eyes in surprise and covered her mouth with her hand as she thought to herself, &quot;Which mouth said that?&quot;.</p>

<p>Alisa&apos;s lips pouted slightly dissatisfied with that very surprising reaction.</p>

<p>&quot;What the heck... it doesn&apos;t matter, right? Even if you&apos;ve never experienced falling in love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course it doesn&apos;t matter, but..... since Alya-san is so popular, I thought you might have experienced it at least once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all... After all, it&apos;s not like people who have a lot of romantic experiences look much better, right? For some reason, there&apos;s a social tendency that if someone doesn&apos;t have any love experiences, they&apos;ll be ridiculed or made fun of .... What the heck is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, ummm... well, having a lot of love experience means that you have a feminine charm... There are also people who just want to feel superior, so that they can outshine those around them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From my point of view, those types of people are like admitting that they don&apos;t maintain their own chastity.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa snorted with an annoyed expression, as if she had experienced being ridiculed like that. Yuki smiled wryly inwardly at the remark that was not suitable for love talk itself.</p>

<p>&quot;Ummm... by any chance, Alya-san is that kind of girl? The type who believes that you should keep your chastity until you get married?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wh-Were we talking about that too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s of course. Love talk is like that, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa turned her gaze with slightly flushed cheeks in response to that topic..... but Yuki nodded with a very natural smile. That clear smile of hers made Alisa a little indecisive and thoughtful.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, ummm... I wouldn&apos;t go that far anyway, but think only people who are already committed to each other would do something like that?&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps feeling embarrassed by what she said, Alisa sharpened her gaze while the blush on her cheeks intensified, and she continued to speak in a stronger tone.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean, any girl would dream of that, right? First falling in love with someone, then dating someone you love for the first time, and then getting married to that person, and then spending the rest of your life with him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm......&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki had trouble answering Alisa&apos;s straightforward statement. Well, she did understand what she wanted to say.</p>

<p>Dating the person you like for the first time, making love smoothly without cheating on each other, then getting married a few years later, and living happily ever after... I&apos;d say, it&apos;s a progression that can be described as a super smooth road in shoujo manga. So, it&apos;s not that she doesn&apos;t understand that statement reflects the ideal of all girls in the world. However...</p>

<p>(In some parts of the world, there are also girls who ideally want to be popular and be pampered by a good man, and there are many girls who think that marriage is about money, not love ..... In contrast, girls who cling to pure love are quite rare these days, aren&apos;t they?)</p>

<p>In fact, as someone who is surrounded by several girls who made such statements, she couldn&apos;t help but look at Alisa with a gentle gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;...What? What&apos;s with that look?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, no, it&apos;s nothing... I just thought that Alya-san turned out to be like the types of innocent girls who would like shoujo manga.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki&apos;s somewhat implied words made Alisa think to herself, &quot;For</p>

<p>some reason, I feel like I&apos;m being teased?&quot; and frowned. But to</p>

<p>discuss it, Alisa was still a little reluctant towards Yuki. Had she</p>

<p>gone up against Masachika, Alisa would have blasted him</p>

<p>mercilessly. However, Yuki seemed to sense something in Alisa&apos;s silence. She then took her eyes off Alisa and turned to Ayano, who was beside her.</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu, that&apos;s a very good way of thinking. Don&apos;t you think so too, Ayano?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano&apos;s eyes widened when she was suddenly asked to speak. She immediately tried to answer her master&apos;s question, but her mouth was already filled with donuts. It was rude of her to speak in such a state. However, despite trying to swallow it quickly, the donut still didn&apos;t pass easily down her throat. She still lacked the water to push it through.</p>

<p>&quot;!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano reached for the cup on the side table in search of water. However, when she realized that it contained orange juice, she picked up the cup and immediately stopped moving. Because the act of combining a sweet donut with orange juice was beyond Ayano&apos;s taste buds, she hesitated. However, when asked which should be prioritized between her taste and the situation where her employer was waiting...</p>

<p>&quot;Uh!~~~... Puha, yes, I think so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yup, for some reason, I&apos;m sorry?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki tilted her head in distress as Ayano poured the juice into her mouth in a horrible way.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Yuki-sama doesn&apos;t need to apologize at all. That&apos;s right. I completely agree with Alisa-san&apos;s opinion. After making a firm decision, I will devote myself completely. That&apos;s ideal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki tilted her head when she heard Ayano&apos;s words. Somehow, Ayano seemed to be talking about something other than love talk... But before the question could be answered, Alisa immediately replied to Ayano&apos;s opinion.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess that&apos;s what it is, isn&apos;t it! Devoting yourself to the one person you love for the rest of your life. That&apos;s what a woman should do!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see....&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano opened her mouth to Alisa&apos;s words... and was stunned. Her pupils pointed upwards at an angle and traced a semicircle around the ceiling. Then she tilted her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayano-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No... I feel that don&apos;t need to fixate on one person...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehhh.....&quot;</p>

<p>This time Ayano&apos;s words left Alisa stunned. Alisa&apos;s facial expression really looked like &quot;I was betrayed!&quot;, but Ayano&apos;s next words made her widen her eyes wide.</p>

<p>&quot;I think even two people are fine...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;T-Two people?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do have one body, but if I put in the effort, I can somehow handle it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Plus, at the same time!?&quot;</p>

<p>In Alisa&apos;s mind, she imagined Ayano flanked by two guys on either side of her and laughing coquettishly. Furthermore, Ayano&apos;s own statement of &quot;at the same time&quot; conjures up an image of Ayano dealing with two boys at the same time....... At the thought of that, Alisa&apos;s face immediately turned bright red. Then, Alisa sharpened her gaze and reflexively raised the tone of her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;D-Don&apos;t, that&apos;s not allowed! Ah, no, if the person themselves agrees with it, that&apos;s fine, but...... the point is, a student shouldn&apos;t behave immorally like that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;? Immoral?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;B-Because, two people at once...!&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa was unable to say anything further due to the perverted delusions that appeared in her brain. Incidentally, the vagueness of the entire imagination was not due to the self-imposed restrictions, but simply due to Alisa&apos;s lack of knowledge. After all, the limit of Alisa&apos;s knowledge in that area was at the level of shoujo manga, which only depicted the upper part of their bodies embracing each other...</p>

<p>(Maybe she was fantasizing like this~)</p>

<p>On the other hand, seeing Alisa&apos;s reaction like that, Yuki could imagine the scene of Ayano &quot;Ahhhnnn~&quot; or &quot;lyaaaaannnn~~~&quot; from the front and back. This imagination has a perfect scene in every detail. On the contrary, she had to limit herself more. Of course, Yuki realized that Ayano did not intend that way. She did realize it, but...</p>

<p>(Because it looks interesting, I&apos;ll just keep my mouth shut)</p>

<p>In front of Yuki who cruelly chose to remain silent, the conversation between the two people who were out of sync still continued.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought we didn&apos;t have to stick to men?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!? A girl is fine!? That means....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, Alisa-san is also included, really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, ehhhhhhhhh~~~~!?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa immediately fled to the bed while holding her body with both hands and screamed at the top of her lungs. Seeing that unexpected reaction, Ayano tilted her head curiously.</p>

<p>(... Yes... Maybe she&apos;s trying to say that if Alya-san marries Onii-chan, she would also give her dedication to her... Fatally, her words are still incomplete, anyway.)</p>

<p>Yuki instinctively looked at Ayano with a gentle gaze, but Ayano didn&apos;t seem to notice her master&apos;s gaze and blinked rapidly as if she had just thought about something.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right... then, there might be four people at the same time someday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um-. Four people...!? Ehh, how will you do it then?&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently, it was already too difficult to understand and this time she was really interested in that. While blushing, Alisa leaned back on the bed with furrowed eyebrows. On the other hand,</p>

<p>Ayano&apos;s gaze wandered around with an expressionless face as usual.</p>

<p>&quot;...Hmm, that&apos;s true. Maybe I guess two people take turns every day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-You want to do it in turn...!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, of course, if everyone lives together, that would be four people at the same time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Living together... ma-meaning a love nest...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if that&apos;s the case, I won&apos;t do it half-assedly, I will still serve wholeheartedly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you&apos;re still serving, huh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I&apos;ve received some training in such cases.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;T-Training... Funyaa~~&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently, her brain was completely over-capacity. Alisa&apos;s whole body was flushed as if she had been boiled, and she let out a soul-crushing cry and fell flat on her back on the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;! Alisa-san, are you alright? What exactly is...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Puhahahahahahaha...!&quot;</p>

<p>Ayano stared blankly at Alisa, whose eyesight seemed to be fogged up on the bed. Yuki, who could no longer stand the funny scene, started laughing out loud. Then, while wiping the tears from the corner of her eyes, she said to Ayano whose eyes were shaking with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>&quot;Fufufu... it looks like Alya-san is a little tired, huh? Oh yeah, Ayano, how about you take care of your future (temporary) master?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take care of her...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Specifically...&quot;</p>

<p>..After that.</p>

<p>About ten minutes later, Alisa&apos;s consciousness began to return and found herself lying on the bed on a pillow on Ayano&apos;s lap who was fanning her face..... thanks to the misunderstanding of various things, Alisa let out a strange scream.</p>
