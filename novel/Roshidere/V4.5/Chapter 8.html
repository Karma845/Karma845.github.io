<h3>Chapter 8 - Beautiful Girl and Gloomy Boy</h3>


<p>&quot;1-1-1-1-1-1-I like you! Pl-pl-pl-pl-pl-please date me!&quot;</p>

<p>Upon hearing this absurd and awkward (?) declaration of love, the first thing that crossed Chisaki&apos;s mind was &quot;What the heck is this guy talking about?&quot;</p>

<p>Taking place in the public discipline committee room of Seirei Gakuen High School, Chisaki, who was sitting on a chair, folded her hands while leaning her back on the backrest and looked at the boy in front of her.</p>

<p>At first glance, he looked like the introverted otaku type of guy. With a large body that looks slow and heavy, his body is equally large both vertically and horizontally. His hair was disheveled and unkempt, and he had an aged face like a middle-aged man with noticeable acne. The eyes behind the glasses restlessly glanced this way and that, and combined with his hunched back, he looked very frightened.</p>

<p>(I think I&apos;ve seen him before... though I&apos;ve never spoken to him, anyway)</p>

<p>Judging from the color of his tie, she could tell that they were in the same year, and she also remembered seeing him during middle school. However, they were never in the same class, and Chisaki was sure that they never exchanged words. So, why was this man suddenly visiting the public discipline committee room, and even confessing his feelings?</p>

<p>(...Maybe because he lost a punishment game? Was it not because of that? Or maybe, bullying?)</p>

<p>It&apos;s only been about a month since the new school year started. It was around this time when groupings were made and hierarchies within the class were established. As a result... sorry to speak harshly, this boy who seemed to be from the lowest caste, came to confess his feelings to a fierce member of the disciplinary committee as a form of punishment from a game or something like that.... Or so it seems.</p>

<p>(Again bullying... even though I thought I&apos;d destroyed most of them during middle school)</p>

<p>However, there are some students who apply externally when entering high school, and this is most likely the result of that. With this in mind, Chisaki asked directly to the boy in front of her.</p>

<p>&quot;...Is this some kind of punishment from a game? If it&apos;s bullying, I&apos;m willing to listen to your problems too, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh......&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing Chisaki&apos;s words, the boy in front of her opened his mouth for a moment... Immediately afterward, he shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;N-n-no! Th-That&apos;s not the case, I&apos;m serious...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki stared into his eyes, not understanding the meaning of his &quot;seriousness&quot;. Chisaki understood very well how the boys viewed her. She could find out such things by listening to the rumors around her. Based on the rumors, she was the demon sergeant of the public discipline committee. Or, there were also those who thought of her as the gang leader of the Seirei Gakuen girls.</p>

<p>Most of the guys&apos; feelings directed towards her were admiration, and Chisaki herself was satisfied with her current situation. It was ten thousand times better than being belittled by them. Precisely because she thought like that, she could not understand that there were boys who liked her.</p>

<p>If the person who confessed to her was an outside student who had just entered Seirei High School Gakuen, she could still understand it. Chisaki herself understood that she had a pretty face, so it was no wonder that someone would confess to her just by looking at her face. However, this boy in front of her was an internal student who had been here since junior high school.</p>

<p>&quot;You... What&apos;s your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, ah yes, my name is Kenzaki... Kenzaki Touya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... then Kenzaki. What do you like about me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, that...&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki asked with a cold-eyed look, Touya then answered timidly and bowed even more.</p>

<p>&quot;You look strong, dignified, and cool... but at the same time, look feminine too. If I&apos;m honest, I&apos;m captivated by your proud way of life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fuee, ah, hmm,...I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki was surprised by the answer filled with honesty and blunt praise like that. In fact, this was the first time Chisaki had been told a direct compliment from the opposite sex.</p>

<p>Of course, it was not that she had never received confessions of feelings. But most of them just said something like &quot;You don&apos;t have a boyfriend? You wouldn&apos;t mind being my girlfriend, would you?&quot; Or &quot;I quite like strong girls, be my girlfriend.&quot; Most of them were always trying to dominate Chisaki. Of course, those misunderstood boys were taught a lesson, then separated as burnable and non-burnable trash, but well, leave that aside for now.</p>

<p>Anyway, having unexpectedly received such a blunt compliment... Chisaki subconsciously felt happy.</p>

<p>&quot;Ehemm!&quot;</p>

<p>Then, when she cleared her throat to deceive herself, Chisaki pretended that she was not really caring, and started to say something.</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yes, I understand how you feel... but don&apos;t know you at all, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, t-that&apos;s obvious anyway...therefore, first of all, how about...we start off as friends first?&quot;</p>

<p>Over time, both Touya&apos;s body and voice grew smaller. His demeanor that was so cowardly and trembling with fear... overlapped with his former self and to her great annoyance, Chisaki then opened her mouth offensively.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t like guys who don&apos;t say things clearly and firmly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh, s-so yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I also hate guys who are always hesitant and cowardly. I also hate guys who are weak. Actually, hate guys in general, so how could possibly make you my boyfriend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Th-that&apos;s it, please give it some consideration...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...well, I understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, I&apos;ll start over from the beginning.&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that in a clearer tone than before, Touya bowed his head and left the room. Chisaki looked at his back with a dumbfounded expression....</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, does he seriously want to be student council president?&quot;</p>

<p>After muttering absentmindedly, Chisaki shook her head as she said, &quot;No, it&apos;s impossible, isn&apos;t it.&quot;</p>

<p>(He must have felt that I was not a quitter at all, so he just said that and just left.)</p>

<p>After saying that to herself, Chisaki tried to erase that intruder from her memory. She was oblivious to the fact that she was -in a sense-slightly attracted to the other party who was making such an effort.</p>

<p>◆◆◆◆</p>

<p>Then, about a month later.</p>

<p>fear, still did not back down, even though she had pushed him all the way. Then, the eyes that looked at her from behind his glasses made Chisaki a little shaken up again,.... he then turned his face away to hide himself, and said while waving a hand.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, how about you try it again after becoming a cooler guy? Hmm, that&apos;s right... like being the student council president? If you become the President of the Student Council President, I&apos;ll reconsider.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Student Council President!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, you can&apos;t do it?&quot;</p>

<p>Although she said it herself, Chisaki was well aware that her request was unreasonable. The value of being the student council president in this school was very high. Hence, there were many students aiming for the position, and it was obvious that if an ordinary and unexceptional student suddenly ran for it for the position, he would be completely crushed without being able to make it to the election stage.</p>

<p>However, that did not matter. It was just an off-the-cuff requirement that came out of her mouth, but it was not a bad reason to make Touya give up. When Chisaki thought so...</p>

<p>(That guy never really showed his nose again... even though he himself said that he liked me. No, I don&apos;t mind if he gave up anyway!)</p>

<p>After complaining in her brain, Chisaki patrolled around the school in a mood that was a little upset. Then from the nearby art room, she heard the sound of laughter between a male and female couple, Chisaki could only sigh lightly. Even in a prestigious school where many of the children of wealthy families attended, there were students like them. After school, there were some students who liked to meet secretly in club rooms or quiet classrooms.</p>

<p>However, engaging in indecent relationships within the school is an act of breaking school rules. Even if it&apos;s just a kiss, if a teacher finds out about it, one will suffer severe punishment.</p>

<p>(Geez, what&apos;s the point of being intimate at school, it&apos;s like there&apos;s nowhere else to go!)</p>

<p>With a feeling of exasperation, Chisaki swung the bamboo sword she had in her hand at the hallway. Prakkkk! A loud noise echoed in the hallway, and the male and female voices that were heard from the art room suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;The gates are about to close, you know!&quot;</p>

<p>While shouting loudly, Chisaki quickly left the place. Although it was the disciplinary committee&apos;s job to crack down on indecent relationships, she did not bother to step in and warn them. If they complied and went home quietly, that was fine. If they still don&apos;t want to go home, the risk is their own. If a teacher caught them, it was no longer Chisaki&apos;s business.</p>

<p>&quot;How ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p>There were many prominent politicians and businessmen among the graduates and parents of this school. In this school that received a lot of attention, if they were suspended from school, their future would be darkened. It is no exaggeration that their path to success would be sealed.</p>

<p>Who would want to take such a risk and get carried away with temporary passion? Would they be that stupid when their brains are fueled by the feelings of love? While thinking like that, she casually turned her attention outside the window...</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm...? Isn&apos;t that...&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki squinted at the two people in sports uniforms standing near the school gate. She then approached the window and stared at them for a few seconds, then realized that the two people were the student council president and vice president.</p>

<p>&quot;What are they doing?&quot;</p>

<p>They were standing side by side right outside the school gate and seemed to be waving or calling someone from the left side of Chisaki&apos;s perspective. As student council members, it was not unusual for them to remain at school after school. However, it was a different story when they were wearing sports uniforms near the school gate. Chisaki, who was looking at them with a puzzled look, saw the person they were talking to.</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh....?&quot;</p>

<p>The person who came running with a panting and exhausted look, who could even be seen from a distance, was the boy she had just imagined in her mind. Chisaki felt that his silhouette looked a little different, but she didn&apos;t mistake her guess when she looking at his large, hunched body. The boy put his hands on his knees and breathed in desperately, his back being patted by the two Senpai who were watching him.</p>

<p>Why would that guy be with two student council members? The answer was obvious. Because that guy is also a student council member. In other words, that means...</p>

<p>&quot;Is he seriously... intending to become student council president?&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki immediately shook her head as the words came out of her mouth. If that was the case, then what? There must be something wrong with that guy&apos;s mind for already taking the subtle rejection made on the spot seriously.</p>

<p>(It was just a pep talk after all, wasn&apos;t it? Taking that seriously is just weird... So, it&apos;s not all my fault)</p>

<p>Indeed, it wasn&apos;t her fault. Even though it&apos;s not her fault, but... maybe it wouldn&apos;t hurt to care about him a little.</p>

<p>With a slight feeling of guilt, Chisaki went downstairs to the first floor and bought a sports drink from the vending machine, then decided to wait for Touya at the entrance. However.... &quot;Your stamina is increasing, Kenzaki.&quot;</p>

<p>(If you aren&apos;t reading from here, <a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://glucosetl.wordpress.com/">https://glucosetl.wordpress.com/</a>, please leave and do so.)</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right, you haven&apos;t had much muscle pain lately either, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed... compared to a month ago.&quot;</p>

<p>At the sound of Touya&apos;s voice along with the other two, Chisaki immediately hid behind a shoe box. No, if she thought about it calmly again, she did not need to hide at all... as someone with a slight case of androphobia, it felt quite embarrassing for her to talk to a boy, or difficult to explain the situation...</p>

<p>(At this rate... I guess have no choice but to do it)</p>

<p>After much deliberation, Chisaki came to a decision as she put down the bamboo sword and sports drink on the spot, and then attacked the student council president and vice president who were changing their shoes and were about to head into the hallway of the school.</p>

<p>(TN: Well that went from 0-100 quickly)</p>

<p>&quot;Eh....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wha....&quot;</p>

<p>The sudden attack instantly dispelled their consciousness and made them lean gently on the shoe box.</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh? Senpai? What was that sound...&quot;</p>

<p>Then she heard Touya&apos;s voice from behind her, and when Chisaki turned around, their gazes met each other.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, Sarashina-san? Why...... what happened to the chairman and vice chairman!?&quot;</p>

<p>Touya suddenly turned his gaze on the two people leaning on the shoe box behind Chisaki. However, Chisaki did not pay much attention to that, and stood up with an indifferent expression as she picked up a sports drink with a grin on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Long time no see, huh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? Ah yes... it&apos;s been a long time. But umm, the president and vice president...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you join the student council? Since you&apos;re with the two of them, that means....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yes, that&apos;s it... so about those two...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? So you joined the student council, huh~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So-so rude and... so strong... I like it.&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: Yeah Touya is definitely a masochist)</p>

<p>&quot;H-Huh!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah sorry, I just let it slip.&quot;</p>

<p>When Chisaki cried out in confusion at the sudden confession, Touya&apos;s gaze wandered as if he was also feeling uneasy. When she saw his reaction like that, she could not even get angry with &quot;Don&apos;t tease me!&quot;. Chisaki glared at Touya sharply and raised her chin as if to push him away.</p>

<p>(TN: I think between the two, Touya&apos;s the bottomer)</p>

<p>&quot;By any chance, did you take what said the other day seriously? Just so you know, that was just a passing thought I said to get rid of you. So, if you&apos;re thinking of recklessly aiming for the student council president position, how about you stop that?&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki, who dared to say so arrogantly, decided to make a clear statement at this point, but... the reply she got was unexpected.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, ah... no, well, do have such feelings, but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh...&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki was taken aback by Touya&apos;s saying that with a troubled smile while scratching his cheek. Without looking at Chisaki&apos;s face, Touya continued slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well actually... of course, I had an ulterior motive to make Sarashina-san pay a little attention to me, but.... put that reason aside, I think this could be a good opportunity....... to change myself.&quot;</p>

<p>.Change yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yes, I realized that the person I am now isn&apos;t attractive enough as a man... so I thought, I can&apos;t go on like this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Even so, you still tried to confess your feelings to me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh! No, that&apos;s just, umm... because I&apos;ve heard that... one must tell his feelings to the girl he likes as soon as possible...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Isn&apos;t that assuming that you&apos;re already in some relationship with the related people?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I guess that&apos;s the case, huh...&quot;</p>

<p>Touya said that while dropping his shoulders in disappointment... but he then suddenly got up. Touya stared straight at Chisaki while his eyes were slightly trembling, he then told her in a voice that was slightly shaky but sounded clear.</p>

<p>&quot;But I don&apos;t regret it. Thanks to that, I got the chance to change myself! So umm, Sarashina-san doesn&apos;t have to bother worrying about me...&quot;</p>

<p>Touya suddenly lowered his tone of voice and looked away. Chisaki opened her eyes wide as she heard a remark that hit the nail on the head.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha-Huh!? Who&apos;s worried about you anyway! just thought that you took my joke seriously, so was just making sure of that, really!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh, isn&apos;t that the same as caring--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh~? Don&apos;t be absurd, how could care about a guy! Here, I&apos;m giving you this because I have a lot! Then, see you later!&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki spoke quickly while pushing the sports drink she was holding towards Touya, grabbed the lying bamboo sword, and rushed out of the place.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, but, the student council president and vice president....Oh, she ran away quickly--.&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki ran as fast as she could as if she did not want to hear Touya&apos;s voice. She ran with an anxious heart.</p>

<p>(Huh? Care? That&apos;s completely different! If I say that, won&apos;t care one bit anymore! No matter where or what that guy is doing, I&apos;d never cared at all!!)</p>

<p>Like a stubborn child, Chisaki swore silently. After that, Chisaki made every effort to avoid any contact with Touya, in accordance with her vow.</p>

<p>&quot;Chisaki- this week&apos;s patrol, it says we get to patrol the school grounds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will replace the person in charge inside the school building.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh?&quot;</p>

<p>After school, Touya would run outside the school. Chisaki completely avoided anything that would cause her to meet him there.</p>

<p>&quot;Sarashina, can I have a moment?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, what is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, please help me put up flyers during the Student Council President election period--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please just ask someone else to do that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh...oh, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>The chairman of the disciplinary committee made a confused face after being flatly rejected. But, what can be done? After all, the bulletin board recently had a small special feature about Touya in the school newspaper. Although she had tried to avoid Touya at all costs.... but, there were certain events that could not be avoided.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, next is the introduction speech of the student council treasurer, Kenzaki Touya.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a greeting from the student council officers at the closing ceremony of the first year. Hearing a familiar name being called, Chisaki reflexively tried to avert her eyes from the stage ..... But she felt surprised when she saw a figure coming out from backstage.</p>

<p>&quot;Nice to meet you all, my name is Kenzaki Touya, the Treasurer of the Student Council this year.&quot;</p>

<p>Is this what it means to be different? His body shape was clearly</p>

<p>different from one half a month ago. Although his body was still a</p>

<p>little chubby, his sluggish and disheveled aura had disappeared,</p>

<p>and the way he walked with his back straight and erect gave the</p>

<p>impression of an authoritative and dignified appearance.</p>

<p>Chisaki stared at the figure standing on the stage, forgetting to look away. At that moment Touya looked straight into Chisaki&apos;s eyes. It was not just her imagination. Because that was proven by Touya&apos;s next words.</p>

<p>&quot;I intend to run for student council president in next year&apos;s election, but I do not yet have a vice chair candidate to run with me. However, there is one person that I would like to make my partner. No, I can&apos;t imagine being paired with anyone but that person!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Touya&apos;s statement made Chisaki&apos;s heart beat wildly. And at the same time, the surrounding students......, especially the male students, showed a strange excitement that was strange.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ll do everything I can to make that person willing to be my partner!&quot;</p>

<p>What kind of declaration was that? While Chisaki thought so with a dazed expression, everyone around her clapped for Touya on stage. Being affected by the atmosphere around her, Chisaki had clapped a few times...and hastily lowered her hand. She could feel that her cheeks were burning. Whether it was due to reflexively clapping or something else...at that time, Chisaki could not tell.</p>

<p>◆◆◆◆</p>

<p>Then, the day after the opening ceremony after the summer vacation. Chisaki was genuinely surprised when Touya visited the public discipline committee room just as he had done in the past.</p>

<p>&quot;Sarashina-san! Please, are you willing to run as a candidate for vice president and participate in the student council president election together with me!&quot;</p>

<p>Touya bowed his head and seemed to be a completely different person from four months earlier. The fat covering his entire body had been completely removed and replaced by toned muscles. His hair was neatly arranged, and his eyes that looked straight at Chisaki, were filled with confidence.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, ummm...&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki was left speechless after seeing his drastic change and coughed once. Then, she forcefully turned her gaze towards Touya.</p>

<p>&quot;... Why? thought originally asked you to be the student council president, right? If I run together, wouldn&apos;t that be the same as me doing you a favor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I know that. But I can&apos;t think of anyone other than Sarashina-san as my partner!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohh...&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki instinctively looked away at those too straightforward and blunt words. Touya then gave a further explanation.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, if I win the election with Sarashina-san&apos;s help, I won&apos;t use it as a shield to force you into a relationship with me! But... I&apos;m no longer a cowardly or weak guy. And will continue to grow into a man who will be recognized by Sarashina-san! Are you willing to see my growth up close? Please!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;U-Ummm, well....&quot;</p>

<p>It sounded like a rather selfish request, but the straightforwardness of it made it impossible for Chisaki to simply refuse. Then, she realized that her mouth was again talking to itself and uttering strange conditions without permission.</p>

<p>&quot;You&apos;re not weak at all... Isn&apos;t that already obvious by looking at your current body? I guess have to prove it too... hmmm, right. I&apos;ll think about it if you manage to win a point from me in kendo.&quot;</p>

<p>Because she had already said it, Chisaki herself even thought &quot;What the hell am I talking about?&quot;. If she wanted to refuse, she</p>

<p>should have refused normally without giving any conditions. If she did that again, then...</p>

<p>&quot;...Alright, I understand. After school, I&apos;ll visit the Kendo Hall.&quot;</p>

<p>As expected, Toya agreed to that condition after two seconds of silence, he then bowed his head and left the room. While looking</p>

<p>at his back, Chisaki kept wondering, &quot;Why didn&apos;t I dare to refuse</p>

<p>him?&quot;</p>

<p>◆◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;So you&apos;re the one, huh! The brat who dared to approach Onee-sama!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ummm...&quot;</p>

<p>After school, Touya visited the kendo hall and looked very surprised. But naturally he reacted that way, because as soon as he entered, Touya was immediately ganged up on by an Ojou-sama with a ringlet hairstyle, or hanging rolls. Moreover, on either side of that Ojou-sama, three female students with strangely elegant standing postures (inexplicably standing in a karate stance) were lined up in a row. The atmosphere was really like his arrival had been eagerly awaited.</p>

<p>&quot;W-who do you mean by Onee-sama?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that obvious... when talking about Onee-sama, who else would it be but Chisaki Onee-sama desuwa!&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: uhh she&apos;s basically Beatrice from Re:ZERO I guess. Same hairstyle and ends every sentence with &quot;desuwa&quot;. Except maybe not a loli?)</p>

<p>&quot;S-So yeah...&quot;</p>

<p>Touya nodded his head as if overwhelmed by the Ojou-sama&apos;s strength. Then, the Ojou-sama shook out her hair roll as she said.</p>

<p>&quot;I know why you came here... roughly speaking, you want to challenge Oneesama, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Geez, what a person who doesn&apos;t recognize his own position!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is very troublesome, you know? Don&apos;t take Onee-sama lightly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you think that you can win easily because you&apos;re a man, you&apos;re dead wrong, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don&apos;t think so... Umm, why are you standing at an angle?&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: They are all currently standing in a fighting stance. You where your body is at an angle while one leg is in front and the back leg is holding more of your body weight?)</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s not important at all! If you want to challenge Onee-sama</p>

<p>Then, the Ojou-sama stopped her speech and snapped her fingers. Then, the girl with a cheerful-looking twintail style on her right shouted while puffing out her chest.</p>

<p>&quot;Shinbashi Ayame!&quot;</p>

<p>Next, the tomboyish girl farther to the right began to open her mouth, covering one eye with her hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Oomori Kikyou!&quot;</p>

<p>Followed by the bespectacled girl on the other side saying while pushing her glasses.</p>

<p>&quot;Kurasawa Hiiragi!&quot;</p>

<p>And finally, the Ojou-sama in the center came forward as she shook her hair roll.</p>

<p>&quot;Kiryuuin Sumire! How about you defeat us first, The Sisters of the Four Seasons, before you can fight Onee-sama desuwa!?&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: Is this a kendo club or a chuunibyou club?)</p>

<p>It was a truly impressive declaration of war, announced in a loud and booming voice. In fact, it felt like there was going to be an explosion behind them. When hearing a nickname similar to the Four Heavenly Generals of the demon king army, Touya&apos;s reaction was...., taking a step back and turning his head toward Chisaki, who was slapping her forehead behind the four of them.</p>

<p>&quot;Ummm, Sarashina-san... Who are these lively people?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...They are all members of my competition team in the kendo</p>

<p>club back in middle school&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Then why were you called Onee-sama earlier?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, don&apos;t get the wrong idea, okay? We are neither blood relations nor sworn sisters, nothing like that, okay? First of all, that Sumire is older than me in terms of birthdays, and although she calls herself &apos;Sumire&apos; to conform to the people around her, her real name is Viole--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t just ignore us and talk to Onee-sama!&quot;</p>

<p>As she leaned forward to block Touya&apos;s view, Vio-... Sumire raised her voice. Then, she snapped her fingers again, and a petite girl who referred to herself as Ayame stepped forward.</p>

<p>&quot;If you want to fight Onee-sama, beat me first!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;E-Ehhh...?&quot;</p>

<p>Touya stared at the girl in front of him, his voice trembling with confusion. Even according to a rough estimate, the height difference between the two of them was more than 30 cm. Even if excluding the difference in gender, it was hard to believe that they could compete fairly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, well... if you say that...&quot;</p>

<p>Still, assuming that the conversation would not be able to continue, Touya decided to engage her, but...</p>

<p>&quot;Hmph! Just a big mouth!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hah, I didn&apos;t expect it to end in one punch...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a disappointment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ara ara, it&apos;s just a tree standing there gawking.&quot;</p>

<p>It was an instant defeat. As soon as the signal was shouted, his opponent disappeared from his sight and...... he was immediately followed by a stab in the neck, and the match was over just like that.</p>

<p>&quot;Goho, gah, ughh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wha-are you alright-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Onee-sama! Don&apos;t show mercy to the opponent, desuwa!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, but it&apos;s getting too-&quot;</p>

<p>Touya coughed in a crouching position, and Chisaki, who was worried about him, tried to rush towards him. ...... but before that, Sumire stood in his way. She then looked straight at Chisaki as she whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;(A woman shouldn&apos;t show sympathy to a man who&apos;s already made up his mind. Showing compassion is tantamount to underestimating his his determination desuwa.)&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!!&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki was stunned when she heard Sumire&apos;s words. Then, while Chisaki stood stunned, Touya got up himself and wielded his bamboo sword again.</p>

<p>&quot;Uhuk, uhuk,... let&apos;s do one more round!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hee, you still dare to fight me? Well whatever, I&apos;ll hit you again and again until you feel satisfied!&quot;</p>

<p>As per the declaration, Touya was forced to lick the ground for the next two hours. However, Touya neither despaired nor gave up. He continued to go to the kendo hall and challenge The Sisters of the Four Seasons. Later, he managed to defeat them one by one...</p>

<p>&quot;I can finally face you, Sarashina-san.&quot;</p>

<p>By the time Touya challenged Chisaki to a duel, it was already October, but that was no reason for Chisaki to give in to him.</p>

<p>&quot;...I&apos;ll come back later.&quot;</p>

<p>Although Touya had improved his skills in kendo against The Sisters of the Four Seasons, he was constantly defeated by Chisaki. During this time, Chisaki did not exchange a single word with Touya, but she did not refuse to fight him and continued to beat him with all her might. If she did not submerge her heart in this way, she might have been filled with uncomfortable feelings. But one day, suddenly.</p>

<p>(Ah, the exam is soon.... His forearm... he needs to study hard too...)</p>

<p>Touya put all his strength into his arm to attack the mask, and in that split second, he tried to aim his bamboo sword at Chisaki&apos;s empty arm. Suddenly, such a thought crossed her mind. And then, that momentary hesitation caused her grip to loosen, and Chisaki&apos;s small hand split the air. Immediately afterward, Touya&apos;s bamboo sword was swung downward and...</p>

<p>Plangg!</p>

<p>Chisaki&apos;s head received a light impact. The impact was too light... to be judged as a blow.</p>

<p>&quot;.... Haa?&quot;</p>

<p>Her opponent held back. As soon as that possibility crossed his mind, the emotions that Chisaki was suppressing exploded.</p>

<p>&quot;Hahhhh~~~~!?&quot;</p>

<p>With a mixture of contempt and anger in her voice, Chisaki grabbed the bamboo sword that hit her head, grabbed it forcefully, and threw it at Touya.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by that, hahh!?&quot;</p>

<p>She glared at Touya through her metal mask angrily, and Touya, who caught the bamboo sword in his arms, cried out in panic.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, ah, I&apos;m sorry! I know that it&apos;s rude to hold back on you or something like that, but just as was thinking of hitting the girl I like with all my strength, my body suddenly held back...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wh-What!!!&quot;</p>

<p>In response to those words, Chisaki was rendered speechless..... her teeth chattered, and then she cried out to express things.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhhhh~~, uuuu! Whatever! I lost because of a violation! Student Council President election!? Alright, who&apos;s afraid! I accept your offer to be the vice-chairman candidate!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, ah... ho-hoorayyy!&quot;</p>

<p>After a moment of confusion, Touya raised both his hands like a child. At the sight of the scene she exhaled angrily, Sumire, who was acting as referee, called out to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Onee-sama, are you sure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, no problem, really?&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki said that by looking away, even though she was wearing a mask so that her face was not too visible.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we&apos;re just running for the student council president election, right? Dating is a different story.&quot;</p>

<p>As she continued to speak quickly, Chisaki realized that she was making excuses for herself.</p>

<p>&quot;I did it!!!!!!</p>

<p>With his protective suit on, Touya made a victory pose as if someone would think that he had won a gold medal in the Olympics. Looking at him from the side, Chisaki foresaw that in the not-too-distant future, she really wanted to be able to run in the election together with Touya.....</p>

<p>◆◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;So, you know what? Touya got cooler and cooler after that....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uhh, yeah, that&apos;s something to be thankful for...&quot;</p>

<p>Located in the large arena of a dojo owned by the Sarashina family. In the audience, Chisaki was talking to her cousin, whom she had not seen for a long time, in a happy tone. However, the expression on her cousin&apos;s face was twitching and stiff. That was because...</p>

<p>&quot;Ummm? Chisaki-neechan. That cool boyfriend of yours is likely to get killed in the elimination round, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gosh~ What are you talking about? How could Touya, who managed to beat me, lose so easily~~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, even if you say he beat you, it was only a victory because of Chisaki-neechan&apos;s offense alone, right...? Furthermore, this match is hand-to-hand combat.&quot;</p>

<p>Her cousin looked anxiously at Touya who was in the center of the arena, his face clearly puckered and pale. In front of him, a man who was even bigger and more muscular than Touya, was staring at him with a sharp, bloodthirsty gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;That opponent, isn&apos;t that guy the student from our dojo who was beaten to a pulp by Chisaki-neechan back in the day, right? For some reason, he gave off an air that seems to be no joke.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so? I don&apos;t remember at all. Touyaaa~~ Fight~~!&quot;</p>

<p>Chisaki innocently encouraged Touya while saying something outrageous. In response, Touya raised his right hand with a stiff smile, and the murderous air of the opponent in front of him intensified.</p>

<p>&quot;I-I think it&apos;s too impossible for an amateur to participate in a martial arts festival, even if it&apos;s just the amateur division... ...Hey-Hey, wouldn&apos;t it be better if we just stop the match now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh~~? But Touya seemed really excited about it, really~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, if his girlfriend encourages him like that, a man has no choice other than to do it!!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s true, isn&apos;t it, he looks so manly and cool, doesn&apos;t he~~?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhh you pussycat!!!&quot;</p>

<p>The referee declared the start of the match, ignoring the concerns of Chisaki&apos;s cousin. The result... Well, let&apos;s just say that when Touya collapsed, his body fell forward. After that, his opponent was planted in the corner of the arena by Chisaki, who intervened and barged in after the match.</p>

<p>(TN: Now that I think of it, Chisaki and Touya really resemble the student council president and her childhood friend from the manga series &quot;Aishiteru Game no Owarasetai&quot;.)</p>
