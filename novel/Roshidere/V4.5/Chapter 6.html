<h3>Chapter 6 - Warehouses and Locked Rooms</h3>

<p>&quot;Geez, you&apos;re so shy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What can I do? I want to try it once in a while...&quot;</p>

<p>After finishing their work on the roof, Masachika and Alisa headed to the schoolyard. Their destination was the sports equipment warehouse.</p>

<p>Of the five remaining mysteries, &quot;The disembodied cat&quot; and &quot;The sound of sobbing from the clubhouse&quot; could be investigated during the daytime. They then decided to investigate these two places separately. Basically, they were divided by couples for the election campaign, Maria was asked to go to the club building, given the wide scope of the investigation.</p>

<p>&quot;Impulsively shouting or something, it&apos;s not just endangering people, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...But yeah, I&apos;ve adjusted it so that those below can&apos;t hear it, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>While debating such things, they finally arrived at the sports equipment warehouse. When the heavy metal door was opened, dusty air rushed out, and they both reflexively frowned. The light coming in through the entrance clearly illuminated the dust flying in the air, and it was very bad for one&apos;s health.</p>

<p>&quot;Uwaahh... do we have to check inside this room?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Complaining is also pointless. Let&apos;s quickly start the investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Once inside, the first thing they needed to do was listen carefully for whether they could hear any meowing sounds or not.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Nyan</p>

<p>&quot;Just now, I heard something!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, from which direction?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please be quiet first!&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika approached Alisa and tried to listen along...</p>

<p>&quot;Yosh~ just a little bit more!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let&apos;s get your spirit out!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ohh!&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: Sounds from the sports club outside)</p>

<p>&quot;Fuuu, it&apos;s so noisy outside! Masachika-kun, please close the door!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Okay.&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika closed the heavy sliding door at the behest of an exasperated Alisa.</p>

<p>Soon, the air inside the warehouse was cut from the air outside and became stuffy making the warehouse even hotter again. But they endured for a while and listened carefully.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>However, despite having focused all their attention on their hearing for about 20 seconds, Masahika and Alisa could only hear the sound of the athletic club&apos;s activities. In the end, Alisa exclaimed in dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>&quot;Now I can&apos;t hear it anymore... haaah, even though I&apos;m sure that I heard it earlier ....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind, let&apos;s just open the door first... look, it&apos;s hot and dark in here, right?&quot;</p>

<p>While calming and persuading Alisa, Masachika tried to open the sliding door... *Bruuk*!</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>The door didn&apos;t move at all and stopped when there was a slight gap between the doors.</p>

<p>&quot;Is something wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, actually...&quot;</p>

<p>While thinking that it was impossible, Masachika grabbed the handle with both hands and pulled with all his might, but the door still wouldn&apos;t open.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh yeah, seriously...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... Unfortunately, that&apos;s the way it is.&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika ceded his place to Alisa, who approached him with an impatient and half-suspicious gaze.</p>

<p>However, the door still wouldn&apos;t open even if it was someone else opening.</p>

<p>At that moment, Masachika&apos;s smartphone vibrated lightly. When he took it out of his pocket and looked at it, he immediately saw a message from Yuki. [Hello~ back again with Yuki-chan, a very understanding little sister.]</p>

<p>Masachika spontaneously wanted to throw his smartphone. But he held back his will and waited for the next message to come in. Soon after, the next message came.</p>

<p>[For the sake of cowardly Onii-chan who dared not do</p>

<p>anything about Alya-san despite bringing her home so</p>

<p>many times, I&apos;ve prepared a wonderful special event for</p>

<p>you.]</p>

<p>No, they&apos;re already doing something similar to their date the other day.</p>

<p>Although his memory was lost halfway through.</p>

<p>However, Yuki shouldn&apos;t have known that, so Masachika didn&apos;t comment anything.</p>

<p>[That&apos;s right, it&apos;s a mix of a good old-fashioned romantic comedy clich&eacute; scene called &quot;You can&apos;t get get out of the gymnasium warehouse before cumming---&quot;]</p>

<p>(TN: I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>&quot;To hell with it!&quot;</p>

<p>After reading that far, Masachika mercilessly threw his smartphone.</p>

<p>Masachika&apos;s smartphone was buried inside the large blue mat used for the high jump landings. At the same time, Alisa turned around and her shoulders jerked, startled as she suddenly heard a strange sound.</p>

<p>&quot;Wh-What? What&apos;s wrong with you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...No, it&apos;s nothing. I&apos;m just a little upset about not being able to contact Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p>Actually, Masachika could contact her. However, contacting the culprit wouldn&apos;t help at all. Now that I think about it, the cat&apos;s voice that Alisa heard was also quite suspicious. It would be more reasonable to assume that the cat&apos;s voice was just Yuki&apos;s subterfuge being played through her smartphone.</p>

<p>It was all in order to get Masachika and Alisa to close the door of the gymnasium. Then, she could just lock them both in from the outside.</p>

<p>(Imouto yooooo0000000000!!!)</p>

<p>Masachika gritted his teeth to keep his voice down and shouted only in his. In front of him, a message came into his smartphone.</p>

<p>[Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll release you guys at the right time so you don&apos;t get heatstroke.]</p>

<p>(That doesn&apos;t help much anyway!)</p>

<p>[So, in the meantime, try to pet or groom one of her oppai. If you want to, you can go too far with the petting, right?&quot;]</p>

<p>(How could I possibly do that!!)</p>

<p>(TN: I mean he does eventually (This story takes place before the training camp).)</p>

<p>Exhaling a rough, ragged breath between clenched teeth, Masachika took back his smartphone. Then Alisa raised her voice while shaking her head left and right.</p>

<p>&quot;...It&apos;s useless, I can&apos;t contact Masha.&quot;</p>

<p>.That&apos;s it.&quot;</p>

<p>It was just as Masachika had expected.</p>

<p>There was a possibility Yuki had handled that too. It was possible that she also notified the athletic club outside by saying, &quot;There might be a little commotion in the warehouse, but please don&apos;t think too much about it~&quot; So, Masachika&apos;s chosen course of action was...</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, I already sent a message to the student council group. After all, someone will definitely come here after the investigation in other places is over, and we just need to wait until then.&quot;</p>

<p>He could not help but say that.</p>

<p>&quot;Waiting... Can&apos;t we just shout for help from outside?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Better not do that. There&apos;s a chance that they won&apos;t be able to hear it, and it will make you thirsty and hot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmp......&quot;</p>

<p>The fact that there was no way to refill her thirst made Alisa close her mouth. After that, she silently pondered for about ten seconds if she could escape, but she shrugged her shoulders in resignation at not being able to think of anything.</p>

<p>&quot;... Then, let&apos;s go find the cat until help arrives.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you&apos;re really diligent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell? It&apos;s not like that&apos;s what we came here for in the first place, and actually heard the cat&apos;s voice earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ummmm, well... that&apos;s just because...</p>

<p>In Masachika&apos;s opinion, there was a possibility that the cat&apos;s voice was the work of Yuki. Since he could not provide any evidence or basis for his guess, Masachika could only nod his head ambiguously. Perhaps taking this as affirmation, Alisa pressed the switch next to the door and tried to turn on the fluorescent light, but</p>

<p>&quot;...Ara?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, if I&apos;m not mistaken the lighting here is turned off, huh...&quot;</p>

<p>One of the two fluorescent lights mounted on the ceiling were completely extinguished, and the other only emitted a dim, bright orange-colored light, which barely did not function as illumination.</p>

<p>Now that the door was closed, the only decent source of light was the small window placed high on the wall. The illumination was also largely obstructed by the piles of various equipment piled up in front of it.</p>

<p>Thanks to that, they could still at least see each other, but the area near the warehouse wall melted into darkness.</p>

<p>.... Look, this room is too dark to look for cats. So we&apos;d better be quiet okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who says we can&apos;t? We can still use the flashlight on our smartphones. Let&apos;s find the cat quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehhh~...&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa started looking for the cat like a model student, despite Masachika&apos;s attempts to persuade her.</p>

<p>At this point, Masachika couldn&apos;t stay silent and was forced to start the search. Somehow they split up and searched left and right. After searching for the cat for about five minutes,</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s hot!&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika couldn&apos;t bear to take off his blazer because of the hot air in the warehouse, where he could neither find nor hear the cat meow. He also took off his tie, hooked it on a nearby basket for balls, and grabbed the chest area of his shirt to fan himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Haaa... although the Chairman is working on it, we still have to wait for the summer uniforms to be replaced, huh?...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...That&apos;s right, the current uniforms are definitely too hot.&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika glanced at her as Alisa replied approvingly to his ramblings, which he did not really expect a response from her. Then, Alisa was about to take off her blazer like Masachika.</p>

<p>She also took off her ribbon tie, unbuttoned the shoulder straps of her jumper skirt, and just removed half of her upper body, then exhaled lightly and fanned her face with her hands.</p>

<p>(Uuuhh......)</p>

<p>Seeing that voluptuous figure.... made Masachika inevitably remember...the hypnosis incident that happened in the student council room about a month ago, and he felt awkward.</p>

<p>Whether it was because she could feel Masachika&apos;s gaze or some other cause, at the moment when their gazes met, Alisa furrowed her brows and she quickly turned her upper body as if to protect her own</p>

<p>&quot;Hey... don&apos;t look over here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Ohh, sorry...&quot;</p>

<p>No, she wasn&apos;t wearing any strange clothes. If you looked at the clothes alone, the uniform was not much different from a typical school summer uniform. But somehow she strangely looked very erotic even though she only took off her blazer.</p>

<p>(Geez at this rate, I&apos;d rather concentrate on finding the cat.)</p>

<p>Deciding that in his heart, Masachika started his search again... but...</p>

<p>&quot;...Still can&apos;t find anything, huh.&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika had searched here and there, opening and closing the various sports equipment in the warehouse, but he still couldn&apos;t find the cat.</p>

<p>However, since the name of the seven mysteries was &quot;disembodied cat&quot;, it was only natural that he was could not find it easily.</p>

<p>&quot;The only area left is the top, huh...?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika looked up at the shelf, which was about the height of his own head, and frowned.</p>

<p>There were small cone-shaped tools, wheels with bent spokes, and cardboard boxes with unknown contents... ... in other words, there were many things that were not usually used, and unpacking just one of them seemed to be a very troublesome task.</p>

<p>(... Besides, since we will also be conducting the investigation at night, it&apos;s not like we could do it with three people at that time?)</p>

<p>I shouldn&apos;t bother doing it in a hot and humid atmosphere like this... while thinking so, Masachika turned to look at Alisa to ask her opinion too.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Al-....&quot;</p>

<p>Then, he swallowed back his words when he saw Alisa who was crawling under the obstacle bars placed collectively on the wall, exploring the depths of something.</p>

<p>Alisa&apos;s butt trembled and swayed with the sound of the bars</p>

<p>clashing against each other. It swayed to the right and left...</p>

<p>to the point of fluttering the hem of her skirt. Probably</p>

<p>because her upper body was bent over so that her back</p>

<p>wouldn&apos;t hit the crossbar .... Masachika could see her</p>

<p>panties, which he couldn&apos;t in normal circumstances.</p>

<p>(... Seriously, here?)</p>

<p>Masachika&apos;s mouth frowned at the unexpected opportunity to catch a glimpse of Alisa&apos;s panties.</p>

<p>Inside the room filled with stale air, he felt that Alisa&apos;s buttocks were slightly quivering as it swayed, as if inviting him to join in.</p>

<p>How exciting it was to see sweat dripping down her plump, smooth white thighs, which appeared faintly in the darkness. Ahh, he must see with his own eyes himself where the sweat came from--</p>

<p>&quot;...Uhukksph!&quot;</p>

<p>While letting out a sound that sounded like a loud cough, Masachika punched his forehead and pushed away his perverted, evil thoughts. Then, while exhaling, he tried to cool down his brain that was boiling from the heat.</p>

<p>(C-Calm down... catching a glimpse of a girl&apos;s butt is just a lewd lucky event that was unintentional. When you try to look at it directly, it&apos;s no longer called catching a glimpse! That&apos;s already peeping!)</p>

<p>Masachika reprimanded himself with an argument that might make one wonder if that was the case. Pressing his fist to his forehead, Masachika glared at Alisa&apos;s skirt.</p>

<p>(No matter how big the gap is, taking advantage of it to peek at it is an outrageous act! Doing so could destroy the trust I have with Alya... so I would never do that! Never.... but still, her legs are really smooth)</p>

<p>The thighs that are tightened by her knee socks, and the way they rub against each other was strangely sexy. Inevitably Masachika&apos;s gaze tried to follow how the plump thighs collided with each other and changed shape.</p>

<p>(... yup, it&apos;s not called peeping. In other words, ..... its still considered safe, right?)</p>

<p>Masachika looked at Alisa&apos;s legs as if in a daze and hurriedly hit his forehead again with his fist. At that moment, the smartphone in his hand shook, and made Masachika gasp in surprise. His reaction was as if he had been poked and woken up when caught sleeping in class.</p>

<p>Masachika took out his smartphone as his eyes wandered here and there for no reason, and realized that he had received another message from Yuki.</p>

<p>[When Alya-san is on all fours, the curve of her buttocks is clearly visible to the point of making the center of your crotch preyed upon--]</p>

<p>While reading it that far, Masachika quietly turned off the screen of his smartphone. Then, feeling very awkward and embarrassed, he looked around to see if his little sister was watching him from somewhere...</p>

<p>&quot;...Hy-Hyaa!&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika reflexively turned around at the sudden shout. When he turned around, he saw Alisa, who in an attempt to crawl out, had hit the bar by accident.</p>

<p>Alisa&apos;s skirt fluttered conspicuously as she retreated hastily</p>

<p>&quot;!!!?&quot;</p>

<p>Barely getting back the event of catching a glimpse of a girl&apos;s butt, Masachika quickly looked up. However, Alisa didn&apos;t seem to care about any of that, and hurriedly ran towards him with a shuddering expression, then embraced Masachika&apos;s arms with both hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Wh-What? What&apos;s wrong!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;R-Rat, there&apos;s a rat...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? A rat..?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika raised his eyebrows and looked at Alisa, who looked up and stared into his eyes.</p>

<p>There, Alisa seemed to realize that she was now holding on to Masachika, and after looking at her own hands in shock for a moment, hurriedly let go.</p>

<p>Then, as she hugged herself with her hands to stifle the feeling of goosebumps, she pointed behind the obstacle bars with an expression of fear and disgust.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, back there... there seems to be a rat carcass...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Ueehh, seriously?&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika frowned at the word that gave a physiological disgust that was called a small animal carcass. However, Alisa glanced at him with a look of &quot;You should check it out too&quot; and reluctantly.... he picked up his smartphone and walked towards the obstacle course equipment.</p>

<p>&quot;Ups...&quot;</p>

<p>He then crawled over, tucked his body under the obstacle course, and slowly illuminated the wall. Then......</p>

<p>&quot;Ughh... !!&quot;</p>

<p>On the right side, Masachika saw it behind the large rope used for tug-of-war and shouted. He hurriedly pulled himself out from underneath the obstacle bars and returned near Alisa&apos;s feet.</p>

<p>&quot;...it&apos;s there, isn&apos;t it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I mean, it&apos;s there. Ughh~ so disgusting.&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika himself had never seen a rat. Because he had never seen one, he had a vague impression that rats were filthy creatures... but when he saw one that had turned into a carcass, he couldn&apos;t help but feel disgusted.</p>

<p>&quot;Ughh... but isn&apos;t this proof the cat really existed? I feel that the mouse carcass had bite marks on it...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;T-That&apos;s true too... but we can&apos;t just take a photo of it and treat it as evidence, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course. Even with a mosaic, that photo would cause an uproar...... and I&apos;m sure that no one would want to go near the sports equipment warehouse.&quot;</p>

<p>(TN: Mosaic is pixelated censorship, with the other 2 censorships being a few horizontal lines and complete whiteout, if you understand what I mean ;)</p>

<p>They both shuddered as they rubbed their arms. It was already a completely different terrifying experience from the seven mysteries.</p>

<p>Due to the goosebump sensation that ran up his spine and the unpleasant perspiration oozing out from all over his body, Masachika walked quickly towards where his blazer was hanging. He then unbuttoned his shirt and took it off.</p>

<p>&quot;Ughhh~~ so disgusting! I&apos;m dripping with sweat!&quot;</p>

<p>Then, when Masachika was wearing only his undershirt, he took out his handkerchief from his pants pocket and wiped the sweat from his neck to his chest.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey...! Don&apos;t suddenly take off your clothes like that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa then let out a panicked voice, and Masachika turned around while wiping the sweat from on his face. Then, Alisa&apos;s anxious gaze went everywhere in the darkness.</p>

<p>&quot;No, it&apos;s not like I&apos;m going to take off more than this, okay? Besides, it won&apos;t be too visible, right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Although I can&apos;t see it, .... but that&apos;s not the case, you know!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, at the training camp we&apos;ll be wearing swimsuits, right? In other words, my upper body will be naked...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-You know what, if you suddenly take off your clothes in a closed room like this, any girl would definitely feel wary!&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika immediately fell silent when he heard Alisa&apos;s words.</p>

<p>It was true, if a guy suddenly started taking off his clothes when they were alone in a closed room, any girl would feel threatened. Even if it was with someone they knew.</p>

<p>&quot;...I guess there&apos;s some truth to that. Sorry, I&apos;m not being sensitive at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, y-yes... Well, it&apos;s fine anyway...&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa awkwardly answered Masachika, who honestly bowed his head. Then she continued by mumbling in Russian.</p>

<p>{My heart is on edge, you know...?}</p>

<p>(In the sense of being alert, right?)</p>

<p>His brain immediately made a practical interpretation and Masachika brilliantly ignored the mumbling. For a few seconds, a strange and indescribable atmosphere filled the sports equipment warehouse. However, Masachika suddenly grinned and said something to change the atmosphere.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if it was said by a weak and innocent girl, it wouldn&apos;t matter, but if it was Alya says it, it feels a bit strange~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? What does that mean?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all, you have a criminal record of knocking a guy unconscious in his room...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, that&apos;s just because...&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa stammered as she recalled what happened in Masachika&apos;s room a few days ago. After a few seconds of her gaze wandering restlessly, Alisa glared at Masachika.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s because you did something to ruin the atmosphere!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Did I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>

<p>With a sharp jerk, she turned away as if to imply that this conversation was over. Masachika smiled wryly as he said&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll just take that this time&quot; at the way Alisa ended the conversation forcefully, but....</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/fNmcYVQ/u67551-a3461412-6a9e-4116-aff0-fdcc2212e61c.jpg">

<p>{If only the atmosphere was nicer... I would too...}</p>

<p>The sudden murmur of Russian made his smile harden.</p>

<p>(Oops? What does that mean?)</p>

<p>I&apos;ll also... What does that mean? If Masachika hadn&apos;t done something to ruin the atmosphere, what would have happened next? In the darkness, Alisa&apos;s expression could not be seen clearly. Although he couldn&apos;t see it, judging by her habit of playing with the ends of her hair, Maschika believed that Alisa must be...</p>

<p>&quot;Nyaan&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment, they turned around as if being played by the sound of a cat meow that suddenly came from the upper right area. Then, at the pile of cardboard boxes loaded on the shelf. They saw a black cat there.</p>

<p>Suddenly confronted with the cat, Masachika and Alisa stared at the cat without a sound. It seemed like this was an accidental encounter for the cat as well, and it was staring at the two of them as if to say, &quot;There&apos;s something here!&quot;. They then continued to stare at each other for a few seconds.</p>

<p>Masachika, who realized first, was about to raise his smartphone to take a picture of the cat, but the cat suddenly bent down in front of him. Then, half a second when Masachika was stopped by a cat that seemed ready for a battle, the cat turned away and disappeared into the back of the cardboard box.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>After letting out a disappointed sound, Masachika rushed towards the place where the cat had disappeared. Then, as he moved the cardboard box where the cat had been hiding,... a dazzling light entered his field of vision and reflexively squinted.</p>

<p>&quot;...what is this?&quot;</p>

<p>There, behind the square hole in the wall.... There was something that looked like a rain cover with a downward opening. When jumping lightly, one can see the ground outside through that hole.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? In other words, is this the hole where the ventilation fan used to be...?&quot;</p>

<p>Somehow, that&apos;s what Masachika felt. On closer inspection, there were traces of something stuck to the edge of the hole.</p>

<p>&quot;Does that mean she goes in and out of here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it seems so...&quot;</p>

<p>When he casually turned to Alisa, who came next to him... Masachika was stunned for a few seconds, and then quietly started forward back. The reason why he was acting like that was because</p>

<p>(Uwaaaahhhhhhhh her uniform is really transparent)</p>

<p>In other words, that was the problem. Alisa&apos;s upper body was illuminated by the light that came in through the hole. The yellow lace could be clearly seen through her clothes that were wet, soaked with hot sweat and cold with fear. In addition, the shirt was completely clung to her skin and displayed.... incredible curves. Those curves were too stimulating for a pubescent teenage boy.</p>

<p>(TN: There&apos;s a colored illustration of this on the illustration page)</p>

<p>(After trying to avoid the incident of catching a glimpse of her button-down, I unexpectedly experienced a &apos;seeing her bra through her transparent clothes&apos; event)</p>

<p>While Masachika was doing some kind of nonsense monologue about the unexpected situation, Alisa, who seemed oblivious to Masachika&apos;s agitation, let out a sigh of relief when a light breeze blew through the hole.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, it feels a little cool.&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika actually felt that his body was getting hotter. His head almost felt like boiling again at such an unexpected stroke of luck, but for the time being, he quietly put the cardboard back to avoid the poisonous sight in his eyes.</p>

<p>Then, while pretending not to notice Alisa&apos;s gaze, which seemed to be conveying &quot;Even though the air is getting cooler, why did you suddenly close it&quot;, Masachika turned his face away and began to put the various objects that he had moved back into place.</p>

<p>&quot;...well, since we&apos;ve already found the culprit of the cat&apos;s meowing sound... if we close the hole there, the cat definitely won&apos;t be able to get in and out as it pleases anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</p>

<p>Alisa began to clean up as well while tilting her head at Masachika, who suddenly lowered his tone of voice. Then, when they were almost done cleaning up most of the mess over the next few minutes, they could hear Yuki&apos;s voice from outside.</p>

<p>&quot;Masachika-kun, Alya-san? Ara? Why is the key...&quot;</p>

<p>After hearing that voice, which could only be described as bland from Masachika&apos;s point of view, there was the sound of the door being opened with a clank. Masachika shrugged his shoulders as he muttered &quot;Yare~, yare~, finally got out too&quot;... but immediately realized that it was a bad idea.</p>

<p>(Wait a minute... it&apos;s going to be a disaster if we let Alya out in this state!)</p>

<p>Although the possibility of this happening was very small, if there were male students who were near them while she was out, it would really be an accident, and even if it wasn&apos;t, Yuki would definitely tease Masachika if she saw her.</p>

<p>She would say something like, &quot;Hmm? So, how does it feel to be with Alya-san whose clothes are almost transparent?&quot; Masachika was sure that Yuki would tease him about that!</p>

<p>(Wh-What should I do!? I have to do something to hide Alya... but how? First of all, how do I tell her, but if I don&apos;t tell her, the conversation can&apos;t continue peacefully!... ahhh time is running out!!)</p>

<p>After two seconds of racking his brain, ...... Masachika grabbed his own blazer up close and gently placed it on Alisa from behind.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>He then smiled softly and turned to Alisa, who was staring at him with a doubtful expression. Alisa&apos;s gaze widened while her shoulders jerked lightly to the loving eyes that were suddenly fixed on her.</p>

<p>The two of them exchanged glances from a close distance. It was so close that they could feel each other&apos;s breath. The scene looked like a very romantic scene where a guy puts his jacket on a wet girl as she takes shelter from the rain. The arm around her shoulders gave Alisa the illusion that she was being hugged from behind. Under normal circumstances, she might have felt that she was in danger. However, Alisa did not move at all.</p>

<p>She just opened her eyes and grabbed Masachika&apos;s blazer tightly. While squinting her eyes gently at Alisa, Masachika spoke to her in a calm tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Ojou-san... your bra can be seen you know?-- guhhhaa!?&quot;</p>

<p>Then he was knocked off his feet by a hard slap to the face</p>

<p>&quot;W-W-W-W-Why didn&apos;t you say so earlier, you idiot!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Yuki happened to open the door as Alisa was screaming mixed with shrieks. She then saw Masachika&apos;s whereabouts buried in the high jump mat and blinked her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Ummm, this--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmph!&quot;</p>

<p>Although Yuki raised her voice to dispel her doubts, Alisa just snorted while continuing to approach her with rough steps, and she hurriedly stepped aside to make way for her. Then, after a few seconds of watching her back, which was getting further away from the school building, Yuki suddenly raised her voice confidently.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, her shirt is see-through, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously, what&apos;s with that sharp instinct of yours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fufu, I can detect the waves of romantic comedies from a mile away...</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously, you?...&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika commented in a dumbfounded voice, and then lifted himself up from the mattress. Then, earlier his grinning sister said something, Masachika took the initiative and opened his mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;We managed to discover the true identity of the &quot;Intangible Cat&quot;. And we have identified its entry point, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Seriously? Where?&quot;</p>

<p>Accompanied by a seemingly interested Yuki, Masachika exited the warehouse and traveled around to the back side of the gymnasium.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, over there. At first glance it looks like an ordinary ventilation hole, but it&apos;s actually a hole used by a ventilation fan that allows access to the inside.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm~~...&quot;</p>

<p>When Masachika said that while pointing at the rain cover attached to the wall, Yuki looked around the wall, Yuki looked around and thought deeply... but she suddenly realized something and stopped moving.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? What&apos;s wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Hey, did you really see directly that the cat went in and out from there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Well... I didn&apos;t actually see it directly, but based on the traces, I think the cat must have gone in and out that way... besides, there&apos;s no other place the cat could have entered.&quot;</p>

<p>After Masachika said that, Yuki slowly raised her face and... asked with a serious expression.</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ehh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did the cat get in through there?&quot;</p>

<p>After being told that, Masachika took another look at the back of the gymnasium and realized that the wall was completely flat and that there was nothing to use as a foothold. The distance from the ground to the ventilation shaft was also about more than one and a half meters.</p>

<p>&quot;Right....&quot;</p>

<p>Masachika instantly felt a chill run down his spine as he</p>

<p>realized this fact. Just as he was thinking, &quot;Perhaps, this is</p>

<p>a scary story if one understands what it means&quot;, Masachika</p>

<p>and Yuki heard a faint sound coming from the slope to their</p>

<p>left, and turned around at the same time.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>Then there was the black cat that Masachika had seen earlier. The cat was staring at them from the grass on the slope with eyes that seemed to say, &quot;What&apos;s the matter with you guys?&quot;</p>

<p>They looked at each other for a few seconds. Masachika quickly pointed his smartphone camera to capture it this time. Right after he started recording the video, the cat turned its attention towards the gymnasium and started running at high speed.</p>

<p>The cat ran like a cheetah chasing a wolf, and jumped near the sports equipment warehouse area. The cat then attached itself to the surface of the wall and galloped up the wall normally, like a ninja.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;...That cat is really good!&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>By the way, the video that was recorded at the time immediately went viral on social media later on.</p>
