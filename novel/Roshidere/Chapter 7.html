<h3>Chapter 7 - She's a 5M</h3>

<p>The next day, Masachika woke up at a little past 11.</p>


<p>&quot;Seriously... how did I sleep this much?...&quot;</p>


<p>No matter how much he was sleep-deprived, sleeping for almost half a day was clearly too much. If you include the amount of sleep during yesterday, Masachika had already spent almost a full day sleeping. Instead, up until now, his body still felt sluggish. He didn&apos;t know whether the dizziness in his head and sluggishness in his body were due to a fever or the consequence of sleeping too much.</p>


<p>&quot;I guess that means I&apos;m also skipping school today...&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika felt a wave of anxiety and cold sweat as he realized that he had fallen asleep without informing the school of his absence, however a knock on his bedroom door interrupted his thoughts.</p>


<p>&quot;Masachika-sama, are you awake?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ah, yes...&quot;</p>


<p>As he responded to the familiar voice with confusion, Ayano entered his room wearing maid clothes. She clasped her hands in front of her stomach, and with a beautiful posture that would make anyone fall in love with her, she quickly lowered her head.</p>


<p>&quot;Good morning. Masachika-sama.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, morning... Did you miss school too?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes. Taking care of Masachika-sama is much more important than returning the test exam sheet. Tomohisa-sama has already informed the school that Masachika-sama will be absent, so you don&apos;t have to worry.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Jii-chan already, huh?... I see.&quot;</p>


<p>Ayano thrust out the thermometer as she glanced at Masachika who sighed with relief.</p>


<p>&quot;Here you go. Masachika-sama.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;How are you feeling now?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I thought I was doing much better... but this time I&apos;m very sluggish from sleeping so much... and my throat is still sore. Well, I guess it&apos;s also because I slept too much and didn&apos;t drink any water.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...So it seems.&quot;</p>


<p>While being asked and answering questions about his physical condition, the thermometer rang, and Masachika took it out to check his temperature.</p>


<p>&quot;36.7 degrees. Well, that&apos;s almost close to normal temperature.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Thank goodness then. I was thinking of preparing breakfast, but which would you prefer, porridge or udon?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;In that case, I&apos;ll go with udon.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Alright, understood.&quot;</p>


<p>Thanking Ayano for her concern, Masachika washed his hands, took a quick shower since he was sweaty, then changed into casual clothes and returned to the living room.</p>


<p>Masachika ate the udon that Ayano had prepared for him, which was flavored with broth, and ate one and a half servings.</p>


<p>&quot;Haa... Thank you for the meal.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;You&apos;re welcome. It looks like you&apos;ve recovered your appetite.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well, since I&apos;ve almost recovered. My sore throat has also gotten a little better.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I feel relieved to hear that. But just in case, please rest today.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well, school is almost over anyway...&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika said so while looking at the watch that already showed 12:35. Normally it would be lunch break by now, but since there were only morning classes this week, it was already school dismissal time. Tomorrow, the student council members were supposed to get ready for the end-of-semester ceremony, but he didn&apos;t have any urgent matters to attend today.</p>


<p>&quot;Masachika-sama, here&apos;s the medicine.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh thank you...&quot;</p>


<p>As he recalled the school schedule in his head, Masachika was offered medicine and water, but felt strange when looking at it</p>


<p>(Hmm? What&apos;s this feeling? Somehow something is bothering me?)</p>


<p>There was a vague sensation of discomfort, as if there was an important fact there, but he didn&apos;t realize it. However, Masachika&apos;s instincts warned that this feeling of discomfort should not be ignored.</p>


<p>(This medicine pill...)</p>


<p>As Masachika stares at the pills in Ayano&apos;s palm, he recognizes the source of his discomfort. He didn&apos;t pay much attention to it yesterday because he was in a fever-induced daze, but these pills looked familiar.</p>


<p>&quot;Is there something wrong? Masachika-sama.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ayano tilted her head with her usual flat expression.</p>


<p>However, she seemed to be a little nervous... Masachika then said softly while looking into his eyes.</p>


<p>&quot;Ayano. Show me the package of this medicine.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>Her face did not show any anxiety. However, she did not immediately respond. The hesitation shown by Ayano further strengthened Masachika&apos;s suspicions.</p>


<p>&quot;Ayano.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>At Masachika&apos;s call, Ayano closed her eyes as if she had already given up and took out the medicine packet. When Masachika saw the name of the product and the ingredients on the back, he raised his face confidently.</p>


<p>&quot;Ayano... This type of medicine has the added side effect of making me sleepy, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...It seems so.&quot;</p>


<p>Ayano&apos;s affirmation reassured Masachika. No wonder why he was sleeping so much. It wasn&apos;t just the lack of sleep, but it was also the side effects of the fever medication that made him sleepy.</p>


<p>The question was solved. The medicine Alisa bought was not suitable for Masachika&apos;s body condition. However, what made her curious was... why did Ayano intentionally give him this medicine. But before that, who chose this medicine in the first place?</p>


<p>&quot;Ayano, you know that this medicine will make me sleepy, right? Why did you not warn me at all?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>In response to Masachika&apos;s interrogation, Ayano did not answer immediately... but with fluid movements, she immediately performed a dogeza on the spot.</p>


<p>&quot;I sincerely apologize.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I have committed the unforgivable act of administering a medicine that was not suitable for Masachika-sama&apos;s body condition. I will accept whatever punishment is appropriate.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika quietly asked Ayano, who was doing dogeza on the carpet.</p>


<p>&quot;Ayano... Was it Yuki who told Alya to buy this medicine?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>The reply he got was only a silent affirmation. Silent because she couldn&apos;t divulge the secrets of her master, Yuki, but she couldn&apos;t lie to Masachika either.</p>


<p>&quot;What is Yuki up to? If her goal is to make me skip school today, what is her real goal?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>Ayano just closed her mouth tightly when asked by Masachika. Masachika let out a small sigh and spoke in a relaxed, gentle tone as he looked at the figure of the girl who had decided to skip school today.</p>


<p>&quot;Ayano.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;If you will tell me everything honestly, I will hand over all my care to you completely. I will not say anything and let you take care of me.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;!? N-no... I won&apos;t lose to such temptation.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, I&rsquo;m serious, you know?&quot;</p>


<p>Ayano&apos;s back jerked, but she rejected the proposal in the dogeza position. While scratching his head for her slightly misguided response, Masachika said,</p>


<p>&quot;Well, then, if you tell me everything honestly, I will insult you to no end and say &apos;What kind of scum betrays his own master?&apos;&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ehhh!?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oi, didn&apos;t you look a little interested earlier?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;! N-No, that kind of thing...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t lie. You just gave the best reaction I&rsquo;ve seen in awhile. It&apos;s been awhile since I have heard your voice like that.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika averted his gaze from Ayano who suddenly raised her face with eyes full of surprise and expectation, but she immediately lowered her head and returned to Dogeza&apos;s position. Then Ayano raised her face slightly and opened her mouth shyly.</p>


<p>&quot;Umm, Masachika-sama...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...What?</p>


<p>&quot;By the way... if I may know, when you planned on insulting me did it involve stomping on my head?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Do you want to be stomped on?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, I&apos;m just asking if that&apos;s the case because of the position we&apos;re in. I saw Masachika-sama&apos;s bare feet right in front of me, so I thought that&apos;s what would happen.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t beat around the bush. Answer my question. Do you want to be stepped on?&quot; (TN: ðŸ¤¨)</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t want to answer, huh?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika looked out the window with a distant gaze at Ayano who was confirmed silently after making a long-winded excuse. Hm, today the weather is sunny huh~. Outside, it&apos;s so dazzling~.</p>


<p>Though he said it while half joking and half confirming his suspicion of Ayano&apos;s M tendencies... it turned out that her reaction surpassed his expectations. Apparently, this childhood friend of his is not only M but also a super M. A quiet, voiceless, and expressionless Maid M. Combined, they make 5Ms!</p>


<p>&quot;Haa...&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika sighed while holding his forehead as if his head hurt, then stood up and headed for his room.</p>


<p>&quot;I&apos;m going to school. This is the extent of it, there&apos;s no way I&apos;m going to blame you, so hurry and get up.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, you can&apos;t do that. There should be punishment for the sin that I&apos;ve committed.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Then, clean the house thoroughly while I&apos;m at school. That will be your punishment.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Yes. Understood.&quot;</p>


<p>Ayano finally stood up and looked anxiously at Masachika.</p>


<p>&quot;Do you really want to go to school? It&apos;s better if you rest first...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;My fever has gone down, so there&apos;s no problem.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;At the very least, do you want to be driven by car?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;It&apos;s faster to walk than to use a car.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;But in this scorching hot weather when you&apos;re sick... what&apos;s more...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;What else?&quot;</p>


<p>When asked by Masachika, Ayano&apos;s gaze darted back and forth, and then she opened her mouth as if struggling to say something.</p>


<p>&quot;Anyway, by now... I think it&apos;s too late.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...What?&quot;</p>



<p style="text-align: center;">â—‡â—‡â—‡â—‡</p>


<p>Driven by impatience thanks to Ayano&apos;s unpleasant words, Masachika made his preparations as quickly as possible and headed to school after struggling to escape from Ayano&apos;s attempted restraints.</p>


<p>Under the scorching sun, he pushed his aching body. By the time Masachika arrived at school, it was already one o&apos;clock in the afternoon.</p>


<p>The people coming out of the main gate were probably students who had already finished eating lunch at the school cafeteria. As the students leaving the school area looked at him suspiciously, Masachika ran towards the school building in the opposite direction to them.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya, Yuki... where are they?&quot;</p>


<p>While panting as he changed his shoes, Masachika pondered on where he should go and decided to go to class first, then to the student council room.</p>


<p>Swallowing the sticky saliva stuck in his throat, Masachika walked quickly to his class. Then, he heard three male students walking from the front and chatting excitedly about something.</p>


<p>&quot;I knew that Suou-san was really good~. Although I know that, her speaking ability is on a different level.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Even though Alya has also done her best, you know~. But yeah, the level is really different, anyway.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;When I watched the debate last time, I thought that Kujou-san was quite good too, but as it turned out... it seemed like he had no ability to improvise at all. At the debate the other day, I think she was just speaking according to the script?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ah~ maybe there&apos;s some truth to that~&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That seems to be the case.&quot;</p>


<p>As Masachika passed by the three students who were chatting without paying attention to her presence, he felt that his bad feeling was growing ever so larger.</p>


<p>(What were they talking about? The ability to speak? Perhaps, a debate?! No, there&apos;s no way they should be holding a debate on this day...)</p>


<p>He didn&apos;t have enough information to find the answer. However, despite the lack of details, Masachika could deduce that Yuki had done something that resulted in the ranking between her and Alisa.</p>


<p>(Damn it, I was caught off guard! I thought nothing would happen before the closing ceremony of the end of the semester... I didn&apos;t expect that she would arrange something at a time like this!)</p>


<p>Masachika looked into his classroom as he gnashed his teeth at his own carelessness. And... there, he found Alisa sitting alone in her seat.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya...&quot;</p>


<p>As he opened the classroom door, Alisa, who was staring down at her desk, looked up slightly and her eyes widened as she realized Masachika&apos;s presence.</p>


<p>&quot;Kuze-kun...!? Why are you here...!&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...I heard from Ayano that Yuki seems to have prepared something.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I see... is your body okay?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;My fever is gone, so there&apos;s no problem. But more importantly... what happened?&quot;</p>


<p>When Masachika sat in his chair facing Alisa, she bit her lip and bowed her head.</p>


<p>&quot;...I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Alya?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I, uh, messed up. After all the help you&apos;ve given me, I just...!&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Calm down first. You can slowly explain to me what really happened.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa let out a voice full of regret as she gripped her hands tightly on her lap. After Masachika gently calmed her down, Alisa slowly began to tell him what had happened.</p>


<p style="textext-align: center;">â—‡â—‡â—‡â—‡</p>


<p>It all started before homeroom class yesterday morning. Alisa was called by Yuki, who had come to visit her in class 1-B, and she faced Yuki in the student council room.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya-san, I know that this is too sudden, but can you go to Masachika-kun&apos;s house today to deliver medicine?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa was confused by Yuki&apos;s sudden request. However, Yuki didn&apos;t pay much attention to her and continued to put her hand on her cheek as if she was in trouble.</p>


<p>&quot;Actually, Masachika-kun has a fever and can&apos;t seem to move.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh? Really?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes. Normally, I&apos;d like to visit him myself, but unfortunately I have duties to do... therefore, I wonder if I could ask Alya-san, as his partner in the election campaign, to help me.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I see... well, I don&apos;t mind, really?&quot;</p>


<p>While feeling a little uncomfortable at the thought of being asked by Yuki to take care of Masachika, she realized if she rejected it here and if Yuki said &quot;In that case, let me do it ....&quot; Then it would be too much for her, so Alisa decided to agree to her request. Then,</p>

<p>as if she knew that Alisa would accept it, Yuki took out a sheet note from her pocket.</p>


<p>&quot;Thank goodness. Well then, this is the fever medicine Masachika-kun always uses and his home address is written here, so please help, okay?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>


<p>Feeling bothered once again by the information about Masachika that she didn&apos;t know, Alisa accepted the note.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, I&apos;ll go see him after school.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa was about to return to her class again after saying that, but Yuki stopped her.</p>


<p>&quot;Ah, please wait a moment. Actually, I still have other things to do with Alya-san.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;If Alya-san doesn&apos;t mind. Would you be willing to appear as a guest star on the school broadcast tomorrow afternoon?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>


<p>As Alisa was confused, Yuki intertwined her fingers and smiled.</p>


<p>&quot;You know that I&apos;m part of the student council&apos;s public relations and I use the school&apos;s</p>

<p>every week to report on student council activities, right? While we&apos;re talking about it, tomorrow I&apos;ll talk about the debate that happened the previous week. Therefore, I would like to ask Alya-san, who was involved, to be a guest star on tomorrow&apos;s broadcast ... &quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ehh, tomorrow...?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes. Wouldn&apos;t this be a good opportunity for Alya-san to impress more students impressed by your victory in the debate the other day? Just like sports matches, sometimes there are interviews with the winner, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well that&apos;s just...&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa felt indecisive. She felt hesitant to mention the incident because she was not sure if she should. Sayaka&apos;s bad reputation due to the debate had been eased thanks to the efforts of Masachika and Nonoa. There seemed to be some people who criticized Nonoa</p>

<p>for infiltrating the provocateurs in the audience, but Nonoa herself didn&apos;t care at all, so Alisa couldn&apos;t do anything else about it.</p>


<p>(Though Kuze-kun and Miyamae-san had gone to great lengths to control the situation... Am I allowed to bring it up again later?)</p>


<p>From the start, Alisa had no intention of declaring victory, but how about saying that the debate the other day was an invalid match? Isn&apos;t that exactly what Masachika was talking about, &quot;Mercy and the pity and helping hand of the winner is an act of trampling on the remaining dignity of the loser&quot;.</p>


<p>(Also true... anyway, I shouldn&apos;t say bad things)</p>


<p>In terms of human relations, Masachika and Nonoa are much better than herself. The situation the two of them created should not be interfered with by her own shallow thoughts. Considering this, Alisa conveyed her thoughts to Yuki.</p>


<p>&quot;...Sorry, but I feel that I didn&apos;t win that debate. So, I&apos;m not planning on doing a victory interview or anything like that, and I don&apos;t want to talk about it anymore.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>


<p>When Alisa nodded, Yuki suddenly tilted her head with an expression of surprise and then smiled.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, how about we skip the debate and have you appear as a special guest?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;After all, tomorrow&apos;s broadcast will be the last activity report for this semester, and I thought it wouldn&apos;t be a bad idea to do it. How about it? No problem, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Uh, well... that&apos;s right. If that&apos;s the case...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Uwaah, thank you very much!&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa unconsciously nodded at Yuki&apos;s plea as she brought her both hands in front of her face. She smiled innocently and squealed with delight, but suddenly, Yuki lowered her tone of voice and said,</p>


<p>&quot;Even so... from the looks of it, it seems like Alya-san and Masachika-kun are really serious about wanting to erase your victory in the debate, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;!! Looks like you can understand us well...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Of course. Lately, there are rumors circulating that Nonoa-san committed an offense in yesterday&apos;s debate. I can see why you guys are doing that. If you really care about the fact that you won the debate, Masachika-kun would have done a better job at manipulating information.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa immediately fell silent as her intentions were completely guessed right. As if taking advantage of her mental state, Yuki suddenly changed her laughing manner.</p>


<p>&quot;Fufuu, geez... seems like Alisa-san is taking this thing for granted, huh? Giviing up on your own victory in the debate... do you really intend to defeat me?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;What...?&quot;</p>


<p>The atmosphere around Yuki instantly changed, and a completely different face peeked out from behind her perfect Ojou-sama-style face. Alisa&apos;s eyes widened at the sight of Yuki wearing a frightening smile that she had never seen before.</p>


<p>&quot;What&apos;s more, I didn&apos;t expect that you would just accept my invitation without feeling any caution at all... aren&apos;t you too careless? Because you didn&apos;t feel alert at all, fufufu, I unknowingly gave you a warning.&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki laughed mockingly and looked at Alisa coldly behind her narrowed eyes.</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/FqtMmz7/image-028.jpg" width="500" height="540">

<p>Alisa quickly looked away, feeling a little creeped out at that terrifying and horrifying laughter</p>


<p>And then she realized it. She must not be fooled by the words &quot;guest star appearance&quot;. This was... an invitation to a debate using the school broadcast.</p>


<p>&quot;You finally just realized it? Fufuu, don&apos;t let your guard down just because you think it&apos;s an invitation from a friend, okay? It&apos;s an invitation from the opposing candidate in the election campaign... with Masachika-kun on sick leave like this, you should be more cautious when approached.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t tell me... you&apos;re targeting me on purpose?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, I thought I&apos;d take this opportunity to make an attack as hard as possible on Alisa-san, since you&apos;ve lost your precious advisor&quot;</p>


<p>While not changing her smile, Yuki said something cruel. Alisa was more than a little surprised to see the other side of her friend, but she managed to respond to Yuki&apos;s words.</p>


<p>&quot;In other words... If I&apos;m alone, you can do whatever you like?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well, I didn&apos;t bother to give you this warning, but&hellip; If Alisa-san is alone, I don&apos;t need to feel surprised. Moreover...&quot;</p>


<p>After a moment&apos;s pause, Yuki looked at Alisa with a mocking gaze.</p>


<p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t make excuses if challenged and defeated from the front, won&apos;t you?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;!!! ... seems like I&apos;ve been underestimated, huh.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ara ara, even though you&apos;ve already been played by me for a while, but you still dare to say so... huh?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;!!!&quot;</p>


<p>After hearing Yuki&apos;s insulting words, Alisa completely changed her thinking. The person in front of her now was not a friend who worked with her in the student council. She was an enemy that had to be defeated in the election campaign.</p>


<p>Perhaps sensing the change in Alisa&apos;s thought process, Yuki finally said with a grinning smile on her mouth, without bothering to hide it.</p>


<p>&quot;Oh, of course, you can count on Masachika-kun, you know? You can ask his opinion when delivering the medicine for him today.&quot;</p>


<p>... She realized that she was being provoked. However, Alisa&apos;s pride did not allow her to rely on Masachika after being told this.</p>


<p>&quot;I don&apos;t need it. I&apos;m not going to burden Kuze-kun who is resting due to illness.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ara~, are you sure? You don&apos;t need to hold back, do you?&quot;</p>


<p>Her words and the look in her eyes, clearly containing the intention, &quot;You can&apos;t can&apos;t do anything alone, so hurry over there and cry to Masachika.&quot; After hearing her words, Alisa gasped and retorted her provocation.</p>


<p>&quot;Fufufu, Yuki-san is alone as well... are you going to be okay without Kuzekun&apos;s help?&quot;</p>


<p>The intent behind Alisa&apos;s words implied, &quot;You also equally rely on Kuze-kun, don&apos;t you?&quot;, but Yuki didn&apos;t waver at all.</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, of course. I hope that Alisa-san can properly live up to the expectations worthy of the nickname &quot;Loner Princess&quot;, okay?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ugh! I definitely won&apos;t lose...!&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki just smiled casually at Alisa who was glaring at her with a clear fighting spirit.</p>


<p>&quot;Fufu, I&apos;m really looking forward to tomorrow.&quot;</p>


<p>Thus, the face-to-face competition between the two &quot;Beautiful girls of the same age&quot; was suddenly held. After that, Alisa prepared for her battle against Yuki.</p>


<p>She checked the contents of the suggestion box first to predict which suggestion will be taken. In addition, she remembered as much as possible about Yuki&apos;s activities in the past, and carefully planned about what kind of conversation would happen. And... after school today. Alisa went to the broadcast room after doing all the countermeasures she could in a day.</p>


<p>&quot;Excuse me.&quot;</p>


<p>When she knocked and entered the broadcast room, Yuki was already inside</p>

<p>to wait for her.</p>


<p>&quot;Good afternoon, Alya-san. You came early, yes.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Yes, please give me your best.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, please give me your best as well.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa sat down next to Yuki without relaxing her fighting spirit, although her eyebrows raised slightly when Yuki called her by her usual nickname. However... then, something completely unexpected for Alisa happened.</p>


<p>&quot;While there&apos;s still time before the broadcast time starts... Alya-san.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I&apos;m really sorry.&quot;</p>


<p>Suddenly, Yuki bowed deeply towards Alisa. Alisa widened her eyes at Yuki&apos;s unexpected behavior.</p>


<p>&quot;What is this... apology for?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I want to apologize for the way I treated Alya-san yesterday.&quot;</p>


<p>With her head bowed, Yuki spoke in a tone full of regret.</p>


<p>&quot;Even to me, it feels really painful to challenge my precious friend in such a shocking manner... I took an overly aggressive approach to dispel such doubts in me. Yesterday at home, I rethought my attitude and reflected on it.&quot; (TN: cap)</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I know that this is a very selfish request... but, I don&apos;t want to lose my friendship with Alya-san. Please... Are you willing to forgive me?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Alright, it&apos;s fine... please raise your head, okay?&quot;</p>


<p>Because Alisa said she felt uncomfortable, Yuki raised her head slightly and looked at Alisa.</p>


<p>&quot;That means... Are you willing to forgive me?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Umm, yes... I forgive you. That apology just now shows how serious you are, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Thank you very much! Aah, I feel relieved.&quot;</p>


<p>To be honest, there was a part of Alisa&apos;s heart that felt &quot;Why are you apologizing now?&quot;. However, when she saw Yuki raising her head and smiling widely as if she really felt relieved... Alisa became unable to say anything else. Alisa naturally smiled slightly as Yuki patted her chest as if the burden in her heart had disappeared.</p>


<p>&quot;I&apos;m really sorry... not that I want to make this an excuse, but I have my own reasons why I want to win the student council president election.&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki said that with a serious expression while squeezing her fist in front of her chest. Alisa, who knew the reason, reflexively asked with a sense of mild sympathy.</p>


<p>&quot;Is it because... your family told you to become the student council president?&quot;</p>


<p>That was what Yuki had told her when she had just joined the student council. At that time, Alisa said, &quot;Well, everyone&apos;s situation at home is different. It must be hard being under such pressure from your family.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well, there&apos;s that reason too, but...&quot;</p>


<p>After letting her gaze wander as if she wasn&apos;t sure what to say, Yuki looked straight at Alisa and said.</p>


<p>&quot;I have an older brother.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa was shocked by the unexpected confession of Yuki, who usually claimed that she was an only child. Avoiding Alisa&apos;s wide-eyed gaze, Yuki spoke softly with eyes that seemed to be looking somewhere far away.</p>


<p>&quot;My brother is much more talented than me... both my parents and grandfather had high hopes for him. If it were my brother, I&apos;m sure that he would be a good heir to the Suou family... I also have a lot of respect for him.&quot;</p>


<p>Did that gentle gaze remind her of their precious past? Yuki spoke about her brother with a gentle expression, but suddenly her gentle expression instantly changed.</p>


<p>&quot;But, he&apos;s already gone.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh-&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa was really surprised by the change in Yuki&apos;s expression and her words. Yuki said that her sister was gone... that meant...</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s why, I can&apos;t lose.&quot; (TN: bro that&apos;s dirty you can&apos;t just intentionally cause a misconception like that)</p>


<p>Yuki spoke while looking straight into the eyes of the silent Alisa. Her words pierced Alisa&apos;s heart.</p>


<p>&quot;In order to replace my brother who is no longer around... I have to fulfill my family&apos;s expectations, because that&apos;s... the mission I have left to do.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>She proudly declared that with a voice that conveyed a sense of mission and strong will. Yuki then suddenly relaxed her expression.</p>


<p>&quot;...However, everyone has their own circumstances, so there&apos;s no point in saying that. I&apos;m sorry for telling you something like this.&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki lowered her eyebrows and laughed, as if she said something unnecessary, then lowered her head.</p>

<p>unnecessary, then lowered her head again.</p>


<p>&quot;N-no... I don&apos;t mind.&quot;</p>


<p>When Alisa replied with eyes trembling with anxiety, Yuki lifted her head with a fragile smile and spoke cheerfully to change her mood.</p>


<p>&quot;Oh! Now it&apos;s time. Alya-san, are you ready?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Yes.&quot;</p>


<p>Let alone preparation, what Alisa had in mind right now was not even thinking about that. Alisa then half-consciously turned her head to the microphone, as she couldn&apos;t think of what she was going to do. Then, Yuki asked question to her.</p>


<p>&quot;By the way... what about Alya-san yourself?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ehh?&quot;</p>


<p>Those words interrupted Alisa&apos;s anxiety.</p>


<p>&quot;Why does Alya-san want to be the student council president?&quot;</p>


<p>Hearing that question. Alisa&apos;s mind went blank. In the past, Masachika had asked her the same question. Alisa answered immediately without hesitation. She said that she wanted to be</p>

<p>student council president because that was her wish. However, after she heard about Yuki&apos;s situation, Alisa felt that her motives seemed very trivial compared to to her...</p>


<p>&quot;Gosh, it&apos;s about time, huh. Then, let&apos;s get started, Alya-san.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ah, y-...yes.&quot;</p>


<p>After reflexively answering, Alisa vaguely recalled in the corner of her mind .... of what she was going to do.</p>


<p>But by the time she remembered it, the microphone button was already turned on and the broadcast started.</p>


<p>&quot;Hello everyone. It&apos;s time for the bi-weekly report of the student council. Today, I, Suou Yuki, as the public relations department representative will report on the activities of the Student Council activities for the past two weeks. Well, since today is the last broadcast</p>

<p>of this semester, I&apos;ve invited an extraordinary guest. Would you please say hello to the listeners?&quot;</p>


<p>While listening to Yuki&apos;s smooth narration, it was now her turn to speak. As she turns to Yuki next to her, Alisa hurries herself closer to the microphone, but the greeting sentence she had prepared... completely flew out of her head.</p>


<p>&quot;Ah, I&apos;m Kujou Alisa. Umm, I serve as the treasurer of the student council... well, thank you for taking your time to listen today&quot;</p>


<p>As a result, the sentence that came out of her mouth was the most awkward greeting that she had ever heard. After saying that, Alisa felt that her back became hot with embarrassment.</p>


<p>&quot;Ara ara, it seems that Alya-san is feeling a little nervous. Don&apos;t worry! Today not many people will be listening to this broadcast, anyway! Although it should be, I don&apos;t have the right to say that, do I?&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki quickly helped her up, and Alisa could feel that not only her back, but her cheeks were also hot.</p>


<p>(I have to be firm! I&apos;ll definitely beat Yuki-san! Where will I put my face if the opponent I want to defeat is trying to help me with my carelessness!)</p>


<p>Yes, Alisa was trying desperately to scold herself... The fighting spirit that she had to face Yuki a few minutes ago had completely disappeared.</p>


<p>(Back then... why? Since the beginning, why did I want to be...)</p>


<p>Why did she want to be the student council president? There must be a reason. She should have her own reasons that are no less than Yuki&apos;s.</p>


<p>(No! Now is not the time to think about that, I have to concentrate on this ongoing broadcast... uh, uh...)</p>


<p>Alisa realized that this broadcast was so important. But now, Yuki&apos;s question earlier was still ringing in her head.</p>


<p>Why do you want to be the student council president? If Alisa couldn&apos;t answer that question with pride, she would never be able to beat Yuki. That kind of obsession slowly pushed Alisa into a state of limbo.</p>


<p>&quot;-That&apos;s what happened~ what does Alya-san think?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh? Well... umm...&quot;</p>


<p>However, the broadcast continued even though her state was still shaken, and the more impatient she became, the narrower her train of thought became, leaving Alisa unable to speak properly--</p>



<p>â—‡â—‡â—‡â—‡</p>


<p>&quot;After that... everything fell apart. Without being able to calm my mind and regain my spirits, I kept being tossed about... I couldn&apos;t speak as fluently as I wanted, and made Yuki-san constantly help me...&quot;</p>


<p>While saying that with a tone of voice that was a mixture of bitterness and self-mockery, Alisa clenched her pearly white teeth. While silently watching her figure, Masachika muttered in his heart.</p>


<p>(Uwahh, what a sneaky bastard)</p>


<p>That was the first impression that came to Masachika&apos;s mind upon hearing Alisa&apos;s story. Masachika couldn&apos;t help but twitch his cheeks from the power of Yuki&apos;s sly mental attack. When she challenged her to a match, Yuki behaved like a villain, which fueled Alisa&apos;s rebellion and fighting spirit. And then, on the day of the match, Yuki changes her behavior to make Alisa empathize with her, this makes Alisa&apos;s fighting spirit, which was previously passionate, suddenly disappear.</p>


<p>In addition, Yuki also made sure to use the excuse of her motivation for the school broadcast match, as if to imply &quot; I will fight by carrying the hopes of my family. What about you?&quot;</p>


<p>She was very careful to include such a chilling question. Because Alisa had an honest nature and was always serious, she fell into Yuki&apos;s trap.</p>


<p>The unfortunate thing was that Alisa was too honest to realize that she was being set up by Yuki. Alisa, who didn&apos;t have many friends to begin with, and Yuki&apos;s words and actions today...well, maybe Yuki wasn&apos;t too serious about it... but if she knew that Yuki&apos;s actions were done with certainty and calculation, Alisa might develop a sense of distrust towards people.</p>


<p>(No... Was it also part of Yuki&apos;s calculations that Alya didn&apos;t realize...?)</p>


<p>With an apology, Yuki was able to maintain her friendship with Alisa and shake her up simultaneously. Although she was his younger sister, it was a very meticulous and</p>

<p>frightening.</p>


<p>&quot;I feel frustrated...&quot;</p>


<p>When turning his attention to the source of the sad voice he heard, Masachika saw Alisa&apos;s face twitch as she spoke while tightly clenching her hands and gnashing her teeth.</p>


<p>&quot;I&apos;m so easily provoked... even though I was the one who accepted the challenge, but in the end I couldn&apos;t do anything about it.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Okay~ that&apos;s enough. Your line of thinking is leaning in the wrong direction.&quot;</p>


<p>As Masachika clapped his hands together and said that, Alisa raised her face from her downcast position and looked at Masachika.</p>


<p>&quot;...In the wrong direction?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;You could say that you&apos;re dancing on Yuki&apos;s palm, but you just weren&apos;t able to speak like you wanted on the school broadcast where Yuki is the host, right? Since when did it turn into a contest?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;You ask, since when...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Because Yuki said so. Or because she made you think so, yes right?&quot;</p>


<p>After hearing Masachika&apos;s words, Alisa blinked and slowly moved her upper body back from its forward leaning position. After ensuring that Alisa had regained her composure, Masachika spoke clearly.</p>


<p>&quot;The spirit of wanting to defeat your opponent is important. But if you get too fixated on it, you&apos;ll narrow your view of what&apos;s important, so you should be careful.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Of what&apos;s important?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes. In that case... what is her true purpose?&quot;</p>


<p>When Alisa looked at him with curiosity about the meaning of his words, Masachika shrugged his shoulders and continued.</p>


<p>&quot;First of all, your personality is not suited for a match full of tricks. ... You&apos;re more the type of person who always goes all out, no matter who the opponent is, and keeps fighting until you&apos;re satisfied, no matter the results that will come later, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well, you could say... I&apos;m just that type.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;For that type of person, realizing who their opponent is a challenge in itself. Of course, there are times when the presence of a rival can increase your motivation, but in your case, you&apos;re the type of person who can maintain your own motivation. If you&apos;re too fixated on your opponent, you&apos;re only restraining yourself and can&apos;t show your true potential.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well, naturally anyway... this is the first time you&apos;ve lost your composure because of the blood that rose to your head, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;The blood that rose in my head... well, after you said that you might be right too...&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa looked at him thoughtfully, as if guessing about something. Then Masachika interrupted in a stern tone.</p>


<p>&quot;Listen carefully, you have to change your mind. Yuki&apos;s goal is not to gain an advantage over you in today&apos;s school broadcast. Her real goal is to discourage you so much that you won&apos;t be able to give your all at the end-of-semester ceremony.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;!!&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s the truth, isn&apos;t it? Today there&apos;s only class in the morning and there aren&apos;t many students who listen to the school broadcast during the lunch break. If she was intentionally targeting you during the school broadcast, there must be another time that would be more effective.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s because... she targeted the time when Kuze-kun wasn&apos;t around...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Maybe that&apos;s true. But, even though I&apos;m not sick with fever, if Yuki offered you a one-on-one match, you&apos;d accept it, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Remember carefully? Like I said earlier, change your mind. You don&apos;t need to be swayed by her incitement. This is just a trivial matter, not even a prelude to the speech at the end of semester ceremony. You are the guest on today&apos;s school broadcast and can&apos;t speak fluently. But that&apos;s all. None of the students know that you and Yuki are competing, and most of them don&apos;t even listen to the broadcast themselves.</p>


<p>&quot;Depending on the results of the end-of-semester ceremony the day after tomorrow, no one would care about what happened today.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika spoke earnestly while looking straight into the eyes of Alisa. However, Masachika himself knew very well that what he had just said was not entirely true. He could not guarantee that today&apos;s school broadcast did not change the balance of power between Yuki and Alisa.</p>


<p>This was the first time that two people who had never feuded in public, were competing through a school broadcast. Masachika thought that the event that would naturally attract more attention was the end-of-semester ceremony.</p>


<p>But this time, Yuki&apos;s surprise attack reversed that prediction. After their success in the previous debate, there was an air of &quot;It turns out that Princess Alya is pretty great too&quot;, but then this happened. Even Masachika, who wanted to take advantage of the end-of-semester ceremony while defending Alisa, felt that she was caught off guard.</p>


<p>However, the most important thing he had to do was to change Alisa&apos;s way of thinking. After all, her ability was highly dependent on her mental state, so Masachika felt it was important to take care of that.</p>


<p>&quot;So that&apos;s... her actual goal? The end-of-semester ceremony is the real goal while the school broadcast is a prelude to it...?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. She probably wanted to discourage you... but it looks like Yuki&apos;s prediction was a little off.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>


<p>Grinning, Masachika told Alisa, who blinked her eyes.</p>


<p>&quot;She probably thought that you were depressed, right? Because you couldn&apos;t speak fluently and she&apos;s trying to put you under pressure at the end of the semester... but unfortunately, you were frustrated. If then, everything will be fine. You just need to use that frustration to your advantage.&quot;</p>


<p>Therefore, don&apos;t think about it too much. Masachika looked into Alisa&apos;s eyes as if conveying that intention. He wondered if his intention was successfully conveyed to Alisa. After closing her eyes and taking a deep breath, Alisa turned to Masachika with a new expression.</p>


<p>&quot;...Well, I understand, thank you.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm... oh, and frustration is fine, but don&apos;t be too competitive, okay? Because you will later be affected by her again.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s right... in other words, I should forget about this incident and do my best in my own way, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yup, that&apos;s exactly what I mean.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Alright...somehow, I&apos;ll try my best. And one more thing, I want to apologize for taking it all on myself.&quot;</p>


<p>After saying that, Alisa bowed her head. Masachika felt uneasy because of the rare experience of Alisa bowing her head to apologize.</p>


<p>&quot;No, that&apos;s... Well, it&apos;s my fault too for getting sick at such an important time. I want to apologize about that too.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;It can&apos;t be helped... because you had a fever, none of this would have happened if I hadn&apos;t let my guard down.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;....Again, it&apos;s my fault for not anticipating that Yuki would go to this extent. I felt annoyed with myself for being too casual and said &lsquo;Well, it&apos;s not a debate anyway, so how could she possibly take it seriously if it&apos;s just a speech at the end-of-semester ceremony...&rsquo;&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t expect it either. After all, if only I hadn&apos;t acted stubbornly and consulted with you, things wouldn&apos;t have ended up like this.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I told you, it&apos;s because I was sick... duh, how long are we going to continue to blame ourselves. Alright then, how about we both think of it as a win-win?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika scratched his head and said so, and Alisa nodded with an expression that looked a little unconvincing. In order to dispel the awkward atmosphere, Masachika cleared his throat and continued.</p>


<p>&quot;However, come to think of it, this is the perfect opportunity to showcase your hard work like we talked about at the family restaurant before. Besides, it&apos;s good that you can find out firsthand that Yuki is better than you at this kind of tactic. After all, knowing your opponent is an important trait as well.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Well. To be honest, I didn&apos;t expect that Yuki-san would use tactics like this, so I thought it... could be a good experience for me to be aware of that aspect from now on.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa said so, half of which was said to herself. Masachika asked Alisa with some concern.</p>


<p>&quot;...Do you feel disappointed?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;When you found out that she made a surprise attack like this... I&apos;m asked if you felt disappointed with Yuki.&quot;</p>


<p>When asked by Masachika, Alisa shook her head after blinking slowly.</p>


<p>&quot;Not really, I didn&apos;t feel disappointed at all... Although it was a little surprising, Yuki-san challenged me directly. If I blame Yuki-san for losing, that&apos;s called holding a grudge, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Hmm. I see... I&apos;m glad to hear that.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika was relieved when he realized that the friendship between Alisa and Yuki had not disintegrated. At the same time, he felt curious about ....</p>


<p>(As expected... she didn&apos;t notice Yuki&apos;s attempt to mentally to shake her mentally.)</p>


<p>Apparently, Alisa believed Yuki&apos;s excuse that she was too aggressive to break her doubts, and didn&apos;t realize that it was all just a carefully calculated charade by Yuki to shake up Alisa&apos;s heart. She seemed to think that Yuki was challenging her to a debate and her words and actions shook her mentally.</p>


<p>(No, you misunderstood, okay? Everything has been carefully calculated, you know? But, how can I tell her...)</p>


<p>If he told her everything, it might ruin the friendship between Alisa and Yuki. On the other hand, if he didn&apos;t explain how Yuki did it, he wouldn&apos;t be able to warn Alisa. As Masachika pondered what to do, Alisa tilted her head.</p>


<p>&quot;Kuze-kun? What&apos;s wrong?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh... no, it&apos;s nothing.&quot;</p>


<p>Seeing the innocent expression on Alisa&apos;s face, Masachika decided to keep quiet. Since the beginning, she had always been good at this kind of tactic. If Alisa wasn&apos;t good at that, Masachika could support her shortcomings.</p>


<p>&quot;Even though you said it was nothing... So, why are you grinning?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika blinked when he heard Alisa&apos;s words. Then, he touched his own face and realized that he was indeed grinning.</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s right... why, huh?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Why are you asking me back...&quot;</p>


<p>In front of a confused Alisa, Masachika wondered why he was making that face like that... and then, he realized it.</p>


<p>(Oh, am I feeling... excited? Because Yuki and Ayano... really managed to outsmart me for the first time.)</p>


<p>{You look handsome... when making such a face}</p>


<p>Masachika blinked his eyes because he really couldn&apos;t hear the Russian whispered by Alisa.</p>


<p>&quot;Did you just say something?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Nothing... I just said, &apos;You&apos;re making a bad face.&apos;&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Do I look that bad?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Yes.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa nodded, but her cheeks, which could not be hidden by her hands, were slightly flushed. Masachika was a little puzzled by the imbalance between her words and facial expression.</p>


<p>(Eh? Why? Perhaps... does she like bad boys? Is it because the more polite a girl is, the more she is attracted to bad boys?)</p>


<p>At a glance, the image of Alisa being deceived by a ruthless-looking bad boy appeared in his mind, and Masachika felt disturbed. Masachika knew that the word &quot;bad with a mean face&quot;, which is generally not used in a positive sense, was treated as if it were a beautiful thing specifically for women.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;The only cool thing about Yakuza young masters is that they&apos;re only two-dimensional characters, okay? Don&apos;t try to get involved with a Yakuza young master in the real world, okay?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Sometimes you say strange things... What the hell are you talking about?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, because you were blushing earlier... I thought that you liked bad boys.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;What are you talking about, how could I like those types of men. And also, I&apos;m not blushing. It&apos;s just... Kuze-kun&apos;s face is a little bad, looking very silly.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that really cruel?&quot;</p>


<p>(So that&apos;s what it was, indeed she looks like she&apos;s covering her mouth and trying to hold back laughter...)</p>


<p>(No, I&apos;m pretty sure that she said something embarrassing while mumbling in Russian....)</p>


<p>Regardless of whether she really meant it or not. Or maybe she was embarrassed by the fact that she said something embarrassing.</p>


<p>(Well, whatever. After all, I didn&apos;t think that Alya could be easily fooled by a bad guy...)</p>


<p>Then suddenly, as if having an epiphany, Masachika&apos;s mind went back to remembering the incident at home. The figure of Ayano who was beaming in her response to Masachika&apos;s scornful statement.</p>


<p>(Don&apos;t tell me... Alya, are you the same!?)</p>


<p>She reacted to a bad face... so that&apos;s what it means!? Such thoughts crossed his mind, but Masachika quickly eliminated that possibility.</p>


<p>(No, no...no matter how I think about it, Alya&apos;s the type of girl who would probably be an S. She also often looks at me as if I&apos;m trash) (TN: S as in sadistic)</p>


<p>Masachika felt reassured in a very rude way. But then, a certain otaku-style pattern appeared in her mind.</p>


<p>(No, there&apos;s also a pattern where a girl who&apos;s clearly an S turns into an M when in front of someone she loves~!!!)</p>


<p>After imagining it to that extent, Masachika smacked himself on the head in his heart.</p>


<p>(Gosh, I just thought of something outrageous and disgusting. Yosh! alright. I&apos;ll try not to think about it anymore.)</p>


<p>After shaking off her thoughts, Masachika turned to Alisa again with a a new expression on his face---</p>


<p>{I like it because it&apos;s you}</p>


<p>&quot;Pfwah!?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Kuze-kun!?&quot;</p>


<p>When Masachika suddenly punched himself in the forehead (or rather, swinging his head into his fist), Alisa widened her eyes in shock.</p>


<p>&quot;W-What&apos;s wrong with you? Are you okay?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Hm? What is it?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;What did you do... geez, your forehead is turning red.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa, who seemed to have lost her resistance after taking care of him yesterday, approached Masachika with a worried face and immediately ran her fingers over Masachika&apos;s forehead. The closeness and the teasing touch on his forehead made Masachika lean back and open his mouth.</p>


<p>&quot;Y-you yourself, are you okay? I don&apos;t know how, your face still looks glum, you?&quot;</p>


<p>Half of his words were spoken to change the topic, but... Alisa stopped moving when she heard that.</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;What&apos;s wrong? Is there still something bothering you?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika asked Alisa as she slowly sat back in her chair. After a few moments of silence, Alisa replied.</p>


<p>&quot;...I can&apos;t answer that.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;About what?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yuki-san asked... why I wanted to be student council president... and I couldn&apos;t answer.&quot;</p>


<p>Lowering her head and clenching her hands on her skirt, Alisa spoke bitterly.</p>


<p>&quot;Yuki-san...is aiming for the position of student council president with very strong feelings for the sake of her</p>

<p>her family...whereas, I...I want to be the student council president because it&apos;s all for my own sake...that kind of reasoning, still isn&apos;t good enough. And when I think about it, I can&apos;t say anything...!&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa clenched her fist tightly against her chest as if trying to hold back the pain in her heart.</p>

<p>pain in her heart.</p>


<p>&quot;I&apos;m ashamed of myself... for wavering in front of Yuki-san. I feel frustrated because... I wasn&apos;t able to answer Yuki-san&apos;s question!&quot;</p>


<p>While saying that, Alisa bit her lip and turned her gaze downward. At the sight of her figure... Masachika was speechless. The reason she was fighting was because... she had been there too. She participated in the student council president election because of her guilt towards Yuki.</p>


<p>And Masachika himself got rid of someone else to become the vice president of the student council. Because he had struggled with it for so long .... he could understand Alisa&apos;s feelings very well.</p>


<p>(However...)</p>


<p>However, there was a Senpai who laughed and erased that suffering for him. A Senpai who was kind and gently gave him affirmation.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya...&quot;</p>


<p>This time... it was his turn. Just like the kind Senpai who had already supported him, now it was his turn to support Alisa. He had to keep the promise he made that day to support her.</p>


<p>&quot;Look ahead. Look at me!&quot;</p>


<p>In response to Masachika&apos;s call, Alisa&apos;s body jerked and she looked up. Masachika looked straight into Alisa&apos;s eyes whose lips were tightly closed in sadness.</p>


<p>&quot;Your reasons are nothing compared to Yuki&apos;s? So what? Have you forgotten? I still chose you despite knowing all of Yuki&apos;s situation and your situation, you know?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa opened her eyes wide at Masachika&apos;s words. He spoke sincerely to Alisa, who seemed surprised.</p>


<p>&quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you before? You&apos;re the kind of person I want to support as you are. I know that very well. I know your beauty. You&apos;re more dedicated than anyone else, always working hard... and living life straightforwardly. You deserve more. You deserve to be supported and liked by more people.&quot;</p>


<p>As he spoke, Masachika could feel that his back was slowly heating up, but he tried to ignore it for now. He felt that he could not reach Alisa&apos;s heart unless he spoke from the bottom of his heart. Moreover, for the time being, Masachika thought that he should face her wholeheartedly. .</p>


<p>&quot;Therefore... Look forward. Keep puffing out your chest proudly and be who you are. Don&apos;t worry. Your charm as a girl... is in no way inferior to Yuki. I can guarantee that.&quot;</p>


<p>After saying that much, Masachika felt that sweat was running down his back. He felt like squirming and banging his head against the table right now, but Masachika tried to hold it in and continued to look into the eyes of Alisa.</p>


<p>Then, Alisa slowly blinked her wide-open eyes, then&hellip; put her hand over her mouth and started laughing.</p>


<p>&quot;Fufufu, somehow it feels like a love confession, huh?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Woi, don&apos;t say that! I swear that I&apos;ll never say it again!&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika screamed unbearably when told bluntly about what he had been feeling all along.</p>


<p>&quot;Ah~ it&apos;s hot! I think my fever has come back. As expected, I can&apos;t do anything that I wouldn&apos;t normally do with a fever like this~!&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Fufufu, right? When you have a fever... what can you do, right?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa laughed and walked over to Masachika who was fanning himself by grabbing his uniform while looking the other way. Then, she placed her hand on the cheek of Masachika, who turned away from her, and turned him toward her. .... Alisa then pressed her own forehead against that of Masachika, who widened his eyes.</p>


<p>&quot;...It seems to be true. Is your fever still not completely cured?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;!!?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa&apos;s face with her eyes closed was so close at a distance where the tips of their noses almost touched. As if they were about to kiss, this made Masachika wide-eyed and confused. It was a very long few seconds where he even hesitated to breathe. Finally, Alisa quickly raised her face and smiled gently at Masachika.</p>


<p>&quot;Thank you, I was able to overcome my doubts.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Oh. Thank goodness then.&quot;</p>


<p>Somehow, he could not look directly at Alisa&apos;s face, and Masachika averted his gaze and replied with a few words. While smiling at Masachika again, Alisa said in a clear voice.</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s right. Compared to the others... It can&apos;t be helped.</p>


<p>&quot;After all, I am me.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s right... Yuki is Yuki, and you are you.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</p>


<p>Upon seeing that her partner had regained her usual composure, Masachika breathed a sigh of relief.</p>


<p>&quot;Although Yuki-san is carrying out her late brother&apos;s will... I don&apos;t need not fear fighting her.&quot;</p>


<p>...Hmm? Masachika froze after hearing such unexpected words entered his ears. Her late brother&apos;s will... The will of her dead brother! Dead!?</p>


<p>(Oooooooiiiiiii!! Imouto yoooooo!! So this brother of yours, me, is dead huh?!!!)</p>


<p>Masachika screamed at the top of his lungs against the illusion of his younger sister who was performing the tehepero scene in his brain. A completely different kind of sweat gushed out all over his body.</p>


<p>(TN: tehepero is an action which refers to someone doing an expression to lighten the atmosphere after making a mistake. In anime, it&apos;s usually the character placing their fist on top of their head, or making a peace sign, while sticking out their tongue)</p>


<p>(W-w-w-w-what am I supposed to do!? Somehow, Yuki even made the past seem too heavy, but... With the position of a childhood friend, should I correct this? But then, there&apos;s the possibility that the friendship between Alya and Yuki could crack... No, but still still...)</p>


<p>Masachika was having an inner war about a difficult problem that suddenly appeared ... After struggling for a few seconds, he reluctantly called out to Alisa.</p>


<p>&quot;U-Umm. Alya...&quot;</p>


<p>However, at that moment, the classroom door opened, Masachika and Alisa looked towards</p>

<p>simultaneously.</p>


<p>&quot;Yahoo~&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Excuse me.&quot;</p>


<p>Nonoa opened the door with a casual voice and entered the classroom. Behind her, Sayaka struggled to bend down and walk in. Masachika and Alisa both widened their eyes at the sudden and unexpected visitors.</p>


<p>&quot;Ohh~ as I thought she was still in the classroom~... huh, Kuzecchi? I thought you weren&apos;t in school today?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well, I actually just arrived...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Uh, is that so? Then it&apos;s really a coincidence~&quot;</p>


<p>But Nonoa said that without caring about their reactions, and sat down with a thud on Hikaru&apos;s chair in front of Masachika. ... by straddling the chair.</p>


<p>&quot;Nonoa... that&apos;s not polite, you know.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Eh~ it&apos;s okay too~. There&apos;s no one else anyway.&quot;</p>


<p>Without listening to Sayaka&apos;s warning, Nonoa rested her cheek on the back of the chair lazily, looking unmotivated as usual. In front of Masachika. With her legs spread as wide as possible.</p>


<p>(... Because of her behavior, for better or worse, I guess they don&apos;t consider her an idol.)</p>


<p>From Masachika&apos;s point of view, it&apos;s no surprise that Nonoa was crowned the &quot;prettiest girl in the class&quot; in terms of looks and fame. However, the reason why this is not the case may be because people feel that Nonoa is more familiar with them than Alisa and Yuki. If Alisa and Yuki are more like flowers that cannot be reachable, then Nonoa is more like a big flower that blooms on the ground.</p>


<p>(... although she is more like insectivorous flowers, anyway)</p>


<p>Masachika added that inwardly, raised his guard slightly, and inquired about their needs.</p>


<p>&quot;So? What business did you come here for?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm~? It&apos;s not me who has business, but Sayacchi, anyway?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Taniyama?&quot;</p>


<p>As Masachika turned her head towards Sayaka who was standing diagonally behind Nonoa, Sayaka&apos;s eyebrows twitched for a moment and then she exhaled for a long time. Then, she straightened her posture with a sincere expression.</p>


<p>&quot;Although it&apos;s too late to say this... Kuze-san and Kujou-san. I apologize for my rudeness and inconvenience I caused you two. I truly regret it.&quot;</p>


<p>Then, she bowed deeply towards the two of them. Seeing that, Nonoa also bowed slightly while sitting on her chair.</p>


<p>&quot;I apologize too. It&apos;s also my fault for not stopping Sayacchi when I knew she was out of control. I know it&apos;s a little late, but will you guys please forgive me? Of course, I won&apos;t ask for it for free.&quot;</p>


<p>Nonoa put her hands together in front of her face, closed one eye and apologized. Sayaka was still standing and continued to bow her head. Seeing their apologies, Masachika looked back at Alisa.</p>


<p>&quot;I have no right to make that decision. Everything is up to Alya.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I... don&apos;t mind if you apologize for the harsh words. As for Miyamae-san, you didn&apos;t do anything to apologize for at all.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;But~ I think it&apos;s only natural to apologize for infiltrating by using provocateurs at the debate the other day, right~?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika waved her hand at Nonoa who was resting her head with both hands.</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s just part of the strategy. After all, why should the loser apologize to the winner?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Aha... well, really~?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...that&apos;s because you yourself ignored the victory.&quot;</p>


<p>While raising her head, Sayaka looked at Masachika. It seemed that she had learned that Masachika had asked Nonoa to quell Sayaka&apos;s bad rumors. Masachika just shrugged casually.</p>


<p>&quot;I only did it because Alya said that it bothered her. Besides that, Miyamae was the one who actually made the move, so we have no right to comment on the matter.&quot;</p>


<p>That meant that, rather than receiving thanks for taking care of the Sayaka&apos;s bad gossip, Masachika did not criticize anything for making Nonoa&apos;s reputation into disrepute. If she had something to say, Sayaka could have said it directly to her partner, Nonoa.</p>


<p>After understanding the meaning behind Masachika&apos;s words, Sayaka then turned her attention to Alisa.</p>


<p>&quot;Still, that doesn&apos;t change the fact that you guys care about me, does it? That&apos;s why... on today&apos;s noon broadcast, you didn&apos;t mention the incident?&quot;</p>


<p>In response to Sayaka&apos;s gaze, Alisa looked straight into her eyes.</p>


<p>&quot;...In fact, if the voting in yesterday&apos;s debate had continued, I don&apos;t know who would have won. I just don&apos;t want to declare victory when there&apos;s no clear winner.&quot;</p>


<p>Hearing Alisa&apos;s reply, Sayaka looked back into Alisa&apos;s eyes as if she was trying to figure out her true intentions. But finally, she closed her eyes and nodded with a faint smile.</p>


<p>&quot;... I see. You apparently have a lot of self-respect, huh.&quot;</p>


<p>After muttering that, Sayaka turned around and headed for the door at the front of the classroom. She placed her hand on the door and paused there for a moment.</p>


<p>&quot;...But, I also have pride.&quot;</p>


<p>Based on her words and body language, Masachika knew that Sayaka was intended to do something.</p>


<p>&quot;Wait a minute, Taniyama. What are you planning to do?&quot;</p>


<p>When asked that, Sayaka looked at Masachika and replied.</p>


<p>&quot;...I won&apos;t bend the facts to protect my honor.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Therefore, you want to make a declaration of defeat and not of victory? Do you intend to do it on the school broadcast... No, at the end-of-semester ceremony, huh?&quot;</p>


<p>Upon hearing Masachika&apos;s words, Sayaka looked away and seemed to be at a loss for words. Masachika then stood up, knowing that his guess was right on target.</p>


<p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but as a member of the student council, I can&apos;t allow your selfish actions at the end-of-semester ceremony this semester... If you want to respond to Alya&apos;s sincerity, are you willing to do it in another way?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...another way?&quot;</p>


<p>When Sayaka turned around, Masachika told them his request. Not only Sayaka, but Alisa&rsquo;s eyes also widened, and Nonoa also raised her eyebrows.</p>


<p>&quot;...are you serious?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yeah, Alya doesn&apos;t mind either, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Uh, yes...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Miyamae too, you said &apos;I won&apos;t ask for it for free&apos;, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ah~ I did say that anyway...&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa nodded in confusion, and Nonoa laughed dryly. Looking at the two of them, Sayaka turned her body to Masachika. She looked at Masachika and Alisa with a complicated gaze, and said in a voice that seemed to be holding back various emotions.</p>


<p>&quot;...I still don&apos;t support you guys.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, I know.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Even now, I still think that you should be working with me, with Suou-san.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I see. But, the reason why I chose Alya... you can understand it a little, right?&quot;</p>


<p>Sayaka looked at Alisa&apos;s face in response to Masachika&apos;s question. Alisa also silently looked back at Sayaka. They exchanged glances for a few seconds, and Sayaka quietly closed her eyes.</p>


<p>&quot;...yes, I can understand a little.&quot;</p>


<p>Then she gave a small nod. Seeing Sayaka&apos;s response, Nonoa grabbed the back of the chair and leaned back.</p>


<p>&quot;Seriously... In that case, I&apos;m fine with it, too.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika nodded strongly at Nonoa, who turned her body around and nodded lightly at him.</p>


<p>&quot;Thank you, then let us cooperate.&quot;</p>


<p>She then turned to Alisa, who widened her eyes in surprise, and told her.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya, this is your power. With this... you can defeat them.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Uh... defeat them? Didn&apos;t you say to aim for a draw?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika smiled fiercely at Alisa, who seemed confused by such a sudden development.</p>


<p>&quot;I won&apos;t aim for a draw anymore. Since the other side started it first... we&apos;ll crush them mercilessly.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika&apos;s statement caused Alisa to gasp, Sayaka to quietly push up her glasses, and caused Nonoa to laugh happily.</p>
