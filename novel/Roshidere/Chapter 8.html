<h3>Chapter 8 - Introductory Speech</h3>

<p>The next day, after school, each member of the student council made various preparations for the end-of-semester ceremony and meetings with related parties. With the progress chart of the end-of-semester ceremony in hand, two or three pairs of students walked back and forth around the school building.</p>


<p>Meanwhile, Masachika and Alisa, who had already completed their assignments, were practicing on the gymnasium stage for tomorrow&apos;s event.</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s all from me, thank you very much for your attention.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika, who was listening from the bottom of the stage, applauded Alisa who had just finished giving a speech without a microphone.</p>


<p>&quot;Okay, if you can do this on the day of the performance, it looks like you&apos;ll be fine.&quot;</p>


<p>As she climbed the stairs to the stage, Alisa&apos;s expression was filled with a bit of anxiety.</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s right... even on the day of the event...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Do you still feel anxious? Even during the debate the other day, you were able to speak smoothly.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That time... I was able to speak fluently because I concentrated on my inner self. Besides, there will be more people tomorrow than last time, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well, all the students in the school will be here tomorrow. The gymnasium will be full, you know?&quot;</p>


<p>There was no point in deceiving her, so Masachika shrugged his shoulders and said honestly, then turned around and told her in a casual tone.</p>


<p>&quot;But, what you have to do hasn&apos;t changed, has it? No matter how large the audience is, as long as you focus on what you want to say...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;But I think that&apos;s still not enough.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;At the last debate... I saw what you were talking about, and I know exactly what you meant. There&apos;s a big difference between talking to yourself and speaking to an audience. Especially when &apos;making a speech&apos;, I think I should have to look into the eyes and faces of the audience.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa said with a serious expression as she looked down at the stage, and then turned her intense gaze towards Masachika.</p>


<p>&quot;Nee, how can I talk to the audience like you?&quot;</p>


<p>In response to Alisa&apos;s question, Masachika scratched his head while silently inwardly admiring how ambitious she was.</p>


<p>&quot;Even though you&apos;re asking how, I myself don&apos;t know what to answer because it&apos;s all about getting used to it. At the very least, you should be able to speak perfectly without looking at the script, and then change the tone of your voice and take pauses while watching the audience&apos;s reaction .... and then make some jokes to keep the audience focused...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa immediately fell silent with a difficult expression when she heard Masachika&apos;s suggestion. Masachika herself realized that she was demanding something quite difficult, so she added with a wry smile.</p>


<p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s impossible to do it perfectly from the start. Like I said before, it&apos;s all about getting used to it... For this time, you can just face forward and speak openly.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Is that enough?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, think of it as practice for the upcoming election campaign. I told you yesterday, didn&apos;t I? If you compete too much with Yuki, she&apos;ll make you shake.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;!!&quot;</p>


<p>Upon hearing Masachika&apos;s words, Alisa&apos;s eyes widened as she realized that she had subconsciously felt the deep urge and fear to avoid losing to Yuki. Masachika then patted Alisa&apos;s shoulder lightly to calm her down, and began to lower his voice slightly.</p>


<p>&quot;Then... how about I tell you one secret trick that can help ease your nerves while also capturing the audience&apos;s attention?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Secret trick??&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>


<p>When Alisa raised her eyebrows, Masachika quietly told her. Alisa seemed momentarily surprised at the unexpected contents of the trick, and then raised her eyebrows when contemplating the contents of the secret trick in question.</p>


<p>&quot;So that&apos;s the secret trick...?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;How is it? It&apos;s easy, right? But still effective.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Yes. I&apos;ll give it a try.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa nodded with a serious expression, and Masachika smiled back at her. Then, they heard a voice calling from outside the stage.</p>


<p>&quot;Are you practicing for tomorrow?&quot;</p>


<p>They turned around at the same time when they heard the voice, and saw Yuki with her usual smile. Behind her was Ayano who was giving an expressionless nod to Masachika and Alisa.</p>


<p>&quot;Oh, did you finish your part of the assignment?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, everything went well.&quot;</p>


<p>The two of them exchanged words in a friendly manner, but there was an unusual tension there. As she walked slowly towards Masachika, Yuki put her hand in front of her mouth and tilted her head.</p>


<p>&quot;Fufufu, what&apos;s wrong? Masachika-kun. Your face looks a little scary, you know?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;How dare you say that so bluntly... Isn&apos;t the cover of your Ojou-sama character starting to wear off?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ara ara, fufufu.&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki opened her eyes slightly while putting on a perfect Ojou-sama style smile. The eyes that peeked out from behind her narrowed gaze had a cold presence, without the slightest trace of a friendly smile. In the face of a gaze that would make most people feel goosebumps, Masachika shrugged his shoulders and looked back at Alisa who was behind him.</p>


<p>&quot;You can see for yourself, right? This is how she really is. Like I told you before, don&apos;t be fooled by her graceful face.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Y-Yes...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ara, Alya-san. Did I disappoint you?&quot;</p>


<p>As Yuki tilted her head, Alisa slowly shook her head.</p>


<p>&quot;No, I was a little surprised, but I don&apos;t feel disappointed.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ara...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;We don&apos;t know each other very well yet. It&apos;s only natural for things to change and for you to show your real side.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Besides... is it true that you want to be friends with me?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Yes, of course.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Then, it&rsquo;s fine.&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki widened her eyes in surprise, having not expected Alisa to give in so easily.</p>


<p>&quot;Moreover... thanks to Yuki-san, I was able to look back at myself with a new outlook.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...And, what&apos;s that?&quot;</p>


<p>With a straight gaze at Yuki who retracted her fake smile and tilted her head, Alisa stated.</p>


<p>&quot;Yuki-san, that time you asked me why I wanted to be the student council president..., I will show you the answer to that question tomorrow. Besides, I&apos;m going to get more supporters than you&quot;</p>


<p>Hearing Alisa&apos;s impressive statement, Yuki blinked her eyes with a flat face and then giggled.</p>


<p>&quot;Fufu, Alya-san really has a straightforward nature... and is a good person, huh.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Wh-What the heck?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa&apos;s gaze darted back and forth in confusion at the sudden praise. However, Yuki continued without feeling embarrassed at all.</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s how I really feel? I feel very happy to be friends with Alya-san.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;.....&quot;</p>


<p>When Alisa turned her face away as if she couldn&apos;t stand it anymore, Yuki said with a wider smile.</p>


<p>&quot;To Alya-san who is so wonderful... I want to tell you one thing.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...What?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Regarding the talk of my brother who is &apos;gone&apos;, I didn&apos;t mean he&apos;s dead, you know?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>


<p>When Alisa turned around with a look of confusion, Yuki smiled wickedly and mischievous.</p>


<p>&quot;He just left home. Even though he cut off all ties with the Suou family, he&apos;s still in good health, you?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Wha-what!?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa suddenly blushed from feeling misunderstood and glared at Yuki. The smiling Masachika then stood in front of Yuki, who dismissed Alisa&apos;s glare with a cold smile.</p>


<p>&quot;Thank god, I&apos;m glad your friendship with Alya didn&apos;t break.&quot;</p>


<p>That unnaturally cheerful smile made Yuki increase her guard and she put on her Ojou-sama-style smile again.</p>


<p>&quot;Ara ara, from the way you&apos;re talking... It&apos;s as if my friendship with Masachika has cracked, huh?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Not really? But I just thought that you didn&apos;t have the nerve to use that kind of tactic.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika walked over to Yuki and Ayano while saying so with a bright tone and a cheerful smile. Alisa looked back at him with a bit of worry, but Yuki kept smiling even though his brother was right in front of her.</p>


<p>&quot;Ara, is it possible that... you&apos;re angry that I deliberately targeted her while you were sick?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s not the case. It&apos;s a natural tactic to target people when they are in a weakened state. In fact, I think you&apos;ve done a very good job by giving me a drug that has side effects without making me realize it at all.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I feel honored.&quot;</p>


<p>Even though he said so, Yuki felt her hair stand up when she saw his brother&apos;s smile. The same went for Ayano, who was given a glance by Masachika. They both felt sweat running down their backs as Masachika gave them an unusually strong gaze. However, despite the eerie atmosphere, Masachika continued in a cheerful tone.</p>


<p>&quot;Fwaah~, what is this feeling I&apos;m having, huh? I don&apos;t really understand it... If I were to put it into words, I&apos;d half feel tempted to pet the head of the cute dog that dared to bite me, and the other half, I feel the urge to discipline it so it wouldn&apos;t bite me again, maybe it&apos;s that kind of feeling?&quot;</p>


<p>(TN: this guy doesn&apos;t realize that Ayano is probably enjoying this)</p>


<p>It was a pretty scary thing to be told, but Yuki did not underestimate him. After seeing her brother&apos;s seriousness, which she had not seen in a long time, Yuki unmasked her graceful face. What was inside Yuki now was a bit of fear, but more than that, a sense of excitement. It was expressed in the form of shining eyes and a ferocious smile. Masachika&apos;s smile also turned ferocious at the look her sister was showing.</p>


<p>&quot;But well, if there&apos;s one thing I want to say...&quot;</p>


<p>Then... he continued while looking at Yuki with a gaze that did not show a smile at all.</p>


<p>&quot;If you dare to bite, you have to grit your teeth, okay?</p>


<p>From the look in his eyes, there was a sense of superiority that showed that he didn&apos;t feel cornered in the slightest. Yuki and Ayano realized that they had stepped on the tail of a sleeping lion.</p>


<p>(Ahaha... I thought I could make him a little impatient, but... apparently I&apos;m still too naive, huh ....) (TN: Yuki&rsquo;s thoughts btw)</p>


<p>It was the most obvious declaration of war from her brother. However, it was also a fortuitous thing for Yuki. If they could have a direct battle, Yuki would definitely want it. Yuki was shivering and Ayano was also trembling at the vigilance and excitement directed at her... although there was no telling which excitement Ayano was aiming at. An overwhelming tension filled the vicinity of the stage, as if it was the day before the performance. However, the tense atmosphere was instantly dissipated by a voice that interrupted from offstage.</p>


<p>&quot;Umm, may I have your attention for a moment? I&apos;d like to do the final check for tomorrow...&quot;</p>


<p>When they turned their heads simultaneously towards the source of the voice, they saw there were the three second-year students from the student council... Masachika and Yuki subsided their fighting spirits and headed to Touya who had a slightly stiff face, to get together. Alisa and Ayano also relaxed and followed them. Although he seemed a little uneasy with the tense atmosphere of the four students, Touya continued on to conduct the final inspection in</p>

<p>preparation for tomorrow&apos;s end-of-semester closing ceremony. And their topic finally turned to the speeches of all the student council members.</p>


<p>&quot;Now, about the important part, the greeting speeches of the student council members... The order starts with me first as the President, then Chisaki who is the vice president, then Kujou (TN: Masha, not Alya), and then the first-year members. Since there aren&apos;t too many student council members this year, there&apos;s no time limit., but please keep it under three minutes if possible. Do you have any other questions?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa had been briefed beforehand, so no one raised their hand to ask a question. After confirming that they were all nodding lightly, Touya turned his attention to the four first years with some reluctance.</p>


<p>&quot;In that case, the order of greetings for the candidates... How should we do it? Last year, the candidates for president decided with rock-paper-scissors.&quot;</p>


<p>Hearing Touya&apos;s words, Yuki and Alisa exchanged glances, and Yuki tilted her head with a smile.</p>


<p>&quot;I don&apos;t mind deciding with rock-paper-scissors&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa tried to agree with Yuki&apos;s words as well... But before that, Masachika spoke up first.</p>


<p>&quot;No, that&apos;s not good. Rock-paper-scissors is just a game of chance.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Well, it is, anyway.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa and Touya raised their eyebrows with a &quot;Hmm?&quot; to Yuki who shrugged her shoulders, Chisaki nodded, &quot;Totally understand&quot; and Maria just said &quot;Eehh~?&quot; with a wry smile. Ayano had already blended into the air.</p>


<p>But, these two siblings were not joking at all. As hard-core otakus, they were always ready to engage in brain games that risked their lives. Again, the game in mind was not just an ordinary game.</p>


<p>&quot;Well then, how about a coin toss?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm, that one would probably be fair.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Alright. How about if Ayano tosses the coin and Alya-san guesses the side?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;No, it&apos;s better to ask someone else to flip the coin.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Fufu, you&apos;re always suspicious.&quot;</p>


<p>Of course, Masachika and Yuki didn&apos;t do the coin toss because of the possibility of cheating, and there was no possibility that Ayano could rig it with a rare skill.</p>


<p>But that didn&apos;t mean Masachika had no reason to be wary of Ayano, since she had a record of trying to drug people without hesitation.</p>


<p>Of course, the fact is that Masachika and Yuki didn&apos;t play a role in the coin toss, since it was just a diversionary game.</p>


<p>&quot;Etto, how about I do it~?&quot;</p>


<p>When Masachika turned to their seniors, Maria said so and took out a 100 yen coin. Masachika looked at Yuki for confirmation, and Yuki shrugged her shoulders casually. Masachika nodded towards Maria, after judging that Yuki had agreed with him.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, please do the favor. Masha-san will toss a coin, and Alya will guess which side. If the guess is correct, Alya is free to choose whether to take the first or second turn, and if she misses, Yuki chooses.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Alright, I understand. Then the side of the coin with the pattern is the head, and the side with the number 100 is the tail, huh~.&quot;</p>


<p>Maria then put the 100 yen coin on her fingernail, but Alisa, who had been watching her, opened her mouth with a suspicious look.</p>


<p>&quot;Masha... did you get it right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ahh~ you underestimate Onee-chan~. Of course I can do it, just take a good look, okay~? Eii~~!&quot;</p>


<p>She puffed up her cheeks when she saw Alisa&apos;s gaze, and for some reason, Maria bounced her body up and down while tossing the 100 yen coin.</p>


<p>While everyone was looking at her with a gentle gaze, Maria was shaking her body for some reason and followed the rotation of the coin with her eyes. She then caught the coin with both hands as if she was swatting at a mosquito.</p>


<p>&quot;Got it! See, I can catch it, Alya-chan!&quot;</p>


<p>With her hands clenched, Maria smiled happily. However, the look in Alisa&apos;s eyes turned cold.</p>


<p>&quot;So? Which one is the top?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ehh...?&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa told her to look down at her hand, and Maria finally realized that she couldn&apos;t tell the difference between the top and the bottom.</p>


<p>&quot;Ettoo~, then... is this the top one?&quot;</p>


<p>Then, as Maria put her left hand down and her right hand up, Alisa replied indifferently.</p>


<p>&quot;Heads.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ehh~ You can take more time if you want, really~ ...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don&apos;t keep joking around.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Muu... then, here it is.&quot;</p>


<p>In Maria&apos;s open hand... a coin bearing the number 100 appeared. Alisa furrowed her brows for a moment, and Yuki watched her expression carefully.</p>


<p>&quot;Too bad, Alya-chan&apos;s guess was off. Then... Yuki-chan, do you want a first or second turn?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Let me think about it first...&quot;</p>


<p>As Maria asked her, Yuki put her hand on her chin. Masachika looked at Yuki who was like that.</p>


<p>(I was hoping that Alisa would win the coin toss, but&hellip; now, how far can you see my strategy?)</p>


<p>While her brother was closely watching her, Yuki was concentrating on her own thoughts.</p>


<p>(TN: Yuki&apos;s thoughts from here on out)</p>


<p>(When you think about it normally, a second turn that leaves an impression at the end is much more favorable .... But, if I can create an atmosphere about my greatness, so as to limit the applause for Kujou in the first turn, I can achieve a landslide victory. On the other hand, the first turn can give her a minimum amount of applause, so it&apos;s difficult to win a landslide victory if it&apos;s Alya-san who gets the first turn... Moreover, I can&apos;t reason what to do because she gets the first turn... Do I have to choose the first turn? From the beginning, I was planning to....)</p>


<p>But..., Yuki thought.</p>


<p>(Even if I&apos;m aiming for a landslide victory, since Onii-chan has started to get serious, I should aim for a safe victory here...)</p>


<p>Then, Yuki suddenly felt uneasy about her brother&apos;s earlier attitude.</p>


<p>(By the way... why is he intimidating me so blatantly? It&apos;s unlike Onii-chan&apos;s nature of doing things behind the scenes... Perhaps, just acting?)</p>


<p>As soon as that possibility appeared in her mind, Yuki instinctively felt that her guess was right. Yuki turned her head while shifting her gaze towards Masachika.</p>


<p>(If it was just an act... what was the real purpose? In order to make me think that he was angry and think he was going to fight directly? But actually, he didn&apos;t intend to do that? Besides... huh! Was it to distract from Alya-san!)</p>


<p>With a flash of enlightenment, Yuki made eye contact with Masachika. Although she couldn&apos;t read anything from the expression on her brother&apos;s poker face, Yuki believed that her guess was close to the correct answer.</p>


<p>(That&apos;s right... I was unwittingly fooled by Onii-chan, but from the beginning, my target was Alya-san... And, as far as I can see, Alya-san&apos;s mentality isn&apos;t as strong as I thought. On top of that, she&apos;s still traumatized from not being able to speak well in the school broadcast yesterday. I originally planned to carry out an attack on Alya-san when that pressure arises.)</p>


<p>Recalling her original strategy, Yuki realized that she was being led into a trap. However, she had already realized it.</p>


<p>(Onii-chan&apos;s real goal is to draw with Alya-san. Aiming for a draw with the first turn speaker can get the minimum applause without any pressure! In that case, I should aim for a landslide victory as originally planned!)</p>

<p>During that time, 5 seconds had passed. Yuki, who reached the conclusion with a speed of thought that surpassed the ability of ordinary people, told Touya with a smile on her face.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, I&apos;ll ask for the first turn.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Alright. Then, the first turn is the pair of Suou and Kimishima. While the second turn will be the pair of Kujou and Kuze.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa nodded silently at Touya&apos;s announcement, and Masachika smiled meaningfully.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p>


<p>Then, on the next day. The end-of-semester ceremony went smoothly without any obstacles, thanks to careful preparation the day before. The principal&apos;s speech, public health committee announcement, and other events went smoothly as scheduled. The student council members were divided into two groups, the first group on the lower side of the stage were Touya, Maria, Alisa and Masachika. While Chisaki, Yuki, and Ayano were watching on the upper side of the</p>

<p>side of the stage.</p>


<p>&quot;Then the next program is the introduction of this year&apos;s student council members. For the time and place, you are welcome.&quot;</p>


<p>Finally, the time had come. The second-year student council members greeted each other in turn as the moderator, a member of the broadcasting club, called out their names. Touya gave a charismatic speech with an impressive demeanor, and was cheered when he announced the school&apos;s decision to change the school&apos;s decision to change the summer uniform.</p>


<p>Chisaki gave a rather general speech while occasionally eliciting laughter in a cheerful atmosphere. While Maria, with her usual gentle smile, gave a stern speech despite the atmosphere and tone of her voice.</p>


<p>The second years of the student council addressed the students in three different ways, but each of them caught people&apos;s attention. While the students were getting more and more excited as if they were watching an idol, it was finally the first years&rsquo; turn.</p>


<p>&quot;Next, the student council member in charge of public relations, Suou Yuki, is going to give a speech.&quot;</p>


<p>The atmosphere in the hall instantly changed as the next student council president candidate appeared. Some of the spectators were looking forward to a quiet battle between the candidates. There were also those who were watching with excitement.</p>


<p>There were also people who tried to assess the situation calmly. Yuki stood on the stage with all kinds of gazes on her. Yuki&apos;s performance was displayed on the screen above the stage, and the audience began to get a little excited.</p>


<p>&quot;Thank you for the introduction. My name is Suou Yuki, and I serve as the public relations officer of the student council as well as the former student council president of the junior high school division of Seirei Gakuen. I plan to run for student council president next year. Therefore, I hope to receive your support.&quot;</p>


<p>When Yuki bowed lightly with a graceful smile decorating her face, cheers from the students came from all corners of the hall. She responded by nodding lightly and slightly lowering her tone of voice.</p>


<p>&quot;Now, I would like to tell you a little about my vision. If I succeed in becoming the student council president, I have a goal, which is... to make a school that reflects the opinions of the students. Ara? There must be many who think that that&apos;s more normal than you think, right?&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki suddenly asked with a slightly ignorant tone, making the audience laugh lightly and made the atmosphere more relaxed. After that, Yuki took out a large box from under the podium and showed it to the audience.</p>


<p>&quot;Specifically... like this suggestion box. This thing has been installed in the school for many years... I&apos;m sure, only a few people have ever used this service before. Actually, I&apos;ve brought it up many times in the lunchtime activity report broadcast, but I feel that there aren&apos;t many real problems or requests in it. I think that&apos;s because many people think, &lsquo;There&apos;s no point in writing to the suggestion box because it&apos;ll never be realized&rsquo;, right?&quot;</p>


<p>When Yuki asked a specific question, the students reflected on it and nodded in agreement. After seeing that the students were convinced, Yuki began to mention her reasoning.</p>


<p>&quot;However, this is not unreasonable. After all, for most of the members, it&apos;s their first time doing student council work. In fact, a company employee needs to spend their first year learning their job, but student council members only serve for one year while their term expires. Therefore, it will be difficult to listen to students&apos; requests and make them happen. What&apos;s more, somehow for some reason this year... Yes, for some reason! We&apos;re lacking student council members from the 1st year, you know?&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki&apos;s deliberate way of saying that made the students laugh,</p>


<p>&quot;Whose fault is it?&quot;. After laughing out loud while following up with the senpai who were also student council members, Yuki cut to the heart of the matter. of the problem.</p>


<p>&quot;However, when I become the student council president later, I will try to fulfill the requests made in this suggestion box.&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki emphasized this very clearly and continued.</p>


<p>&quot;More precisely, I will try to fulfill at least one request from a student per month. And with those results, I will start realizing bigger requests. For example, changing the sports festival. Or adding more events and time for school festivals. Or also extending the free time for school field trips. Maybe it would also be interesting to create new events on Halloween and Christmas, huh?&quot;</p>


<p>For most of the students, the sweet promises that were being offered caused unbearable excitement. Some of them even muttered &quot;Can it really be realized?&quot; because they doubted it. However, Yuki herself answered in the affirmative. After looking around the audience with a strong smile, Yuki declared.</p>


<p>&quot;I believe that only I am capable of doing this, having served in the student council for two years in middle school and still serving in high school. Besides that, I intend to prove it through my future work. For your attention, I thank you very much.&quot;</p>


<p>When Yuki bowed her head, there was much applause and cheering that echoed throughout the gymnasium. Yuki responded by raising her hand and returning to the side of the stage. Masachika looked at the scene with a wry smile.</p>


<p>&quot;How cunning. She&apos;s just playing with words and deceiving with the bigger picture, she didn&apos;t even say anything about what she&apos;s going to do this year. On top of that, she made an excuse that seemed like a follow-up to senpai&apos;s, &quot;We don&apos;t have many members of the student council this year, so we can&apos;t realize the contents of the suggestion box.&quot; ...and most importantly it&apos;s still somewhat convincing.&quot;</p>


<p>Hearing Masachika&apos;s words, Touya also nodded with a wry smile that was mixed with admiration.</p>


<p>&quot;Suou is indeed good at talking and boasting. Isn&apos;t she much better than me?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Ahaha, it&apos;s just a matter of experience... does that make Yuki a bit of a liar, huh?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;You are indeed unforgiving.&quot;</p>


<p>On the other side while they were laughing, Maria was talking to Alisa.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya-chan, are you okay? Are you feeling nervous?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I&apos;m fine... just leave me alone for now.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Geez, Alya-chan is always so serious.&quot;</p>


<p>Maria puffed out her cheeks at her sister, who was always as nonchalant as usual. As she smiled again, the event moderator called Ayano to the podium. Her appearance projected on the screen caused a bit of a commotion. However, it was only natural that there would be a commotion in the audience. That&apos;s because, Ayano who was standing at the podium... although she was wearing a uniform, her hair was neatly put in a bun like a maid. Her bangs, which had always been disheveled, looked neat, and her beautiful forehead was exposed. Although she looked expressionless as usual, her face looked excited...</p>


<p>No, it&apos;s probably just Masachika&apos;s imagination. In any case, Ayano, who usually keeps a low profile, stood on the podium with her bangs open, causing many male students to say, &quot;Who is that pretty girl?&quot; and even some girls shouted, &quot;Kyaa~! Ayanochan is so cute~!&quot; In fact, despite her appearance, Ayano is quite popular as a mascot among the few girls who know her.</p>


<p>&quot;My name is Kimishima Ayano, serving as general affairs within the student council. In my private life, I am a servant of the Suou family and serve Yuki-sama as her personal maid.&quot;</p>


<p>The atmosphere in the gymnasium at that moment could simply be described as &quot;?!!!&quot; due to the shock of the audience. A mysterious beautiful girl suddenly appeared and claimed to be Yuki&apos;s personal maid. For most people, they would do a tsukkomi, &quot;Eh, wait a minute, there&apos;s a lot of information that needs to be digested first.&quot;</p>


<p>However, Ayano continued on regardless of the commotion in the audience.</p>


<p>&quot;Next year, I plan to run for election together with Yuki-sama. I will use my experience as Yuki-sama&apos;s servant since childhood, and support her. Yuki-sama is a wonderful person who deserves to be called well-behaved and talented. I am confident that she will lead the school well as student council president.&quot;</p>


<p>Ayano continued to speak without hesitation as if she was reading a script. But, the way she spoke without the slightest hint of acting or exaggeration, as well as the straightforward look in her eyes, gave a strange sense of truth to what she said. Somehow, the audience could tell that she was only telling the truth. And in fact, Ayano is only telling what is true for her.</p>


<p>&quot;Yuki-sama has always been a top student at school, and her English has already reached the level of native speakers. Recently, she has been learning Chinese and has reached a level that allows for daily conversation. She also shows great talent in piano, flower arranging, karate, and others. She is truly a person who is full of many talents. Even so, Yuki-sama was never arrogant, and is always considerate of those around her. Even for servants like me, she always gives precious gifts every year on my birthday.&quot;</p>


<p>Then Ayano closed her eyes, raised her chin slightly and closed her lips tightly. ...... Apparently, she had intended to put on a satisfied face... butcher expression didn&apos;t change at all. Seeing Ayano&apos;s satisfied face (?) several girls shouted in a shrill tone. As if carried away by the atmosphere, laughter began to spread around the audience with saying, &quot;That girl is kind of interesting too, huh.&quot;</p>


<p>While blinking her eyes slightly at the unexpected reaction, Ayano then proudly and... perhaps enthusiastically talked about Yuki. The audience also listened to Ayano&apos;s story, because of the unique atmosphere that she brought.</p>


<p>&quot;Well, it was bound to turn out like this.&quot; Masachika muttered to herself while listening to Ayano&apos;s speech from the side of the stage.</p>


<p>&quot;Yuki&apos;s persuasive speech was backed up by her achievements back in middle school. And Ayano further emphasized it from the point of view of a servant who has served her since childhood...&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika gave a high rating after conducting an objective analysis of the two rivals. Then, she looked back at Alisa and said.</p>


<p>&quot;This was a perfect speech. She&apos;s trying hard to attack first and first and trying to achieve a landslide victory.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika calmly admitted that the situation was quite difficult, but Alisa asked with a look that didn&apos;t show the slightest bit of anxiety.</p>


<p>&quot;...But, we are able to win it, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, it&apos;s all thanks to your efforts.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika nodded at the unwavering confidence directed to her. She then smiled with satisfaction that Alisa was not distracted by her rival&apos;s speech, and gently placed therival&apos;s speech, and gently placed her hand on Alisa&apos;s shoulder.</p>


<p>&quot;Therefore, you don&apos;t need to make strange speeches to compete with her.&quot;</p>


<p>From the beginning, Masachika knew that Alisa had no chance against Yuki if they fought on the same field. The other party also knew that, and they might try to stir up Alisa&apos;s rivalry in order to make her enter the same field.</p>


<p>&quot;I know... my head has become cold thanks to what you told me.&quot;</p>


<p>But now that she had calmed down after hearing Masachika&apos;s words, Alisa had no desire to compete with Yuki.</p>


<p>&quot;Thank goodness then. You still remember the name of this show, right?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika&apos;s question was answered by Alisa with a faint smile on her face.</p>


<p>&quot;Of course. The &quot;greeting speech&quot; of the student council members, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;That&apos;s right, the greeting speech. It&apos;s customary to make a speech, but originally that wasn&apos;t the original intention. First of all...&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika then turned her attention to the students gathered in the gymnasium.</p>


<p>&quot;Let&apos;s start by getting to know you.&quot;</p>


<p>At the same time, Ayano finished her speech in exactly three minutes, bowed, and stepped down from the podium. She was then joined by Yuki, who came out from the upstage side, and together bowed to the audience. Immediately, there was a standing ovation and cheers that seemed like it would shake the gymnasium.</p>


<p>The roar of applause and cheers continued for more than ten seconds as the moderator hesitated to continue, and finally began to calm down when Yuki and Ayano went backstage.</p>


<p>&quot;Umm then, next up is Kujou Alisa&apos;s speech as treasurer of the student council.&quot;</p>


<p>In front of the students who were still excited, Alisa went up to the podium. The students</p>

<p>finally began to pay attention to the silver-haired girl who appeared on the screen.</p>


<p>The mood among the audience was 50% showing interest, 30% indifferent, and 20% pitying. Most of the students were mesmerized by the speech of the Yuki-Ayano couple, and some of them seemed to be cheering or expecting something from Alisa. With such an atmosphere, Alisa quietly opened her mouth and said&hellip;</p>


<p>Спасибо за представление Я казначей ученического совета Кудзё Алиса На будущий год я планирую выдвинуться кандидатом на выборах председателя совета Прошу вас поддержать меня</p>


<p>(TN: roughly translates to &ldquo;Thank you for having me. I am the treasurer of the student council Kujoui Alisa and I plan to run for next year&rsquo;s election as a student council presidential candidate, I thank you for your support&rdquo;)</p>



<p>She started speaking in Russian at a high speed. Most of the students were stunned to see her. When all the students who were still excited by Yuki and Ayano&apos;s speeches turned their attention to Alisa, she suddenly closed her mouth and blinked slowly.</p>


<p>&quot;...Sorry, I was so nervous that I slipped up speaking Russian.&quot;</p>


<p>The students laughed at the sentence Alisa said with a serious expression. The fact that Princess Alya said something that looked like a joke with a facial expression that made it hard to think that she was joking made the &quot;No, that&apos;s not possible, is it&quot;, &quot;Eh? Was that a joke?&quot; and so on.</p>


<p>Alisa breathed a sigh of relief at the expected response. This attention-grabbing moment. This is the secret trick Masachika gave Alisa yesterday. Listen carefully, from the beginning, speak Russian right away.</p>


<p>&apos;Since Yuki and Ayano are the first to speak, by the time it&apos;s your turn to speak, the atmosphere in the hall must still be lively because of Yuki&apos;s speech and Ayano&apos;s speeches. Then, you need to defuse the atmosphere of the hall with your native Russian. This can also help to ease your tension as well. You will probably be very nervous while on stage, and even if you don&apos;t realize it, you might still have the trauma of not being able to speak well in a school broadcast.</p>

<p>speak well in school broadcasts. So, speak in Russian until you feel comfortable. You don&apos;t have to worry~, if it&apos;s in Russian, no one will notice even if you mess up a bit.&apos;</p>


<p>Alisa secretly smiled as she remembered what Masachika said. She then took a deep breath, and turned towards the microphone again.</p>


<p>&quot;Introducing myself once again, my name is Kujou Alisa as the student council treasurer. Next year, I plan to run for student council president.&quot;</p>


<p>However, even after taking a deep breath, it took a lot of courage to say the next words. There was still a slight hesitation in her heart. Alisa was still wondering if this was enough. But... this is the &quot;Greeting speech&quot;. It&apos;s a greeting to let everyone know who the girl named Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou is. (Then... I have to speak the truth. I can&apos;t fake it. I have to be upfront about myself!)</p>


<p>Inspiring herself, Alisa turned to the front and began to speak.</p>


<p>&quot;I just transferred to this school last year and haven&apos;t had any achievements that I&apos;m to be proud of. I&apos;ve only just started working as a student council member and I dare not say that I fully understand the hard work and responsibility of being a leader. I believe there are many shortcomings I have in becoming the student council president of this school.&quot;</p>


<p>Alisa was afraid of the audience&apos;s reaction. She felt it was inappropriate to show her imperfect self. But Masachika admitted it. Her partner, who was more reliable than anyone else, said that he wanted to support Alisa for who she was. While believing his words, Alisa tried to continue.</p>


<p>&quot;But, if there&apos;s one thing I can be proud of...&quot;</p>


<p>Then, Alisa put her hand on her chest and looked around at the audience, stating clearly.</p>


<p>&quot;That thing is that I&apos;m the kind of person who can work harder than other people.&quot;</p>


<p>Yes, this was all she could say. She could assure that it was not a lie.</p>


<p>&quot;I always strive to achieve the results I want. You can see from the fact that I have been at the top of the exam rankings since I entered this school.&quot;</p>


<p>Suddenly, however, Alisa felt that she was having trouble breathing. It was at that moment</p>

<p>she realized that her breathing was labored. But, there was no time to worry about that now. She had to continue her speech without being interrupted...!</p>


<p>&quot;In addition, I was selected as the MVP athlete for the girls&apos; category at last year&apos;s sports festival, and my class won the sports festival last year. Of course, I didn&apos;t do it alone, but there was...&quot;</p>


<p>I can&apos;t breathe...!</p>


<p>My legs are shaking.</p>


<p>I can&apos;t even hear well. No, am I refusing to listen to myself?</p>


<p>&quot;It&apos;s true that I still lack something, as the student council president now, but...&quot;</p>


<p>The words addressed to the audience during the debate rang again in Alisa&apos;s mind, as well as her own words during the school broadcast. She felt that her throat was tightening as she thought about how to speak properly so that the same incident would not happen again.</p>


<p>Ahh, I knew it was impossible. There&apos;s no way I can look into the eyes of the audience and speak directly to them. I&apos;ve always ran alone all my life, and have never acknowledged anyone.</p>


<p>Alisa felt her field of vision becoming blurry. Her lungs felt tight, and she couldn&apos;t breathe properly--</p>


<p>Не вешай нос!&quot; (Look forward!)</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VwY5VsV/image-034.jpg" width="500" height="540">

<p>Suddenly, the sound of someone speaking Russian rang in her ears. Alisa felt her senses suddenly become clear. She realized that her gaze had lowered down.</p>


<p>(Why, in Russian... perhaps, you were practicing on purpose for this moment?)</p>


<p>At the same time the thought came to her mind, Alisa could feel a strong gaze watching her from the off-stage side. Instantly, Alisa felt a little strange. She couldn&apos;t help but smile at her partner who was overprotective.</p>


<p>As she lifted her face, she could see the slightly confused faces of the students. She could hear... her voice. At the same time, Alisa remembered her purpose and looked forward, proudly puffing out her chest.</p>


<p>&quot;Sorry for the slight pause earlier. I&apos;m sure there are still many shortcomings in my role as student council president at the moment. The same goes for my experience in public speaking. I realized this the other day when I made a small mistake in the school broadcast.&quot;</p>


<p>Actually, even now it is still the same. Even now, without the help of her partner, she would probably fail again. But...</p>


<p>&quot;But, I can speak like this now. With my own mouth, with my own words, and from now on, I will continue to fill in my shortcomings, one by one.&quot;</p>


<p>While speaking like that, Alisa felt that the words seeped into her heart. into her heart.</p>


<p>(Ah, I see... I&apos;m not perfect at all...)</p>


<p>How arrogant she had been until now. She looked down on the people around her, believing herself to be better than others based on her own judgment.</p>


<p>But the truth is, there are many things she can&apos;t do that others can easily do. Not only Yuki, the first person she recognizes as a peer group rival, nor Masachika, the first person she respects. Whether it was Sayaka, Nonoa, Ayano and others... she was certain that they had something better than herself.</p>


<p>Until now, she had not understood that. Although she acknowledged it through words, she did not acknowledge it in her heart. But now... she has finally started to understand it.</p>


<p>(I didn&apos;t expect that I&apos;d been cornered this far and finally realized that...)</p>


<p>Alisa laughed at herself inwardly, but she thought that that was just how she was. She was not good at interacting with others, and was reluctant to admit her shortcomings because of her high self-esteem. But, because of her pride, she tried desperately to overcome it. That&apos;s the nature of the girl named Kujou Alisa. At some point, the fear of showing her imperfect self was gone. No longer worrying about the script, Alisa spoke directly to the audience with a rather fresh expression.</p>


<p>&quot;I can promise that I will continue to strive to become the ideal student council president. If at next year&apos;s election campaign I&apos;m not sure whether I&apos;m suitable to be the student council president..., I will immediately resign from the election campaign.&quot;</p>


<p>Then, Alisa bowed her head quickly.</p>


<p>&quot;Therefore, please keep an eye on me from now on, and don&apos;t hesitate to point out my shortcomings as student council president. I will try to use all of those suggestions to become the student council president that you want. For your attention, I thank you very much.&quot;</p>


<p>As Alisa stepped down from the podium, a standing ovation followed her. It was not enthusiastic applause, but rather... warm applause as if to praise a good fight. Alisa bowed deeply again and left the podium. After confirming the situation from the side of the stage, Masachika felt relieved.</p>


<p>(In general, it&apos;s a high evaluation... Considering the atmosphere that the opposing party has built, she has done a good job. It seems that Alisa&apos;s speech went in a different direction than Yuki&apos;s.)</p>


<p>After she calmly analyzed it like so, Alisa returned to the outer side of the stage.</p>


<p>&quot;Yoo~~, good job on the podium earlier. I&apos;m glad everything went well.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...really?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes, it was very good. You looked great, too.&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika patted Alisa&apos;s shoulder lightly and looked into her eyes curiously.</p>


<p>&quot;...For some reason, your eyes look more relieved, huh?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes... I feel like I can step forward a little.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Is that so...?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika could not fully understand the meaning of Alisa&apos;s words. However, at that moment, the moderator called Masachika&apos;s name, and he raised her face.</p>


<p>&quot;Looks like it&apos;s my turn... then, I&apos;ll be leaving first.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes... fight on.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Leave it to me. Then...&quot;</p>


<p>While heading to the podium, Masachika grinned at Alisa...and the two people who were behind Alisa.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, I&apos;ll win this first.&quot;</p>


<p>As Masachika walked onto the stage, the students&apos; attention was drawn to the last student council member. While walking comfortably among the crowd, Masachika looked around at the audience with a grin as he climbed the podium.</p>


<p>&quot;Hello, I&apos;m Kuze Masachika who is in charge of general affairs in the student council. Next year, I plan to run for the student council president election together with Kujou Alisa. And...&quot;</p>


<p>During the pause, Masachika wasted no time by waving his hand and striking a pose. His left arm was stuck under his chest, his left hand supporting the elbow of his right arm, and his right hand, raised straight up, partially covers his face with his eyes closed like someone with chuunibyou syndrome. It is a pose with a piercing gaze. In fact, Masachika put on a nihilistic smile and glanced at the audience.</p>


<p>&quot;The person who once supported Suou Yuki to become the student council president as the deputy shadow president is myself...&quot;</p>


<p>The confession was made with many pauses and exaggerated staging, and the reaction of the audience...</p>


<p>&quot;Pfftt.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>


<p>Some in the audience responded with laughter, others with a reacted &quot;what the hell is he doing?&quot;, and most of them muttered</p>


<p>&quot;Hee~ so that&apos;s it&quot;. Masachika winked and tilted his her head at the audience&apos;s cold response which was more than she expected.</p>


<p>&quot;...Eh? Was that introduction more crisp than I thought?&quot;</p>


<p>The percentage of people laughing at Masachika&apos;s overly honest comments increased. In the midst of all this, Masachika coughed to clear his throat and said to change the mood.</p>


<p>&quot;And yeah, I&apos;m the vice president of the junior high school student council, in the shadow of Suou Yuki. I&apos;m sure, there are many of you who are wondering, &apos;Huh? So, why did you not run with Suou-san? Are you cheating on her? Yes, right~?&quot;</p>


<p>Laughter spread like ripples after the ridiculous way Masachika had addressed the audience.</p>


<p>&quot;Therefore, I want to say it clearly!&quot;</p>


<p>The audience&apos;s laughter died down as Masachika slammed his hand on the podium loudly. Masachika looked around with a sharp gaze at the audience, whose eyes widened without raising their voices, and declared with a serious face.</p>


<p>&quot;I&apos;ve already broken up with Yuki! So this isn&apos;t called cheating!&quot;</p>


<p>Amidst the tense atmosphere, his words were met with laughter, and some male students jokingly made lighthearted comments such as,</p>


<p>&quot;You bastard!&quot; or &quot;You change partners too quickly, oiii&quot;.</p>


<p>Masachika responded to them by raising his hand briefly, and then began to speak in a calm voice.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, why did I decide not to run with Yuki and Alya instead... Before talking about that, let me tell you something serious... What kind of person do you all think is worthy of being the student council president? A great person? I don&apos;t think so. I think the person who is worthy of being student council president is... someone who attracts the people around him or her. Oh yes, I know what you mean. &quot;Don&apos;t you mean is Yuki?&quot; I understand that, but I want you to listen to the end first.&quot;</p>


<p>After causing more laughter with his disjointed speech, Masachika continued on after crushing the audience&apos;s questions first.</p>


<p>&quot;In that case, I would like to talk specifically about someone who attracts the people around them... After all, in my opinion, the person in question is a straightforward person. Someone who can listen well to other people&apos;s opinions well. And also, it should be a hardworking person. Someone who can make the people around them think, &quot;They&apos;re working hard, so I should work hard too!&quot; when they see them. And most importantly... someone with a beautiful heart. Someone who doesn&apos;t want to hurt others, and can reach out to others by destroying their own selfishness. People will gather around such a person, and I believe that a figure who can make a lot of allies in that way is more suitable to be the student council president.&quot;</p>


<p>After speaking in an organized and logical manner, Masachika changed his tone of voice slightly and asked a question.</p>


<p>&quot;Based on that... What did you all think when you heard Alya&apos;s speech earlier? I don&apos;t want to talk about the content of the speech... Ah, but the first sentence in Russian is an exception, okay? If I may be blunt, it was my idea to make it more interesting.&quot;</p>


<p>At Masachika&apos;s unexpected confession, there were many sounds of surprise from the audience</p>

<p>accompanied by laughter, such as &quot;You&apos;re just saying that now!&quot; or &quot;So that was you!&quot;. In response, Masachika waved his hand to the side as if to imply &quot;No, no&quot;.</p>


<p>&quot;After all, how could Alya have done something like that on her on her own... As the conversation seems to have gotten off track, let&apos;s get back to the topic of the discussion earlier. To be honest, while listening to Alya&apos;s speech from off stage, I thought that she was really very awkward.&quot;</p>


<p>With a wry smile on her face, Masachika made a negative remark about his colleague&apos;s speech, which caused a bit of a stir in the audience.</p>


<p>&quot;But at the same time, I felt that it was very straightforward and honest. I&apos;m sure you all felt the same way, right?&quot;</p>


<p>A large number of students nodded in response to her question. Masachika nodded back in satisfaction, and said.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya is an honest person. She doesn&apos;t try to make herself look pretentious, great and doesn&rsquo;t try to gain popularity by making big statements that she can&apos;t realize. She&apos;s just someone who works hard, as she said in her speech earlier. Other than that, she&apos;s an innocent person. So innocent that she&apos;s willing to accept my idea to make a silly joke.&quot;</p>


<p>Having said that in a joking tone, Masachika changed his expression to look more serious and continued.</p>


<p>&quot;I was attracted to that side of Alya and wanted to support her. That&apos;s the reason why I decided to support Alya over Yuki. And I hope everyone else will support Alya too.&quot;</p>


<p>After saying that, Masachika looked around the audience. Then he immediately shouted, &quot;Well.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Even so, you can&apos;t believe it in my own opinion. ... if someone says &quot;It&apos;s not just a matter of your taste~&quot; it would be useless, wouldn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>


<p>Shrugging his shoulders, Masachika nodded as if to say, &quot;Maybe there&apos;s some truth to that,&quot; and then held up his index finger.</p>


<p>&quot;Well then, let me tell you one fact.&quot;</p>


<p>Then, after doing his best to capture the audience&apos;s attention to its limit--- Masachika began to play his card.</p>


<p>&quot;When Alya becomes student council president,... Taniyama Sayaka and Miyamae Nonoa will</p>

<p>join her as student council members.&quot; The contents were too unbelievable. After a short pause, a commotion could be heard.</p>


<p>&quot;I already got a promise from them about this. Can you guys believe it? The people who were competing against each other in the debate the other day, are now saying that they will work together in the new student council. This is impossible even for me and the old Yuki.&quot;</p>


<p>In front of the audience who were confused and looking at her suspiciously, Masachika glanced at Yuki who was off to the side of the stage.</p>


<p>&quot;Earlier, Yuki said that only she, the one who has a long experience as a student council member, can change the school. But, is that really the case? Besides Alya, there&apos;s me, who has the same experience as Yuki, as well as Taniyama and Miyamae, who were once the most promising candidates to become the student council president. Do you all still think so after listening to these members?&quot;</p>


<p>Masachika&apos;s question created an atmosphere among the students who said,</p>


<p>&quot;Indeed, that member, ....&quot;. Then, Masachika pressed further.</p>


<p>&quot;Moreover, Yuki also said that this year there are only a few class members in the student council, so there&apos;s not much we can do. So, why are there only a few first-year members entering the student council? The answer is simple. It&apos;s because they all left the student council after losing the elections in their second year, and this is true of the student councils of the previous generation as well. There were only a couple of talented people who were able to become student council president, and the students who will be the next generation of the student council, will leave one after another after competing against each other in debates. Therefore, the student council is always understaffed.&quot;</p>


<p>That was a fact that everyone knew. However, it was a fact that was too obvious that many did not think much about it</p>


<p>&quot;But, if you look at it from the opposite point of view... If there are members of the second year who are more experienced, wouldn&apos;t you think that the student council could operate stably without being affected by the uncertainty of the first year members? And only a student council with Alya at the center can do that. If Alya is elected as student council president, she will be surrounded by a dream team of former president and vice president. This is the best student council I can imagine.&quot;</p>


<p>There were many students who were happy with the idea that Masachika had put forward. Former opponents would join hands and run the student council together. Many students&apos; eyes lit up at the dreamlike concept that had never been seen before. Masachika then continued with a more potent tone.</p>


<p>&quot;Of course, this is no exception for Yuki and Ayano. When Alya becomes the president of the</p>

<p>Student Council, I want them to join the Student Council as well. Moreover~ Yuki has shown her enthusiasm to be able to change the school. Even if she loses the election, I&apos;m sure she&apos;ll be happy to give her support!&quot;</p>


<p>In a joking manner that invites laughter, Masachika even manages to attract Yuki&apos;s sympathizers by stating that he would make Yuki their ally in the future. Then, he bowed in a theatrical gesture to the laughing audience.</p>


<p>&quot;The speech I gave became too long, that&apos;s all from me. me. In order to realize the best student council ever, I ask for your support from all of you. Thank you very much for your attention.&quot;</p>


<p>As Masachika left the podium, a final surprise occurred. Just as Masachika started to walk to the bottom of the stage, Alisa came out from the outside of the stage. And behind her, ...unexpectedly, Sayaka and</p>

<p>Nonoa also appeared.</p>


<p>&quot;Hmm? Three people... huh, ehhhh?!?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Uh, impossible!?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Hey, look at that!&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Uwahhh, seriously!?&quot;</p>


<p>The sight that instantly proved Masachika&apos;s words caused the biggest uproar of the day...</p>

<p>Then, when the four people who joined together bowed their heads, there was an explosion of applause and cheers. The students did not know what kind of interaction was going on between the four of them. But it didn&apos;t matter. Two pairs of candidates who should not have been able to establish a relationship, were now starting to hold hands. That fact alone was enough for them to raise their voices.</p>


<p>&quot;Alya, this is the applause you won with your own strength, by yourself.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;.... !&quot;</p>


<p>With his head still bowed, Masachika said so to Alisa who was next to her, and could see that she gasped. Knowing this, Masachika didn&apos;t dare look at Alisa&apos;s expression. Then, amidst applause that was no less loud than Yuki and Ayano, the four of them returned to the outer side of the stage.</p>


<p>&quot;Yuhuu~, good job.&quot; (Nonoa)</p>


<p>&quot;...good job.&quot; (Alya)</p>


<p>&quot;You&apos;re welcome~&quot; (Masachika)</p>


<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>


<p>They had worked hard for each other, but only Sayaka had looked away with a complicated expression. She quietly pushed her glasses and said in a flat tone.</p>


<p>&quot;...This way, I&apos;ve repaid my debt, right?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...Yes, thank you. I find it very helpful.&quot;</p>


<p>Sayaka&apos;s gaze wandered uncomfortably at Alisa who was thanking her honestly and bowed her head.</p>


<p>&quot;As I&apos;ve said before... I don&apos;t support you guys. I&apos;ll keep my promise to join the student council if you guys are elected, but I won&apos;t help with your election campaign.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;I know that. I&apos;ll try...to get you to support me&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...I see.&quot;</p>


<p>Sayaka turned around and headed for the emergency exit entrance at the back of the building. Then she paused for a moment and said a few words over her.</p>


<p>&quot;...I&apos;ll look forward to it.&quot;</p>


<p>After saying that, Sayaka walked out of the door. With a wry smile on her face, Nonoa followed suit.</p>


<p>&quot;Then, try your best, huh~. I also can&apos;t say for sure that I&apos;ll support you guys, but if Alisa manages to become the student council president, I&apos;ll work together with you guys, anyway~&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Oh~ thank you very much, yes~&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;A-Alisa...?&quot;</p>


<p>After looking at Nonoa&apos;s back with a puzzled feeling, Alisa looked back to the other side of the stage. She conveyed her intentions to Yuki who was standing there with a strong gaze. This was the reason why she wanted to become the student council president.</p>


<p>(Originally, that might have been my only goal... but now, I&apos;m carrying the hopes of Kuze-kun, Taniyama-san and Miyamae-san. Therefore, I will not lose. I won&apos;t feel overwhelmed by your determination anymore)</p>


<p>In response to her strong gaze... Yuki smiled casually and conveyed with her eyes &apos;I don&apos;t want to lose either. Good determination, if you&apos;re ready, go ahead and fight me.&apos;</p>


<p>The two of them exchanged glances for a few seconds, but it was interrupted when Alisa was approached by Maria. Upon seeing Alisa start talking to Maria and Masachika talking to Touya, Yuki muttered with a wry smile wryly.</p>


<p>&quot;Our side really lost badly, huh.&quot;</p>


<p>This was supposed to be a winnable game. No, this was just a difference in their achievements and name recognition. After the overwhelming preliminary victory in the school broadcast, this should have been a game that could be won by a large margin. However, the result obtained was a draw. No, although the amount of applause were almost equal, but in excitement and impact on the audience, their side probably lost. The result was a draw, but if considering the process, they suffered a crushing defeat.</p>


<p>&quot;Well~ I didn&apos;t expect that he managed to pull those two people into becoming their allies...I was really surprised.&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki nodded at Chisaki who said that with an impressed tone.</p>


<p>&quot;...Yes, that&apos;s right. This is really unexpected.&quot;</p>


<p>Yes, it really was an unexpected situation. And this was probably... a situation that was caused by Yuki herself. The battle on the school broadcast, which was made to break Alisa&apos;s heart and made her depressed. Perhaps that event was the trigger for those two people to take Alisa&apos;s side.</p>


<p>(Looks like I schemed too much... and ended up highlighting Alya&apos;s innocence.)</p>


<p>On top of that, she made her brother take things seriously. So this is what a strategist who was fooled in her own scheme, as Yuki gritted her teeth inwardly, Ayano bowed her head.</p>


<p>&quot;Please forgive me, Yuki-sama. If only I could speak a little better--&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;It&apos;s not Ayano&apos;s fault. It&apos;s my failure for misjudging the strategy of Masachika-kun after being fooled by my own conjecture.&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki shook her head to interrupt Ayano&apos;s words.</p>


<p>That&apos;s right. If only she wasn&apos;t too fooled by her own conjectures herself, she would have chosen to make a speech in the last turn. She guessed that the opposing party was aiming for a draw... No, somewhere deep down her heart, she thought that was the only way the opposing party would go. Yuki thought that if she fought directly... she definitely wouldn&apos;t lose, even if her opponent was her own brother. She arrogantly thought so, and dismissed her brother&apos;s threat as a mere bluff, and tried to achieve a landslide victory.</p>


<p>(I&apos;m sure that this was all predicted by Onii-chan too...)</p>


<p>Her brother must have felt confident that he had fully guessed the mind of Yuki and knew how she would react, and then she made such a blunt threat. If it wasn&apos;t for that, Yuki would have approached with caution.</p>


<p>&quot;It&apos;s strange, he&apos;s too calm for this matter. Is he planning something?&quot;</p>


<p>(Onii-chan is indeed smarter than me in everything... Ahahaha)</p>


<p>Despite losing... Yuki had a strange and relieved feeling in her heart. It was true that she wanted to beat her brother. But at the same time, she didn&apos;t want her brother to lose. She thought that her brother, whom she once admired and respected, was still extraordinary. The thought that made him want to believe that was still there.</p>


<p>(Ah~ bad. This way of thinking is not good for me...)</p>


<p>Both her desire to defeat her brother and her desire to not want her brother to lose are all true. But if she feels relieved at being defeated, she will never be able to win against her brother in the future.</p>


<p>Therefore, Yuki suppressed her emotions and smiled fearlessly.</p>


<p>&quot;Well, let&apos;s admit our defeat this time. Just this one time, okay...&quot; Yuki muttered, and smiled fiercely while being filled with determination to win next time. Chisaki instantly turned her gaze away, as if she had seen something that she should not have seen. After looking at her with a sideways glance, Ayano was quietly talking to Yuki.</p>


<p>&quot;Yuki-sama.&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;...so it&apos;s a depiction of a strong character trait, huh?&quot;</p>


<p>With sparkling eyes, Ayano brought her hands together in front of her chest as if to say, &quot;I&apos;m starting to understand it!&quot;...</p>


<p>&quot;No, I didn&apos;t aim for that, you know.&quot;</p>


<p>Yuki sighed and unconsciously performed tsukkomi on her</p>
