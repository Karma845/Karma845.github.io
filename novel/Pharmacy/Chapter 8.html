<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; The Medicine God&#8217;s Consultation and The Medicine God&#8217;s Legend </h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>8.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning from Marseille, Falma was also working hard to give checkups and prescribe medicine for the workers of the pharmaceutical factory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is going back and forth between Marseille and the imperial capital to prescribe, make follow-up examinations, and check the condition of the construction of internal plants inside the factory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he didn&#8217;t forget to present the camera and photography to the Empress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the imperial court, it seems that Falma was treated more of an inventor rather than a court apothecary.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress seemed to have a huge liking to the photography, and she made her aides take many family pictures and even gravure photos, so it might really be a matter of time before a photo collection was published. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma had just heard that a photobook of the imperial prince Louis would be created. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unexpectedly, the Empress might love taking pictures a lot. Falma carefreely thought, but the Empress did not only love taking pictures of herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She made an order to start recording the townscape of the imperial capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, it was said that as soon as photography was invented on Earth, the townscape of France was started to be recorded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Lotte, the artists within the court atelier started to become afraid that they might lose their worth because of the invention of photography. Naturally, their hate pointed towards Falma who invented it. Although they could not show blatant attitudes because of the Empress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ahh, this is a bit……I feel bad for those artists) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma is obliged to present his inventions to the Empress, so even the inventions he made for personal use would immediately cause stirs within the inner circle of the imperial capital. He could somewhat imagine what happened, so Falma felt bad for the artists. But even so, with the appearance of photography in the history of Earth, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Cubism, etc. was created, so there might also be some kind of change within the art world of this world. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the advantages and disadvantages created by photography, their advantages are bigger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that were the case, glaucoma court painter Dale&#8217;s Surrealistic Style, or Lotte&#8217;s Art Nouveau Style would receive further evaluation, so portrait painters who are researching highly original and highly non-realistic style of art might begin to emerge. That was what Falma predicted for the future, after listening to Lotte&#8217;s story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the change of technology, art would also change. However, it might have been too quick within the span of two years. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I guess I shouldn&#8217;t reproduce color pictures for a while) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought that there might be artists who would paint color on the pictures, and he didn&#8217;t want to receive unneeded hate. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> …━━…━━…━━… </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has not been so busy, so Falma got a rest day, so he was preparing to go out on that day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-sama, where are you going this early?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well, I just have some business to do」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte wakes up early, so she is well-groomed and wearing her servant clothes with an apron properly. As usual, she would take care of Falma and Blanche as the de Médicis Family&#8217;s servant, although Falma reduced her workload. Lotte would usually wake up Falma with a &#8220;good morning&#8221; bringing him his change of clothes, so even if he tries to leave early, it is difficult for him to get a start on Lotte. Although Falma thought he could attend to himself, that was not applicable to high nobles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While letting Lotte polish his boots and put his coat on, Falma was thinking of a way to shake them off. Lotte got him dressed attentively. Lotte&#8217;s work was conscientious compared to other servants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Elder Brother〜, bring Blanche with you〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanche appeared while still wearing her pajama and hugging her doll, with a messy bed head. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Blanche-sama, please wait okay. I will bring you your change of clothes right away. After that would be breakfast. Ojou-sama&#8217;s favorite lassi will be served too」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte smiled at Blanche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Fineee」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanche seemed to be still sleepy, her eyes were almost closed after she nodded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ne〜, Elder Brother〜, where are you going?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma won&#8217;t say where he was going, so Blanche wanted to know where. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Just for a walk! I&#8217;ll be back at lunch」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Noo〜! Blanche will go too〜!!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The two of you, bye-bye!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please have a nice day. Be careful」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte followed him to the entrance and bowed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma somehow shook them off somehow. He let his favorite horse run on the morning imperial capital. His destination is the Guardian Temple of the San Flueve Imperial Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest would visit the pharmacy every day and there would be a bit of a commotion when a priest sees him, so he does not like to go to the temple willingly, but today, he decided to consult them about his worries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And his worries was, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I&#8217;m being called Medicine God, Medicine God by people from all kinds of fields it&#8217;s hard) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was feeling urgent about it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma possesses several kinds of special abilities, but he believes that he is not the &#8220;Medicine God&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, recently, although some of it was because of his carelessness, almost everyone from all kinds of fields treats him as the Medicine God, making him feel stressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Lotte, Blanch, and his mother might be treating him as human. That&#8217;s why he is the most relaxed when interacting with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress and Ellen understands Falma even after knowing the circumstances, so they are also important people for him, as one of the few who truly understands him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, he wants some evidence that could deny him to be the Medicine God, and even if he was truly the Medicine God, he wanted to be ready for it. Being in between frustrates him the most. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>8.2</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guardian Temple is in the center part of the imperial capital, near to the Empress&#8217;s palace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Good morningー」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Haaaa! Isn&#8217;t this Falma-sama, please, welcome!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest Salomon was preparing the altar and the ceremonial ornaments before the morning mass, but he stopped doing everything he was and welcomed Falma. Receiving Falma&#8217;s visit, the priests started to fidget around; they seem to be very happy about the event. This was also one of the reasons Falma feel worried and stressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I wanted to talk about something with Head Priest today」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Falma entered the temple, the temple&#8217;s floor released a bluish-white light as usual. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Going to the temple, is really……) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma was guided to a room, and the Head Priest himself served him tea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uhm, please do not mind me」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma said because he was afraid that &#8220;offerings&#8221; would come in bulk if he didn&#8217;t say anything. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And so, what is it for today?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I came to hear about the Medicine God&#8217;s legends」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It is a bit strange that His Holiness does not know about himself」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salomon looked at Falma with eyes saying &#8220;you must know more&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uh, no, I&#8217;m not that, so……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite saying that, the circumstantial evidence was anything but less. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma is able to use the Medicine God Staff that humans are unable to wield, he has several cheat abilities, on top of that, he does not have a shadow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Falma did not receive an oracle for a being called Medicine God, nor he had the consciousness of being one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「His Holiness does not wish to acknowledge what he is huh. When we first met, His Holiness threatened me &#8220;I will curse you&#8221;, so I believed that he knew what he was」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest smiled calmly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I just, well, said it without thinking, since it matches the situation. It&#8217;s what you call a bluff」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma felt embarrassed; it&#8217;s as if he was listening to his dark history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I see」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest nodded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「According to legends, what god was the Medicine God? Firstly, does the Medicine God not have a shadow?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It is written in the holy scripture that the Guardian God is light itself; therefore, he has no shadow」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I see」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(It&#8217;s not like it was written exactly huh) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest brought a thick holy book from another room and placed it in front of Falma. The holy book that was adorned with beautiful ornaments was as thick as a dictionary, and Falma was told it was only a copy, not the original texts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest summarized a part of the scripture written about the Medicine God. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Medicine God suddenly appeared a year before the plague. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The god, borrowing the appearance of a girl, named itself the Medicine God, immediately calmed the plague, looked after the people&#8217;s disease and granted medicine suitable for their sickness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was said that the god had a complete holy insignia in the shape of a lightning in its right hand and flew through the sky using the Medicine God Staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Medicine God is immortal and possesses a divine body that can pass through material objects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The god possesses the power to freely go between heaven and earth, returning to the celestial realm from time to time using the powers of the holy spring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Medicine God gradually stopped visiting the earth, and at one point, the god never appeared again after returning to the heavens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was told that the Medicine God only appeared for roughly one year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And only the Medicine God Staff remained as a divine treasure. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It was like that…… thank you very much」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(It&#8217;s already been more than a year since I reincarnated) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the meantime, Falma did not feel he would disappear anytime soon. That made him relieved the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「How old was the Medicine God?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma who heard from the Empress that the holy insignia might&#8217;ve appeared during the age of ten questioned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I do not know that far. It was only mentioned that it was a girl」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Falma did not find out whether the Medicine God possessed the girl, or it was originally a god in a girl&#8217;s form. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(U〜mu…… the situation with me reincarnating before the plague that might&#8217;ve spread all over the world, it was almost the same. Although I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m immortal) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma somehow understood the reason why those who see his divine insignia and abilities would recognize him as the Medicine God. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or rather, the situation matched the legends for quite some time now, so he could not make excuses about it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Leaving aside whether I&#8217;m immortal or not, I don&#8217;t know the way to go to the &#8220;celestial realm&#8221; you know?) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma had some hope that that &#8220;celestial realm&#8221; might be Earth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Maybe that God-possessed came from Earth, then returned to Earth) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If that is so,&#8221; Falma started to think that he might also be able to return to Earth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, that&#8217;s right. By the way, is there any other god who visits the earth just like the Medicine God?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(If possible, I want to consult with other God-possessed. Maybe there&#8217;s even some who came from Earth) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「While you are here, other gods would not come」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma was disappointed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was told that the Guardian Gods would only descend to earth one by one. While the Medicine God has descended, the other gods would not. Up until a few hundred years ago, it was said that the gods frequently descended soon after the previous one returns, but that is not the case recently. The God-possessed would leave divine treasures on earth before they disappear. Because of that, many divine treasures remained on earth, and all of them cannot be touched nor used by humans, so they are treated as divine relics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s why, right now, the only god who descended in this world is Falma-sama, in other words, the Medicine God. We are very blessed to have Falma-sama here on earth, and, how should I describe this. We can feel humanity from His Holiness, so it is a miracle for us even to be able to see you living among us」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like Salomon&#8217;s evaluation of Falma was a god that feels like a human. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Were you, observing me?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That goes without saying, Your Holiness. It is the duty of the priests of this era to record everything you achieved in this world. In that way, the pages of our holy scripture shall increase one page at a time」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recording Falma&#8217;s achievements. It seems that that was also Salomon&#8217;s job as a priest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Also, this might be strange to tell a God, but Your Holiness has a good personality」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Salomon, the gods that descend to earth is not limited to good gods. Among them, there were evil gods who would burn the kingdoms and massacre humans. In that sense, a good god&#8217;s descent is very beneficial to humanity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If I was such existence, what do you think is the Medicine God&#8217;s job?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I believe that it is what you are exactly doing right now. Creating countless medicine and heal people」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that Salomon had misunderstood that Falma is doing his &#8220;work as the Medicine God&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m doing it as my job though」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「In other words……His Holiness does what he does because he cannot bear seeing sick people. Hmm」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that the Temple Priest finally understood Falma&#8217;s inner conflict.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>8.3</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Anyways, we would like for you to stay in this world as long as possible without feeling uncomfortable」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I also don&#8217;t want to die, I want to live a long, healthy life in this world」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the cry from Falma&#8217;s heart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If you really feel that bitter, then I believe that you should just stop being burdened by being called Medicine God. You should just think of it as a nickname」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「In other words, its how I handle it, huh」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like how Hippocrates was referred to as the &#8220;Father of Medicine&#8221;, the Head Priest told Falma to treat it as a nickname. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「A nickname huh〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That eased Falma&#8217;s heart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I feel like I&#8217;ve taken off some burden」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The Empire&#8217;s Temple shall follow as your heart wills, so please come to the temple anytime if you have worries」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After all, the temple is originally a place to help those with worry,&#8221; Salomon smiled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salomon promised that he would ask the priests to treat Falma ordinarily, without making a commotion about it. Of course, Salomon himself too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The mass is about to start, so please excuse me. Also, the great divine treasure&#8217;s replica is finally arriving at the temple tomorrow」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;ll come to see the replica」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh, please, I shall bring it to you」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma left the drawing room as they chatted, and when he was about to pass by the chapel, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uwwaa!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma tripped seeing the believers that gathered to the temple. The believers&#8217; eyes were bloodshot. About 50% of them were like that; there were even some who were unconsciously rubbing their eyes. And using the hands that rubbed their eyes, they touched the chairs and the temple doors. That was how the virus spread. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Everyone&#8217;s eyes look red」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was clear without even the need to use Diagnosis Eye. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「&#8221;Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis&#8221;」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ah〜. It&#8217;s completely spread out) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more faithful the believer is, the more they attended masses, infecting them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please make today&#8217;s sermons longer. Do not let anyone leave even after it ends」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes, did you see some kind of disease?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s true that their eyes are red,&#8221; the Head Priest noticed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s an eye disease. It would immediately spread」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They must not let any of them go home as they are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After telling the other priests &#8220;do not let anyone leave until the mass ends&#8221;, Falma rushed with his horse to prepare antibiotic eye drops enough for the number of people before the mass ends. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the mass ended, Falma stood by the entrance of the chapel and distributes them to the patients he found among the leaving believers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also distributed the eye drops along with prints where the instructions how to use it is written. Like how to spend the days with red eye, avoid touching other people as much as possible, not touch anything with the hand that they used to rub their eye as much as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is caused by a group of adenoviruses. It is highly contagious, so they must be very careful to prevent the spread of infection. Although there is no medicine for adenoviruses, it is possible to relieve the symptoms by instilling antibiotics or steroids. Falma distributed the medicine, especially eyeing those with severe symptoms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What&#8217;s this?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old woman with red eyes asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「They&#8217;re eye drops, medicine for the eyes. You are infected by conjunctivitis. It infects other people」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Now that you&#8217;ve mentioned it, wife said that her eyes are red」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gentleman received the eye drops and the print. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「My eyes seem to be red too」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eye drops have been common even in the pharmacies within the imperial capital, so they received them without resistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh thank you very much. This helps a lot」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salomon said after approaching Falma who sighed in relief after giving out all of the medicine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If the temple becomes a place of infection, it would be very unfortunate to the many believers who came all the way to visit」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma answered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Just like this, you cannot leave them alone, can&#8217;t you」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest couldn&#8217;t help but feel sympathetic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If only everyone else could do what I can」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「For that to be possible, education is needed I might suppose」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma thought that that path was far and endless. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the next day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thank you very much for yesterday. The thing I have mentioned has finally arrived」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest came to the Different World Pharmacy do deliver the great divine treasure without bringing guard priests this time. Guard priests might have been required if it was the original, but it was as ease since it was only the replica. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「This……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma could not help but pinch his cheek after seeing the great divine treasure&#8217;s replica that he saw inside the box. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Although we were unable to replicate its material; the real one is transparent. It was excavated from the stratum of three thousand years ago」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(No way…… what in the world is happening) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Since it&#8217;s called great divine treasure, does it have an amazing divine power?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes, although it seems to store divine powers, no one knows how to use it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest shook his head. He said that he wanted Falma to take a look because he might know how to use it. Ellen, Lotte, and Cedrick took their turns to take a look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma started to think &#8220;this world, don&#8217;t tell me it&#8217;s a dream after all&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written in that replica both in Japanese and English was 「薬谷 完治 &#8211; KANJI YAKUTANI」. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition,  T University Graduate School &#8211; Pharmaceutical Science ○× Course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The object that Salomon called great divine treasure was the staff card that Falma used for the university in his previous life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, it was an ordinary identification card with magnetic data. Although it also has data required to enter and exit the facilities of the university. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uhm, do you understand what is written here?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest looked with a gaze of hope, as he traced the part describing which department the owner of the ID was affiliated with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah〜, I think I&#8217;ve seen it before…… please give me some time」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even if I told them, there probably won&#8217;t be any meaning. It&#8217;s only a name after all,&#8221; Falma thought. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please take your time!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest returned, leaving the replica behind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(He said it was found from the stratum of three thousand years ago…… why in the world?) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen fiddled with the replica, looking at it closely then looking at it at a distance, she even closed one of her eyes as she stared at the picture added to the identification card, in other words, she stared at Falma&#8217;s appearance in his previous life. Falma felt his heart beating loudly, wondering what they would say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Black hair huh, how rare. Is he from the divine race?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It might be the picture of a god」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What an amazing thing we have seen,&#8221; Lotte placed her hands to her mouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Un. I wonder why, it somewhat feels familiar……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That is very rude towards God you know, Eleanore-sama!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s probably just me」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma&#8217;s heart skipped a beat because of Ellen&#8217;s great intuition, but he let out a sigh because they didn&#8217;t find out. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(My staff ID, why is it here? It&#8217;s the only thing that connects Earth and this world) </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No matter what, I need to see the real one,&#8221; Falma thought. </span></p>
