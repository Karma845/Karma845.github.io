<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Thermae and Incomplete Flame God&#8217;s Insignia </h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.1</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That thing called mimeograph that you had invented, have you presented it to Her Majesty?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a certain morning. Falma was pointed out by Bruno at home and remembered a terrible mistake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Even failure histories, repeats itself……huh) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma was completely unable to come up with that idea. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I have forgotten. I will quickly present it to Her Majesty」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s alright to invent things, but you must not push yourself having too much work」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno worried about Falma while wearing his coat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(No, Father also gives me jobs though. For example, becoming a university professor) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t really want to hear that from you&#8221;, Falma really felt like rebutting. And there, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Father, I want to inquire about something」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a good opportunity too&#8221;, Falma thought and asked. He is unable to ask about it during meal times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Why did you pushed me to become a university professor?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ahh……about that, it was not like I supported you, the other professors could not hold themselves with you working at a pharmacy. Just as you have thought, I also think that it is too early」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno looked away and spoke with turbid words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, making a child a professor was preposterous and ridiculous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope they had made me one after my coming of age&#8221;, Falma thought. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「However, I am very concerned about how long you would keep that state」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno&#8217;s answer was as such. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(That&#8217;s what he means, huh……the Head Priest also said it) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Falma does not know how long he would be in this world, having the memories of his past life. Just like the Head Priest have said,「it is only but a moment that the gods and their incarnations appear in this world」and together with the precedents that are investigated, not only Bruno, but the other professors are worried as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma was unable to reply. It was because he was not confident to give an answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe, his ego might even disappear in the next day. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If, time is finite, I wish that you would concentrate on a huge job」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes time to examine patients one by one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno&#8217;s rational way of thinking is really showing itself, because he thought it would be better if Falma devoted that time to research, invent numerous new medicines into the world, complete the pharmaceutical school&#8217;s system, and leave as many excellent successors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was not impersonal or whatever, it was a very scholar-like idea. It would seem to be impersonal as the father or Falma, but he must still do so for the sake of public good. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Right now, rather than saving thousands of people living as far as your eyes could reach, I wish that you would leave a feat that would remain even if the age exceeds itself. That would result in saving more people, rather than saving the people in front of you. At least, that&#8217;s what I think」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「……exceed the age, and remain……?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Bruno has said was reasonable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I understand that, Father, I understand it very well. That thought……is also something that put me in a dilemma in my previous life) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma&#8217;s father is saying that he wants Falma to live just like how he did in his previous life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not an exaggeration that Falma, in his previous life, had invented numerous new medicines to save thousands and millions of lives in the future, more than the patients that he would meet in his whole life. As a result, he slept and woke up in a laboratory, looked face to face with data, and was unable to look at patients. And Falma does not think that that is a wrong way to live. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was just, he was wrong for dying from overwork. Falma felt very frustrated thinking that he would have been able to work for the sake of more people if he had only taken care of his body a little more. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(But……this time, I don&#8217;t want to end with just that) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was something he had decided since he came to this world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I, want to save patients with my own hands」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(This time, I want to live together with patients, firmly looking after them even if it&#8217;s through life or death) </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Bruno stared at Falma&#8217;s eyes and slowly nodded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s your life. You can do what you want with it. I am really sorry for placing huge burdens on you, although you are still small」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma&#8217;s Father bowed his head. And, continued with a &#8220;but&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If you have medicines that you want to test the result, I want you to use this body of mine」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma&#8217;s father did not only pushed responsibilities and work onto Falma. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I shall gladly take your medicine.&#8221; Falma looked at the back of his father who said that, seeing him not turning around and get into the carriage with Simon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He would also, visit patients everyday, while being the president of the university. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma was left in the entrance, thinking about his memories of his previous life and Bruno&#8217;s thoughts, with many emotions coming up to his chest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And suddenly, a small, hurried footsteps could be heard from behind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Elder brother!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma&#8217;s little sister Blanche called out to him from behind. When he turned around, she was making the funnies face she could make unlike what Falma expected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Pu! Ahhahaha」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma did not expect that she would be making such a face and laughed naturally. If their mother saw her, she would definitely scold her「Oh, how ill-mannered! Stop that!」. Seeing Falma laughing loudly, she happily laughed with him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thinking about difficult things with Father, it&#8217;s not good. Your head would split into two. If it splits into two, it&#8217;s not good, you know」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well, that&#8217;s true」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma felt refreshed and carried Blanche into an embrace. Blanche reached out her hand and forcefully pinched the corner of Falma&#8217;s lips with her thumb and pointing finger. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Like that, Elder brother. Smile?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Un, thank you, Blanche」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanche rubbed her cheeks to Falma&#8217;s and hugged him back tightly while being embraced. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.2</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, in the San Flueve Palace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress, Elizabeth the Second was inspecting the inventions that were respectfully presented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of Falma who brought a mimeograph with the Lotte-designed superbly beautiful, multi-colored illustration card that became more and more polished, to present to the Empress. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please forgive me for the late offering」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma apologized while sweating beads. He would always forget to present them to the Empress when he was busy, so he&#8217;s even thinking of hiring someone who would specialize on presenting his inventions. However, the Empress would probably not be convinced if Falma did not personally explain them. That is what an Empress is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress looked at the illustration cards one next to the other, and kept silent for a while. 「Bring them to me first hand」was what Falma was told to do so, so he was worried that he would be punished severely because he was late to present them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Fumu, what an excellent workmanship and invention. Or rather, who is this artist named Charlotte. I have never heard of her. Has she yet to come out of the painting circles」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only the mimeograph, but the Empress took interest on Lotte, the illustrator, as well. It must be Lotte&#8217;s original style, the beautiful five-set illustrations were drawn in an Art Nouveau and Art Deco style, and the Empress really liked them. Falma also thinks that they were excellently made. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He asked Lotte to do her best in making the illustrations as not to impair the Empress&#8217;s mood. Lotte had made them while humming and happily, but her talents have started to show. When Falma praised her「Lotte was an art genius huh!」, she got curious saying「I, am I a genius!」. It was an innocent Lotte. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「They were made by a personnel of our Pharmacy in nothing but a side hobby. She is not an artist」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Umu, they look more interesting the more I looked at them. Good, I like them. Is that one a commoner」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ha!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I do not mind even if it&#8217;s a commoner, bring her to me soon. Understood?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Empress, she wants Lotte to become a court painter, and design the stained glass and other glass crafts in the palace. Emperors obtain what they want, no matter if it&#8217;s an object or a person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Uwaa, Lotte&#8217;s going to have it difficult!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress&#8217;s artistic sense of beauty and fashionable sense was excellent, being about to find value in design painting, during the time when realistic oil painting is at its height. Falma could feel the presence that from now on, Art Nouveau that the Empress appreciated would be prevalent in San Flueve&#8217;s imperial capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(It&#8217;s the greatest event in Lotte&#8217;s life, or rather, it&#8217;s an important event in the history of art……) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte has studied manners since she was young in the Archduke&#8217;s mansion, so Falma believes that she would not make a blunder even in front of the Empress, but she might pass out when Falma tells her that she would be the Empress&#8217;s personal artist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I shall order to make a stained glass with this image. I wonder what reward would that one ask for」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like the Empress is going to make a glass artist to make a stained glass out of the illustration that she liked for starters. It is the quick-tempered Empress, so she would probably order to make them tomorrow.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Lotte&#8217;s reward, huh……Lotte is very easy to tell right) </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I think that sweet treats would be good」 </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Falma doesn&#8217;t ask her in person, it should be for sure. If Lotte eats the high-class treats that the Empress and the Prince eats, chocolates, she would already be in heaven. And, she would be completely addicted to them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Umu, well then, I shall order the head chef to make high-class treats. And also, good news」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like the Empress remembered something after speaking about rewards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Saying that?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「One of the thermaes that you wished as a reward has been completed」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she had said Falma wished for them, Falma did not directly ask for them. He only said that he wants to go to the hot springs, but Noah reported that. Noah became a semi-knight, and not longer a small page, but even so, he is still running errands as the Empress&#8217;s aide. He probably knows that that is the shortcut for promotion. And even now, he is nonchalantly attending this offering ceremony. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「T-This quickly……as expected of Her Majesty」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress ordered the construction of five thermaes in the imperial capital but it looks like one of them was already completed. Not even a month has yet to pass. It was told that it was built through the night without sparing the lights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(This is probably, what an emperor is huh) </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Indeed, indeed」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahhahahaha&#8221;, the Empress laughed heartily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It is natural to hurry the reward for the Empire&#8217;s meritorious person」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The muscle-head Empress said such manly words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I wanted you to be the first one to see the bath after all!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress looked down towards Falma pompously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ah! Your Majesty, that, it&#8217;s as if you&#8217;re spiting me for being late to present……!) </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That is the case. We shall visit the bath now」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courtiers also followed the Empress who had stood up from her throne. It was said that the bath was reserved for her for the whole day today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「R-Right now?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was said that the bath was prepared quickly to make Falma surprised since he would come to the palace for the offering ceremony. The bath itself has yet to be opened for service, but of course, the Empress would be the first one to enter it. The nobles and commoners would be after that. By the way, just like Lotte had requested, both the commoners and nobles are able to enter it although the bath itself is separated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a reason such as it was a long time since the Empress left the palace, a grand parade will be held leading to the thermae. It would be done with a grandiose carriage pulled by ten white horses and protected by the cavalry. The front gate of the palace opened and the Empress emerges before the people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Falma, just like the Empress, he is riding in the same specialized imperial carriage pulled by white horses. The Empress&#8217;s carriage drew the passionate gaze of the people. The weather is good as well so the roof of the carriage was taken off and one could see what&#8217;s inside. It looks like there was some commotion, seeing that the person beside Her Majesty is the different world pharmacy&#8217;s young owner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Your Majesty! Your Majesty!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The passionate &#8220;Your Majesty&#8221; call was deafening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ahh, why did this happen……) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma had a flushed face and shrunk at the Empress&#8217;s side, but the Empress did not keep it in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Now there, the commoners are looking. Get a hold of yourself」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Y-Yes」 </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While receiving the gaze and applause of the crowd, the carriage finally arrived at the Thermes de Cité Impériale (Thermae of the Imperial Capital). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Wow, amazing! How splendid!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma attempted to show a huge reaction as much as he could. After all, the Empress brought Falma to the thermae to see his reaction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Umu, indeed」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly made public bath was created by refurbishing the mansion of a noble, so it has a considerable site area. Its exterior looks just like a palace. And it was said that that structure is a huge entertainment facility, directly ordered by the Empress. The thermae&#8217;s staff personnel were waiting for the Empress&#8217;s arrival outside. With just that, reflects the strength of the Empress&#8217;s authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma got off the carriage with the Empress, and after passing through the elegant entrance hall where expensive glass was used unsparingly, the entrance of the changing room could be seen. There are two entrances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uhm, by the way, I would like to ask……the bath, is it separated for males and females?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Umu, it is separated. It will be a matter of grave significance if the public morals become disordered」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Thank goodness……that&#8217;s why, there are four separate baths for nobles and commoners of the different gender) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Falma was about to go towards the men&#8217;s bath with a gentleman&#8217;s engraving, the Empress stopped him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You shall enter the private bath for the royal family together with me. Let us enter the female bath」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「W-Why, Your Majesty?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma asked with a cracking voice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I went out on the way to make it built, wouldn&#8217;t it be a waste to enter separately?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「E-Entering the same bath with Her Majesty……I dare not……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, there are only two guests in this thermae. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress and Falma. It would seem that the Empress just really wishes to see Falma&#8217;s reaction of surprise and admiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hahaha, you are still 11, no need to talk about men and women yet. How could you speak so precociously」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After grabbing Falma&#8217;s arm strongly, the Empress forcefully dragged him towards the entrance of the women&#8217;s bath. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wide space was used for the changing room, and could accommodate hundreds of people. There are also resting areas and massage rooms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Over here, let&#8217;s go」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Empress undressed without hesitation, she walked towards the bath with huge strides. Seeing the plump, well-shaped buttocks in front of him, Falma looked away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(What the heck is this, is this Her Majesty&#8217;s unconscious service) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several maids wearing clothes followed her. Falma would only be troubled if he was left alone in the changing room, so he went towards the bath in a hurry while hiding his front with a towel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large bath was wonderful. Within the spacious dome, there is water flowing directly into the bath, and as spacious as a 25-meter pool, and there are also several circular and rectangular baths. Each of them has differences in temperature, differences in designs, some have fountains, and some has bathing agents. The interior look extravagant as well, with statues made out of marble in the middle of the large bath, and ornamental plants and other decorations were arranged very well. The tall, white pillars would make one reminisce of Rome. The Empress went towards the glass-enclosed private bathhouse that is in the middle of the courtyard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entering the bath, crimson petals of rose were floating unsparingly above the water. The smell of rose permeated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Wow〜……as expected」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Falma losing his words to the magnificent view, the Empress placed her hands on her waist in satisfaction, and turned around. She is completely unguarded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ahh! Your Majesty! If you turned around so suddenly, I-I&#8217;d be able to see them!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Falma was about to cover his face, the two maids beside the Empress covered her front with a silk cloth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Thank you, dear maids! Good job) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a close shot. The 25-year-old Empress&#8217;s skin looks very youthful, her waist shows a beautiful curve, and her chest was abundant as well (although only its silhouette could be seen through the silk), making her a possessor of a perfect style. The Empress does not have a place she is embarrassed with, so she does not hide them sneakily like the common people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the maids are the ones who hide the Empress&#8217;s sacred body so that it would not be seen by anyone&#8217;s eyes. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.3</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After washing their body with bath water, they soaked themselves in the rose bath. The sound of hot water reverberates throughout the room. Steam rises and the maids slowly fanned the two. That, in short, being alone in the bath together with the Empress of a Great Empire. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「How is it? Do you like it? I made this for your relaxation, you should rest and relax」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(The emperor&#8217;s authority, it&#8217;s too awesome……) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with thoughtlessly saying that he wants to go to the hot springs, and reaching this as a result, Falma felt very awed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uhm, thank you very much」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Umu. If you are happy, then I am satisfied」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress narrowed her ruby-colored eyes and showed a pleasant smile. Her skin that was colored by the rose petals would make anyone feel the sex appeal of an adult woman. The way she casually scooped up her silver hair with a gold mesh was enough to describe as a peerless beauty even without her makeup. Undressing the clothes of an emperor, what existed there was one lovely woman. They say that the Empress is a widow. According to Ellen, just soon after marrying her husband (the prince consort), he died of an epidemic on the battlefield. Since then, with her thin(?) arms, she excellently upheld the Empire. &#8220;She is courageous and admirable too&#8221;, Falma thought. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absently soaking with the Empress in his side, Falma forgot the time and enjoyed the scenery of the garden outside the bathhouse, the small birds fly down and play, but suddenly, the Empress was staring at Falma&#8217;s upper arm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, the Empress, she closed the distance between them, and stared into it. Falma got careless. The scars in his arms must not be seen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The mystery is resolved, it was as such, huh」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress&#8217;s eyes widened. And her gaze, it caught the color of envy. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Isn&#8217;t that a holy insignia」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Oh no……!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing that he could do even if he hides it now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It is the complete Medicine God&#8217;s insignia」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress showed a deep nod as if she assured herself that it was so. Falma&#8217;s scar, it is releasing nothing but a faint light in the darkness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Um, is this, is it &#8220;that&#8221; after all?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma understood that the Empress knows about the holy insignia so he gave up and asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is the Empire&#8217;s strongest divine arts user, she should see through it even if he starts hiding it now. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You should look at this」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress raised her right leg from the bath. In the inner part of her calves, there was a scar that seemed like a blazing flame. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh?! Is that a holy insignia?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Someone who possesses the holy insignia, they exist other than me!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma felt some sense of affinity with the Empress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s the Flame God&#8217;s holy insignia……if it was complete, that is. It lacks about 1/4 of it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress used her thin finger to point at her calves that drew a lean curve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as she said, it felt like something is missing when one would look at the scar on her leg as the Flame God&#8217;s emblem. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「When I was ten, it became like this when I got a burn」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, she was found by the Temple, and started to walk on the path of an emperor. Before her strength, there was no one who blocked her way, she possessed the title of the strongest as much as she wanted, exceeded the famous divine arts users, and received the emperor&#8217;s crown. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It was also when I was 10, it became like this after I was hit by lightning」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a strange match between Falma and her situation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It is told that one would possess strong divine powers, even if only a part of the holy insignia were inscribed to their body」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of that, she was able to become the Empress. Whether she liked it or not. As a chosen one. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And if the holy insignia is complete, it is told that God shall dwell. When I was still a little girl, that made me vexed. I thought of how great it would have been if I&#8217;ve had a complete insignia」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma silently listened to her words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「However, right now, I think that it is good that it&#8217;s incomplete. I am afraid that, if the insignia was complete, my consciousness might have disappeared」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s why&#8221;, said the Empress while looking at Falma with a gaze that could mean pity in some way. Falma received her words and stared back right at her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Right now, there are two of the Medicine God&#8217;s insignia in your body, yet, both of them are complete. The great Medicine God might have dwelled on you, you must have received unparalleled strength and wisdom, but」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress&#8217;s finger gently traced the insignias in Falma&#8217;s arms. As if to console the boy, Falma&#8217;s body who has lost its shadows and ceased to be that of a human. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I wonder, you who have become the Medicine God, I wonder, if Falma de Médicis&#8217; heart, remains as it was before」 </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Empress threw out a simple but cruel question, she said &#8220;I am starting to get dizzy from the bath, I shall leave first&#8221;, and left the bath. In the bathroom where the Empress has left, Falma let his body soak in that light that passes through the glass, and has the same shine as of that in Earth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had fallen into an illusion, that someday, his body would become transparent and turn into light, disintegrating everything together with his ego and just disappear. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Falma did not think of anything and tried all of the baths. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He remembered Blanche&#8217;s words, &#8220;it&#8217;s not good to think about difficult things&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each and every bath felt good. He felt as if his body relaxed, and his body that was continuously working was finally refreshed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Fuu〜……it was a great bath. I should get out of the bath I guess」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Falma was about to leave the bath, there was some noise coming from the dressing room. And soon after, tens of guest women entered the large bath one next to the other. He could also hear the first-class apothecaries from the different world pharmacy, and Ellen and Lotte&#8217;s voices as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「He?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The towel that Falma placed on his head fell off. His became red. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Kyaa〜, Eleanore-sama, your breasts are huge after all〜!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte&#8217;s excited voice echoed throughout the bath. Although they are hiding their fronts with a cloth, Falma could see their body lines clearly even from far away. Falma was just at a position where they can&#8217;t see him, being hidden by decorative plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Arara〜, Lotte-chan&#8217;s are getting bigger too aren&#8217;t they?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Kyaa〜! Please stop〜〜! It&#8217;s ticklish〜!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ara〜, Lotte-chan&#8217;s are pink?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I-I&#8217;m curious! What&#8217;s pink?! I-Is it her hair? It&#8217;s her hair, right……?) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma got curious, and told himself &#8220;peeking is a crime, peeking is a crime&#8221;, but his blood pressure had a gradual increase due to nervousness and excitement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh really〜, Her Majesty&#8217;s so generous〜. To think that we would get specially invited before it opened」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what Falma heard from them, he found out that they were invited by the Empress to reward the pharmacy&#8217;s staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-sama was invited too right〜? I did not see him in the entrance though」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「They said that he entered first with Her Majesty. He should be taking his time in the men&#8217;s bath」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are female apothecaries from the dispensing pharmacy guild, so there should be ones invited to the men&#8217;s bath. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I mean, this isn&#8217;t the time to for this. Oh no!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma was left by himself inside the women&#8217;s bath. And the dressing room is blocked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Your Majesty, why did you leave me alone and invited guests in when I haven&#8217;t got out! Is it on purpose?!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he was to encounter them head to head, he would probably get lynched by the female guests.  No, that might not happen, but it is unknown what would happen. &#8220;What should I do?&#8221;, Falma thought while he hid himself using the decorations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even so, he was unable to leave from the dressing room, lost the place to stay in, so he could only run into the Empress&#8217;s private bathroom without getting noticed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He jumped into the bath, showed only his face from the water surface, and camouflaged his existence using the rose petals. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I could only wait here……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And speaking of Falma&#8217;s fate being unable to get out of the bath…… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was later on found by a cleaner completely passed out and floating in the rose bath. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More on that, in the Thermae of the Imperial Capital that was officially opened. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rumors say that when one soaked themselves in the women&#8217;s bath, back pain, stiff shoulders, and other diseases would be cured. </span></p>
