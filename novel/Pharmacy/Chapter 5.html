<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Curry and Lassi and Intestinal Flora </h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>5.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a fine autumn day, an autumn party（Fête d&#8217;automne）event organized by the General Headquarters of the Different World Pharmacy is held in the sandbank of the river owned by the de Médicis Family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This event is a secret outdoor event where the staff of the pharmacy and regular customers are invited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Head Priest and other priests have mixed in as well, taking with them regular tickets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this party, a dish that is yet to be known is served to the guests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s curry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma was finally able to compound an edible curry recipe from the ones he mixed in his laboratory in the fourth floor of the pharmacy, so he asked the chefs of the House of de Médicis to make and serve it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I didn&#8217;t think that a mere curry party would become this grand) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless normal dishes are also served in open tables in consideration of those who would not like the taste of curry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event turned out to be a grand and elegant one, with an orchestra playing outdoor music. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It tasted very good」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen who is wearing a sky blue dress just like ladies of her age does is tasting the curry where expensive spices are used. She is elegantly eating her curry using a knife and a fork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Be careful not to spoil your dress」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Kyaaー! It got on meー!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma&#8217;s warning was in vain. It looks like she dirtied her dress so quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「This curry&#8217;s yellow color, it can be taken off right?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It should get off after washing it and drying it under the sun. The component that makes it yellow will be decomposed when exposed to sunlight」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking something like this might happen, Falma came to this venue dressed up in clothes with a black base color. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is that so? Thank goodness」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eating outside also makes you feel refreshed on this fine day」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like it was a new feeling for the people of this world who does not have a culture of eating outside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Can you tell us the recipe?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admiral John who came tightly dressed up in his uniform, not his usual one-shirt-look, showed the desire to use curry for seafarer&#8217;s meals. Falma gave him the document that has the details he copied using the mimeograph. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Spices lasts very long, so I think that it&#8217;s suitable for seafarer&#8217;s meals as well」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma looked forward to the day there would be seafood curry. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-sama〜, what a wonderful dish〜!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte was busy conquering all the flavors of the curry while following her table manners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The curries prepared are Keema Curry (curry with minced chicken meat), Aloo Palak (curry with spinach and potato), European Curry (curry with soup stock taken from meat, vegetables, and herbs, with added milk), and White Curry. Falma thought that people would choose their likes and dislikes, but thankfully, it just fit their tastes. She elegantly wiped his mouth that is covered with curry using her napkin. And Lotte also had curry stains on her white apron skirt. Lotte looked very satisfied. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s the best it&#8217;s eaten with this bread. What is this bread called? Ehehe〜, I can eat a whole lot of them〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s called Nan」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma ate his curry with his nan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Nani?」(What?) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen asked back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The thick ones are called nan which is made with refined wheat, the thin ones are called chapati made with whole grains」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ahh〜, I can&#8217;t stop eating curry〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma continued to eat his meal at a slow pace as he chats with Ellen and the pharmacy&#8217;s regular customers. It was a satisfying meal, however…… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ahh……I could only wish that there&#8217;s rice……) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma summoned an urge to eat extra-sized curry rice meal that would make his stomach swell, but it would be indecent in this world&#8217;s manners, and in the first place, there&#8217;s no rice in this world. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「This, what spices are used on it? I want to make this too after going home」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this world, spices are still expensive and people would feel the pain using a lot of them, so the recipe of the curry is one that only uses the least amount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「In this recipe, you would chop the onions and vegetables and stir-fry, and boil it together along with the meat, using turmeric, coriander, red pepper and cayenne pepper, cumin, ginger and garlic」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If more spices are used, the deepness of the taste would naturally be better, but Falma is not that knowledgeable in mixing spices, and he could not use the spices to their bests, so he could only make the recipe after many failures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spiciness of curry depends is determined by the amount of red pepper, cayenne pepper, and other peppers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By adjusting their amounts, one could make the curry that is for kids, adults, sweet ones and very hot ones. Very hot and spicy curry strongly stimulates the stomach, so Falma didn&#8217;t serve it this time. He couldn&#8217;t organize a party with the Different World Pharmacy&#8217;s name then have people with upset stomachs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Curry, it looks very healthy」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte fanned her face with her hand. &#8220;Come to think of it, my body is getting warm&#8221;, Ellen nodded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It has a side that is good for health」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true that curcumin, which is a pigment contained in turmeric, has a strong antioxidant effect and it is supposed to have an inhibitory effect on cancer and research is underway. However, one must be careful on common advertisements claiming &#8220;these ingredients is good for this disease&#8221;. Falma does not plan on advertising curry as a healthy food at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating too much is not good and he had to take personal health conditions into consideration. There are also aspects that the burden on the gastrointestinal tract is great if too many spices are taken in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What&#8217;s with that cautiousness?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen let out a wry laugh to Falma&#8217;s adult-minded, iridescent choice of words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ahh, but, your body would get warm and there is an appetite-stimulating effect」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「This, how long would it last after cooking? Can you eat it after a few days?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please eat it on the day it&#8217;s cooked」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is generally thought that curry which is prepared and left to sleep overnight is delicious, but there is also cases where the curry which people left overnight many grow bacteria called Welsh fungus and become the cause of food poisoning, even if it&#8217;s heated up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no problem keeping it on the refrigerator and eat it the next day, but it would be better people in this world to refrain doing that. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>5.2</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finishing eating, the staff of the pharmacy and its regular customers continued to chat, and some are playing a racquet sports called jeu de paume which is a precursor to tennis. The event completely turned into a recreation party, making Falma and the guests enjoy most of their time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-kun, would you like to dance? I really love dancing so I&#8217;d really like to dance right now」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of light music played by the orchestra could be heard. Ellen invited Falma for a dance. The baroque dance of nobles is about to start. Falma had received education about dances for salons as a noble&#8217;s etiquette. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Alright. Ellen likes dances huh」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Was I able to dance again? I just hope I won&#8217;t shame her) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although worried, Falma joined the dance with Ellen. Is it the boy Falma&#8217;s body memory? Falma was able to remember the steps and movements that was needed. Ellen danced in baroque style dressed up beautifully with elegance, she would unconsciously meet with Falma&#8217;s eyes and her movements that are more beautiful and sophisticated than ever looked very attractive. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Looking at Ellen when she&#8217;s like this, she really seems mature. She&#8217;s becoming even more beautiful recently) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Falma who have thought of her as a younger girl before thought that it might be better to look at Ellen as a woman. Their dance ended with Falma not noticing the kind of feeling he started to have towards Ellen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte who could not participate in the baroque dance with her identity as a servant welcomed the two of them with an applause albeit being envious. She cheered on them sincerely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Fuwa〜, you two were so good〜! Seeing you like that, you are really great nobles after all〜, you were so beautiful〜!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well yeah, we&#8217;re nobles after all. I&#8217;ve been compelled to do things like this ever since I&#8217;m young」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen smiled at Lotte&#8217;s naturally airheaded comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hm? Where&#8217;s Blanche?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at that time, Blanche sat on the bench and was stooping. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What&#8217;s the matter, Blanche-sama」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「My tummy hurts〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving the comfort room, she returned to the bench and, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Brother〜, lend me your lap〜!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked Falma to let her lie on his lap. Blanche laid down her body in a く position. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「My lady, are you alright? My lady&#8217;s tummy is in bad!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte looked after her spiritedly, bringing her drinks and a cloth cover. Even after she was chosen as a court painter, Lotte continued to serve the members of the House of de Médicis respectfully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Curry probably wasn&#8217;t good for you. I&#8217;m so sorry」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanche has the constitution of being prone to diarrhea in the first place, so she was served curry that has the least amount of spices mixed in, but even so, it might&#8217;ve been still too stimulating for the child, Falma thought. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It might be for the best if Blanche won&#8217;t eating curry anymore」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Curry, it was delicious, but, I can&#8217;t eat it anymore?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanche regretfully pouted her lips and bit her pointing finger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Let&#8217;s not」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No, it&#8217;s not curry&#8217;s fault, my tummy already hurts before! It&#8217;s true!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanche resisted, asserting that it would be bad if she can&#8217;t eat curry anymore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma looked at her with his Diagnosis Eye. She did not have a major disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not ulcerative colitis or Crohn&#8217;s disease and other diseases and infections. It was not lactose intolerance either. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Falma was doing that, Blanche who was lying down with his lap as a pillow feel asleep, so he couldn&#8217;t move from there anymore. Beside the bench, Lotte and Falma were still looking at her worriedly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Poor thing, she should get some rest」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I agree. I&#8217;ll accompany her here.」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma petted Blanche&#8217;s hair and touched her cheek. Blanche who was sleeping under the sun was a very beautiful girl. For Falma, she is her precious blood sister. He wished that she would get better soon. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Her gut flora might be imbalanced」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What&#8217;s gut flora? Are you talking about the field of flowers (fleurs)?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flora is defined as the plants of a particular region or period in English. English doesn&#8217;t exist in this world, so Ellen could not possibly know that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「There is something like a field of flowers for bacteria in the intestines」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just exactly, in the sandbank of the river where the party is held, spread a field of flowers. It was a beautiful view of white and yellow flowers making many clusters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You see, looking at the field of flowers, the view is always changing right? Sometimes there would be more white flowers and sometimes there would be yellow flowers, or sometimes there would be more weed」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma pointed at the cluster of white flowers and the cluster of yellow flowers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s not always at the same state」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen was convinced. Without taking care of them in their natural state, the plants would start competing for survival. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Similar to that, there are many bacteria in the intestine, constantly increasing and decreasing. Good bacteria and bad bacteria would expand or reduce their habitat, just like this field of flowers. The state of bacteria in the gut flora is quite different from person to person, and it is not always constant either. And right now, I think that Blanche&#8217;s state is not good」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Speaking of that, there&#8217;s no way that there are so many bacteria in your intestine. There&#8217;s just a few right?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re exaggerating&#8221;, Ellen laughed. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>5.3</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「There&#8217;s no way that there are so many bacteria in your intestine. There&#8217;s just a few right?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re exaggerating&#8221;, Ellen laughed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Although this isn&#8217;t a pleasant topic, don&#8217;t you think that feces are just waste from food?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By the way&#8221;, Falma asked Ellen. He also thought it should be alright talking about it now after everyone has finished eating, although it was still a bad topic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Of course」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen agreed affirmatively, and Lotte also didn&#8217;t doubt it, thinking &#8220;All that comes out is food right? After all, all that we eat is food!&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well, you&#8217;re wrong」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma shook his head and raised his finger one by one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If the amount of the components included in feces excluding moisture are arranged in descending order, number 1 would be the cells of the mucous membrane of the intestine, number 2 would be the intestinal bacteria, and number 3 would be the waste from food」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The percentage of food, isn&#8217;t it too little?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen seemed as if she received a shock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The food eaten has about 4-5% percentage」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s all?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total amount of intestinal bacteria or gut flora of an adult human would be 1-1.5kg. Falma taught Ellen and Lotte what the gut flora is. Lotte subconsciously looked towards her stomach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It was that important, huh. Ha〜, intestinal bacteria, I see them now in a new light. One must increase their good bacteria huh. I was looking at on intestinal environment too lightly」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen pats her stomach as if to show gratitude to her gut flora. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「One must remove the weeds and apply fertilizer to see beautiful flowers. It&#8217;s the same with your gut」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I agree!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221;, Lotte cheerfully raised her hand in agreement. Ellen also followed Lotte and planned to work on improving her intestinal environment immediately starting today. But although Ellen was full of spirits, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And then? How can you increase the good bacteria?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good bacteria are made up of lactic acid bacteria and lactobacilli. They take effort on increasing these bacteria&#8217;s influence on Blanche&#8217;s intestine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「For example, if the flower field in front of you was a clear field, the number of the flowers you grew first will increase right?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s true. Maybe it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s nothing else to disturb it, so it might cover the entire field」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the day of a baby&#8217;s birth, it takes in good bacteria from its mother&#8217;s normal bacterial flora. After that, it would gradually take in other bacteria, start to multiply in the intestine, creating its gut flora. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「However, it&#8217;s difficult to plant flowers when it&#8217;s already this crowded」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「U〜n, it will lose to the other plants. What must be done?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The human body that&#8217;s entangled by complicated factors is really complicated〜&#8221;, Ellen felt a headache. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s why, you cannot just eat food that contains lactobacillus」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one asked what food has lactobacillus, it would be fermented products such as yogurt and cheese. If such food is normally eaten, it would already have died when it reaches the intestine due to gastric acid. Even a special lactic acid bacterium that is said to reach the intestine alive may only reach the intestine, but it hardly gets colonized. If one stopped eating them, it would turn into feces (dead bacteria), and be excreted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state where gut flora has already been established, even if one would ingest good bacteria, it can be said that it is difficult to create a new space where it could be colonized. However, the lactobacillus itself has the function of enhancing immunity and eliminating bad bacteria even if they do not multiply alive. That&#8217;s why there is a decent amount of reason to eat lactobacillus. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If so, maybe one should only make a fertilizer that only grows what they want to grow. But, does a fertilizer like that exist?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen flashed that thought in her mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Correct. Good idea」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Ellen is talking about is a new idea called prebiotics. One only need to take good bacteria from the outside, and take those that would help multiply the good bacteria that is already inside the gut flora. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oligosaccharides and dietary fiber are such prebiotic foods. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;ll think of a menu that Blanch would like」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there, what Falma thought of was lassi. It can easily be made by mixing yogurt, milk, lemon, and honey. Honey contains oligosaccharides, and yogurt contains lactobacillus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when he served that to Blanche together with grapes that contain oligosaccharides during dinner, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No〜, I hate milk」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanche pouted and refused. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Why do you hate it?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I hate its taste, I just can&#8217;t drink it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like she does not like its taste. She probably doesn&#8217;t like it very much; she was trying to get distance from it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I thought you&#8217;d say that, so I added honey. You love honey right?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma convinced Blanche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Un……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanche started to drink the lassi albeit looking very reluctant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s sweet and delicious! It&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s not milk!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as if a special, sweets-like drink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It looks like her hate of milk was overcome in an instant. She&#8217;s still too naive&#8221;, Falma thought. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, the lassi was also served to Lotte and the others in the pharmacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s great eating it with curry huh! It lessens the spiciness」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, I forgot about that combination! You would see it a lot at curry stores」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just like that, lassi is now served together with curry during meal times. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For what happened to Blanche after that, it was said that she stopped having bad stomach after some time, and is now eating curry with lassi on the other hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, curry became a classic menu of the de Médicis Family. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother Beatrice and the father Bruno loved the menu very much that they would ask for seconds, although they usually do not. </span></p>
