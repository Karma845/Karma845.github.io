<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; Remission of Induction Therapy (4 - 6)</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>13.1</strong></p>

<p>Palle was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Falma started treatment immediately with an induction treatment to start reducing the leukemia cells.<br></p>



<p>He started drinking ATRA from day one after the diagnosis, to begin differentiation induction that converts leukemia cells into normal white blood cells.<br></p>



<p>From the second day, Idarubicin (anticancer drug) was administered as an aid to ATRA.<br></p>



<p>Two days after the ATRA and idarubicin combination therapy is the fourth day of the therapy.<br></p>



<p>Palle, who had successfully reduced the number of leukemia cells, had serious side effects.<br></p>



<p>Whilst ATRA was maturing leukemia cells into white blood cells, these rapidly growing white blood cells were giving off inflammatory substances into the bloodstream, destroying Palle&#8217;s lungs, causing pulmonary hemorrhage and dyspnea.</p>



<p>ATRA&#8217;s side effects are the occurrence of retinoic acid syndrome (differentiation syndrome), which is said to occur in approximately 20% of patients.<br></p>



<p>As bleeding occurred in Palle’s lungs, Falma began high-dose (pulse therapy) of methylprednisolone (a type of steroid).<br></p>



<p>Even if he survives, the five-year survival rate of patients who have had a pulmonary hemorrhage, that is, the survival rate five years after the start of treatment is about 30%.<br></p>



<p>It can be understood that the situation is dangerous in the short term and in the long term.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Is there anything else I can do, I am here!&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma felt so useless that he could only use the medicine.<br></p>



<p>Falma creates oxygen with his left hand and supplies oxygen to Palle. It&#8217;s possible to supply oxygen for a few days without interruption if it is sustained by invincible divine power.<br></p>



<p>In the meantime, I hope the steroids stop the bleeding.<br></p>



<p>But I do not think that Palle will recover by that alone.<br></p>



<p>“Really……”<br></p>



<p>Falma remembered while listening to Palle’s breath.<br></p>



<p>In the dimly lit room, Falma moved his right hand forward. The important thing was left in my room.<br></p>



<p>It was something I had to not let go of.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; come!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Kusurishintsue flew with force, penetrated the inner wall of the house and got sucked to Falma’s palm with a brisk sound.</p>



<p>He clasped Kusurishintsue.<br></p>



<p>(I do not want to use this unless there is no other choice &#8230;)</p>



<p>Falma recalled the unique art of the drug gods, &#8220;Immunity power and maximize the effects of drugs.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Enhancement of immunity was very effective at the time of the plague, that was an infection.<br></p>



<p>However, in the context of leukemia, if the increased immunity further activates leukocytes, the situation would continue to deteriorate.</p>



<p>Pulmonary hemorrhage will appear.<br></p>



<p>“But there is no choice”<br></p>



<p>Still, I was already hesitating to try. There is no more time to lose, and if I leave it alone Palle will be out of steam.<br></p>



<p>Falma decided to examine the effect of the arcane as a therapeutic method in advance through mimetics.</p>



<p>In the past, Falma had used mimetics to decide on the treatment but thought it could be possible to estimate the effect of the arcane.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I ask, Kusurishintsue. Tell me.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>(Tell me what will happen if I use the “First relief”)<br></p>



<p>The unspoken Kusurishintsue responded through mimetic. The reddish light turned blue.</p>



<p>The condition seems to get better.</p>



<p>After all, the power of the drug god was to prolong the life of the patient.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>The arcane works. Falma holds his cane horizontally against Palle’s body axis fearlessly and presses it against him.<br></p>



<p>I closed my eyes silently.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;The relief of the primordial &#8220;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Kusurishintsue shines, and the crest of the drug god appears on Palle&#8217;s body surface.<br></p>



<p>“U …… u”</p>



<p>TLN: What?<br></p>



<p>Palle screamed and bled. Even though Palle’s breathing became rough, it seems the bleeding had subsided.<br></p>



<p>(Right&#8230; I have secured time for treatment)<br></p>



<p>With a steroid therapy, I believe the lung hemorrhage should go away in 2-3 days.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Falma, what can I do to help. Can I enter the room?&#8221;</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>13.2</strong></p>


<p>I rang the handbell a while ago, servants came despite it being midnight. You can hear Lotte&#8217;s voice.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I want two people to help you&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Bruno has also come. As Bruno was well aware of the condition that Palle&#8217;s immune system was weak, he changed clothes and washed his hands as a countermeasure against infection.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Father, please help me as my hands are occupied.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma directs Bruno. He is supplying oxygen to Palle with his left hand, so his hand is used.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, leave it to me. What are you doing by putting your hand on Palle’s mouth?”<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I am helping by making it easier to breathe&#8221;<br></p>



<p>It may actually be better to intubate (insert a tube and secure the airway), but I hesitated because I had never done it with a human partner.</p>



<p>As for Falma with Kusurishintsue, Bruno saw his whole body emitting light.<br></p>



<p>Bruno was overwhelmed by the mysterious sight.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Prepare what I ask for&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Farma tells Bruno to prepare blood transfusions, transfusions and equipment without leaving Palle. Bruno is competent and does his best to prepare for the application of anesthesia, which Falma had prepared.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you very much. I appreciate it&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Pharma is grateful for the assistant&#8217;s presence.<br></p>



<p>By the time the rooster announced dawn, Falma, who was working nonstop, was exhausted.</p>



<p>TLN : “By the time the chicken roar…”<br></p>



<p>Thanks to that, Palle&#8217;s body condition is settling down little by little.<br></p>



<p>Falma dozes off, material creation is interrupted.</p>



<p>Then Palle&#8217;s breathing, which has run out of oxygen, is painful. He occasionally spits up blood in order to avoid his throat being clogged because of hemoptysis.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Falma&#8221;<br></p>



<p>The sound of Bruno wakes Falma up and he resumes material creation.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I was unconscious.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Because you are overdoing it &#8230; drink this&#8221;<br></p>



<p>A potion of strength recovery was prepared and presented to Falma. He has a body that is not effective for drugs but is thankful for moisturizing his throat.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy. Thank you&#8221;<br></p>



<p>(Oh….?)<br></p>



<p>After a while, my drowsiness blew away, and my energy began to recover.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;It worked &#8230;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>(Though it did not work for Ellen?)</p>



<p>To Falma, who often slept at the drugstore due to overworking, he used to have the same composition nutritional drink as Ellen. But Ellen&#8217;s did not feel more effective mentally.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;What happened&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;No, my father&#8217;s medicine works well&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Bruno&#8217;s guardian deity is a medicine god. So no wonder Pharma’s compatibility is good. Pharma turns his head.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;The preparation of medicine is in the realm of theology, the medicine of skilled people works well, however, the medicine of immature people doesn’t&#8221;<br></p>



<p>What he is saying may be true, Falma paid more attention to Bruno.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Your technique is more interesting to me. And how do you make the oxygen that you are giving to Palle?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Bruno only sees Falma with his hand on Palle&#8217;s mouth.<br></p>



<p>Bruno is concerned that it might be stuffy as it covers the mouth with hands. Bruno wanted to say, or could not hide &#8230;, Falma partially confessed.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Like father who can produce water, I can produce oxygen and other substances&#8221;</p>



<p>TLN : Since I did not read everything yet, is this correct?</p>



<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Bruno&#8217;s eyes were wide open in surprise.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I thought that was the case. That&#8217;s how you&#8217;ve created medicine so far. You don&#8217;t have to hide it.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, actually &#8230;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t seem to be doing a full-blown synthesis, I had no evidence of buying raw materials, so I thought there was something secret..”<br></p>



<p>Bruno had not pursued in detail until now but wondered how he was procuring new medicine. It seemed that he fell into a trap of Falma&#8217;s explanation.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I can only see your hand, but if you are using such advanced theology … You must have the power of the drug God.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I do not know if it is the power of the drug god, but I can do it. However I think that this method is also inefficient, so I also need industrial production of oxygen. Let&#8217;s make it possible to produce at the Mersail plant in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>13.3</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">Falma was keenly aware of the need of the oxygen cylinder. Otherwise, Pharma will have to be close to the patient as a live oxygen cylinder, and it will become infeasible if there are more than three patients.<br></p>



<p>Bruno leans forward to listen closely.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;To make oxygen, can&#8217;t you make it in the university laboratory even now?&#8221;</p>



<p>It’s impossible for Farma to be an oxygen supply for multiple days, Farma topples over.</p>



<p>There was also a sense of concern for him.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Because the oxygen that can be produced in the laboratory is in very small quantities, we need to industrially compress the air to make it into a liquid, and then fractionally distill it to take out the oxygen. It&#8217;s difficult.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>You can pack the liquid oxygen that Falma synthesized into a cylinder, but there is no such cylinder.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Air is liquid &#8230; such a foolish thing&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;If pressure is applied, the air will be liquid&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Farma briefly explains the three states of matter. Is it the nature of a scholar to explain even at such times? While looking at such a chat, I check his condition.<br></p>



<p>“Let’s get Melody to make the cylinder”<br></p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8230; Do you think Melody can do it?”<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s nothing she can&#8217;t do about metalworking.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>On the same day, Bruno made an order for Melody according to Farma’s description.</p>



<p>As Palle’s symptoms started to recede a little, I reduced the amount of anesthesia via infusion.<br></p>



<p>Once the amount of anesthesia was reduced, Palle&#8217;s consciousness returned.<br></p>



<p>“Are you conscious, Palle?”<br></p>



<p>Bruno holds Palle&#8217;s hand at the bedside.<br></p>



<p>“What happened &#8230; I suddenly cannot breathe&#8230;”<br></p>



<p>Falma’s hand was in front of Palle’s mouth. As soon as he had removed it, it became hard to breathe.<br></p>



<p>“I will apply my hand. Breathing will become easier”<br></p>



<p>Falma returns to his original position.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel bad&#8230; what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>When I confirmed the situation, Palle was connected to the drip. Farma explains what is dripping and talks about the progress so far.</p>



<p>&#8220;There was a side effect.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>“Is it a pulmonary hemorrhage &#8230;? Will I survive”<br></p>



<p>Palle heard the story and seemed horrified. According to Palle&#8217;s common sense, if you have a serious lung hemorrhage, you can not help but suffocate. Even Palle and Bruno&#8217;s hand-held medicines cannot cure it, and the treatment has not been established yet. Although the explanation that there might be severe side effects was given by Falma, it had not been believed. Palle did not think I&#8217;d befall to himself.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s thanks to Pharma, if it were not for Pharma, I wouldn’t have survived the disease.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Bruno admitted honestly. But Pharma said<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad the steroid worked&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma&#8217;s humble attitude that he does not depend on himself, but gives credit to the medicine, is admired by Palle. Bruno also agrees.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Falma, you are a great drugmaker &#8230; and a good guy&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Palle had to admit to Falma. There was nothing to be embarrassed about, so he told Falma straight.<br></p>



<p>“Let&#8217;s do our best, my brother. Now is a crucial moment”<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I will do my best.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Palle was strong. Positive patients in treatment survive, Falma believed so.</p>



<p>It was the afternoon of the next day.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;If you want, would you like to decorate Palle&#8217;s room?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Lotte dropped by to see Falma, who is still in the hospital room as Bruno&#8217;s replacement and handed over a picture in a frame to Falma. It is a landscape drawing of the riverside where a pheasant plays. It was great workmanship. It seems to have been drawn in a few days.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Wow &#8230; why this subject?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>“Yes, it is the oil of Faisan de colchide which is Pelle&#8217;s favorite river and a water mill. I used to go there alone. I think I&#8217;m nostalgic.”</p>



<p>TLN : Faisan de colchide is french for Ring-necked Pheasant<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, I think with his brother in the room, it will be decorated because it is tasteless.&#8221;</p>



<p>TLN : Help<br></p>



<p>I hope Palle likes it. Farma thanks, Lotte. Even though he/she isn’t in the hospital room, Lotte cares about Palle.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Then, here is a letter of encouragement from everyone.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>A collection of photos from servants, Beatrice and Blanche, and a photo collection of Saint Fleuve&#8217;s capital city. The cover was painted by Lotte.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good, this &#8230;&#8230; I think I&#8217;m getting better&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;What is this picture?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a painting based on Palle&#8217;s medicine god guardian deity. I hope you will be protected.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma glimpsed at the graceful girl deity pictured on the cover. To Lotte, the representation of the medicine god seems to be a beautiful girl god of the legendary street in the temple.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;The drug god has such an image?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s kind and pure, yet it&#8217;s a noble child&#8217;s goddess! Because it is the guardian of Palle, I was particular about the face!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm &#8230; yeah, I like it! I think I&#8217;m happy.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma runs away with plain comments. After all, it is Falma.</p>



<p>TLN : The second sentence is difficult</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Falma, please treat Palle&#8217;s treatment so as not to be overwhelmed physically and mentally. I know that attendants are of no help, but please tell me anything I can do.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Well then! That said, Lotte ran off. Farma feels once again that she is a good girl.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, this picture is wonderful. I feel good, and what is this elaborate black and white picture?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a photograph. It is a photograph of the city of Teito and a family.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;This is good &#8230;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>A smile appeared on Palle’s face after a long time. Lotte&#8217;s presence, which made it possible to understand that there were a large number of people who were hoping for his recovery, was just perfect as a gift.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Lotte is a mass of energy. We are all cheering, let&#8217;s do our best,&#8221;</p>



<p>TLN : Not sure<br></p>



<p>Falma laughs at Palle&#8217;s delighted face.<br></p>



<p>And the presents from Lotte and the servants delighted and encouraged Palle from time to time.</p>
