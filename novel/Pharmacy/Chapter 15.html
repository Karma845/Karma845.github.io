<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; Palle’s Recovery and Improving Medical Cooperation</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>15.1</strong></p>


<p>In a room on the second floor of the de Médicis.</p>



<p>“Hmm… I look good no matter what I do. A handsome bald man. It’s almost a crime to be this beautiful, hahaha!”</p>



<p>Palle posed in front of a mirror while wearing the blonde wig made from Blanche’s shiny and flawless hair. He was pleased with how he looked and decided to keep this new hairstyle.</p>



<p>“Big older brother, it’s the same as Blanche’s-”</p>



<p>Blanche pulled on her recently shortened hair with both hands to emphasize the similarity in color.</p>



<p>“Hahaha, of course it’s the same! It’s your hair! That’s right, hahaha!”</p>

<p>Palle mimicked Blanche and pulled on his hair, causing his wig to fly off his head.</p>



<p>“Oh, stop it! Don’t laugh at me, brother”</p>



<p>Palle looked at the hair that didn’t belong to him with a quiet expression. Falma was about to burst into laughter. Palle was also feeling cheerful today.</p>



<p>Previously, Palle was a handsome man with silver hair who gave off a cool impression. After switching into the blonde wig, he left a much sweeter impression.</p>



<p>Even after enduring the painful leukemia treatment, and after shaving his head bald in order to prepare for the hair loss, Palle was never pessimistic but instead always had a positive outlook. Falma thinks that here, he was saved by his brother.</p>



<p>“Brother, you’re always like this. You’re too brash”</p>



<p>&nbsp;I don’t want to be like him, Falma thinks.</p>



<p>“Why are you so humble? People like you aren’t popular”</p>



<p>To Falma’s annoyance, Palle was trying to convince him that women like men who are assertive.</p>



<p>“Umm- I know. Mom said that small old brother is popular”</p>



<p>“This is the first time I’m hearing about it. Tell me more”</p>



<p>Palle wanted to hear more about Falma in detail.</p>



<p>“Wh- No!”</p>



<p>Falma pretended to chase Blanche who, while giggling, ran out of the room.<br></p>



<p>“Speaking of which,&#8221; Palle suddenly said with a serious expression while wearing his wig. He asked Falma a question.</p>



<p>“Even though it’s called complete remission, there are still leukemia cells, right?”</p>



<p>“Exactly. Brother is currently in complete hematological remission. In other words, there are almost no observable cells when using a microscope. However, there’s still around 1 billion leukemia cells in your body”</p>



<p>Falma draws a graph to explain to Palle.</p>



<p>“Ngh- there’s so many!”</p>



<p>Palle couldn’t feel relieved at all. Instead, he felt a sense of panic grow within him when he thought about remission. Blanche, having overheard that there are 1 billion leukemia cells, stood there with her mouth agape.</p>



<p>“If you can’t stop thinking about it, just remember that it’s already decreased from 1 trillion”</p>



<p>“Oh.. it’s still not good enough. I can’t waste more time, what should I do next?”</p>



<p>Palle’s expression became obedient. He wanted to speed up the treatment.</p>



<p>“After no more leukemia cells can be seen using a microscope, let’s aim for 100 million leukemia cells. This is known as complete molecular remission”</p>



<p>“Well, are you going to use the same medicine?”</p>



<p>Palle nervously swallowed.</p>



<p>“Ah, I’ll use three more courses of the same medicine. Keep taking ATRA and anti-cancer drugs. If there are no recurrences in 3 years, it’s probably fine. If there are no recurrences in 5 years, it can be considered cured”</p>



<p>That way, even if the number of leukemia cells don’t go to zero, it’s said to be cured.</p>



<p>“It seems so far off. So, will we move onto the next treatment soon?”</p>



<p>If I overcome the trials and tribulations in this test from the Medicine God, surely, I’ll get something good out of it, thought Palle optimistically.</p>



<p>“Take a break, until the normal cells in your bone marrow have recovered”</p>



<p>If this were a hospital, then under the current circumstances the patient would be sent home for a while.</p>



<p>However, this is Palle’s home, so it’s only a break.<br></p>



<p>“Yay…”</p>



<p>Even under these normal circumstances, Palle was much more cheerful and so his expression was even brighter.</p>



<p>“Yay, brother! Higher!”</p>



<p>Palle lifted Blanche up and down in the room.</p>



<p>“When can I go back outside?”</p>



<p>“You can go outside. I’ll come with you”</p>



<p>Palle kicked off his pajamas. Feeling like he didn’t have any time to waste, he started changing his clothes. Falma was worried about the risk of infection, so he went with Palle.&nbsp; Blanche had free time so she came along as well.</p>



<p>And that’s why my brother and sister were walking around in the imperial capital.</p>



<p>Palle took in the city’s air for the first time in a long while. He had been under treatment for around a month now, so it was almost February.</p>



<p>“Ahhh… the city air is so good”</p>



<p>“Where do you want to go?”</p>



<p>“Oh yeah, over there”</p>



<p>When Blanche asked Palle where he wanted to go, Palle pointed towards the cathedral.</p>



<p>“Ehh, again? Let’s go eat some yummy food“</p>



<p>When Palle entered the cathedral, he knelt before the statue of the Medicine God and began to pray. Blanche lazily walked to the statue of the Water God.<br></p>



<p>“Thanks to you, I was able to overcome this challenge”</p>



<p>Palle earnestly informed his guardian deity. Falma wanted to pretend to be the Medicine God and say, “well done”, but decided not to trick his brother this time. Also, the head priest was clearly peeking out from the shadows behind a pillar.</p>



<p>“Thank you very much for lending your aid through my brother’s hand”</p>



<p>It was then that “that” happened.</p>



<p>(My brother’s head is in danger!)</p>



<p>Because Palle had prostrated himself, his wig was starting to slip off. Falma resisted the urge to fix the wig’s position.</p>



<p>“I had the unique experience of being a patient for a serious illness. This was a trial imposed by the Medicine God for the sake of my growth, wasn’t it.”</p>



<p>Palle lifted his head, and the wig immediately slipped off. He looked around and checked that no one saw, then put the it back on.</p>



<p>Falma also didn’t see anything.</p>



<p>“Big older brother, little older brother, I’m finished my prayers”</p>



<p>“Finished already? Blanche, your prayers are too sloppy! Did Falma pray to the Medicine God yet?”</p>



<p>“Mmm? Ahh, uhh…”</p>



<p>Palle didn’t notice that the cathedral floor around Falma was glowing.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>15.2</strong></p>

<p>After strolling through the city and socializing with people, Palle went home with Blanche. Falma stayed behind and, having been away for a long time, was finally able to return to the Diversis Mundi Pharmacy.</p>



<p>“I’ve missed this place”</p>



<p>The staff were taking their lunch break, so they went up to the second floor from the back door.</p>



<p>When Falma entered the room, the three people all looked up at once.</p>



<p>“Ah, Falma-sama! It’s been a while!”</p>



<p>Lotte rushed over.</p>



<p>“I’m back! Here, I bought some delicious tea. Let’s drink it together”</p>



<p>When Falma handed the tea tin to Lotte, she was overjoyed and hugged it tightly.</p>



<p>“I’ll also go prepare some delicious sweets to go with the tea!”</p>



<p>“Welcome back, Falma-kun”</p>



<p>Ellen appeared to be relieved as she stared at Falma.</p>



<p>“Thank you for everything you’ve done, Ellen, Lotte, Cedric-san. Sorry I left all of this on you”</p>



<p>“Haa-, I was really lonely without you. It’s strange how the child manager of a pharmacy is also the most important person here”</p>



<p>As Ellen welcomed Falma back, she wiped her glasses. She seemed relieved.</p>



<p>While Falma was away, a part-time first-class pharmacist was able to formulate medicine but only Ellen could diagnose patients. As such, she was under constant pressure to ensure that diagnoses were accurate. After all, patients come to the pharmacy for medicine that works. Ellen didn’t want to betray the patient’s trust or give the impression that all the pharmacists except for Falma were useless.</p>



<p>“Ellen, you’re a bit thin”</p>



<p>“I am thin! I’ve had stomachaches everyday”</p>



<p>It was caused by stress. “I’ve done something bad,&#8221; thought Falma with regret.</p>



<p>“Do you have any stomach medicine?”</p>



<p>“It’s not that”</p>



<p>“I trusted you, Ellen. That’s why I could leave things to you”</p>



<p>“You overestimate what I can do, Falma-kun~”</p>



<p>However, Ellen had worked with Falma on numerous cases and so with the exception of particularly difficult cases, she could diagnose the general points. Also, Falma gave her a diagnosis flowchart for diseases which she could rely on when taking care of patients.</p>



<p>“Lotte-chan helped me a lot. Cedric-san helped me too”</p>



<p>“Falma-sama and Palle-sama have been working hard. Eleonor-sama has been trying her best as well”</p>



<p>While Falma was gone, Lotte was responsible for liaising between Falma and Ellen and so she travelled back and forth from the mansion to the pharmacy.</p>



<p>“Ok, everyone! The fruit galette is done! Let’s have some of the high-quality tea that Falma-sama bought”</p>



<p>Lotte had baked a crepe-like dessert called a galette and stuffed it with various fruits. She set the galette and a tea set in front of Falma and the others. She was getting better and better at her hobby of making sweets.</p>



<p>“It’s Falma-sama’s welcome back party! Ahhhh~ it smells good”</p>



<p>Lotte pours some tea.</p>



<p>“Thank you. Starting from today, I’m going to be coming back to work”</p>



<p>Although he would have preferred to be in the pharmacy, Falma was often away recently due to unavoidable circumstances.</p>



<p>“In any case, Palle-kun &#8211; everything’s fine now, right?”</p>



<p>“Everything isn’t fine yet, but I’m not hovering between life and death anymore”</p>



<p>Ellen was surprised by Palle’s choice of words.</p>



<p>“Ehh? It was that serious? Didn’t you say it wasn’t that big of a deal?”</p>



<p>“I was at death’s door”</p>



<p>When she found out that things were worse than she imagined, Ellen was flustered.</p>



<p>“Jeez, Palle-kun, you don’t need to act strong. I don’t care about our rivalry if you don’t get better”</p>



<p>Ellen firmly voiced her thoughts.</p>



<p>“So, what’s Palle-kun doing at home then? Resting?”</p>



<p>“I’ve been proofreading the textbooks Falma’s written so far and fixing typos and other mistakes as well as finishing the incomplete parts”</p>



<p>The textbooks that Falma wrote make extensive use of medical and pharmaceutical terminology from Earth, so Palle is replacing the foreign terms with words from this world.</p>



<p>Falma can more or less use this world’s language. However, because it’s a different language, there are some roundabout expressions, colloquialisms, and medical terms as well as uncommon sayings which didn’t translate well. Those parts seemed off to Palle when he read them.</p>



<p>As such, Palle brushed it up and drafted a more academic, professional, and high-quality text. This was a huge help to Falma. Moreover, Palle read all of Falma’s work and urged him to continue.</p>



<p></p>



<p>“Eh? Did you say you’re writing for Falma-kun? How does Palle-kun know how to write textbooks?”</p>



<p>Ellen is shocked that Palle was able to learn pharmaceutical knowledge from Falma and use it to write textbooks.</p>



<p>“I’m writing the parts that Falma dictates. That’s how”</p>



<p>The process wherein Falma teaches Palle the pharmaceutical knowledge, Palle writes it down, and Falma confirms that it’s accurate, was very efficient.</p>



<p>As for Falma, he could write almost everything except for colloquial expressions, but he was slow at it. Furthermore, Palle had learned about chemistry at Novaroot Academy, so if Falma teaches him the chemical formulas, he’ll understand them. As such, it was faster to explain new chapters to Palle and have him write it down.</p>



<p>Falma’s work was significantly reduced while Palle happily exclaimed “Fwahaha, this is groundbreaking knowledge!” Also, Palle liked cutting the paper for the mimeograph.</p>



<p>“The de Medicis pharmacist brothers really are amazing, are they not?”</p>



<p>Lotte said in praise of the two.</p>



<p>“… including master-sama, and that’s three people from the de Medicis family. As expected of a prestigious and noble family of pharmacists. Say, will those textbooks be used at universities?”</p>



<p>“That’s what I intend to do. I was also thinking about this while treating my brother. I think that for the newly established department of pharmacology, needle skills for things like taking blood samples and other treatments should be required courses as well. It’s impossible to treat diseases like leukemia simply by taking medicine and leaving the rest up to fate”</p>



<p>“Aren’t doctors already doing what Falma-kun is describing?”</p>



<p>“Pharmacists are best suited to handling drugs. Of course, this won’t improve coordination with doctors, so it’ll be necessary to train technicians and have all sorts of inspection departments”</p>



<p>Falma wanted to not only educate the pharmacists, but also the doctors and technicians. If only the field of pharmacy improves but not the field of medicine, then it’ll be very frustrating.</p>



<p>“Well… there’s a medical school in the imperial capital of San Fleuve, but it’s not very well known”</p>



<p>Although Salerno Medical School is located in the imperial capital, its educational standards were low, and it wasn’t very popular. After all, all the talented medical students attended the influential Novaroot Academy. Incidentally, the Imperial Medical School and Salerno Medical School were close to one another.</p>



<p>“What if you ask your father to teach at the Department of Pharmacology? As the dean, that decision is up to you, right?”</p>



<p>Said Ellen, bravely.</p>



<p>“Pharmacists can’t pierce or cut people with needles, right?”</p>



<p>“It’s standard medical practice, but it’s not legal”</p>



<p>“I thought so!”</p>



<p>Falma suddenly had an epiphany.<br></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>15.3</strong></p>


<p>That night at the dinner table, Falma discussed with Bruno.</p>



<p>“Sure, there were many times when I felt constrained by the rules of the medical school”</p>



<p>“There are limits to just prescribing medicine. We need to train doctors who know can treat patients using injections or IV drips or the like”</p>



<p>Bruno moodily stroked his beard. He understood that new methods of treatment required new frameworks.</p>



<p>Palle had an incredulous look on his face, but Bruno turned in favor of Falma’s idea.</p>



<p>“Let’s arrange a meeting with the faculty immediately”<br></p>



<p>After meeting with the faculty and discussing with Salerno Medical School, it was agreed that the Imperial Medical School and Salerno Medical School would merge into one single school.</p>



<p>The new layout is like this:</p>



<p>Department of Medicine → Previously the Salerno Medical School</p>



<p>Department of Pharmacology → A faculty based on divine arts and traditional herbs</p>



<p>Department of Drug Discovery → The faculty that Falma is the dean of. Responsible for dealing with new drugs</p>



<p>Department of Clinical Laboratory Services → For training new lab technicians (those who perform clinical tests on microbes and blood as well as pathological examinations)</p>



<p>In total, there are 4 departments.</p>



<p>Falma was in charge of the two-year curriculum for all the departments already, so in this regard his responsibilities didn’t increase. All that changed was that instead of lecturing students of the Department of Drug Discovery in a classroom, now he would be lecturing them in an auditorium.</p>



<p>After all the students have been taught the fundamentals of medicine, it’s better to focus on a specific faculty’s curriculum. Then, after all the students understand the fundamentals of medicine, they can verify and select the correct treatment for what was once attributed to evil spirits in this world.</p>



<p>It was good to try many different things, so in a few years there will be a lot of specialists.</p>



<p>“This was a bigger ordeal than I expected”</p>



<p>Falma was dumbstruck. Ellen was also shocked.</p>



<p>“That’s just how much teacher-sensei is betting on Falma-kun, right?”</p>



<p>TL: Those department names might end up changing if someone with a medical background knows what they’re actually called in the real world<br></p>



<p>In time, it might even be possible to raise students and doctors who are on the same level as those on modern day Earth. Then the whole continent, or maybe even the whole world, can enjoy the same level of medical treatment that the imperial capital currently has.</p>



<p>That was Falma’s hope.</p>



<p>“Little by little, I’ll do my best”</p>



<p>And so after two years San Fleuve Imperial Medical School, which used to educate pharmacists, was renamed to the San Fleuve Imperial College of Medicine and reborn as the foremost location for medicine and pharmacology within the San Fleuve empire.</p>
