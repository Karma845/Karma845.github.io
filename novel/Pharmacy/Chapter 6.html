<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; The Different World Pharmacy Marseille Factory&#8217;s Operation Preparation </h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A carrier pigeon arrived to Falma who was carrying out his Different World Pharmacy&#8217;s regular business together with the news he had been waiting for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pharmaceutical factory in Marseille was finally completed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s built so quickly〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma had believed that he would wait for years, but the result was it was completed after half a year it had started. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-kun, you&#8217;re a young master so it&#8217;s different〜. Also, the Empire and the Temple&#8217;s investments were huge too」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen somewhat awed by Falma would gather everything he needs using the assets he earned himself, without even relying on the assets of his family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even though he was like that, he would not use most of his money for his own individual entertainment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen analyses that his unselfishness gathered more and more supporters and worshippers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the world where many nobles spend all their time to fatten their pockets, Falma showed a surprising unselfishness. He was not a child who was clueless about the world, one that just doesn&#8217;t know how to increase his fortune. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What are you going to make in the factory? Swee……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte covered her mouth that almost spout out &#8220;sweets&#8221;. It looks like it was an involuntary comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s not sweets. It&#8217;s medicine」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma smiled at her cliché idea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I-I know right!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte was so embarrassed that she was red to her ears. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after the completion, the preparations are being done with the instruments and equipment needed for manufacturing and experimenting are ordered from their respective suppliers. Falma himself used the Medicine God Staff to fly to quickly carry precision equipment, while the large equipment is carried by carriages. He also used his Substance Creation ability. Although the interior is yet to be completed, the structure and facilities themselves are completed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides that, Falma asked the acting lord of Marseille, Adam, to hire 200 factory workers locally. After most of the factory equipment was installed, Falma visited San Flueve Empire Medicine Academy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He received several actinomycete strains from Professor Casper chosen explicitly for antibiotic production, and he will be transporting them for mass production. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Casper, who met with Falma, entrusts him three strains that she chose with confidence. She looked reluctant to part with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I will be leaving them to you, Professor de Médicis. I hope that they would be of patients&#8217; use」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma who was being called as a professor is yet to get used to being addressed as such. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even so, he thought that it was thoughtless if he corrected her right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I have certainly received them, Professor Casper. I will take responsibility for scaling up these strains, and make them an antibiotic formulation. I promise that those medicines will be of patients&#8217; help」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「They are strains found with everyone&#8217;s effort. I will leave them to you」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Casper seemed as if she was handing over her own child. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The box was wrapped with a ribbon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the following names were written on the box. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Casper-chan No.1&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eric-kun No.2&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alexis-kun No.3&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen suddenly asked Falma who was preciously holding the box entrusted to him by Professor Casper while they are being shaken by the carriage going to Marseille. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What&#8217;s this, who?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She saw the three names written on top of the box. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I think that it&#8217;s the name of the strain of actinomycetes. The name of the discoverer and the order of discovery is written. Professor Eric and Assistant Alexis are also co-researchers of this research」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma interpreted while thinking of the names of the researchers engaged in the research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh?! Are bacteria also named?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of the discoverer and the order it was discovered is written. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma looked at the letter of explanation attached separately, and just like he thought, it was the name of the strains taken from Professor Casper and the other discoverer&#8217;s names. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s an interesting way of naming it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What genial professors&#8221;, Ellen laughed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Un, well, I understand the feeling of using the names of the inventor on their inventions」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I guess I should unify the nomenclature later. I wish they at least added a generic name. Just calling them Casper is fine too) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it was the names given by Professor Casper and the others, Falma decided to give it a silent approval for the moment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the names of the discoverer is an honor as well as their privilege. And it was not like it needs to be &#8220;like this&#8221;. This is a different world, so there was no rule that it must follow Earth&#8217;s style. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Falma himself, in his past life, had several new antibiotic strains of bacteria named after him. He named them according to the nomenclature, but he cannot tell Professor Casper that, and he understands how happy she is. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s true. This bacteria is special, right? I&#8217;m sure that they put on many efforts to find and increase these bacteria」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen said so, telling compliments to Professor Casper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s Professor Casper and her assistant&#8217;s great accomplishment」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「By the way, where do bacterial strains exist?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Wait a second」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma smiled mischievously, asked the carriage to stop, got off, and walked towards the side of the road without hesitance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What? Are you peeing?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, what should I do&#8221;, Ellen looked away. Falma rubbed off the surface of the ground using his shoes, picked up a handful of soil, and showed it to Ellen after he returned to the carriage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen who looked at the soil thought &#8220;don&#8217;t tell me……&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Look, it&#8217;s here」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh? You&#8217;re saying that it might be here? The bacterial strains?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s not &#8220;might be&#8221;. It&#8217;s full of it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma moved the fingers of the hand he used to pick up the soil. Ellen felt her back turn itchy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hiiiiーー! How can you carry that, Falma-kun! Aren&#8217;t you disgusted?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would seem that Ellen felt that way. She shivered in disgust. Falma threw away the soil and washed his hand with the water he created using divine arts and returned to the carriage. The carriage started to run again. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.2</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the carriage, Lotte is comfortably sleeping while drooling. She would repeatedly say the usual &#8220;Falma-sama〜, I can&#8217;t eat anymore〜, munyamunya〜&#8221;, and &#8220;I guess just a bit more after all〜&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be better to just leave her like that. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No, well, soil is like that. Many bacteria, fungi, and microorganisms live everywhere. Or perhaps I should say, even our skins have countless bacteria」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By the way, those microorganisms has a purifying effect on soil&#8221;, Falma explained. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「But, the strains that Professor Casper chose are especially excellent elites」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Casper and her helpers are looking forward to the extract of the active substance of the bacteria turning into medicine and be administered to patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following three is what Professor Casper and the others found. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">① &#8220;Caspar-chan #1&#8221; / Caspar, No.1 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its scientific name on Earth is streptomyces griseus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streptomycin producing microorganism candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">… antituberculous drug. Effective for tuberculosis, leprosy, bubonic plague, etc. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">② &#8220;Eric-kun #2&#8221; / Eric, No.2 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its scientific name on Earth is streptomyces mediterranei. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rifamycin producing bacteria candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…semi-synthesized to rifampicin, effective for tuberculosis, leprosy, etc. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">③ &#8220;Alexis-kun #3&#8221; / Alexis, No.3 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its scientific name on Earth is streptomyces peucetius. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doxorubicin producing bacteria candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…antitumor agent (malignant lymphoma, lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, breast cancer, bladder tumor, osteosarcoma, and a wide range of effects) </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Professor Caspar and the others do not know the specific effects of those drugs, Falma knows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What an amazing effect. It sounds like a lie hearing that white plague, black plague, and even cancer can be cured」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s not a lie. Bacteria strains possess such power」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-kun or Professor Casper, how did you know those drugs can be made with those bacteria? How did you narrow it down to these three?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one were to ask how they were identified (find out that drug), it was not like Falma did a complicated analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even one of his cheat abilities, the Magnifying Eyes, cannot see the structure of a compound. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, he simply used his Erase ability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using his erase ability in a reverse way, it can also be used in distinguishing drugs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma chanted all the names of the antibiotic he knows and what disappeared is the drug. It is a very accurate way of identification.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Falma was not satisfied with that. He thought that he must think of other inspection methods for the people of this world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hey, how?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh? Ah, that&#8217;s still a secret. I&#8217;ll tell you when the time is right」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma had not prepared an answer to Ellen&#8217;s simple question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What&#8217;s with that〜, don&#8217;t treat me like a stranger in this topic〜, tell me how〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Haha, I&#8217;m sorry」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could only cover it up with a laugh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You, really……, then, tell me if it&#8217;s that time okay?」 </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well, anyways. It&#8217;s amazing that Professor Caspar and the researchers of the medicine academy could find this much. There are 2 antibacterial agents and 1 carcinostatic agent!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma returned to the topic and showed how he was impressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Falma and Professor Caspar were the ones leading the team, they were able to find useful antibiotics in a short period. If Professor Caspar had it researched individually, it would have taken tens of years. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(With this, even if I disappear, the people of this would have the means to fight against disease.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma could not hold back his joy. The work he needs to do would probably decrease one by one from now on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he thought that he could not become too pleased by this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I need to make it reach the point where it can be mass produced!&#8221;, Falma cheered. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The whole academy took action, gathered many researchers for a single research, so it&#8217;s really amazing」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That was unprecedented!&#8221;, Ellen groaned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was said that most of the researchers had interrupted their own research and participated. That was also something impossible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it changed to something like a treasure hunt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they become the first one to discover, their name shall be bestowed. They were probably blinded by the honor they would receive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Having a medicine with your own name, I want it too〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen was mesmerized. She believes that she saw the determination of the San Flueve Empire Medicine Academy and Bruno&#8217;s seriousness. Even now, the Medicine Academy continues their big project of discovering bacteria that can produce other antibiotics. It is said that even the Norbatz University of Medicine is focused on the movements of the Empire&#8217;s Medicine Academy. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You should just search for it, search for &#8220;Ellen-chan #4 bacteria&#8221;. I&#8217;ll teach you how」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma suggested to Ellen with a serious face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;ll search for something other than bacteria」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen who feels disgusted with bacteria wave her hands and immediately refused. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s very Ellen」 </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing things like that, the staff of the Different World Pharmacy spent a whole day traveling to Marseille and inspected the factory that was just completed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its name is also called &#8220;Different World Pharmacy Marseille Factory&#8221;, which was named as it was. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After passing through the front gates of the factory, Falma, Ellen, Lotte, and Cedrick was welcomed by Adam, the acting lord, and the one appointed to build the factory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Welcome, Falma-sama. You must be tired after a long journey」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thank you for your arrangements, Adam-san」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma used his Medicine God Staff to go back and forth between the imperial capital and Marseille, so he has seen the completion of the factory, but this is the first unveiling for the other staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The factory that is built with stone, boasting a vast site area, had spread in front of their eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Woah〜! This factory, it&#8217;s so vast!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte started saying things like she wants to run a whole lap around the factory from end to end, but stopped by Cedrick, telling her that she would get exhausted. Falma also couldn&#8217;t let her do that because it would be three kilometers around the factory and it is not suitable to do it with her shoes right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It looks like a little palace, amazing! It&#8217;s more vast than Falma-kun&#8217;s mansion you know?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen also raised a voice of admiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being more vast than the site area of the de Médicis Family&#8217;s mansion, one could say that it is really impressive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There should be no other in this world, where both the government and its people had created a production base with such a large scale, with pharmacies, medicine stores, and drug stores making medicine for their patients&#8221; after saying that, Ellen praised the Falma&#8217;s achievements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It is such a fine thing」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cedrick was also moved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its exterior and facilities are the biggest among everything he had seen. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.3</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After passing through the front yard of the pharmaceutical factory, they entered through the factory&#8217;s entrance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Buーー!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma who was walking ahead burst out as soon as he entered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spacious entrance hall that one would see in hotels, there was the founder, Falma de Médicis&#8217;s real-size bronze statue! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What&#8217;s this! This wasn&#8217;t here a few days ago!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen and Lotte giggled at Falma who desperately protested. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ahh, it was donated by the Esthark Village. It was just completed recently. I placed it here, thinking that you would like it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acting lord Adam answered definitively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam said that there was gold donated from Esthark Village with a message &#8220;Please make the factory founder&#8217;s bronze statue.&#8221;, so he ordered for it to be made. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s really Esthark Village!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If it&#8217;s them, they might do such thing&#8221;, Falma thought, feeling resigned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-sama, please stand beside the bronze statue」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte asked him and Falma stood beside it. The bronze statue was quite beautified. The hem of its white coat had looked like it flutters in the wind, while the statue is looking far ahead with crossed arms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma did the same pose as the statue. He also made a face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「How is it?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma asked the three while making a serious face. </span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vwXBh7f/182314.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The statue looks more handsome」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen and Lotte looked at each other and Cedrick smiled at him warmly. The founder staggered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s none of your business!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If there is there inconvenience being placed her, shall I order it to be brought to the factory&#8217;s front garden?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam said with concern. However, Falma himself thought that it is a bit pitiable if his own statue was left outside under the sun and rain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s fine here」 </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving aside the jokes, they turned to look at the factory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interior of the stone-built medicinal factory was divided into rooms for each production process, and is thoroughly cleaned and has its cleanliness kept as to eliminate dust. On top of that, Falma had cast his &#8220;Disease Destruction Sanctuary&#8221; beforehand, increasing its cleanliness furthermore. There would be bacteria strains going to be brought from now on, so Falma needs to be very careful when casting his holy field to not &#8220;sterilize&#8221; the actinomycetes and kill it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The professors that took care of the bacteria as if they were their children would be very very angry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there is no electrical system, compared to the humble research facility of the Different World Pharmacy and the Empire&#8217;s Medicine Academy, it is considerably modernized. For the mass cultivation of actinomycetes, a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant consisting of several large tanks and pipelines was necessary. For pilot plant tests, tests were conducted with harmless bacterial species at the Empire&#8217;s Medicinal Academy. Currently, a large number of artisans and engineers are hired, building 5 plants. It would still take time before these plants to be completed and fully operational. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group came to the laboratory attached to the pharmaceutical factory inside the factory site. It is a research facility with an aseptic room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Professor&#8217;s Caspar&#8217;s bacteria, let me see!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After entering the aseptic room after washing their hands, putting on gloves, and wearing clean clothes, Ellen said with great interest. Lotte and Cedrick changed as well and watched them although they could not understand. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I want to see it too. Let&#8217;s open it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After wiping the box with alcohol, the pink ribbon was removed, and the box where Professor Caspar&#8217;s children were opened. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What came out was six Petri dishes. A plate planted with actinomycetes strain. After that was the test plate as the antibiotic. Planted in the middle of the agar petri dish filled with bacteria was the various actinomycetes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as if to surround those actinomycetes was a circle made of other bacteria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actinomycetes develop antibiotics that suppress the growth of other bacteria, creating an antibiotic production region called &#8220;growth inhibition circle&#8221; where other bacteria cannot grow. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What&#8217;s this circle, it&#8217;s cool」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen understood what it meant and nodded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Right?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Around here, why are fluffy ones not growing?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like Lotte also found it strange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen seems to have changed the way she looks at actinomycetes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was an ability that actinomycetes acquired in the process of its evolution as a result of its struggle for existence. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Around these circle, are the antibiotics being produced right at this moment?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to tell since it can be seen with the naked eye&#8221;, Ellen was impressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s right」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a third-person perspective, they were a weird group peeking at a plate with mold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, they are inside the pharmaceutical factory so there is no problem. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Actinomycetes are really great huh」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen looked at them fervently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We will increase this bacteria to large quantities, and extract and purify antibiotics therefrom」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Falma spoke, Lotte continued his words. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「By doing that, we can make medicine for everyone who&#8217;s troubled!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Lotte who jumped in excitement said was exactly they plan to do. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(That&#8217;s right. We&#8217;re going to make a lot of medicine from now on. Now using my cheat powers, but using the powers of the people of this world) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma braced himself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first step to establishing pharmaceutical technology in this world. </span></p>
