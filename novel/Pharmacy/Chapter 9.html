<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Palle de Médicis and the Different World Pharmacy </h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>9.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Year 1147, the New Years have also arrived in the mansion of the de Médicis Family in the imperial capital of San Flueve Empire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma turned 12 and Lotte turned 10. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Good morning, Falma-sama」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「<i>Fuwaa</i>…… good morning. What are you doing?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma woke up in the morning and saw Lotte&#8217;s face 10cm away from the bed. She placed her head on the arms she folded on top of the bed, swaying it to the sides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「<i>Ehehe〜</i>, I was just looking〜! I was looking at Falma-sama&#8217;s sleeping face」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her pink eyebrows blinked, and flapped. &#8220;Is she a pervert?&#8221; Falma thought for an instant, but it seems that for Lotte, being in the same place as him was pleasant enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What is it over here?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma felt there&#8217;s something moving around his waist and found out that Blanche snuck under his beddings.  He didn&#8217;t notice her sneaking in at all. Blanche is as spoiled as usual. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It might be because it&#8217;s cold today」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte opened the louver door in Falma&#8217;s room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What they saw outside was a silver world, the San Flueve Imperial Capital was covered with a blanket of snow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(<i>Ah〜</i>, it&#8217;s snowing today huh. Although it looks beautiful, I want to erase it) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma is not good with snow so he could not help but think like that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year&#8217;s winter, Falma&#8217;s favorite horse slipped on the frozen ground. Because of that, Falma fell off the horse and landed on his waist, making him stuck in bed for a day. He let his guard down because of some strange logic that it should be alright riding a horse, underestimating the snowy road. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s snowing outside huh, we should stay inside today. Lotte, do you have plans today?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The scenery in the courtyard is wonderful, so I was thinking of drawing a picture」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte looked at the courtyard with sparkling eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(This, I guess I should be careful not to accidentally erase the snow) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma almost got in the way of Lotte&#8217;s art creation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Today is a rest day, so Falma-sama should take it slow today as well」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Well, it&#8217;s just changing what I&#8217;m doing from working in the pharmacy to desk work though) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma wanted to do some desk work, so he used the New Year&#8217;s as an excuse, taking a few rest days from the pharmacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why, unusually, Falma would be spending his time in their house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-sama〜. What would you like to wear today?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;m fine with everyday clothes, ones I can relax wearing inside the house」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Understood」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte took out several clothes from the dresser. She would prepare clothes for Falma that would fit the time, place, and occasion, so he really finds it convenient when participating in formal events. However, Falma feels a bit troubled that she would sometimes give him clothes that are Lotte&#8217;s taste, making him look like a visual kei. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;ll wear clothes other than that」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Lotte had a face full of smiles as she holds the clothes with flashy ruff collars and cuffs with frills. Lotte is only a servant, and because she cannot wear flashy clothes herself, she is more interested in fashion than Falma or Blanche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「<i>Eh〜</i>, understood」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I mean, I wonder when does Lotte plan on being my personal servant?) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma felt troubled where to look while having his clothes buttoned up. Although he is still in the age where one would be called a child, he thinks that it would be embarrassing if Lotte would see him change his clothes and it would also be troubling for Lotte herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Even if I say I can change my clothes myself, a son of a noble shouldn&#8217;t do so) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma was being thoughtful, thinking that it would be better if his personal attendant would be a male servant or Lotte&#8217;s mother instead. Although the lifestyle of a noble was still suffocating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Come, it&#8217;s time for Blanche-ojousama to change too〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yeaa!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma let Lotte dress him in simple clothes, and Blanche was dressed in a frilly dress. The two of them headed towards the dining room. As they did so, Falma instinctively took the employee ID&#8217;s replica from the box on top of his desk. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Elder Brother, you&#8217;re always holding that」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanche curiously said as they went down the spiral staircase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「This is, well〜……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is it very important to Elder Brother?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s very important」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his past life, Falma always placed his employee ID inside the chest pocket of his laboratory coat. It was also the card key to his laboratory, so he has the habit of bringing it as much as possible when moving to other rooms. He could not help himself but bring it with him. Although it was only a replica, it was also the proof that it bothers him from the bottom of his heart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I need to go, soon) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma is thinking of going to the Great Temple and take a look at the original great divine treasure. It turned into a divine treasure, so its condition might have changed from his previous employee ID. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Temple is not within the San Flueve Empire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The headquarters of the temple is in a small City Country called &#8220;Divine Nation&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Divine Nation is similar to the Vatican City, with the entire country being a temple organization where only priests live. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only Falma needs to pass through the borders to get there, for some reason, he really could not make up his mind in going to the Great Temple. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has heard from the Head Priest that it is not simple to go to the Great Temple. According to him, the Great Temple has yet to find out Falma&#8217;s existence, but if they do, he might fall into a state of confinement as a precious God-possessed. Those who have become Grand Priests that oversees the Great Temple possesses tricky secret techniques to seal a god. That&#8217;s why Falma started to think of law-breaking plans to sneak into the temple at night, during the time where there are fewer guards and take a look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Temple has turned into a labyrinth, so even if Falma was able to sneak in at night, he might not be able to locate the great divine treasure. The Head Priest have also told Falma, &#8220;If you wish so, I can take you in.&#8221; But Falma felt an ache from his heart, because it really sounded like they were thieves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(There&#8217;s no way I can let the Head Priest Salomon take dangerous actions, he might get fired too. A country that only has priests, huh? I feel that they&#8217;ll find me just after taking three steps in) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, getting caught doing sneaky actions as such would be a disgrace. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>9.2</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma entered the dining hall and took his seat to take his breakfast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their parents were already awake, only waiting for Falma and Blanche. They usually eat their meal when the family has gathered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It seems that Palle is coming home」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the servers brought their meal, Falma&#8217;s father casually said that significant information while reading the Imperial Capital Newspaper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「<i>Pa?</i>」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma and Blanche braced themselves just hearing the &#8220;<i>Pa</i>&#8221; sound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The siblings looked at each other&#8217;s faces. (What should we do?) (What do you think we should do?) (Should we run?) ( We should run!) (H-Hey, that&#8217;s) They exchanged such eye contacts. It seems that Blanche was very serious about escaping his brother&#8217;s whip of love. Falma coughed so that his unrest would not show. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I am looking forward to that. Uhm, when will Elder Brother return?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We received the message today, you know? He said that he&#8217;s coming home today」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma&#8217;s mother Beatrice was in a very good mood. She looks very happy to meet her son after a long time. It seems that Palle is a scholarly, obedient, and lovely son for their parents. By the way, Falma&#8217;s parents don&#8217;t have a clue of the scandals Palle made in Norbatz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It seems that he wanted to surprise us」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I really don&#8217;t need that kind of surprise okay?!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma thought from the bottom of his heart how great of an idea it was to have a break from the pharmacy. His brother might&#8217;ve asked where Falma was, making him suddenly visit the pharmacy. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After breakfast, Falma and Blanche gathered around the fireplace restlessly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte was sketching the courtyard from the terrace while wearing thick clothes. She said that she had come up with a good design with the snowy scenery as the motif. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Today&#8217;s snowing, so it should be okay, right? Big Elder Brother won&#8217;t say snow training, right?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanche had a faint hope. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「He got me even though it was raining cats and dogs. Even when it was storming」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma would never forget his face off with his brother. His brother would return every half a year, so even after that, he would challenge Falma to a match every time. Nevertheless, Palle has never been able to win once before the Medicine God Staff. Despite that, he would still challenge Falma in a serious 1-2 hour long fights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most troublesome thing was not the battle itself. The battle itself was a good exercise, but the tenacious Palle would not give up until he was KO-d, so healing Palle who was covered all over with cuts and bruises after the battle between brothers ended was troublesome. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(This time, maybe I should knock his lights out with one punch as soon as the match starts) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like that, Falma started to think violently. He felt that that way, his brother&#8217;s wounds would be the least. Also, Palle believes that Falma always wins due to coincidences, so he does not plan on ending the battle between them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afternoon, Falma&#8217;s elder brother returned along with his attendants, so he was welcomed at the entrance by the whole family and all of the servants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I have just returned」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palle got taller. It was that case with Bruno as well, but it seems that they are a family of tall people. He looked even more sturdier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It is good that you are back, my son」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno&#8217;s eyes thinned, seeing his son&#8217;s growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It has been a while everyone. Without delay, there is something I wish to report to Father」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palle said with a pause. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I have graduated from Norbatz as the valedictorian, and passed the first-class apothecary exam」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palle took out the diploma and the first-class apothecary badge from his bag and proudly showed it to his parents. It is the culmination of his years of effort, days spent in training his divine arts and studying in the dormitory of the Norbatz University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「As expected of my son」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh my, you really did your best. I&#8217;m so proud of you」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno and Beatrice were happy from the bottom of their hearts, hearing Falma&#8217;s brother&#8217;s honor. Palle also looked very happy. He&#8217;s very honest in that sense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;ll show you guys too. <i>Hm?</i> What do you think? Aren&#8217;t you envious?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palle proudly showed them to Falma and Blanche, so Falma answered saying &#8220;this is the first-class apothecary badge huh〜, amazing〜.&#8221; The badge Ellen, another first-class apothecary, wears on her chest was a badge with the Imperial Medicine Academy&#8217;s crest, and its shape is a bit different from the badge with the Norbatz Medicine University&#8217;s logo, but Palle&#8217;s badge had a higher formality. By the way, a Court Apothecary would have the crown badge, so the alma mater would not be asked. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What are you planning now you&#8217;ve graduated? Do you wish to study abroad?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno asked Palle&#8217;s future course. As the heir, no matter if he becomes a court apothecary, no matter if he succeeds the Archdukeship or not, Palle is the successor of the de Médicis Family. That&#8217;s why, although they would eventually return to the imperial capital, it is not rare for first-class apothecaries to train or study abroad. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes, I would wish to return to the mansion and pursue becoming a court apothecary while acting as Father&#8217;s assistant」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palle said with determination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(<i>Geー!</i> Brother&#8217;s coming home?!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma&#8217;s eyes turned white. It was the same with Blanche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「From now on, we&#8217;re going to train every day. Aren&#8217;t you happy your brother&#8217;s spending his time with you, right Falma!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(There it isーーhe&#8217;s completely fired up!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that Falma was required to accompany his spartan-like brother. Falma does not neglect training his divine arts so that his skill would not fall, but it would be a huge time burden if he would need to train with his brother every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Blanche swiftly got in between Falma and Palle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「<i>nm〜to ne〜</i>, Big Elder Brother〜. Little Elder Brother〜, you know〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palle made a questioning face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(H-Hey, what are you, stop, Blanche!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma had strictly reminded Blanche before Palle returned that she absolutely cannot tell him about Falma&#8217;s recent activities. However, it was a mere promise with a child. No one could blame her even if she breaks it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「He&#8217;s very busy〜, so you shouldn&#8217;t bother him okay〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palle was melted by Blanche who smiled like an angel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It can&#8217;t be helped. I guess I should train you first. I won&#8217;t care even if you start crying」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I don&#8217;t wanna get ouchie〜. Be kind okay〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palle patted Blanche&#8217;s head, seeing her beg with teary eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the meantime, it seems that Falma himself was able to avoid the daily training but, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I&#8217;ll make sure to pick up your ashes, do your best Blanche) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma prayed for Blanche&#8217;s safety along with his gratitude. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, during the afternoon of that day, Falma was challenged to a match as heavy snow fell, making him accompany his brother for three hours under the falling snow.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>9.3</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a few days after having a match with Falma under the heavy snow, Palle brought Falma, Blanche, and Lotte to play around the imperial capital. Apart from being muscle-brained and hot-blooded, he was a big brother that cares a lot about his siblings. Hearing that thermaes were made with the Empress&#8217;s arrangement, Palle happily entered one, looking very excited from beginning to end. They had snowball fights, played on a sled, and climbed snow mountains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After playing that much, Palle returned to the university to finish his graduation procedures and preparations to move. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Haa〜, Elder Brother, I think you shouldn&#8217;t come home for a while」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma went to start the ceremony to begin the new year&#8217;s business of the Different World Pharmacy while avoiding Palle&#8217;s eyes. The usual regulars crowded in front of the pharmacy before it opened. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Happy new years, Falma-kun」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen came to work bringing lots of presents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then said after seeing Falma who was resting his chin on top of the pharmacy counter, and Lotte and Blanche who was leaning over. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What happened to the three of you? You looked tired although it&#8217;s the new years」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We played too much」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「How unusual, to think that Falma-kun would get tired because of playing too much」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eleanor-sama, it smells delicious!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>*SunSun*</i>, Lotte who was unmoving like a corpse twitched her nose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「<i>Ara</i>, smells? Oh you, Lotte-chan. I&#8217;ve enjoyed Suize〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that during her vacation, Ellen went to her father&#8217;s fief, Suize Earldom. She gave Falma, Lotte, Cedrick, and the other pharmacy employees rare cheese and confectionery. Ellen&#8217;s father&#8217;s fief was a mountainous area like in Switzerland, and the people there are making a living out of pasture and tourism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s delicious〜! Its thick smell is also〜…」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte could not hold back and ate some cheese. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah! I&#8217;ll brush my teeth」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte went off to brush her teeth for eating cheese before the pharmacy opens, thinking that the smell is unsuitable for dealing with the customers. It seems that she had grown a habit of etiquette. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「<i>Heh〜</i>[, that guy&#8217;s coming back huh. Did he graduated from Norbatz?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen showed a complicated face hearing Palle&#8217;s name. They are childhood friends and has been rivals for long years. And maybe only Ellen can call the son of the Archduke &#8220;that guy.&#8221; Although they haven&#8217;t seen each other for years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Un, he said he graduated valedictorian. It seems that he passed the first-class apothecary exam at the same time as he graduated」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「<i>Heh〜</i>, he&#8217;s pretty good. However, we&#8217;re only finally equal huh」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was true that Ellen became a first-class apothecary earlier. However, there is still a difference in actual ranks between becoming a first-class apothecary after graduating from the distinguished Norbatz Medicine University and becoming a first-calls apothecary after graduating from the Imperial Medicine Academy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「<i>Ne〜</i>. Does he know that Falma-kun is a Court Apothecary, Her Majesty&#8217;s Primary Apothecary, operating the Different World Pharmacy issued with an imperial sanction, and most of all, the Medicine God?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Of course he doesn&#8217;t」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What a frightening thing you&#8217;re asking,&#8221; Falma shook his head. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Since he&#8217;s returning home, wouldn&#8217;t it be impossible to hide it?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What do you think would happen if he finds out?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Let me see. It&#8217;s <i>that guy</i>, so I think his pride won&#8217;t forgive him for losing to his younger brother. And most of all, his position as the heir would be precarious if the younger brother is more competent. There&#8217;s the thing with the family inheritance, so there would be some discord」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well, he shouldn&#8217;t find out about it that easily. After all, he said that he&#8217;d be studying at home to become a Court Apothecary, and follow Father in his diagnosis」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That might be somewhat difficult」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cedrick said something ominous as he was creating lines on the new accounting book for the new year. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I was asked, &#8220;I heard that there is a pharmacy in the imperial capital with a good reputation, do you know where is it?&#8221;」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Cedrick-san, what did you answer?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma froze. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I answered, &#8220;all pharmacies have good reputations, I wonder which one&#8221;」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, all of the pharmacies in the imperial capital which were affiliated with the Dispensing Pharmacy Guild has a business alliance with the Different World Pharmacy.
