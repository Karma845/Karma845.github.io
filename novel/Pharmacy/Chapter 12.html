<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Start of Induction Therapy (Day 1 - 4)</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>12.1</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;I will explain the treatment plan&#8230; No, let&#8217;s think together, brother.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma took care of Palle falling from the chair. Falma respected Palle&#8217;s position as a pharmacist and considered it not to be a one-sided treatment.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Cedric, could you give us a tea?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Cedric gave a hot tea to Palle and Falma while Lotte immediately put the chocolate. Palle drank the tea and finally felt comfortable.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Are you really Falma?&#8221; <br></p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Where does that knowledge came from? You didn’t learn that from Eleonore right?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I had a dream when I was struck by a lightning.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma gave them a reasonable excuse. Palle cannot hide his shock.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;That’s a revelation, isn’t it? &#8230; Who is the God that gave you the revelation?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Palle replied.<br></p>



<p>Palle stood up and went out. Falma stood up to follow his brother while Ellen called to Palle.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I also want to get struck by lightning!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Palle you idiot. You’re going die if you got hit by a lightning!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Because it&#8217;s stupid, Ellen didn’t do it but Palle really do want to get struck by a lightning.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;It won’t be so easy to get hit by a lightning,&#8221; Falma added.<br></p>



<p>Falma’s statement made Palle stopped.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Eleonore, think about it? The pharmaceutical knowledge that we have learned so far. What is it? If anything, maybe it was meaningless.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not meaningless. It&#8217;s not pointless.&#8221; Falma denied Palle&#8217;s words.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Even the medicine of the past has worked, right?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;As you say, but more medicines don’t work or even sometimes lead to death&#8230;&#8221; Ellen supported Palle.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Falma, write down everything you dreamed of. Tell and explain it to us.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, so I&#8217;m doing it now. That&#8217;s the text.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma decided to continue the lecture in front of the two 1st-Class Pharmacists.<br></p>



<p>“I’ll continue explaining. Leukemia has two types according to its progression rate. Chronic Leukemia is a slow-growing leukemia while Acute Leukemia is a fast-growing leukemia that progresses quickly without treatment. It doesn&#8217;t mean the acute period will be prolonged and become chronic. It is a completely different disease. Chronic is a condition in which problems arise in the hematopoietic stem cells themselves. While acute is a condition in which an abnormality occurs in the middle of becoming each blood component from the hematopoietic stem cell. So which type of leukemia does brother have?”<br></p>



<p>By making it a question form, Falma wanted to embed the knowledge in their memory and deepen their understanding. Palle was an excellent student who quickly absorbed and understood what Falma said. <br></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s acute,&#8221; Palle replied, <br></p>



<p>&#8220;Isn’t it chronic?&#8221;, Ellen said the other way around.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Acute is the correct answer. There are two ways to get rid of this leukemia cell. What do you think it is?&#8221;, Falma asked.<br></p>



<p>Falma showed an illustration of text of how blood cells and other components mature from hematopoietic stem cells.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Kill the leukemia cells&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Palle seems to have come up with the way soon.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. Give another one. Ellen, think about it.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Surrender, what should I do?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Ellen was quick to give up. As both were excited to know the answer, Falma gave an answer.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Leukemic cells can become normal white blood cells.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Can you do that?&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle gets excited and leaned out.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Can leukemia cells become normal white blood cells? Isn’t it an abnormal cell?&#8221; Ellen doubted Falma&#8217;s statement.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Cells in a state that can’t become white blood cells are abnormal. However, if it can become white blood cells, then it will become normal.”<br></p>



<p>Once all leukemic cells have been converted into white blood cells, it will eventually remove all traces of leukemic cells. It was described that the drug that promotes the maturation of leukemic cells into leukocytes (White Blood Cells) was a substance called All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA). </p>



<p>T/L Note: ATRA helps the promyelocytes affected by APL develop into fully functioning cells (neutrophils). Thus, it reduces the number of leukemic blast cells in the bone marrow. It’s the most important drug in the initial treatment of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) which is Palle’s leukemia.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so?!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, isn&#8217;t it bad that white blood cells grow too much in the blood, even though it&#8217;s normal?&#8221; Palle had a good argument.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;The blood cells created don&#8217;t stay in the blood all the time. Blood cells have a life span. White blood cells die in a few days. They are destroyed in the spleen. But if that doesn&#8217;t work, retinoic acid syndrome will be developed.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>ATRA, a specific drug for this Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL), had side effects.</p>



<p>The leukocytes, which were promoted by ATRA to differentiate (mature) from leukemic cells and were produced in large quantities, as described by Palle, may damage blood vessels or cause heart failure. It was a rare, life-threatening side effect.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Really…&#8221;<br></p>



<p>However, side effects were common to drugs. You couldn’t be cured if you were afraid.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why. First, drink ATRA to induce differentiation into leukocytes (promoting maturation)&#8221;</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>12.2</strong></p>


<p>Falma held out his right palm before the two.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;In addition, an anti-cancer agent is administered by injection to destroy leukemia cells.&#8221; Palle also offered his left palm.<br></p>



<p>Clinically, in the case of Palle, it has been determined that ATRA alone cures. However, Falma wanted to minimize the risk of recurrence by combining ATRA with anti-cancer agent.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Eliminating the leukemia cells thoroughly with two drugs.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Having said that, Falma joined his hands together.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;This is the treatment for Palle’s leukemia. I’ll mention later the detailed dosing schedule.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma thought that Palle was smart by understanding his explanation from the rough flow.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;In other words?&#8221; Ellen asked for the conclusion.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;That means there is a possibility of completely cured,” Falma replied.<br></p>



<p>Ellen felt relieved and Palle also seemed to have had a little hope. Lotte and Cedrick also looked and laughed at each other.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, you’ll undergo Remission Induction Therapy.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma gave the medicine and water to Palle. It&#8217;s an ATRA capsule.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Drink after every meal now. For now, after lunch&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want to drink it now? Be ready…&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Palle drank the provided medicine. Falma was nervous about Palle’s esophagus.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, the treatment has started. Let&#8217;s go home, brother, Lotte. I’m taking a leisure ride today in a carriage.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma though that a brain hemorrhage was likely to occur if the ride was by horse.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Your bleeding symptoms should improve in a few days after drinking ATRA, but until ATRA works, you need an absolute rest.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;ATRA alone, do you have to take anti-cancer drugs and others?&#8221; Palle asked Falma in case he has forgotten his prescription.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Idarubicin is given by injection, let&#8217;s do this at home&#8221;</p>



<p>T/L Note: Idarubicin is an anti-cancer medicine (Chemotherapy) that interferes with the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body. It is used for leukemia and advanced breast cancer.</p>



<p>Falma explained that Palle should rest, and Idarubicin will be injected in a clean room instead of a crowded place. On the way home, Falma threw an open question to Palle, who was swayed by a wagon in a state of exhaustion.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Brother, do you have a girlfriend now?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you talking about that now?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Because it is necessary information.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;We broke up last week. It&#8217;s my 25th woman, a good woman. We’re too frustrated at each other. Oh, by the way. I&#8217;m using contraception.&#8221; – (he or she???)<br></p>



<p><em>‘I have never heard anything like this, brother’</em> , Falma thought.<br></p>



<p>Anyway, it didn&#8217;t seem to change that Palle had lived a fulfilling personal life. It may be that Palle broke up with her girlfriend because he’s front of death’s door. Anyway, it was Falma who felt relieved since she didn&#8217;t leave Nova Root Pharmaceutical Academy (Palle’s academy) and chased Palle to Imperial Capital. Upon hearing her and her contraception, Lotte, who is on the same carriage, turned red on her face; pretending not to hear him.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go out with her while you’re still taking ATRA. Having her pregnant during medication may cause mutation in your child.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>ATRA was a drug with teratogenic potential. During medication, not only women but also men must use contraception. &nbsp;&nbsp;	</p>



<p>T/N Note: Teratogenic Potential refers to the potential of a drug or substance which may disturb the development of the embryo or fetus.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, you don&#8217;t have to worry because I&#8217;m not there now.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about two years.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>He was forced to abstinence for two years, but he can’t return to his old life.</p>



<p>T/L Note: Treatment of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (Palle’s leukemia) usually takes 1 to 2 years with intermittent ATRA and low-dosage of chemotherapy (Refers to Idarubicin anti-cancer agent). Since Falma is a chemist and not a doctor, extra precaution is needed.</p>



<p>　　&#8230; ━ &#8230; ━ &#8230; ━ &#8230;</p>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;What! Palle did have such a devious disease&#8230;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Bruno listened to Falma&#8217;s report, who came to his study after he had returned from college. The treatment process was also explained in detail to Bruno. Including what kind of leukemia and what type of stem cells and white blood cells. Bruno, who has basic knowledge, grasped Palle&#8217;s medical condition. Much shorter time than when Falma explained it to Palle. As Bruno listened to Falma’s explanation, he became unnerved. In Bruno&#8217;s mind, Palle’s condition was a life-threatening situation. <br></p>



<p>“If bleeding occurs, there is a probability that brother may not see tomorrow. It was a moment-sensitive situation, so Palle is already in the treatment of taking ATRA.” Falma continued.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;If we get bleeding, we will not know tomorrow&#8217;s life. We have been in the process of taking time, so we are already in the process of taking ATRA.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; I knew I had such a blood disease but&#8230; Palle looked fine.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Please leave it to me.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh. I am rest assured since you’re in charge of Palle’s treatment.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>As a father, and as one of the pharmacists to suppress the desire to take charge the treatment of his beloved son. Bruno entrusted Palle’s treatment to Falma. That way, the probability of Palle’s survival increased.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Is there anything I can do? Is there anything I should prepare? Is there a need for my hands? I’ll do anything.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;There is. Please allow collecting blood from our servants who have the same type of blood as brother. It can be used for the blood transfusion to compensate for missing platelets and blood coagulation factors. It may not be used, but it is better to be prepared.&#8221;<br></p>



<p><em>‘If you transfuse my blood outside, I don’t know what will happen…’ </em>Falma thought.<br></p>



<p>It was a serious problem. The worst, shock would be the cause of Palle’s death. Blood transfusions from Bruno couldn’t be used to avoid the risk. Hopefully, the blood from non-blood related people can be used for the blood transfusion.<br></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>12.3</strong></p>


<p>&#8220;Blood transfusion from servants will be only be conducted upon their consent.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;And then, if chemotherapy does not work, or if he relapses. Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation may have to be performed. The types of white blood cells on father and brother are very rare with a 1% accuracy rate. In addition, Blanche is also a match. So, if you decide to participate in the transplant, will you cooperate with me in the order of you Father first, then Blanche?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>T/L Note: Remember, Bruno’s stem cell will be given to Palle and not red blood cell.</p>



<p>The probability that the white blood cell types of both father and mother were identical to their son was rare. But in an aristocratic society where relatives weren’t uncommon to be married. Likely that there was a high probability of coincidence between the father and son, Falma considered. Since Blanche was still a child, the burden on blood collection was heavy. Falma would like to avoid being a donor if possible.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. For the development of pharmacy and the treatment of patients, I will not hesitate to sacrifice because their life is precious.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Bruno willingly accepted it. Falma taught Bruno was good at understanding. He always received spiritual support from Bruno.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;What is the recovery/healing percentage/rate of your treatment?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Alternative: “What is the percentage that your treatment will result in a complete cure.”<br></p>



<p>Bruno expected to hear low percentage of complete recovery. Falma didn’t hide the fact and conveyed the information.</p>



<p>&#8220;If an unexpected event does not happen at all, and the treatment proceed as planned, I think there is an 80-90% chance of complete remission. Complete remission doesn’t mean complete cure. Leukemia cells are reduced, symptoms disappear, normal life state will return, that is.”<br></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s 90%? Is it something you can expect so much?!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, ATRA is a molecularly targeted treatment. Unlike anticancer drugs, it targets leukemia cell and is a revolutionary drug that does not damage other normal cells. Even if you go into remission, it doesn&#8217;t mean all the leukemia cells are completely gone, there is also the possibility of relapse. &#8220;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult&#8230;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>“It is difficult. If a hemorrhage occurred in the brain or any vital organs during the medication, then I can’t get my hands on it <br></p>



<p>(T/L: Operate on Palle). <br></p>



<p>We can’t say for sure that I can control the condition&#8230; It’s not a cure.”<br></p>



<p>Falma wasn&#8217;t a doctor and has almost no clinical and surgical experience or knowledge. From his previous career, he was more of a chemist than a pharmacist and was better at drug discovery than treatment. That’s why there are details of disease that he doesn’t know and needs to be explored.<br></p>



<p>T/L Note: Don’t be confuse about Falma’s profession. He’s a pharmacist however in a sense is a chemist because he’s more in drug discovery rather than a pharmacist who supervise the medicine supple chain.<br></p>



<p>Cancer treatment was insatiable and never optimistic. Even if you have the medicine, it is new and may not bring the desired effects.<br></p>



<p><em>‘I will be careful, and patient will devote my whole body to my brother’s treatment.’</em> Falma thought. <br></p>



<p>&#8220;The cooperation of the whole family is essential. We have to be patient and make sure brother, who will lose his immunity, doesn&#8217;t get infected.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. Let&#8217;s aim for Palle’s complete remission with the whole family.&#8221;, Bruno said.<br></p>



<p>As Falma left his room and tried to return to his room, Pallet also went out of his own room and stole the eyes of the servant. He saw a place in the residence of the ‘dé Medicis’ family<br></p>



<p><em>‘Elder brother? Where are you going?’</em> Falma said inwardly.<br></p>



<p>Falma was worried about Palle and decided to follow him. He was embarrassed because the servants are looking at him. Palle entered the chapel at one corner of the mansion. The statue of the Guardian God, Medicine God is enshrined there. It is said that you cannot go to the church because it is said that you cannot go out once inside. So, it seems like you pray for the Medicine God in the chapel of your house.<br></p>



<p><em>‘Brother really is religious and passionate’</em> Falma thought as Palle entered the chapel.<br></p>



<p>Falma followed Palle going into the chapel. Palle went in front of the God of Medicine and kneeled. Falma closed his eyes and prayed behind him gently, passing by, he hid behind the statue of the Medicine God. Then he heard a prayer.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Guardian Gods, Medicine God. Why&#8230; Why do you make me experience such a thing? I wonder if my faith in Medicine God wasn’t enough. My body lose strength. I&#8217;m not listening to anything, breathing becomes difficult. I wonder if my brother’s medicine will work. The more I talk to you, the less I can think of&#8230;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>When Falma heard Palle&#8217;s words, he knew Pallé was refined in front of his family, but he was quite ill and suffering. Cancer treatment went awry if the patient gives up on life. Falma wondered how Palle could be cheered up. <br></p>



<p><em>‘It&#8217;s not me that should encouraged my brother&#8230; It should be the Medicine God.’</em><br></p>



<p>Falma touched the statue of the God while hiding behind it. As soon as his hand touched, the statue glows pale and responds. A statue of the same material as the church’s sculpture responded to Falma’s Divine Art.</p>



<p>Palle was flabbergasted because the statue of the Medicine God in front of him suddenly started to glow.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;What?!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma, who was watching over Palle from the back of the statue, created sulfur hexafluoride with 20% of the oxygen. Inhaled it in slowly, creating a material in which sulfur hexafluoride was created in the round rolled up both hands. And talked to Palle in a relaxed tone.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Palle can you hear me?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>A majestic, low voice came from the statue of the empty chapel. Palle was surprised by the voice and looked up at the statue.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;This&#8230; This&#8230; Medicine God?!”<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I will always watch thee” <br></p>



<p>Palle rubbed his head on the floor. Apparently, if you inhale sulfur hexafluoride; speak out, your voice will be low. It was the opposite of helium gas.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I know there’s no mistake in what The Guardian God, Medicine God does but why did you give revelation to my younger brother and not to me?&#8221;<br></p>



<p><em>‘I wanted to receive revelation like my younger brother.’</em> Palle swallowed up his words.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Thy treatment shall be undone by thee. He overcame the intractable disease, survived, and became a remarkable pharmacist&#8230;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Before Falma finished his dialogue, Palle lost consciousness as he tried getting up. Falma came out of the back of the statue and supported Palle.<br></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>12.4</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Orthostatic hypotension?!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>T/L Note: Orthostatic hypotension, also known as postural hypotension, occurs when a person&#8217;s blood pressure falls when suddenly standing up from a lying or sitting position. Severe drops in blood pressure can lead to fainting, with a possibility of injury.<br></p>



<p>Falma thought of Palle. It was morning when Palle finally woke up. He got up in bed and stands still.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Was it just a dream?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Palle dropped his shoulders.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>However, that wasn’t a dream by looking at the bruises of his knees that would have been only present when kneeling in the chapel.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;The Medicine God came to my dream…&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Palle was deeply moved.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, yes!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Palle recalled the revelation and noticed. The enlightenment of the mysterious Medicine God, interpreting the phrase “Thy treatment shall be undone by thee.”<br></p>



<p>Indeed, neither injection nor blood sampling can be done to one’s own arm. A patient with this disease couldn’t treat themselves. Palle interpreted that the Medicine God gave Falma a revelation so that he can treat him.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;To save me&#8230; The Medicine God told Falma instead of me? So that’s what happened.”<br></p>



<p>After receiving protection and encouragement from the Guardian God, Palle reconsidered his doubts and brightened up.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;How are you feeling today?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>On the second day of his illness, Falma began preparing an anti-cancer agent and injection for Palle.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s getting worse, but I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m getting better either.”<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I saw the results of today’s morning blood sampling. Little by little, leukemia cells are starting to decrease. The induction of leukemic cell differentiation by ATRA is starting to work properly.” Falma encouraged Palle.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Elder brother, how are you doing? Will you be able to practice divine arts soon?”<br></p>



<p>Blanche also put on a hat, mask and apron. Disinfected her fingers, took measures against infections. Came to Palle&#8217;s room along with Falma.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity that I can&#8217;t ditch you guys.&#8221; Palle said he’s strong, but his voice has no strength.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;From now on, we will start administering the anti-cancer drug Idarubicin. We need to remove some of the leukemia cells that are resistant to ATRA. Unlike ATRA which a molecular targeted drug (Targets only molecules of leukemic cells), Anti-Cancer agents are cytotoxic, meaning killing both leukemia and normal cells.”<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Kill normal cells&#8230; What?!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;There may be side effects, be prepared for it.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>After the administration, the side effects that may appear in a few days are nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, bone marrow suppression, hair loss, etc.; said by Falma. Depending on the condition of the individual&#8217;s body, all the side effects might not be necessarily present. Falma told him some people were quite calm, and others suffer. Being told the risk, Palle sighed.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a strong medicine&#8230; but will it work? I can&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s such a medicine in this world.&#8221; Palle, who would receive medical treatment; agreed, but he felt depressed.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Ah. Then, stay calm and rest while taking anti-cancer agent starting from now, also don&#8217;t leave the mansion.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;A long-time captivity?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;No. Not for long, but when you&#8217;re on medication. Hematopoiesis can be suppressed by the Idarubicin (Anti-Cancer Agent). In other words, you are much more vulnerable and susceptible to be infected by all kinds of pathogens because white blood cells are reduced. I cleaned the whole mansion, so it’s relatively safe inside.”<br></p>



<p>T/L Note: Hematopoiesis is the production of all types of blood cells including formation, development and differentiation of blood cells.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Cleaned the mansion? How?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>During Palle’s sleep, Falma developed a plague free sanctuary with the Staff of Medicine God. It was a divine art that kills bacteria and viruses in the air. The dé Medicis family turned into a huge sterile ward.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;How did you eliminate all the germs and bacteria inside the mansion?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;No, that&#8230; uh&#8230;&#8221; Falma was at loss to explain this time.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, it&#8217;s safe inside the mansion. If you really want to go outside, let&#8217;s go out with me.&#8221;<br></p>



<p><em>‘Because the sanctuary around me should kill bacteria and viruses in the air.’ </em>Falma said inwardly.<br></p>



<p>Falma unknowingly created a sanctuary, was like a walking sterile room.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Why with you?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I&#8217;ll accompany you in case of emergency.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>“I’ll be in your care then&#8230;” Palle then answered tiredly.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;You can’t order me around like I’m your little brother, you see?&#8221; Blanche pinched his cheek.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Yep, and you too.&#8221; Palle patted Blanche&#8217;s head. Blanche made a big deal.<br></p>



<p>“Well, don’t hold back, we’re family members. It’s mutual. If I get sick, I’ll rely on you brother.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, leave it to me. Even so, it hurts that I can’t do anything as a pharmacist for around two years&#8230;”<br></p>



<p>“Brother is smart, so you can quickly adapt to the society even if you’re here. Besides, taking your medication constantly doesn’t mean that you cannot go out.”<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Falma. I&#8217;ll be at my leisure while under medical treatment.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>“Ellen said that she would come to visit and care. Then, how about a game?”<br></p>



<p>As Falma has a pharmacy business, it was likely Ellen would accompany Palle during the day.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Let me read the pharmaceutical book that you wrote to kill time.”<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, read, and I’ll write more of it.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>If Palle’s encouragement was to study pharmaceutics. Falma then wanted to hurry to write a text.<br></p>

<p>“But there is only one good thing about getting this disease. Now, I can understand the suffering of the patients who had an incurable disease where they don’t have any experience.”<br></p>



<p>Falma was shocked by Palle’s way of thinking. Palle was totally regaining his positiveness.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;No pharmacist can be a patient.&#8221; Palle, who said so, had a good smile. Falma thought that it was dazzling.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Everything is needed to be studied.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do our best together, brother.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma took turns sleeping in Pallé&#8217;s room with Bruno. It was to cope with sudden changes. It was the 4th day of Remission Induction Treatment with ATRA and Idarubicin (Anti-Cancer Agent). In the middle of the night, Falma woke up with a bad premonition. When Falma came to Palle’s room, something wrong happened with Palle’s breathing. He was in pain.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Brother!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma panicked and soon, used his diagnosis eye. Light was visible in Palle’s both lungs.<br></p>



<p>(Got it&#8230;!)<br></p>



<p>The side effects of ATRA (All-Trans Retinoic Acid) have appeared. As Palle was concerned, large numbers of white blood cells that were simultaneously differentiated from leukemia cells by ATRA can damage the blood vessels in the lungs. That caused pulmonary hemorrhage.<br></p>



<p>T/L Note: Pulmonary Hemorrhage is an acute bleeding from the lung, from the upper respiratory tract and the trachea, and the alveoli.<br></p>



<p>Pulmonary hemorrhage could cause a difficulty in breathing and could be fatal. Falma put his hand on Palle&#8217;s mouth.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oxygen synthesis&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Oxygen was sent to Palle’s lungs to aid his breathing. At the same time, a large number of steroids was prepared in preparation for side effects were given to Palle by infusion and steroid pulse therapy to suppress inflammation by the white blood cells.<br></p>



<p>T/L Note: Infusion is an insertion of a solution into the body through a vein. While Pulse Steroid Therapy refers to discontinuous I.V infusion of high doses of medication.<br></p>



<p>Falma was scared while treating Palle.<br></p>



<p><em>‘If you can&#8217;t stop the bleeding&#8230; Will brother die?’</em><br></p>



<p><em>‘You may lose an important member of your family.’</em><br></p>



<p>The color white in Palle’s lungs turned into purple. It was a color wandered on the border of life and death. The light gradually became reddish. To call Bruno, he rang the hand-bell that he had placed at the bedside. They needed help.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;DON’T GET RED!!! LIVE…!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Falma shouted to Palle. It was as if he could hear the flatline sound of Palle’s life.</p>
