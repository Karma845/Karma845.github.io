<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Glaucoma and Court Painter Dale</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cutely wrapped box with a golden insignia that indicates the Imperial Family is placed in front of Lotte who looks very nervous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An emissary from the court came to the Different World Pharmacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was said that the box is a gift to Lotte from a certain high-class individual. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s probably from Her Majesty」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a handwritten signature by Elizabeth II in a fine sealed envelope. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「From Her Majesty?! What do you mean from Her Majesty?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It says that it&#8217;s for Lotte from the Empress」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte who was about to collapse timidly removed the crimson ribbon and wrapping, showing a two-stage drawer. She nervously pulled the top drawer and took out what&#8217;s inside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「T-This?! This is?! T-That rumored?!?!?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte was flabbergasted as if she had discovered a new continent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I wonder what this is, Falma-sama?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You didn&#8217;t know?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked at Falma with a solemn expression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d know about it right〜……I&#8217;m just, a maid you know〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte herself did not have the opportunity to taste high-class delicacies. She would even twitch her nose many times together with a gaze of envy each time she would serve the House of de Médicis&#8217;s Blanche and Falma their sweets. Although she would now receive some of the from Falma&#8217;s share, and she is now able to buy them using her own income after becoming an employee of the pharmacy, it is only on the level that commoners can reach. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Arara, Lotte-chan, this is called Praline Chocola〜, it tastes delicious you know〜. Ah, I&#8217;m not aiming for it, so Lotte-chan should eat them caringly」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen took a peek at what&#8217;s inside the jewelry box from Lotte&#8217;s shoulder. Ellen was not bad enough to hoist one from her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Praline! It&#8217;s a word I don&#8217;t know, Eleanore-sama!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Praline Chocola is a bite-size chocolate. It is similar to high-class chocolates that are often exchanged during the Valentine&#8217;s Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;ll open the bottom too」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte pulled the second drawer. What appeared was colorful confectionery arranged in a circle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh my, it&#8217;s Macaron. It&#8217;s sweet and soft, so it tastes so good〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen stimulated Lotte&#8217;s appetite. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ehehe〜, Praline and Macaron!!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte&#8217;s smile was reaching her ears. Falma looks back, knowing that he was not wrong about treats being the best reward for Lotte. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ahh! Can these be eaten? It&#8217;s so wasteful to eat them! They look like jewels!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte closed the drawers that were filled with treasures. &#8220;Haa〜……&#8221;, she enjoyed the remaining scent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You should eat the confectionaries early, Macarons spoils quickly」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma said with a wry smile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s impossible to eat such cute things〜!!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hugged the treasure box and shook her head. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Or rather, Lotte-chan. Shouldn&#8217;t you read the letter from Her Majesty first?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte followed her advice and read them, then dropped the letter after finishing reading it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I-I-I&#8217;mmmmm! C-C-C-C-Court Painter?!!!!!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte&#8217;s voice cracked and almost fainted. For a maid servant such as her, the Empress of the world&#8217;s greatest country, the San Fleuve Empire, is an existence above the clouds. The honor of being requested by the Empress to suddenly become a Court Painter could only be described as a miraculous event. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I-I think that Lotte is an art genius!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma who&#8217;s praised by Lotte in his daily life, praised Lotte back as a return. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Kyaa〜! Oh no〜! Really〜〜?! Am I a genius?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it seemed like an acting, Lotte believed him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Are you going to accept it then? Lotte-chan」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh no〜, I&#8217;m so scared, a court painter……it&#8217;s impossible for me〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I think that it&#8217;s more frightening refusing Her Majesty&#8217;s invitation though. Also, if you want to refuse, then it&#8217;s better not eating the confectionaries」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「PYAAA〜!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte let out a weird voice, alternating her gaze between the treats and the letter. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If, you want to focus on being a court painter, you don&#8217;t need to help in the pharmacy any more」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma said thoughtfully for Lotte who would probably become very busy. Although Falma believes that it is a great honor for Lotte to be selected as a court painter, it is not like he is completely delighted about it. Although it is an honor, it also contains many constraints just like Falma. Also, there is no doubt that her workload would increase drastically. For a job such as an artist, the &#8220;end&#8221; does not exist. It consumes time infinitely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma forgot about himself, thinking that one shouldn&#8217;t overwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I feel fulfilled when helping in the pharmacy. And I&#8217;m very honored with Her Majesty&#8217;s request. If, if it&#8217;s not a nuisance, I would like to help with both」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte answered with an innocent smile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I would try to make you exempted from the work in the mansion at least. There&#8217;s no way that you can do them both」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No, no, my work in the mansion is my duty」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She does not have the consciousness of thinking that it&#8217;s called labor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;ll make you exempted. Got it?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Auu〜, please no〜. My fulfilment〜〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(This, Lotte might be the same kind of person like me) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I must watch her work load carefully&#8221;, Falma increased his vigilance. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4.2</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a few days, Falma came to the palace with Lotte to seek an audience with the Empress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte is wearing the new dress that she bought using the money raised from the pharmacy&#8217;s wage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that Lotte&#8217;s mother ordered such a luxurious dress that is suitable for the audience at a high-class tailor shop adding in her savings. Although, it is about the thoughtful Empress, they would probably be given enough funds to meet the cost. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after Falma and Lotte arrived at the palace, they were guided to the Empress&#8217;s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress was taking care of piled up paper works with her ministers and secretaries, signing them at an astonishing speed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Your Majesty, the new court painter has arrived」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ohh, you are the one called Charlotte huh」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress stopped her work and welcomed Lotte with a smile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte curtsied, raising her skirt and bowed her head deeply. She did it more respectfully and bowed deeper when compared to as usual when she is in Falma&#8217;s mansion. While Lotte is still described as a young girl, her etiquette as a servant of a great noble is sophisticated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes, Your Majesty. My name is Charlotte Soller. I feel very honored by Her Majesty&#8217;s invitation to become a court painter. Also, I cannot thank you enough for the wonderful gift that you have given me」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Umu. Your artworks are the condensation of purity and curvaceous charm that is difficult for others to copy」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It is my honor to be praised by Her Majesty」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress allowed Lotte free pass in the art workshop made specifically for court artists, asking her to make original artworks using ceramics, tapestries, and stained glass that can be made by other craftsmen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You are still young. It is not suitable to ask you too much and push yourself too hard. You should just bring your designs when you have them, and you do not need to make your artworks in the workshop as well」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means that she does not have a fixed quota and it is possible to work at home. It is a considerable treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I will do my best to create artworks that would satisfy Her Majesty」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte received a badge with crossed paint brushes that show her status as a court painter from the Empress and attached it to her chest. From then on, she was allowed to freely enter the workshop. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I was so nervous〜! Her Majesty&#8217;s so beautiful right〜, she&#8217;s like a goddess!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving the office, Lotte let out a deep sigh while placing a hand on her chest. She claimed that she almost fainted with her chest throbbing so hard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Were you nervous? It was quite alright」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma felt relieved. The ministers were also impressed, saying that she acted very well in front of the Empress. Following that, Lotte went to see the court workshop that could be found inside the palace grounds. Falma accompanied her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I am the workshop chief, Hubert. Do your best」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A young workshop chief welcomed them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please take care of me」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many court painters and artisans are creating furniture and furnishings that were ordered inside the workshop. Among them, an old court painter is working on the imperial family&#8217;s portrait with a serious face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「He is our workshop&#8217;s top court painter, Baron Dale」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma and Lotte watched him work from a distance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hm?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The painter, Baron Dale noticed the concentrated gaze coming from Lotte. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「My name is Charlotte Soller. It looks so good, it&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s alive」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte stood in awe of the overwhelming skill. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s nothing, there are many who could replace painters who are &#8216;just&#8217; good」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I could say I&#8217;m a bit good at the skill of beautification though&#8221;, he answered seemingly used to praises. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lotte respected him because it&#8217;s because he has the status of being the greatest painter in the Empire that he was given the honor of drawing the Empress&#8217;s portrait. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You&#8217;re that Charlotte, I see. I saw your painting」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes, thank you very much」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Bluntly speaking, your painting is too rough. I can&#8217;t even find a way to praise it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte who did not know techniques nor studied them did not have any words to retort with, got red to the ears and looked down with shame. It is too presumptuous for her to call herself a court painter, but Lotte is also aware of that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I-It is exactly as you say」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte completely shrunk. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「But that was the good thing about it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, his bright voice, it continued, as though she has dispelled something. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「For all these years, I did my best to improve my drawing skills. I have been seeking for the drawings that are comparable with the real thing. That&#8217;s why, when I saw your work, I felt blank. It was not a masterpiece, nor could be called excellent, but it made me remember that art is free」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What captured the Empress&#8217;s heart was the exact opposite of what the old painter had drawn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He felt as though his life was denied entirely, making him return to his beginning. He said deprecatingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「But, I&#8217;m already old. It&#8217;s too late to challenge new things. I am thinking of retiring, not finishing this drawing, and not offering it to Her Majesty」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh?! Why?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was quite near completion, making Falma and Lotte feel that it&#8217;s a waste to stop now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like the workshop chief heard his retirement plan for the first time, he looked surprised and panicky. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「After all, it seems that, I am possessed by an evil spirit」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a painting done by someone who was possessed by an evil spirit was displayed in the palace, it might call upon a disaster to the emperor. That&#8217;s why he said that he must withdraw from it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please tell me what happened」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it were before, Falma would have taken a step back, feeling the absurdity of it, but since encountering Kamyu, he finally understood that evil spirits really exist in this world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, although the baron proclaimed that he is possessed by an evil spirit, Falma cannot feel an evil presence from him. Additionally, Falma used his Diagnosis Eye, but he did not saw anything unusual. So, all he can do is ask him what it is about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What kind of evil spirit is it?」 </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4.3</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma listened to Baron Dale&#8217;s story and visited the San Flueve Imperial Capital Parish&#8217;s Head Priest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest raised his spirits so much because of Falma&#8217;s visit, welcoming him with great vigor. It is said that the sanctuary would get strengthened when Falma would visit the temple. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thank you for coming. What could we help you with?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I want to ask for advice from the Head Priest」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Advice from this lowly one! Ahh, how honored I am!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest and the other Priests started their prayer of thanks, so Falma decided to get to the point quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The Baron told me that he could see human parts appearing and disappearing, severed heads floating in the air, and the space distorting. Are there evil spirits who do bad things like that? I did not see a dark shadow from the Baron himself though……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please excuse me for saying this, but evil spirits are not like that」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Head Priest Solomon sharply denied. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Normal evil spirits would get erased by the Medicine God-sama&#8217;s sanctuary and any divine arts user would be able to see notorious great evil spirits with their eyes」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That means, it&#8217;s not an evil spirit?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That should be the case」 </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Then, what is happening? It shouldn&#8217;t be brain disease too. Is it just the Baron&#8217;s imaginations? Is he seeing hallucinations from being too tired?) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, I see. It&#8217;s eye disease」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma who returned to his pharmacy dropped a fist to his palm in realization. Lotte reacted to the words disease of the eye. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「But, do those things happen with the disease of the eyes?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The human brain unconsciously supplements the parts that are not visible. You want to do an experiment?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What are we going to do? I, is my eyes sick?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Lotte&#8217;s aren&#8217;t, but anyone could try and experience it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma placed his apothecary badge and Lotte&#8217;s court painter badge side by side on a patterned handkerchief and spread that handkerchief towards Lotte. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Close one of your eyes and look at Lotte&#8217;s badge without moving your eye. I&#8217;ll make the handkerchief slowly move closer to Lotte. My badge would disappear」 </span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/drKQM57/182313.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-sama&#8217;s badge disappeared!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s what&#8217;s called as &#8220;blind spot&#8221;. And, the place where the badge was, what happened to it now?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「There&#8217;s the handkerchief&#8217;s pattern! Why?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That phenomenon. Lotte thought that there&#8217;s something wrong with the part she can&#8217;t see, so the &#8220;hole&#8221; where the badge should be was supplemented by the pattern around it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Waa〜?! I didn&#8217;t do something like that!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s something that you do unconsciously after all. Normally, as long as you can see with both eyes, your eyes would supplement each other creating a complete image」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That means……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte swallowed her breath. It looks like she noticed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Probably, Baron Dale is doing the same thing inside his head. It&#8217;s just, the loss of his vision is too big, so there is a discrepancy in his recognition」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I see……!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Can you tell the Baron to come tomorrow to the pharmacy? It&#8217;s better to heal it quickly」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「He&#8217;s not possessed by an evil spirit but sick huh」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s right. Well, it&#8217;s still a mere conjecture at the moment」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Will the Baron come?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte felt worried. She thought that the Baron might feel displeased being told by a lass to come because he&#8217;s sick, and furthermore, she thought that it might be impolite. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;ll write a letter」 </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, Lotte timidly gave the Falma&#8217;s letter to Baron Dale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He opened the letter and saw a lattice pattern drawn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What is this?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If this pattern looks distorted or if there is a part missing, please come to the Different World Pharmacy.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such annotations were written as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite making a face of displeasure, Baron Dale still came to the pharmacy at that day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What do you know?! Does the pharmacy diagnose patients possessed by evil spirits these days? It&#8217;s better if to go to the temple」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well, please calm down. It&#8217;s a check-up including that」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Baron Dale was complaining, Falma activated his diagnosis eye facing him. And then, the Baron&#8217;s eyes were lit with red light although they were minuscule. It looks like the lights were too small that Falma missed them before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma narrows it down to a few disease names. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「&#8221;Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG)&#8221;」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It hit. It&#8217;s an eye disease, with the intraocular pressure rising and creates optic nerve damage. On Earth, it is the second greatest cause of blindness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Baron, this is a disease called Glaucoma」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What did you say? I&#8217;ve never heard about that」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I named it right now after all」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma used the tools and magnification device that he prepared beforehand and conducted a fundoscopy and perimetry test. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You can see with half of your left vision. Your right has a huge defect. If it was left alone, in the worst case, you would turn blind」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma showed him the result of the perimetry test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What?! Can it be healed? Is there a cure for it? I&#8217;ll pay you anything」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baron Dale was frightened. If he were blinded, not to mention quitting his job, there would also be difficulties in his daily life. Falma slowly shook his head. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Unfortunately, there is no way to improve its condition right now」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma honestly answered that he could not cure it. It also shows red in his Diagnosis Eye. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optical nerves that had once died cannot recover. Although there is a possibility if iPS cells were used, there is no experimental environment and ophthalmologist in this world so it is impossible. Early detection would be the key. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I am going to live in the darkness from now on……? Ahh, what punishment is this……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Baron showed a face of despair, as if he was thrown into the bottom of the abyss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「However, if you use medicine, we can stop its progress」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is that true?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma prescribed eye drops that could stop the progress of glaucoma and lower the intraocular pressure of his eye. Falma explained that although it can prevent blindness, the effect of the medicine is unknown unless the treatment was started. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Let&#8217;s take care of your remaining vision」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thank you. I plan on spending the rest of my life quietly in the countryside」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please make sure to come and get your medicine」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes, I know」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baron Dale showed his gratitude, bowing to Falma while holding his medicine bag. Seeing his back that looked thinner, Falma called out to him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uhm, excuse me. Baron. Can you continue drawing the world without retiring? After all, you are not possessed by evil spirits」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I cannot see the world as it is? How can I continue paint portraits?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had already given up, thinking that his life as an artist has ended. Everything that comes out of his mouth was mixed with a sigh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「How about drawing the transfigured world, instead of portraits?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma had an idea and suggested it to him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「How about making a canvas out of the new world that you obtained?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comforted by Falma, the Baron gained an urge to create art. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「……I don&#8217;t have the confidence, but……I should try while I can still see. I don&#8217;t want to regret」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Falma thought that even if his paintings would not be portraits, it would still have value as modern art. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The completed creation of Baron Dale was presented to the Empress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Baron himself did not think that there would be a value in that painting. Even so, he created it with all of the passion of his soul, using everything that he has to express it. As a result, he presented to the Empress something that could be called the culmination of the life of a painter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Baron respectfully bowed, waiting for the Empress&#8217;s words, trembling in fear that she would disparage his work as rubbish. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress who faced the artwork wordlessly viewed it for a while. And lastly, she groaned once. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「How interesting」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a comment that one cannot distinguish whether its a praise or criticism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I cannot understand this picture, but my heart is shaken. It feels as if I have seen it somewhere, but yet, it feels like a new worldview. It is not bad. No, instead, it might be good」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress&#8217;s eyes were planted on the artwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What she could see there is a painting that has an impact, as if reality suddenly connected with fantasy, objects that are impossible in reality combined, a new kind of art, one that could be called as Dépaysement on Earth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Baron Dale who had retired as a Court Portrait Painter was hired continuously as a Court Painter. He continued to create artworks about fantasies showing a different, dream-like world in his canvas, while receiving the warm welcome of the court itself. Sometimes, it was distorted space; sometimes, it was deformed human bodies. It was an extraneous art that breaks common sense, combining different kinds of concepts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its innovative expression method possessed a strange attraction, it swept the national salon, and became The Movement. His personal exhibition was a great success with customers coming every day to see it. There was also the ceramics and handicrafts designed by Lotte and created by craftsmen displayed in his personal exhibition, which likewise, received a similar popularity. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I am really indebted to Falma-dono. All of this success is thanks to you. I hope you would accept this」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A huge oil painting that has a tremendous amount of price value was delivered to the House of Médicis along with that letter. When the cloth cover was taken off, what appeared was a fantasy painting that seemed to reflect somebody&#8217;s dream world. It was a masterpiece. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「T-Thank you very much. Father will be delighted as well」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its size was huge, so it could only be displayed in the entrance hall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「U〜n, like this……?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(This style of painting, I think I&#8217;ve seen it before. Something like Madrid or Dali) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While looking at the Baron Dale&#8217;s artwork displayed in the House of Médicis&#8217;s entrance hall that was too surreal and even grotesque for some, Falma thought that Baron Dale might have become the one who created the surrealism movement in this world. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was said that from then on, it was so unique that Lotte and Blanche stopped walking in front of the painting in the entrance hall in the middle of the night. </span></p>
