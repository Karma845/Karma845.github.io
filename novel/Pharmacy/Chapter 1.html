<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; &#8211; Request from the San Flueve Empire Medicine Academy</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Two weeks after the Empress declared the end of the black plague. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Although confusion and the aftermath of the plague still remain in the imperial capital, the San Flueve Market was also held with an extended schedule of the original plan, and the scene of their daily lives is returning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">By the way, the wind hole that Falma opened during the fight against Kamyu on the fourth floor of the Different World Pharmacy was closed up in a week by many craftsmen. The crater that Falma made in front of the pharmacy was also fixed by earth divine arts users sent by the Empress using her authority. The civilian houses and stores that were collapsed by the wind divine arts of Nedale Kingdom&#8217;s Holy Knights were being reconstructed at a rapid pace using the Empire&#8217;s funds to hire many craftsmen and purchase materials. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And in a certain day&#8217;s afternoon in a good weather. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Falma is walking at the Market together with Lotte and Ellen. The marketplace is full of liveliness, and there are huge battles to pull in customers being held. The three have already finished their lunch, buying spicy roasted chicken and rare kind of roasted sweet potatoes. Ellen stopped in front of a medicinal plant store&#8217;s tent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Ah, take a look. There it is〜! It&#8217;s also here this year, Navar&#8217;s herbs, it&#8217;s difficult to get it you know〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ellen saw a rare herb and immediately bought it. For pharmacists, this Market where valuable herbs, potions, and spices from all over the world gathers once a year is a chance to buy things easily without the need to go so far to get raw materials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And, there is a pink-haired beautiful girl who stopped in front of the cakeshop&#8217;s stall and would not leave. She is talking to the store owner as if she was having an enormous deal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I will ask once again. What flavor was this cake again?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">She is choosing very carefully between the good-looking baked goods before her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「There is orange and nuts」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I&#8217;m also curious about that raisin cake. Well then, I&#8217;ll buy two for each one!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Lotte is carefully buying treats using the salary she got from working at the Different World Pharmacy. And that, she would bring it to her mother and her fellow servants in the House of de Médicis, so she is buying a lot of those ever since the San Flueve Market started. Falma thought that she was like a middleman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Well then, I&#8217;ll go and take a look around there」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Falma was also shopping while the girls enjoyed shopping.</span></p>

<img src=""></img>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I have a gift」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">To give thanks to the people who did their best during the black plague turmoil this time, Falma has bought each of them presents. Hearing his words, Lotte straightened her back and widened her eyes. Falma gave the girls one bag each. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「The two of you, thank you for always supporting me. This, it&#8217;s full of my gratitude」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A person cannot tell their feelings of gratefulness if they do not put it into words. That&#8217;s why, Falma always reminds himself to always say the words &#8220;thank you&#8221;. Although surprised by the sudden event, the two opened the pretty bag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ellen was given a perfume popular between nobles and royalties. Lotte was given a cute apron with detailed embroidery. By the way, Cedrick who stayed in the store was given an expensive staff with a chic design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Thank you, Falma-kun. This perfume, it&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m interested with. How did you know I liked it?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「It seemed like it&#8217;s popular, so I thought Ellen might like it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ellen enjoyed the smell with a mesmerized expression after she applied on her wrist. Ellen is weak to clear sweet smell. Falma has finished researching that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Oh really, Falma-kun has thoughtfulness unimaginable from a child sometimes」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">(Well, I&#8217;m not a kid after all) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「To think that you can casually give presents to women, I wonder how it will be in the future. Don&#8217;t get into any scandals okay」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But although Ellen said that, her expression is drunk with joy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Falma does not think he could do that &#8220;casually&#8221;, but for him who has traveled all over the world for academic meetings, conferences, research and etc in his previous life, he did not forget to give gifts for souvenirs to his laboratory staff. It is well said that &#8220;presents are better if the likes from everyday life are researched&#8221;, and he is a person who does not neglect to have efforts for such human relationships. He had a good reputation with them saying &#8220;Yakutani-sensei has a great sense when it comes to presents&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Aprons with such beautiful flower embroidery, commoners don&#8217;t wear them you know!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Lotte was very happy and could not help but take a peek at the apron in the bag and let out a sigh. It looks like it is rare for masters to buy things with embroidery for their servants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Does Falma-kun want anything? Let us return the favor to too?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ellen started worrying about what&#8217;s good in return. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I want to give back something too〜!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Lotte also raised her hand after she took a peek at her wallet and showed her tongue. It looks like she used too much from buying treats. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I&#8217;m fine. I already bought what I want. Spices, and also good quality paper」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Falma said that and peeked inside the bag that is full of his trophy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Ara, it&#8217;s true. You bought a lot」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Falma found a good quality paper in the marketplace, so he immediately bought a lot of it. He purchased the paper to use it as a note for his experiments or to write books. He searched for a high-quality paper that can last for hundreds of years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Even so, Falma-kun and spices? Are you planning on using it to make a new medicine? You&#8217;re always medicine, medicine, medicine! You&#8217;re really Falma like your name, you&#8217;re really diligent huh〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ellen was impressed as such, so Falma looked down with some kind of guilt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">(No, it is not for medicine, it is for curry) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Although, he was not able to say that. He was able to obtain spices like cumin, turmeric from the from the Market&#8217;s spice stall, so he was planning to secretly curry inside his laboratory in the fourth floor. It looks like although they have the spices, curry does not exist in this world. It is a very sad Japanese characteristic that they would think of curry when it comes to spices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">(There might be a commotion due to its smell. Rice doesn&#8217;t exist in this world, so I should bake some naan using flour……) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Falma must think of the timing of when he would make it, but it is a secret plan that he is looking forward to. By the way, in his past life, although his main meals are nutritional supplementary food, because there are some things in common when it comes to experiment and cooking, his cooking skills are in a uselessly high-level although he did not practice a lot. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">(It&#8217;s going to smell, so it&#8217;s probably impossible to make it a secret. I should hold a &#8220;curry party&#8221; and make everyone taste it) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Falma thought of hosting a curry party. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">After lunch time had ended, the three returned to the pharmacy, and gave his present to Cedrick who stayed with the reason「I do not have anything that I want to buy in the Market」. It is an excellent staff with two amber crystals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Cedrick-san, thanks always. This, it&#8217;s just a bit of my feelings」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Hou……this is! Is it alright? I know just by seeing it, it is a very expensive, high-performance staff. Its wood is completely made out of Dowall Tree, and the crystal is Fulgan Yellow, its design is elegant as well. It should raise the power of the holder by 150%」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The words that a divine staff store&#8217;s storeowner would tell came out from Cedrick&#8217;s mouth as fast as a machine gun. He showed an aspect of being a staff-maniac just like Ellen. Falma did not know about it that much, so he just placed an order to the store owner saying「the one which is most durable and highest performance」. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「I-It is good that you like it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cedrick&#8217;s staff is not only for divine arts, but it also an auxiliary for walking. His staff is old and has a somewhat lacking handle, so he was very happy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">「Yes, I liked it very much. I must persevere practicing my divine arts with this」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cedrick who have completely supported the maintenance of soil and fertilization of the House of de Médicis&#8217;s herb garden seems to be not good in attack-type divine arts. But even so, he said that he will train from now on since he received a staff with a smile. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.2</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pharmacy&#8217;s afternoon business, Bruno&#8217;s pharmacist disciple came to the pharmacy with a horse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-sama. Can you please come to the Medicine Academy in the evening today? The president is calling you」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Father is? Is it too late to hear about it after we went home?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Falma&#8217;s father always returns home late, during the morning, he would always tell Falma his schedule. But since it is today&#8217;s today, Falma must have been called for a sudden matter that was decided today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eleonora-sama as well」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Me too? No way」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eleanora who was listening to their conversation as if she had nothing to do with it suddenly became serious and nervous. The call from her immediate master seems to be scary for a first-class pharmacist as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I was already planning on taking a look at the progress of Professor Caspar&#8217;s fungus research, so I am going to the academy either way」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma opened his schedule book and checked his schedule. Falma&#8217;s schedule is completely full. The business in the pharmacy, the cooperation to Professor Caspar&#8217;s experiment, confirmation of the construction process of the pharmaceutical factory in Marseille, etc. Falma&#8217;s schedule book is completely full. There are also business trips to the Nedale Kingdom. After that, there are also writing medicinal textbooks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thank goodness」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disciple seemed to be relieved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Was a new kind of disease was found or something?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma asked what he needs to know to prepare his medicine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「There is no need to bring anything」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is that so?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, what is it about?&#8221;, Falma and Ellen could only tilt their heads. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> …━━…━━…━━… </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the evening, Falma and Ellen closed the pharmacy early and went to the San Flueve Empire Medicine Academy riding a horse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In there,  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently only 4 Royal Court Apothecaries that the Empire recognizes (pharmacists that can give royalties and nobles including the Emperor medical examinations) including Falma. There are only 21 First Class and Second Class Apothecaries who can give royalties and nobles medical examinations. There are only so few of them. The Empire&#8217;s passing standard to become a high-class apothecary is very strict, and the pharmacist school graduates would either apply for the high-class apothecary exam while practicing without a license, or become a high-class apothecary with the lenient standard of other countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen, President Bruno&#8217;s number one disciple, who have both talents in pharmacy and divine arts and passed the first-class apothecary examination with just the age of 15 for being too excellent, currently does not have direct relations with the academy. She is the type who would rather look at patients rather staying in a laboratory, so she does not specialize on experiments, but specializes in giving nobles medical examinations before. Although right now, she received an order from Bruno, spending all of her time on the Different World Pharmacy. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are medicinal herb gardens, research building, lecture building, divine arts experiments building, cafeteria, student dormitory, etc that are built inside the Academy&#8217;s premises. Falma and Ellen got off their horse, and passed through the beautifully arranged courtyard that has a large fountain that was making a cooling sound. The pharmacy students that know about Ellen followed behind her as if they were chasing after their idols. There were also students who left after receiving a handshake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ellen&#8217;s, popular huh」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Ellen seems to have a fan club when she was still studying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s already 2 years since I&#8217;ve graduated though〜. I wonder how they knew about it? But even so, alma mater, how nostalgic〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like Ellen feels nostalgic about her alma mater that had not visited for a long time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We have been waiting. Master de Médicis, Miss Bonnefoi」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disciple guided the two of them to the large conference room of the research building. Falma had some doubts about why thy were brought there, not the President&#8217;s Office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large conferences room is a huge room that has a high ceiling and has a chandelier hanging. Many ladies and gentlemen were present. Each of them is huge figures of the aristocracy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It looks like the faculty meeting will begin from now」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen checked inside through the gaps of the door. They were all professors that she knows of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Should we come again after the meeting ends? We will be on the way too」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma asked the disciple. If the meeting is about to start, it would feel bad to call out Bruno for private matters. Since Bruno is the president, he also in charge of the faculty meeting. Professor Caspar is within them as well, I should wander around the campus for a while. It was when he thought of that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No, please enter inside. Everyone is waiting for Falma-sama and Eleanore-sama」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ehh? Is it alright?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hey, I haven&#8217;t heard about this?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please do not hold back. Master de Médicis and Miss Bonnefoi have arrived!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the disciple had declared with a loud voice, the conference room&#8217;s door was quickly opened. Gazes from the conference room gathered at once. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Come in」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh, yes」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma and Ellen helplessly appeared in front of the faculty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You finally came」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno&#8217;s voice sounded. The ones seated in the long arching conference table are the first-class professors and lecturers of the Imperial Medicine Academy. And the President, Bruno, is seated in the innermost seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please excuse us during your meeting」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma and Ellen greeted in front of the faculty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Actually……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno seemed reluctant to speak. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「President」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unique-looking Vice President who has a wealthy belly and exploded white hair stood up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We understand that this is very difficult to say as a father to his son, so I shall」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma prepared himself, thinking of what the Vice President who does not seem to have anything to with it all would tell him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We should get straight to the point. The two of you who have arrived. It has been decided that our academy shall establish a comprehensive medicine department next year. We would like to ask Master Falma to teach there as the chief professor」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes……?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma almost ceased of thinking because all of his expectations were off the mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Frankly speaking, we are asking, would you like to become a professor of the Empire&#8217;s Medicine Academy」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another professor declared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And we would like to ask Miss Bonnefoi to support Master who have many things to do. We will have you named as a lecturer as well」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen also opened her mouth petrified. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many gazes full of expectations were showered down towards the two of them, and Falma thought deeply of what to do. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I have not attended the academy, and a child who has yet to have his coming of age. I believe that I cannot meet up with your expectations」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma thought that it was not an effective excuse. However, he is not thinking of affiliating himself to the academy and become a teacher right away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We know very well that you are still young. However, it can be said naturally in consideration of your glorious achievement. Within just this one year, you have invented the thing called the microscope, developed a special medicine for the white plague, not only that, you have stopped the black plague epidemic by inventing a new medicine. Those achievements that cured incurable illnesses one next to the other must be greatly admired」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not known that the Empress was suffering from the white plague, but it seemed that it was rumored that it is Falma who made that cure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Vice President started to applaud by himself while saing「Marvelous!」, the other faculty members followed him. It was a round of applause. Bruno coughed and seemed to look at them that was slightly distasteful eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「This not a feat that an ordinary man can achieve. You are a prodigy」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「To think that medicine would be made out of my research that could only be described as a hobby, no one would believe it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Caspar also declared excitedly. It is true, Falma had directly guided Professor Caspar&#8217;s research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No, uhm……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Praises that could only be prefixed by huge. Falma who is not used to being seriously praised other than simple flatteries slowly began to shrink. Up until now, Falma has misled the truth by treating the new medicines that he introduced as his Father&#8217;s work, but his Father might have finally revealed it to the professors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(This……it would become difficult to move with this </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma felt very frustrated. And instead, it could be said that Falma&#8217;s Father who have completely supported Falma by making him free to take actions, has finally used his social standing of having a noble title and the academy&#8217;s president, to enclose Falma. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Everyone belonging to the faculty here can proudly say that we have the best brains in the country, however, although this is pathetic to say, we cannot beat your knowledge and new medicinal technologies」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vice President told a pathetic comment. However, there was no one who was dissatisfied to those words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all agreed, speaking out that it was exactly true. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Although we know that this is selfish, but we want to learn your knowledge as the Academy. Things like you being an 11-year-old, or have yet to come of age; we do not intend to argue about those non-academic problems」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma&#8217;s Father probably told earlier in the meeting that Falma is possessed by a Medicine God or something. Or maybe, the rumors or other things had spread to much, that it cannot be concealed that Falma is inhuman anymore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And everyone right now, they have confirmed with their eyes that Falma does not have a shadow. He cannot make up excuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma has nowhere left to escape. However, the reason why they do not ask Falma「Are you the Medicine God?」nor do not point out「You don&#8217;t have a shadow」 is probably Falma&#8217;s Father&#8217;s intention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(What are you planning? Father) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma stared at his father, trying to understand his intentions, but he was unable to read his father&#8217;s expression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma is also a man who has become a sub-professor in a university in his past life. He is not unwilling to affiliate with the academy and live a life of experimenting. He rather wishes to do it for the sake of educating his juniors. However, even though this world&#8217;s medicinal world is backward, it is too obtrusive to have an 11-year-old child appearing in the limelight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The danger that would befall to him and the pharmacy&#8217;s employees is too great. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why, the things that he can only do as a boy right now, is to write medicinal textbooks while hiding the author&#8217;s name secretly. He had thought that it would be alright to be used as standard education in medical universities, since it can be read by anyone, and would last for a hundred or even several hundreds of years. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Falma himself thinks that he would wish to become a type of person who would face his patients, rather than face with medicines in laboratories in this life. He also wants to refrain from being treated as a Medicine God or be worshiped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, his father must have his own thoughts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is an unknown knowledge just in front, and if it can be reached by reaching out a hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He probably thought that all of it must be brought to light no matter means are used. That is what being a researcher is. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We do not wish to force you. What do you think?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma&#8217;s Father faced him and asked with a calm tone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not like Falma absolutely hates to become one. He is just thinking very carefully whether to accept it right now. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hmm. Well then, I should ask Miss Bonnefoi. What will you do?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Me? If it is Master&#8217;s order, I will humbly accept」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno had sent eye contact towards Ellen and checked her beforehand. The only answer that Ellen could say was &#8220;yes&#8221;. Bruno had released a pressure of &#8220;you won&#8217;t get off well depending on your answer.&#8221;. It is Ellen who becomes timid in front of Bruno who is her Master. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You heard her. Falma, what would you do?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well then, if it is a lecturer, then」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a professor is too much of too much. It is too conspicuous. Being a sub-lecturer is just good. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Too bad, but the slots for lecturers, had closed right now. The only post open is a professor」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a newly established department you know? There&#8217;s no way that could be true.&#8221; Falma thought to himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;m the store owner of the Different World Pharmacy so that would hinder the pharmacy business……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We do not mind as long as you will give lectures to the students. You are free to discuss anytime. We don&#8217;t mind even if it is just several hours a day」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vice President immediately compromised. Falma made excuses about this and that, but he was immediately told「we do not mind, please do as you please」. If so, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Well, if I directly raised a student, they would become specialists later on, so maybe that would be better as a result……) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That also has a point&#8221; Falma decided. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the worst scenario, it might be even possible to leave the medical examinations of the Different World Pharmacy to them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If so, I will accept. But, I would feel awkward as a full-time professor. Please make it a fixed term employment」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma said in desperation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well then, please take care of us, Professor Falma de Médicis. Teacher Eleanore Bonnefoi」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Y-Yes……」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just like that, the discussion ended very quickly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And because of that, San Flueve Empire&#8217;s Medicinal Academy has invited a special professor at 11-years-old and one lecturer by an unprecedented personal management. </span></p>
