<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Diagnos and Procedure</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>11.1</strong></p>


<p>&#8220;Letting Falma who’s an apprentice pharmacist became a shopkeeper of a pharmacy? What’re you doing, Eleonore? &#8220;</p>



<p>Palle picked up the staff he released and scolded Ellen while wearing it on his waist.</p>



<p>Ellen inquired what he was saying because she thought he was mistaken.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle believed Falma was, nonetheless, an unqualified apprentice pharmacist. Therefore, he thought that Ellen who was Falma’s teacher had decided to allow him to do as he pleases or executed some irresponsible things. Palle sighed as he concluded that.</p>



<p>&#8220;You’re still inexperienced without a qualification. Appointing you as a shopkeeper even if you’re merely a decoration isn’t a joke. Being a shopkeeper, you’ll naturally confront hard times and make mistakes on managing it.”</p>



<p>Falma and Ellen looked at each other.</p>



<p><em>What am I going to do? Should I tell the truth to brother? </em></p>



<p>Falma responded in an appropriate manner after interacting through gaze.</p>



<p>&#8220;I told Ellen to allow me, do the pharmacy thing as a shopkeeper, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma looked at Ellen.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey Falma … I think it would be more adequate to tell the truth to Palle.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ellen prompted Falma.</p>



<p>Ellen was worried the truth would be unnecessarily tougher for Palle unless Falma could confide earlier. Without concern for Ellen, Palle started talking.</p>



<p>If you didn’t pursue pharmacology systematically, the period of self-taught learning would be more prolonged. Though it wasn’t Nova Root Pharmaceutical University, San Flueve Empire Pharmaceutical University remain, nonetheless, a suitable choice rather than learning from private tutor.</p>



<p>Palle seemed seriously worried about Falma&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I think I’ll attend the Imperial’s pharmaceutical university.&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma struggled while dwelling on what happened.</p>



<p>If Falma entered San Flueve Imperial Pharmaceutical University, it wouldn’t be as a student but a professor; his brother didn&#8217;t know. Ellen was breathless and sighed.</p>



<p>&#8220;As it is, my older brother would you leave the treatment to me? I will explain older brother’s illness after going to a pharmacy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In that case, I will inquire you ahead of time, but what kind of illness do I have?</p>



<p>Palle asked Falma. Falma responded promptly without hesitation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Leukemia&#8221;</p>



<p>The origin of the disease name was based on the first discovery of a German pathologist of the 19th century. Whose blood of a patient suffering from a certain splenomegaly became whitish and died.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it, your findings? Did you even diagnose me properly?&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course that was Palle’s reaction since he never heard that disease. He was shocked to learn his younger brother was clever to create his own disease name.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have an idea about its symptoms.&#8221;</p>



<p>“What’re you doing? The name of the disease shouldn’t becreated without permission. It should be based on the proper diagnosis. Are you operating the pharmacy like that?”</p>



<p>Palle admonished Falma.</p>



<p>&#8220;It isn’t a shame that you can&#8217;t make a diagnosis. There are many unknown diseases in the world. It&#8217;s more embarrassing as a pharmacist to provide it a proper name.”</p>



<p>&#8220;I think therefore the same&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma completely agreed with Palle.</p>



<p>Ellen can’t keep up with Falma&#8217;s drama play. Therefore, she involuntarily put her hand on her forehead. However, Falma never made fool of Palle. Preferably, he honestly respected Palle’s attitude to face the illness. </p>



<p>To objectively diagnose the disease, to accept his death as unruly in the pharmaceutical industry. Falma thought he’s a great pharmacist. He had a life expectancy based on his knowledge and experienced as much as he could possibly have.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Falma used Diagnosis Eyes to check Palle’s current condition.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to the pharmacy, talk longer, and determine a diagnosis based on the procedure. Ellen, I’ll be preparing a lot at the pharmacy. Please come home with my elder brother in the carriage. I&#8217;ll secure a carriage to you.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, why should I come home with Palle? I’m heading home with a horse.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ellen made a face blatantly disgusted. She didn’t want to wait for a horse-drawn carriage, and she also didn’t like going home with a Palle.</p>



<p>&#8220;No. What’re you saying without my permission? I told you. I must go back to Nova Root.&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma decided the schedule without permission. Palle didn’t seem considering an intention to obey Falma.</p>



<p>&#8220;No. Now, older brother would more likely to suffer cerebral hemorrhage so do not ride on horses.&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma, who told his older brother, took a horse with slapstick and went back to the pharmacy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, your brother said so.”</p>



<p>Ellen clutched the reins of the horse and called for Palle. Ellen and Palle’s horse returned to their home as she let go of them.</p>



<p>&#8220;What’s he doing? Forbidding me to mount a horse?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s for your sake, perhaps.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you stupid?&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle couldn’t take it and tried to call back his horse.</p>



<p>Ellen ceased it.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I’ll wait for a carriage.&#8221;</p>



<p>From here to the pharmacy, even if you go back walk on foot, it required thirty minutes to return. However, the ground was getting soaked with snow. It would be cleverer to wait for the carriage than to walk on foot.</p>



<p>“Oh&#8230; I wonder if I should’ve brought a sledge to the horse.”</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>11.2</strong></p>

<p>To Ellen&#8217;s joke, Pallé replied with a sermon.</p>



<p>&#8220;You know what? Why do we have to deal with Falma’s fantasy? You&#8217;re a first-class pharmacist, right? If you&#8217;re a teacher with such a half-hearted attitude, aren&#8217;t you going being single forever? Even though he&#8217;s the second son, he needs to become an independent pharmacist.”</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ll tell you what, I will wait for the carriage.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Damn&#8221;</p>



<p>Ellen and Palle ended up waiting for the carriage. The carriage that Falma arranged came swiftly.</p>



<p>On the way back, Palle grieved over his brother.</p>



<p>&#8220;My brother is foolish; I am depressed. When I die, what would happen to De Medicis Family? What a bad luck. Looks like I cannot die like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>The future of the De Medicis Family was hitherto said to be in the dark ahead. Blanche also hated studying, and Falma was an optimistic idiot; still daydreaming. Palle groaned as he was harboring these thoughts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? I think you’re fortunate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ellen said to Palle with a mischievous smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it pleasurable for you to observe me suffering from death?&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle provoked reflexively but Ellen didn’t mind it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Palle your brain muscle’s good for anything, but it goes against the Guardian Deity.&#8221;</p>



<p>From the time Palle was concerned, he went to the church every day and didn’t miss a worship while he was in the imperial capital.</p>



<p>Even if his family doesn’t accompany him, he still went worshipping alone every morning.</p>



<p>Even if it rained or snowed, even though he suffered from a severe cold; he would still go to church. </p>



<p>&#8220;Why have you gone so far in worshiping the Guardian God?&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, why wouldn’t I? We can use the Divine Art. It&#8217;s the protection of the Guardian God who gave us the Divine Power. You have too little faith in the Water God! Gods will punish you, and you will be unable to use Divine Arts! &#8220;</p>



<p>Ellen&#8217;s Guardian God was the God of Water, yet it would better if she visits the temple once a month and worships. Although she wasn’t a devout. The amount of divine power that’s predetermined by birth didn’t increase merely because she/he believed earnestly. It’s a common knowledge that prayers to the Guardian Gods should be unmissed in the morning or at night, but there’re a few nobles who were easily protected.</p>



<p>In that situation, Pallé was overly exemplary; a faithful believer of Medicine God.</p>



<p>&#8220;Same as usual&#8221;</p>



<p>Ellen smiled happily.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because you’re so enthusiastic about faith, it looks like your Guardian God has come to your side through prayers.”</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle’s Guardian God was the Medicine God. He who&#8217;s born with a heavenly order to become a court pharmacist. Palle was proud his Guardian God’s the Medicine god. No matter how much Ellen made an effort as a pharmacist, she can’t overcome the difference between the Guardian Gods.</p>



<p>If the Guardian God was a Medicine God, Palle could be a court pharmacist but Ellen cannot.</p>



<p>It’s a lie to say that Ellen never thought that she was envious of Palle who’s Guardian God was the Medicine God.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, nothing&#8221;</p>



<p>Ellen made the words turbid. She couldn’t improve it because of her envy.</p>



<p>Because the God of Medicine didn’t reveal himself to Palle, Ellen thought it would be better not to mention anything for now.</p>



<p>Palle and Ellen returned to the pharmacy. Falma secured the pharmacy, standing in front of the entrance, waiting for them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome back, both of you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I headed home with a carriage as you wanted, are you satisfied with this?&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma received his brother&#8217;s coat and prepares two shoes.</p>



<p>By the way, Blanche returned to the mansion before his eldest brother returned.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome to Diversis Mundi Pharmacy, my older brother. Please come inside.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh my&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle set his foot inside of the pharmacy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this&#8230; a pharmacy?&#8221;</p>



<p>The pharmacy included the arrangements which overturned the conventional concept of the pharmacy. Palle was equally surprised by the fact that he incorporated products that he didn’t know how to use. The storage method of the medicine was also different. There were few bottles of medicinal herbs and simple herbs. When he saw the floor plan and the dispensing room on the first floor of the pharmacy, he was impressed.</p>



<p>It was visibly comprehensible, it wasn&#8217;t the result of Ellen&#8217;s guidance.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good guys come here&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma seated on the first floor sitting desk with both Palle and Ellen.</p>



<p>In front of them, a paper was distributed, drinks and sweets were placed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah, it’s a wishful thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ll explain older brother’s illness once again.&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma seated down opposite to them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why would you give me a consultation?&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle was being grumpy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Properly, listen to me at least until the end before stating something. If you&#8217;re okay with that, undergo my treatment.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, if you can convince me, then give me a demonstration of your theory&#8221;</p>



<p>The words that came out to Palle’s throat. He, who&#8217;s a leading student of the Nova Root Pharmaceutical University, was absurd. When the aroma of tea reached Palle’s nose, he gulped it and made himself drink some water to clear his throat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Before that, please lay your arms.”</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>11.3</strong></p>

<p>Falma took out a blood sampling set like a glass syringe, test tube, tourniquet and so forth.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you doing Falma?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ellen, who saw the needle, retracted her hands on the table.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s called venipuncture, a process of inserting a needle in your arm to take blood from the blood vessel. If you&#8217;re scared, you better close your eyes.’’</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute. I am also included?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Ellen asked Falma, but Falma said that he would also cooperate as a healthy human sample. In this world, when examining the condition of the blood, it’s customary to graze the hands to bleed and examine it. It wasn’t a knife but a needle, Ellen was ashamed of what has to be done. It’s also the same for Palle.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can take my blood afterwards, but you cannot collect blood yourself, so please cooperate.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Falma, do you have experience and technique to perform that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have, so be at ease.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was splendid to be a skilled pharmaceutical in the past life but if we’re recounting experience of blood collection, it’s something else.</p>



<p>Falma wrapped a tourniquet on Palle’s upper arm and let the vein float up and quickly pierce the needle. His blood vessel was difficult to see, so Falma hastily wiped the skin with alcohol cotton. After effacing it with alcohol cotton, his blood vessel was now easy to see. </p>



<p>&#8220;However, since I have no experience on doing it human, you might call it an animal experiment,&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma whispered unconsciously.</p>



<p>Ethically, Falma know pharmacists shouldn’t collect human blood themselves. Since the Palle’s condition may deteriorate and cerebral hemorrhage may occur at any moment. It wasn’t the case of the four or five saying. There’s no choice but to do it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, stop! Don’t compel me as your laboratory experiment!&#8221;</p>



<p>When Palle overheard that, he panicked and tried to stand up, but Falma had already finished extracting the blood and pulled out the needle quickly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m done, do you feel numbness?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a momentary event. Falma put the blood sample in a test tube containing anticoagulant. Ellen, who was reluctant, agreed to blood sampling as he saw at Palle’s reaction.</p>



<p>Falma dropped a drop of blood from a syringe into a glass slide and spread it with a thin glass instead of a cover glass. Immediately swinging with both ends of the glass slide and dry. It was immersed in a glass container containing a kind of alcohol called methanol.</p>



<p>&#8220;What’s the purpose of undertaking that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fixing and sticking the blood cell component to the glass, preventing it from deteriorating&#8221;</p>



<p>Ellen&#8217;s blood was also attached to the glass slide and treated in the same way.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s observe in this state. Brother, can you examine your own blood?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, it’s microscopic.&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle sniffed at his best. His pride as an elder brother and a Nova Root graduated began to immerge.</p>



<p>&#8220;That was excellent, you should have identified various shapes of particles.&#8221;</p>



<p>If it weren’t for the single microscope made by Falma, Palle wouldn’t believe the fact that a blood contained a particle called a cell. But now he had no choice but to believe because he himself observed it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I saw something different from other sample I’ve seen in the past.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Open the text to page 10, Wasn&#8217;t the particle like that?&#8221;</p>



<p>Page 10 of the distributed text had been drawn many illustrations of round particles. Ellen and Palle&#8217;s text in hand was exactly the same. For the hand-written transcript, it’s a precise sketch and even the delicate structures were drawn. Palle was impressed. Indeed, it was drawn exactly as it seemed to be on the microscope.</p>



<p>To establish the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Imperial Pharmaceutical University, it’s effective to generate a text and reproduced it on a mimeograph.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a moment. How did you see such a detailed structure?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can identify it under a microscope with a high magnification.&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma swiftly put out a microscope from the box in front of Palle and Ellen. It was a dual optical microscope made of brass which has a magnification of 500 times by a quality lens that asked the honor of Melody.</p>



<p>T/N: Refer to Compound Light Microscope or Optical Microscope which uses visible light and a system of lenses to magnify images of small objects. (Wikipedia)</p>



<p>A mirror was set under the stage (the platform where glass slide is placed), and a light-collecting function’s also attached. </p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, what is this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a compound microscope that makes the lens part of the single microscope look even larger and enlarged.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why do you possess that?! Did father purchased it for you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle believed and didn’t doubt that Falma ordered a splendid one with Bruno &#8211; the president of the Imperial School of Pharmaceutical School.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, there are various things.&#8221;</p>



<p>In fact, it was made by a craftsman based on Falma’s blueprint but he kept it vague because the story wouldn’t progress for the moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Incidentally, what do you think a blood is carrying over the whole body?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nutrition&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle thought a little and answered. The four-body-fluid theory that human body fluid was made up of four pieces of blood, mucus, yellow bile, black bile. This was taught by Nova Root Pharmaceutical University. It was equally known that separating into clear supernatant and reddish black sediment, leaving blood in a container. Blood was thought to have been cleanly purified by the spleen. It has been taught that the balance of this body fluid was broken by evil spirits, and people get sick.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Nutrition, then oxygen that is brought into the body by breathing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle also knew the element called oxygen.</p>



<p>&#8220;Blood is largely divided into blood cell components, plasma components, and other ingredients. Red blood cells that cause red blood to look red&#8230; These are the particles that play a role of carrying oxygen to the corners of the body. </p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>11.4</strong></p>

<p>Colorless white blood cells&#8230; These are the particles that kill bacteria or are related to immunity. Oh, I will explain the immune on another occasion. And platelets&#8230; A particle that coagulates blood and stops bleeding.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ellen nodded and read the text. After she finished reading it, she was impressed by the results of Falma&#8217;s efforts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey! That&#8217;s right, it looks like a red liquid, and it’s amazing!&#8221;</p>



<p>Lotte strikes with an exact timing.</p>



<p>Cedric and Lotte also listened to the lecture with the text in hand from a little distance.</p>



<p>&#8220;These particles are called cells. Not just blood components, every living thing has a structure called a cell.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>By microscopic observation, Palle knew that every piece of tissue certainly had a structure. Whether it be a plant or an animal, just like a small room according to Falma. He also considered it in his thesis experiment.</p>



<p>Even though it was said that living things were made up of cells, it’s still convincing.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, the origin of the blood that makes up each component of a wide variety of blood is only one type.&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma pointed to the particle drawn on the most upstream in the various blood components being drawn.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s called hematopoietic stem cells, cells that produce blood. The stem cells produce red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and other blood elements”</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmmm&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle listened and thought that it would be good idea to make a fiction out of what Falma said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, listening to the story, what do you think is the reason why the bleeding of older brother has become difficult to stop?”</p>



<p>Falma asked questions to Palle.</p>



<p>Palle decided to play along with Falma. The cause was that it’s easy to bleed from the gums. The blood was difficult to stop, and it’s easy to cause a bruise.</p>



<p>&#8220;Platelets&#8230; The particles that should stop the bleeding, are no longer functioning?</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma nodded greatly. Looks like his elder brother swallowed well the information.</p>



<p>&#8220;An abnormality in the route matures from each hematopoietic stem cell to each blood component, and in the case of older brother, it creates neutrophils (a kind of white blood cells)&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t get it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle pointed out quickly.</p>



<p>&#8220;If that’s the case, why would the particles be reduced? Is it the root particle that’s causing abnormality? Is the root of making platelets and red blood cells, and the root of making other types of red blood cells and white blood cells safe?&#8221; (Refers to bone marrow)</p>



<p>He was an excellent older brother who absorbs knowledge quickly and argued against it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Unusual leukemia cells will increase indefinitely. They are produced in the hematopoietic locations which are the bone marrow. The bone marrow is occupied and there isn’t enough space thus other cells are produced poorly. Low red blood cells caused anemia and so oxygen isn’t carried throughout the body and breathlessness occurs. White blood cells decrease, and bacteria can easily infect the body. Platelets decreases and bleeding is difficult to stop.” </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>All theories were perfect and made sense. Palle was bewildered due to this realization.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s examine by comparing the blood components of my older brother with the blood components of Ellen, see if what I said is true. It’s problematic to observe because the blood cell components are difficult to see in the transparent state. So, we color the cells. This is called dyeing, but it will take time, therefore let&#8217;s partake of lunch.&#8221;</p>



<p>Falma led Palle to the staff rest room on the third floor.</p>



<p>Lunch was prepared by Lotte and Cedric.</p>



<p>Five people sat around the table, while also chatting. Falma periodically go to the laboratory dyeing work. Ellen was shocked because Palle’s usual talk was nowhere to hear. Palle’s mood established the place. (warm/calm.)</p>



<p>&#8220;This onion gratin soup (soupe à l&#8217;oignon gratiné), warms my body. Lotte-chan, you’re skilled at cooking&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, I asked Cedric to help me! There&#8217;s 8 more to come!&#8221;</p>



<p>Lotte who was praised was embarrassed. She’s recently addicted to pharmacy lunch. At the end of the meal, Ellen and Palle waited for Falma.</p>



<p>Falma came down with a slide glass from the lab to the third floor and began to explain the results.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s well dyed, red blood cells are red, platelets are blue, white blood cells have neutrophils, red eyelids, eosinophils, and basophils dyed blue-violet. This is Ellen’s blood. Next, look at your own blood&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it something that will be dyed so conveniently?&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle, who was half confident and so forth, inspected through the microscope and got a word for it.</p>



<p>Indeed, cells were colored by the process of dyeing. It didn’t mean that it’s properly color-coded. It’s neatly unevenly color-coded.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know that the difference between Ellen&#8217;s blood and older brother&#8217;s blood? You can see a structure like a needle gathered inside a purple-colored blood cell because it is the structure of Auer bodies, which does not exist in Ellen’s blood.”</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Oh, certainly, I see.”</p>



<p>Palle’s voice was hoarse.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a leukemic cell that has become white blood cells.&#8221;</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/zmR8FFH/182315.jpg"></img>

<p>Palle also noticed that Red Blood Cells and Platelets were depleted overall as compared to Ellen&#8217;s. The magnified image of his own blood was burnt to his eyes. He was confronted with such evidence.</p>



<p>&#8220;While we were having a meal, I was calculating the whole blood cell on my older brother. Red blood cells, White blood cells, and Platelets is decreased. The characteristics of leukemia cells were seen. (It will be diagnosed through stabbing/It is true to diagnose by stabbing) Older brother’s bone marrow but there is pain, too, leukemia cells are present even in the peripheral blood. Therefore, together with this result…&#8221;</p>



<p>Palle’s hands and feet gradually get colder with Falma who’s talking about it theoretically without giving a gap to escape.</p>



<p>&#8220;I diagnose acute promyelocytic leukemia.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; &#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ellen also failed to keep words. When Falma diagnosed a patient, he’s customarily using the diagnosis eye because it led to simplification of medical treatment.</p>



<p>However, it’s possible to prove the disease without using the diagnosis eye and convinced the patient if you identify the method of diagnosis. Ellen was confronted with the thought that Falma could diagnose even if he had exhausted his divine power.</p>



<p>&#8220;Older brother will die within a few months if I do not treat this condition.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Falma put his hand on Palle’s shoulder, he got weak and fell from the chair. Palle couldn’t completely disagree with the results presented by Falma.</p>



<p>It seemed to Palle that God&#8217;s knowledge far exceeded humanity. It’s no longer the stage of putting in a mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will explain the treatment policy from now. I cannot guarantee 100% effectiveness. Treatment will be terrible. Still if my brother believes in what I say, and if you’re convinced&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>No trace of the older brother was prideful.</p>



<p>Palle felt as if Falma had become a completely different person.</p>



<p>&#8220;Allow me treat you right now.&#8221;</p>
