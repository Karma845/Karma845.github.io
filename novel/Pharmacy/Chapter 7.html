<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Factory Workers and Group Photo</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Within the 200 newly hired factory workers, 199 of them have gathered as scheduled」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam showed Falma who visited the factory in Marseille the list of the newly hired factory workers. There is one worker that was unable to come for being ill. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eighty percent of the workers are men and twenty percent are women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By their jobs, they are clerical, technical, and manufacturing. In other words, they are common factory workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The production manager must have the medicinal knowledge, so they would be either the first-class pharmacists that Falma hired and trained in the imperial capital, or personnel borrowed from the Imperial Medicine Academy. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thank you. It&#8217;s great that you&#8217;ve gathered enough」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Only Falma-kun would hire these many people at once. After all, some would not be able to do it even if they wanted to」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen said, impressed with how daring and how rich Falma is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I don&#8217;t really get it, but Falma-sama is really amazing〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There might not be anything impossible for Falma-sama to do if he wills it&#8221;, Lotte said with admiration. Although Lotte&#8217;s reaction was exaggerated, she was serious. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Those ones who are able to read, write, calculate, and healthy were required, so I have chosen those who meet the requirements. Each of them is an excellent worker. There are also technicians who have know-how from wine factories」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam explained while showing the worker&#8217;s list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed like when the recruitment </span>in Marseille was held, applicants have flooded after seeing the good wages. Adam held an aptitude test and narrowed their numbers considerably with strict eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;ll go greet everyone」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam led Falma and the others to the newly made auditorium where the newly hired workers gathered. The auditorium was as wide as an elementary school&#8217;s gymnasium, and it is a place that could be used to hold workshops, morning meetings and ceremonies, conferences and so on. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The founder has come」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam opened the door with that announcement and the auditorium turned silent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a stage in the front of the auditorium, so Adam made Falma and Ellen ascend to it, and introduced them briefly. Lotte and Cedrick are not pharmacists, so they watched from the back of the auditorium. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The person here is Falma de Médicis-sama, the owner of the Different World Pharmacy, as well as a Court Apothecary and this factory&#8217;s Founder. And she is First Class Pharmacist Eleanore Bonnefoi-sama, a member of the mentioned pharmacy」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Adam&#8217;s introduction, Ellen also took a few steps away from Falma and greeted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It is a pleasure to meet you」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma also greeted them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(nn? What&#8217;s this atmosphere) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma heard some clamors and felt gazes as if they were measuring his worth. They are excellent talents who possess a certain level of education and passed Adam&#8217;s exam, they are not clueless workers. They possess relatively high pride. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What, really, a kid?&#8221;, careless words could even be heard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam glared towards that direction, but it was unknown who said it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Well, I&#8217;m a kid after all) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it was nothing much for Falma who has a strong mentality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His appearance is that of a child, so he thinks that it is natural that he would be looked down upon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam seemed to be pissed off with his master being slighted although he&#8217;s a child. He coughed and said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「In addition, it is decided that Falma-sama will take office as a professor at the Imperial Medicine Academy starting next year」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a great smile, he said towards the direction where he heard the disrespectful words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like Adam did not possess high tolerance against teasing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workers heard that and turned silent, closing their mouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An academy professor is the greatest honorary title even among the ranks of intellectuals. It was not something that a son of an archduke could attain using bribes if he does not have achievements and the ability. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere changed from a nominal &#8220;genius&#8221; boy, to a real genius that even the Medicine Academy acknowledges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one questioned Falma&#8217;s qualities anymore. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Everyone, they&#8217;re weak to titles huh) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uhm, as introduced earlier, I am the owner of the Different World Pharmacy Falma」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While feeling some awkwardness, Falma was about to introduce himself, and </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Medicine God-sama!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voice mixed with surprise was raised from a certain group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uwwaaーー?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Falma could not help but raise a scream. He looked at the direction where the voice was raised and saw villagers from Esthark Village. One of them noticed and shouted, and soon after, all of them noticed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he visited the Esthark Village, Falma hid his appearance with a mask, but it looks like he was identified with his voice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The villagers then rushed to the stage and were even about to raise Falma to the air. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Why is everyone from the Esthark Village come here to work?! We&#8217;re far away from the village you know!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma reached the limit of being awkward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Since that day that the Medicine God-sama healed our black plague, we understood to the depth of our bones the importance of medicine. We have come here to help the society by manufacturing medicine」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the villagers said with deep emotion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the black plague reached their village, it would seem that they had a change in the way of their thinking towards public health sanitary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Esthark Village is a fishing village, so Falma thought that it would be the best if they don&#8217;t go too far and make their fishing industry, their main source of income, to be neglected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I did not believe that I could meet Medicine God-sama once again! Please shake my hand!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Idiot, how disrespectful it is to hold the God&#8217;s hand!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What a miracle. Uhm, do you plan on making the medicine for curing the black plague in this factory?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They started to advertise Falma&#8217;s achievements loudly after gathering in front of the stage, so the villagers from the nearby Marseille port also started to make a commotion about what&#8217;s going on. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No, hey, please stop. Let me greet you first, let&#8217;s leave that for later」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen looked at Falma who started panicking from the eagerness of those from Esthark Village with warm eyes. Cedrick showed a kind smile and Lotte did not understand as usual. She could only hear parts of their conversation and could only watch while biting her finger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please come to our Esthark Village. We had made a golden divine statue. We believe that you would like it」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Towards their faces full of smile, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I, I already saw it) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma thought, but could not say it out loud. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hey〜, guys from Esthark Village. What do you mean by Medicine God? Why are you calling owner like that? Is that a kind of nickname?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A local worker who does not know the circumstances asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, please listen. Actuallyーー!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It was like this, and that, and thisーー!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And they, the villagers from Esthark Village, instantly exposed Falma&#8217;s identity. Falma felt his head aching while thinking how true the saying &#8220;you can&#8217;t control what people say; you can&#8217;t stop rumours&#8221; is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And so, he saved us from the black plague」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please look at this, these goods! It looks great right?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people from the Esthark Village showed their goods or what they call to Falma. The golden divine statue became miniaturized and turned into a character, and all of them have one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What&#8217;s that!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are even some who reaches out their hand holding the keychain towards Falma to give it to him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s Medicine God keychain. This, it is really a hot seller」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The villagers made many divine statue key chains as amulets and attached them to bags, made them as necklaces. Falma felt his jaw about to drop. No matter how you look at it, they are starting mass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please, stop that, I beg you!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like the revitalization of the Esthark Village starts with the Medicine God Legend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「How noisy! Line up with according to your numbersーー!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When everything was about to go out of control, Adam made them line up to restart from the beginning. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.2</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I am only a manager and it is a complete misunderstanding about me being the Medicine God. Please do not misunderstand」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma thought that it would be troublesome, so he decided to deny it at least in the beginning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be very bad if it was not kept it unsettled and unwanted rumors spread. Although, the villagers from Esthark Village did not seem convinced. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma restarted and greeted them once again, told them the corporate vision, and addressed a very long briefing. Falma&#8217;s greeting was overflowing with enthusiasm towards pharmacology, so it was polite enough to be too polite, long enough to not forget to mention anything. If it were a greeting during the a hot summer day outdoors, there would have been one or two workers who collapsed. &#8220;If there was a ranking for talents who are not suitable to become elementary school principals, then there is no doubt that Falma would be highly ranked on top&#8221;, is what the students in his previous life tell about him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And so, the Different World Pharmacy will protect the lives of the people of this world through the development of new medicine」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is probably because the greeting was too long, even Ellen was rubbing her eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Falma, after seeing that, to awaken the disrespectful workers who started to yawn or even sleep, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Are you still thereーー!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He shouted loudly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes〜!&#8221;, the workers replied with an eager voice. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well then, are you healthyーー?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes〜!&#8221;, they replied just as eager as earlier. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I am healthy!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma placed a hand on his chest and declared. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well then, I shall ask you. Those who think that they are healthy, please raise your hand」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a monotonous reply, everyone replied just as eager as before. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Alright! I understood!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma looked at the approximately 200 workers. He looked at them while activating his Diagnosis Eye. Each of the workers has name tags where their staff number and names are written. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma gave all of them an intent look, and suddenly wrote numbers on the large paper pasted on the bulletin board on the stage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What&#8217;s with those numbers?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is it a game?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It might be those who have excellent grades」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It might also be candidates for the supervisor. Might also be a raise?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workers tilted their heads to each other and imagined optimistic situations. After Falma finished writing the numbers, he stood with the bulletin board behind him. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Well then, everyone whose numbers are written, please step forward」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workers looked at their company number and the numbers in the blackboard, and those who matched stepped forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hii! I fell!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I passed!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not an examination result announcement for passers you know&#8221;, Falma said inwardly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Right now, those who have stepped forward, they are those who have healthy bodies」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They clamored. There was only a mere 30% who had stepped forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means, for Falma, the majority of them are not healthy. The workers, whether it is big or small, they have problems regarding their health. With the small ones tooth decay, to even lifestyle-related disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workers who could not step forward paled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s impossible, I&#8217;m healthy! I don&#8217;t feel bad anywhere!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma composedly looked down at the man who protested impatiently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You have hepatitis. Your liver has an inflammation」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma coldly told him the cruel reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The liver is the silent organ. He would not notice the advancement of the disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What is liver?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man asked. &#8220;I need to start from teaching the workers the knowledge about the basics of anatomy, physiology, and pharmacy huh&#8221;, Falma realized the forthcoming challenges. After he explained politely to the man what hepatitis is, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And just like that, even if you think yourself as healthy, there might be diseases that have crept up without your knowledge. That is why, you must understand the condition of your body, and do not neglect on trying to become healthy every day. On top of that, everyone, let us create medicine to save patients together」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma finished his greeting speech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current pending task is to make everyone healthy before the start of the factory operation begins. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Leaving that aside」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the mood became dark, he decided to change the atmosphere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyone, please go outside the auditorium&#8221;, Falma told them, so they went out according to their staff number. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What a nice weather, everyone, please relax」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma called out to them, returned to his carriage, and returned carrying something together with Adam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He took out the wooden box that he prepared in their mansion beforehand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-kun, what&#8217;s that?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「This is called Caméra」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What&#8217;s that?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen asked again with the same words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「This is a method to make a copy of this world&#8217;s scenery to paper」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma showed Ellen, Lotte, and Cedrick a small paper. It is a self-portrait that Falma took of himself for testing. He is making a face full of smile beside the window. It was a black and white picture. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「This, is it drawing?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Although it is black and white, what a good artist&#8221;, Lotte proclaimed. And she was surprised how there were no brush marks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s not a drawing, it&#8217;s a picture」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma briefly explained the principle of photography. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What he chose to adopt was the pinhole camera. There would be a pinhole in a box that completely shuts out light, and inside that box that is painted with black, a photographic dry plate would be installed. In the photographic dry plate, a mixture of photosensitive material containing potassium bromide, silver nitrate, and gelatin is applied to the glass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh you〜, if you made something like that, then why didn&#8217;t you took a picture of us〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen asked Falma playfully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No, uhm. I didn&#8217;t know if it would work well, and recently, it was always cloudy. It&#8217;s a nice weather today, so I think that a good picture would be taken」 </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.3</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh you〜, if you made something like that, then why didn&#8217;t you took a picture of us〜」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen asked Falma playfully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「No, uhm. I didn&#8217;t know if it would work well, and recently, it was always cloudy. It&#8217;s a nice weather today, so I think that a good picture would be taken」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not an excuse or anything, it was an honest reason. The picture would be darker when there is low light exposure. For some reason, the picture of Falma&#8217;s room was taken very well although it was always cloudy recently leading to the fact that it was because he&#8217;s inhuman. But Falma has yet to realize that. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And so, let&#8217;s go take a picture. This place seems good」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma chose a place in front of the factory where the whole of the factory could be seen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the location was decided, a tripod was installed into the wooden box after measuring some distances. Falma separated the two hundred factory workers into five different groups. While the workers had questions about what&#8217;s going to happen, the first group was arranged into four rows with ten people each row. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The first row should sit down on the ground. The second row should kneel, and the rest should just stand up」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma stood beside the wooden box and gave instructions while looking at them all together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He got a rough estimate of the exposure time from the sun. Although pinholes have a small amount of light exposure, the photographic plates are sensitive to light, so the exposure time or the shutter speed can be just several seconds. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Starting now, we are going to take group photos of each group. Please look at this box and don&#8217;t move during the few seconds instructed」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were told not to move, so some of their faces twitched. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving the photographing and exposure to Adam, Falma, Ellen, Lotte, and Cedrick settled in the center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Everyone, smile」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The photo shoot was a bit unnatural, but even so, the picture was taken. There were not many photographic plates prepared, so there were only two shots per group. There was no retry even if someone moved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group photos were taken somewhat how it should be. All of the group photo shoots finished without problems. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thank you very much. Well then, you are dismissed」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma asked Adam to distribute the Precepts for the Preservation of Health &#8211; Different World Pharmacy Edition copies made using the mimeograph. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please read that guidebook very carefully」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They dismissed after telling them to wait for Adam&#8217;s summons, because those who were diagnosed with illness would be given another diagnosis and treatment later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving their new employee ID card from Adam, the workers left in small groups. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte and Cedrick helped Falma who started to put away the photos while being surrounded by the villagers of the Esthark Village. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Let me see the photo taken earlier! I wonder how it looks」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen asked Falma. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「How exciting!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotte cheered. The photos were taken while they were making a serious pose towards the wooden box, so everyone was curious in how it looks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You still can&#8217;t see it. We need to develop, process the photographic plate」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen looked fed up by Falma who started to explain the following work while counting with his fingers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Falma-kun, you&#8217;re doing that develop thing, in addition to giving many workers medical examination. The things you need to do increased again, are you okay?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen lamented &#8220;why does this happen every time&#8221; while making a wry smile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Health management of the workers is a necessary thing, because if the factory workers got infected by infectious diseases, the factory would be done-in including the products. Also, we need to take photos of the employees, since we won&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s our employee or not when some suspicious people come in」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That, shouldn&#8217;t you just issue them such identification?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I will, although with photos」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that Falma plans on cutting the faces of the workers from each group photo to create an ID with photo. The factory would use many kinds of toxic substances and combustibles. They must not allow suspicious people to freely enter inside. Falma believed that they must be thoroughly secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Falma and the rest were having that kind of discussion, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s been a while, Medicine God-sama」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A familiar voice landed on Falma&#8217;s ears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the flame-attributed female priest Kiara. She&#8217;s the priest who rode a horse with Falma when he left the Esthark Village, heading to the imperial capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah! Kiara-san. You have helped me a lot at that time」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「N, No, it is my honor」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Falma bow his head, Kiara continuously bowed her head in return. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「To think that we would meet in such a place. Weren&#8217;t you a priest?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma was happy meeting her again, but at the same time, he worried that she might&#8217;ve been fired as a priest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I am the same with everyone from the Esthark Village. I applied to become a worker because I want to train here in this factory. Ah! The training would be very helpful for myself, so I do not need compensation. I will happily serve」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiara is a medical priest and participated in charity service like free clinics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she is called a medical priest, it does not mean she has a special ability such as healing and the like, so it might be better to call her a nurse. She said that she came to train with the temple&#8217;s permission, so she was not dismissed or anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh, training!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ara, Falma-kun&#8217;s acquaintance?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen interrupted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiara acted so respectfully, so it made Ellen curious. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, Kiara-san is a flame-attributed priest right?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You are correct」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiara answered faithfully with hands above her chest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is there any other medical priests who came?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that medical priests of all attributes came to train. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oh, that&#8217;s great! There&#8217;s something that I wanted help with divine techniques」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma had a flash of inspiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought that if there was a divine arts user, the manufacturing process of the medicine could be considerably improved, cutting down the costs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a flame divine arts user is around, they would be able to heat and sterilize the bulk drugs, wind divine arts users can be in charge with drying the medicine, water divine arts users can cool fluids by making them pass through cooled pipes, and ice divine arts users can preserve the finished medicine in low temperatures. Up until now, Falma did not have the idea of using divine arts in manufacturing medicine, but on a second thought, he realized that it was a world where divine arts exist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those abilities can compensate for the shortcomings of pre-modern factories without electricity. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes! Please let us help」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiara looked happy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I am looking forward to working with you. Let&#8217;s increase the hiring spots for divine arts users so we can make shift schedules」 </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several days later in front of the entrance to Different World Pharmacy Marseille Factory, all of the employees were shown the black and white group photos placed in frames. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The factory workers also received their IDs with photos, and it was said that they bragged about it to their families. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Photos are fun right, Eleanore-sama!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The part where we won&#8217;t know how it would look until it was developed makes me excited」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If only Falma-kun would take more pictures of yourself. You&#8217;re such a handsome boy too」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Actually, I&#8217;m not good with photos」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Eh〜, although you&#8217;re the inventor?!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen and Lotte had taken a lot of liking with the camera. They changed places, changed their poses, and took many pictures of each other. Cedrick was forced to accompany them every day, so it was said that his skill in photography increased quite a lot. However, although they have taken the photos, developing it could not catch up with the pictures being taken. They felt bad for bothering Falma to develop their pictures, so they learned how to process the pictures and busily printed them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma was impressed, thinking that girls like self-photos no matter which era it was. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The world&#8217;s first photo collection might be made」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Maybe we should combine it with the mimeograph, there are probably people who would buy photo magazines if they&#8217;re sold&#8221; Falma suggested jokingly seeing how many photos they have. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Before that, shouldn&#8217;t it be Her Majesty&#8217;s photo collection?」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing Ellen&#8217;s words, Falma turned pale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah!」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Did you forget? It&#8217;s impossible to release a photo collection before Her Majesty does, that&#8217;s disgracious」 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「O-Of course I haven&#8217;t forgotten about Her Majesty!」 </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falma swore to himself that he must not forget presenting the camera to the Empress after he returns from Marseille. </span></p>
