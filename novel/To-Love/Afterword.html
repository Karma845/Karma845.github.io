<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nice to meet you, I am Fuyusaka Usetsu, the one who received the silver prize at the 13th GA Bunko Grand Award.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, I want to start this afterwords by saying my thanks to everyone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are quite a few people that I want to give my thanks to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Firstly, F-sama, the editor. Thank you for holding so many meetings with me, whose inexperience brought a great amount of trouble to you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you kappe-sama for drawing the beautiful illustrations. The first time I saw the characters, I ran around the garden screaming like a madman due to how great they look.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, thank you to everyone involved in the production and marketing for the series. It’s your hard work that made it possible for this series to reach the hands of our readers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And lastly, thank you to the readers who picked up this work. This work could only be called a ‘story’ when it reached your hands. Thank you very much for giving this book a chance and for reading this far. I wish that everyone could continue to follow the continuation of the book, too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I would love to fill this afterwords with my thanks, but I’ll get scolded if I were to do that, so let me tell you a little about the story behind the creation of this work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You see, back when I was a kid, whenever someone told me that ‘Love is beautiful,’ I would frown at them and confront them by saying ‘Is it really?’ Yes, I was a little brat back then. Despite that, when someone told me that ‘Love is overrated,’ I would also frown at them and confront them. Naturally, because I was such a brat, I wasn’t popular. I had no love life to speak of.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, even such a little brat grew into an adult after enough time passed. Since then, I always wondered whether love is actually beautiful or overrated? I managed to come into an answer after years of pondering and experiencing a lot of things. ‘It depends.’ Yes, what a perfect answer. Despite being an adult, I’m still immature as a brat, I know. Even people who are still in school are probably more mature than me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, since I’m such a little brat, I made my answer to a story. I wish that this story could reach the people who need it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The story is about a protagonist who is struggling with love. His journey is all about seeking an answer to his questions about love. I sincerely hope you’ll be able to enjoy this story.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">TL: Well, that’s it for the first book. What do you think? Honestly, I think it’s pretty good so far. The characters are charming and pretty memorable. The story isn’t something revolutionary or anything, but the author made some nice twists here and there. Well, it’s still the first book, so I don’t really have much to say about it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the next volume, I still don’t have the raw yet, so sorry, but you have to wait for a bit. In the meantime, I’ll be working on my other project, a new one since I got the raw of the series already. Stay tuned for the news.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I appreciate it if you were to leave a review and rate the series on NU. Doesn’t have to be favorable, just tell me your honest impression!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, thanks for reading! See you later!
