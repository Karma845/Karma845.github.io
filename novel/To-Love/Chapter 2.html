<h2>Chapter 2: The Most Important Work For a Butler is to Embarrass His Beloved Princess</h2>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“…Mmm, ~~~~~~~~”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>Lying on the bed, Princess Krell hugged her pillow with all her might and let out an inarticulate scream, writhing in agony. She’s breathing slowly in a three-beat rhythm to try to alleviate the pain, but that’s a breathing method pregnant women use to mitigate pain. Of course, Princess Krell is definitely not in labor. So I’d appreciate it if she stopped.  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>I stared fixedly at my master twisting in pain on the bed, searing that sight into my eyes and memory, and called out to her.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“How is it, Princess Krell?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“How… can you say that… and…”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>Looking at me with a bright red face and a teardrop floating on her eyelashes, the princess’s expression grabbed my heart. Her usually graceful face, shining like a diamond freshly cut, is now like a withered flower from the unbearable pain.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>Cute. Cute. Cute. It’s important so I’ll say it three times.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Sto—Roth! It hurts! Please forgive me already!”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Princess Krell, I’m not satisfied yet.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Why do you need to be satisfied!?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“…”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“You obviously enjoy bullying me!?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“There’s no such thing.” <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“That long pause says otherwise!

Or are you saying, Princess Krell, that you properly remembered and took my teachings to heart? If so, what exactly did those words you uttered before the distraction mean?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>***<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>
<p>“…Ugh.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>When pressed, Princess Krell groaned slightly. It seems she made a guguu sound. <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>Seeing that, I sighed.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Please don’t tell obvious lies. It hurts me a little… as your servant to have lies told by my important master.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>As I smoothed out the wrinkles in the pillow and averted my eyes from Princess Krell, I feigned hurt with a sad voice. Right on cue, Princess Krell waved both hands in a fluster.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“I-I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to hurt Roth at all!”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Yes, I’m aware?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>When I instantly dispelled the tragic air from earlier and spoke, the princess gaped wordlessly for a few seconds, then puffed out her cheeks.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Geez! You’ve always teased me since long ago, but recently it’s especially awful!”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“My apologies. However, since Princess Krell gives such good reactions, I can’t help it.” <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“It’s not I can’t help it! Think about my feelings too!”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“…Does it make you happy?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“It doesn’t make me happy! That’s why you get carried away with reactions like this…”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“I don’t intend to get carried away, but I do want to tease you. In other words, it’s Princess Krell’s fault. Apologize. Go on.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“W-h-y m-e!?”<p></p>

<p>Princess Krell snarled in a wary dog-like voice. While she intends it as threatening, with her cute and beautiful angelic appearance, she looks no more than a puppy. I want to hug her and pat her saying there, there. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you for life.  </p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>A few seconds later, Princess Krell stopped threatening (regrettably) and reached for her right foot.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Anyway, where did you learn to give foot massages?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“It’s a butler’s hobby.”  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“I’ve never heard of such a butler.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“What a coincidence, neither have I.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>As I stood up from my kneeling position, I returned the thrown pillow to its original spot and took out the notebook where I jotted down various notes at the Magical Museum. Of course, different notes than what I gave the director. <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>Reluctantly, our pleasant lovey-dovey playtime ends here. With three hours until dinner, I should advance the talk about the etoile magical key theft notice case for now. <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>I moved to the bedside where Princess Krell sat and started talking while standing.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“About the etoile magical key mentioned in the notice… there’s nothing more we can do.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“You mean to wait until the stated date comes without doing anything?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“That’s how it is.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>What we can do now is just make arrangements and increase security in preparation for the date. All of that is the museum director’s job as the person in charge. We’re merely advising, responding to the question of how to prevent the etoile magical key from being stolen. Anything beyond that, they’ll have to somehow take care of themselves. Well, we did say we’d participate in security that day, so we are getting deeply involved but… Basically we’ll stay hands off and play a minimal support role. If we did everything, it wouldn’t help them grow. <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>But… Princess Krell looks unhappy. It seems my master doesn’t like that.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Despite an imperial treasure being targeted, is it alright for me as royalty to do nothing?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Even if you say that, there truly is nothing to be done. I fully understand your desire as royalty to contribute some power, but doing nothing is the greatest cooperation we can provide right now. If we who know nothing about the scene interfere poorly, we’ll just get in the way.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“That may be so but… it’s vexing. To not be able to do anything.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>Clenching her fist in frustration, Princess Krell heaved a shallow sigh. <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>Since we’ve been together a fairly long time, I anticipated she’d react this way. Princess Krell has an exceptionally strong sense of justice and responsibility. She especially can’t forgive doing nothing when she has power as both a magician and royalty. She wants to help, to do what she can. Such feelings are oozing from her expression but… there’s no outlet to vent her pent up emotions. After all, we truly can do nothing right now.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>Oh well. I should let her vent now.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>I sat on the edge of the bed, looked at Princess Krell, and patted my lap.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Um… Roth?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Right now, relaxing and calming your heart is more important than keeping tense. Come, this way.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“If I want to relax, I’ll drink tea and sit on the sofa…”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Understood. Then I’ll prepare it right awa-“<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>As I started to lift my hips to prepare the tea, Princess Krell grabbed my left wrist.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“I-I’m not saying I don’t want it…”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“You’re not honest. But I love that part of you too.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“So don’t say you love me so lightly.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>Despite her complaint, Princess Krell rested her head on my lap and breathed a sigh of relief. From our long relationship, I learned that when she’s worried, letting her use my lap as a pillow drastically relaxes her and settles her heart. It’s mutually beneficial for me too since I get to be close with my beloved woman. Truly a win-win. It’s outstanding and should be left for posterity.  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>While thinking that, Princess Krell suddenly glanced sideways and murmured faintly.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Once I can’t function without Roth anymore… what will you do?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“I feel like that’s already the case now but… of course, it’s decided.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>While stroking her glossy hair, I smiled at my mouth and told her. <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“The goal is three.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“The conversation is jumping way too far ahead?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“My apologies.

I don’t think it’s particularly strange.

In short, Princess Krell feels confessing words of love to your beloved requires courage, and my love that whispers loving words without any embarrassment must be fake. Even though I say it about twenty three times daily, and have been for some time, she still reacts this way… She’ll turn eighteen this year, so I hope she develops some immunity soon. It’s an age where getting married would be nothing unusual in general society.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>However, that doesn’t mean I’ll stop.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>I let out a small sigh and spoke up.<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“With all due respect, Princess cler, are you beyond help in terms of being a complete airhead?”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“That’s quite rude.”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Which is why I said ‘with all due respect.'”<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; word-break: break-word; color: rgb(220, 231, 235); font-family: Nunito, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; white-space-collapse: collapse;"></p>“Isn’t there a limit…?

The value of words of love lies in their rarity. It takes courage to verbalize one’s feelings when one truly loves. Many people share this opinion. However, not everyone feels the same way.”<p></p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>There are various ways to express love. Some say it every day, while others prepare gifts for special occasions. Different methods, frequencies, and intensities, but they are all expressions of love.</p>



<p>&#8220;The love that&#8217;s timidly and bashfully conveyed with courage is indeed beautiful. Like a young rose, freshly bloomed. However, such expressions may not be possible every day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s also a possibility that the person you love suddenly becomes someone who won&#8217;t return. If you hesitate out of embarrassment and end up unable to express your feelings, you&#8217;ll regret it for the rest of your life. I&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to fail again.&#8221;</p>



<p>I recalled past memories and lightly bit my lower lip.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a very bitter memory. The deepest wound in my heart that I can never forget. Just remembering it brings self-loathing and regret.</p>



<p>Before she could notice the pain that struck my chest, I told Princess Krell:</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I express my love to you every day, so I won&#8217;t regret it. The fifty-eight thousand, seven hundred, and sixty-nine times I&#8217;ve said &#8216;I love you&#8217; were all heartfelt and sincere.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve resolved not to speak false words of love.</p>



<p>Now, has that been conveyed sufficiently? I looked at Princess Krell&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>As usual, she covered her face with both hands, blushing intensely, even up to her ears.</p>



<p>Perhaps because she had lived an unfortunate life until now, Princess Krell isn&#8217;t accustomed to being loved by someone. Even after several years since we met and I express my love every day, she still gets embarrassed like this&#8230; She&#8217;s turning eighteen this year, so I wish she&#8217;d develop some immunity. It&#8217;s an age where it wouldn&#8217;t be strange for people to be married in the world, you know?</p>



<p>&#8220;If you find it bothersome, Princess Krell, then I absolutely won&#8217;t express my love to you anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>After a pause of a few seconds, Princess Krell looked at me through her fingers and shook her head sideways.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Love me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That phrasing invites misunderstanding.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a secret just between here that my heart jumped for an instant.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>As Princess Krell&#8217;s personal butler and head steward of the mansion, I work live-in so I can rush to my master&#8217;s side at any time. The same goes for the other servants working at the mansion, so Princess Krell is never alone in the mansion.</p>



<p>Despite being royalty, Princess Krell doesn&#8217;t live in the imperial palace and quietly resides in a place on the outskirts of the imperial capital with few people, increasing the danger of being assaulted. You could say the status of royalty constantly puts you at risk. She has actually been attacked before, and those attackers now can&#8217;t even walk. As long as I&#8217;m here, I won&#8217;t let anyone come near Princess Krell.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221;</p>



<p>The early morning of 6 AM the day after visiting the Magical Museum.</p>



<p>After getting ready, I confirmed my appearance before the full length mirror and noiselessly left the room.</p>



<p>Normally I wake up at 5:30 AM sharp, get ready, and can start work by 6 AM. Servants must start work at least an hour before their master wakes from sleep and opens their eyes.</p>



<p>Additionally, as head servant I have to wake up earlier than anyone to set an example for my subordinates.</p>



<p>Heading outside to first water the flowers in the garden beds, I turned at the hallway dead end- and there stopped, inadvertently parting my lips.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still too early for you guys to start work.&#8221;</p>



<p>In front of the door leading to the main entrance were three maids lined up.</p>



<p>On the right was a girl with long, glossy black hair reaching her shoulder blades and matching circular eyes, wearing a white headband &#8211; Louisa.</p>



<p>In the center was a scowling young woman with a large scar on her forehead and red hair gathered in the back &#8211; Fallara.</p>



<p>And on the left was a dignified lady with curly blond hair reaching her chest and deep blue eyes, wearing a black choker &#8211; Ligre.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re servants working at this mansion, and at the same time are all the servants residing in this mansion. It may feel like few, but this mansion is small, and moreover everyone here is extremely skilled except in certain areas, so we&#8217;ve never been understaffed until now. No, in the first place there&#8217;s no chance we&#8217;d be understaffed just because I alone am here.</p>



<p>When I stood before the three, they bowed simultaneously. Representing them, the eldest Ligre voiced the morning greeting.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Lord Roth.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, morning. More importantly, why are you awake so early? You normally get up at seven.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We heard the head steward is the only one working starting six,&#8221;</p>



<p>said Fallara, a hand on her waist. Beside her, Louisa nodded.</p>



<p>In other words, they woke early in the morning to help me, it seems. Damn, I didn&#8217;t intend to make them go out of their way but&#8230; they&#8217;re diligent girls.</p>



<p>I laughed with folded arms, looked around at everyone&#8217;s faces, and approached Louisa, the youngest.</p>



<p>&#8220;While I appreciate the thought, fix your bedhead if you plan on starting work.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;!&#8221;</p>


<p>Louisa jumped in embarrassment and smoothed down her sticking up hair. She must have neglected her appearance from waking at the unusual time. It&#8217;s the result of her efforts and not work hours yet, so I won&#8217;t say anything, but still.</p>



<p>After brushing Louisa&#8217;s hair with the small comb I keep on hand, I continued talking.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since you&#8217;ve all gathered at this time anyway, let&#8217;s get through the morning meeting for now. There&#8217;s no particularly noticeable schedule but&#8230; Louisa and Fallara, I want you to go shopping in the imperial capital.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shopping? We should still have plenty of ingredients in storage though,&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>said Fallara tilting her head while Louisa took out a notebook and fountain pen. Their personalities really come out here. Fallara just has an abnormally great memory so she doesn&#8217;t need to take notes.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not ingredients I want you to buy. It&#8217;s a vase.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A vase? Are you going to put flowers in it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, our clumsy young lady went and broke a vase yesterday.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh~&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The three nodded in understanding.</p>



<p>Living together, they&#8217;re well aware of just how incompetent Princess Krell is. Which is also part of her charm.</p>



<p>Understanding the circumstances, Fallara nodded.</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it for now. A vase to decorate the room with. What&#8217;s the budget?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give it to you later. Just don&#8217;t buy anything too expensive, Princess Krell doesn&#8217;t like that. And she might break it again, so be careful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Then Louisa raised her hand and showed me her notebook. Unable to speak, she communicates through writing on paper like this. Her writing speed is surprisingly fast, and the handwriting is beautiful.</p>



<p>&#8216;Isn&#8217;t it better not to put out a vase she might break?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s better to put out a vase. It gives me more material to tease her when she breaks them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Lord Roth, your reasons are far too personal.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Rather than buying a vase expecting her to break it, just don&#8217;t buy one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8216;It is tax money, you know?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;The imperial family allowance is provided for the royals&#8217; living expenses, and how they use it is up to them. I won&#8217;t hear complaints.&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no lawbreaking or anything, so no one has grounds for complaints. In the first place, among the current officials there isn&#8217;t a single person who can complain about Princess Krell. If there is, I&#8217;ll crush them.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it for Fallara and Louisa. Ligre, as usual help out with the cleaning and dressing Princess Krell.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it from me. Anyone else have a report?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I asked, Fallara raised her hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Last night, a meeting request came from the head of the Fragaha Jewelry Corporation for Princess Krell. Looks like he wants to meet this afternoon at three. What should we do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A jeweler huh. He probably contacted us because he wants the prestige of a connection with royalty.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just having transactions with royalty becomes huge credibility. For merchants who value credibility and track record above all, that prestige is something they want badly enough to desperately grab at. We&#8217;ve gotten meeting requests from merchants many times until now too.</p>



<p>But remembering the name of the company Fallara mentioned, I shook my head sideways.</p>



<p>&#8220;Send word refusing the meeting. And if he still comes, meet him with the will to destroy all the corporation&#8217;s credibility.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;? Why refuse the meeting?</p>



<p>&#8216;Wouldn&#8217;t connecting with Fragaha Jewelry Corporation with its influence have big merits?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there some awful reason?&#8221;</p>



<p>The three asked me curiously.</p>



<p>If you say Fragaha Jewelry Corporation, they must have transaction results with dignitaries of every country and tremendous influence and sway. Their assets are said to rival small nations, with that much economic power.</p>



<p>But I had a reason I absolutely couldn&#8217;t forgive &#8211; didn&#8217;t want their head near Princess Krell.</p>



<p>&#8220;Two years ago, the corporate head, Ujiel Fragaha, visited the imperial palace of the Carreralonde Empire and thoroughly spouted abusive language about Princess Krell to curry favor with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister scorned Princess Krell, so that was probably why.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s kill him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m good at cutting out tongues.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8216;Fish food.&#8217;</p>



<p>The moment I explained the reason, everyone&#8217;s eyes darkened as they exuded dense killing intent around them.</p>



<p>I forgot to mention, one condition to become a servant here is genuinely loving Princess Krell from the bottom of your heart. Therefore, everyone here loves and fanatically reveres her like family. So much that they turn thick killing intent at anyone who speaks ill of her, regardless of who they are.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>“Calm down. You don’t need to get your hands dirty directly and sully them. Princess Krell wouldn’t want you killing people.”</p>



<p>I clapped my hands to bring the three back to their senses, and glanced at my wristwatch. 6:30 AM. It’s still early for everyone to start work, but we can finish that much earlier today.</p>



<p>After instructing everyone to get to their work, I ended the meeting.</p>



<p>Incidentally, it seems imperial officials call us, Princess Krell’s servants, her imperial guards. For the most part, that’s not an incorrect perception.</p>



<p>9 AM.</p>



<p>After finishing breakfast and putting away all the tableware, a pleasant tea time.</p>



<p>“Princess Krell, how will you be spending today?”</p>



<p>With a small notebook in one hand, I asked Princess Krell elegantly sipping straight tea from a teacup. She has no particular plans today, so she should be able to spend it as she likes.</p>



<p>There, Princess Krell placed the teacup on its saucer.</p>



<p>“I think there was a meeting at 1 PM today, right? The Minister of Magical Technology wants to hear my opinion and such-“</p>



<p>“I refused it.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Why?”</p>



<p>“Because he puts the milk in the cup before the tea.”</p>



<p>“What kind of reason is that!”</p>



<p>Unable to endure, Princess Krell shouted.</p>



<p>I averted my gaze from her and looked at the flowers swaying outside the window.</p>



<p>It’s a topic that’s remained unsettled among tea enthusiasts for many years. When making tea with milk, add milk first or after? Which timing makes milk tea more delicious comes down to individual preference, to be frank. However, there’s no compromise in this debate, and the members of the opposing factions will never see eye-to-eye. I’m in the after camp, by the way. I like watching the amber tea gradually harmonize and mix with the milk slowly poured in. I even wonder if the before camp has something slightly wrong with their sensibilities.</p>



<p>Well, I had another reason for refusing the Minister of Magical Technology’s meeting. He’s scum who agreed Princess Krell should be driven from the imperial palace. I’ve decided to give him a solid punch next time I see his face.</p>



<p>“People from irreconcilable factions shouldn’t occupy the same space.”</p>



<p>“Did the other party understand?”</p>



<p>“Of course. He yelled, ‘I don’t even want to breathe the same air as those after pouring freaks!'”</p>



<p>“In the end it doesn’t change anything about pouring though…”</p>



<p>“Princess Krell. Sometimes fastidiousness can become war.”</p>



<p>“I don’t understand that.”</p>



<p>“You don’t need to think too hard about it. Anyway, since you have no notable business today either, please rest your body leisurely at the mansion. Going to the unpleasant imperial capital yesterday must have been tiring.”</p>



<p>The imperial capital holds more bad memories than good for her, so it must have been mentally fatiguing. Even riding in a carriage, it was overflowing with people incomparable to around here.</p>



<p>When I suggested it, Princess Krell nodded saying, “I suppose so.”</p>



<p>“Then, Roth, one request.”</p>



<p>“For the ceremony, when would you like it?”</p>



<p>“It’s not marriage!! Um, could you join me in studying?”</p>



<p>“Studying?”</p>



<p>I wondered what exactly for a moment, but couldn’t think of it immediately.</p>



<p>Royalty has countless things to learn, more than you can count. Naturally etiquette, and massive amounts of knowledge necessary as the country’s leader is driven into their heads. However, Princess Krell was treated poorly even among royalty, so she lacks that knowledge overwhelmingly compared to other royals.</p>



<p>If just living a normal life, she doesn’t need that knowledge at all, but I wonder what she wants to study. If it’s something practical… Aha!</p>



<p>“My apologies, but I don’t specialize in studies for fixing incompetence.”</p>



<p>“What studies are those? I just want you to teach me the fundamentals of magic.”</p>



<p>“Love magic?”</p>



<p>“I don’t need love.”</p>



<p>“I’m joking.”</p>



<p>As I returned her quip, I pondered.</p>



<p>To be honest, I don’t think Princess Krell needs to study magic anymore. She’s already leapt into a realm unattainable by ordinary people – I forcibly threw her in – and most of all, her magical key isn’t suited for the magic ordinary magicians use.</p>



<p>But since my master requested it, I won’t refuse.</p>



<p>Bringing a hand to my chest, I bowed once and picked up the wheelchair placed nearby.</p>



<p>“Understood. Then let us go to the study.”</p>



<p>“Please treat me well.”</p>



<p>After asking Ligre waiting nearby to take care of the teacup, I pushed Princess Krell in the wheelchair and left the dining room, heading to the study. Checking the window frames and flooring as I went through the hallway, everything was flawless. The cleaning was perfect without a speck of dust or dirt. Those who love Princess Krell really are outstanding. On the flip side, those who treat her spitefully are consistently incompetent. Well, those who don’t understand Princess Krell’s magnificence, beauty, and cuteness have holes in their eyes to start with. May holes open in their bodies too.</p>



<p>Entering the study, Princess Krell got off the wheelchair and sat in the chair set before the desk under her own power, preparing a notebook and fountain pen for studying, and putting on glasses without lenses.</p>



<p>“I think it every time, but do you need to wear glasses?”</p>



<p>“It puts me in study mode, so I need them!”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“Do they not suit me?”</p>



<p>“No, they suit you very well. I feel intellect and almost forget you’re incompetent.”</p>



<p>“That’s one too many words!”</p>



<p>I smiled back at the displeased Princess Krell, placed the wheelchair in the corner of the room, and stood beside my master.</p>


<p>“Now then, shall we promptly start studying? There are various fields when generally talking about magic. Princess Krell, which field would you like to study?”</p>



<p>Like me, first-rate magicians can teach most things. Furthermore, in the field of magic they specialize in, they can dig surprisingly deep.</p>



<p>I expected something difficult that would perplex even adults, but the field Princess Krell mentioned was unexpected.</p>



<p>“I want you to teach me the magical key basics.”</p>



<p>“Basics?”</p>



<p>“Yes. Seeing the etoile magical key, I thought I don’t know the reasons we can use magic by using magical keys, and other magical key knowledge. It’s a little strange that I can somehow use it without knowledge.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>Skillfully spinning the fountain pen with her fingers, Princess Krell said that.</p>



<p>Come to think, the reason she ended up contracting with a magical key without adequate knowledge is because of me. Passing that power called a magical key to her knowing nothing, that was undoubtedly me.</p>



<p>Feeling somewhat responsible, I nodded saying ‘understood’ and summoned a magical key with one raised hand.</p>



<p>“-Guardian Shield Key.”</p>



<p>Taking the deep blue shining magical key that appeared from empty space in hand, I gently placed it on the desk.</p>



<p>I can’t summon Princess Krell’s key here, so I’ll use my beloved key.</p>



<p>“Magical keys are crystallizations of super technology that can’t be reproduced by modern technology, and are often unearthed from the lower levels of ruins said to be from an ancient super civilization.”</p>



<p>“and…”</p>



<p>As I began talking, Princess Krell earnestly ran her fountain pen across the notebook. Matching her note taking speed, I slowly continued.</p>



<p>“In the past, magical key specialists split open a certain magical key to check the cross section but didn’t discover any particularly mystifying mechanisms. However, it was found that the materials making up the magical key were all unknown minerals, and the materials were consistent based on rank.”</p>



<p>All the minerals used in magical keys holding the First Heaven’s Key rank are the same. Based on the minerals being standardized by rank like this, the current accepted theory is that the minerals also influence the magical key’s strength.</p>



<p>“Unknown minerals means ones that haven’t been discovered anywhere in the world, right?”</p>



<p>“Yes. The world is wide, of course, so it can’t be denied that mineral deposits that are the raw materials for magical keys could exist in places modern people haven’t investigated. If the people who made the magical keys could extract minerals from the seafloor, under lava, or even beyond the stars, that could also be why it can’t be elucidated by modern means. I called them unknown, but it means minerals outside our current knowledge.”</p>



<p>“So many mysteries…”</p>



<p>Princess Krell pressed the fountain pen to her temple and made a perplexed expression.</p>



<p>“Using such mysterious things, I’m starting to worry if it’s really alright.”</p>



<p>“It’s true many people feel that way, but you can’t use magic without them. Between unease and convenient power, people would of course choose the convenient power. And it’s not all mysterious. I’ll explain what’s understood from here on.”</p>



<p>I held up the Guardian Shield Key.</p>



<p>“The reason magicians can handle magic is… Magical keys have the power to connect the contractor and the astral world filled with mana. More precisely, they open the door between people and the astral world that is normally closed.”</p>



<p>While explaining, before me I turned the Guardian Shield Key halfway counterclockwise. Then, as if unlocking something from somewhere, a click resounded through the surroundings. This puts me in a state able to use magic – the key to the door separating me and the astral world has opened.</p>



<p>“A minute amount of mana also exists in the world we live in, but not at high enough concentrations to activate magic. That’s why we can’t use magic without magical keys.”</p>



<p>“A different world from this one… How was that investigated?”</p>



<p>“It’s said to have been elucidated by magicians with Seventh Heaven’s Keys in the past. Seventh Heaven’s Key magical keys hold power incomparable to Sixth Heaven’s Keys and lower, so they probably investigated using that power.”</p>



<p>“Then I wish they could have uncovered the other mysteries too…”</p>



<p>“It shows that while convenient, magical keys aren’t omnipotent.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>If magical keys were omnipotent tools that could do anything, all the world’s problems would have been resolved. Powers that convenient don’t exist.</p>
<p>“Among the things elucidated by that Seventh Heaven’s Key magician, there’s also information about the magical keys’ ranks. It seems seven heavens exist in the astral world, and magical keys connect to one of those seven heavens. The rank is determined by which heaven it’s connected to.”</p>
<p>“For example… a magical key connected to the fifth heaven becomes Fifth Heaven’s Key rank?”</p>
<p>“A superb interpretation. Precisely so.”</p>
<p>While praising Princess Krell, I twisted the Guardian Shield Key clockwise and locked the opened astral world door. Like when unlocking, a click echoed through the surroundings, and when I released my hand the Guardian Shield Key turned to particles and diffused into the air.</p>
<p>“Rather than magical key basics… is this about the extent of what Princess Krell wanted to know?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was very educational.”</p>
<p>“Nothing could be better.”</p>
<p>Taking my eyes off Princess Krell stretching after closing her notebook, I glanced at my wristwatch. I thought not much time had passed yet, but already over an hour had gone by. As expected, when you concentrate, time feels like it passes quickly. On top of that, being with my beloved Princess Krell has a synergistic effect. It seems that while teaching her magic, magic was cast on me.</p>
<p>While thinking that, Princess Krell lightly pulled my clothes.</p>
<p>“You didn’t have any plans today, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I canceled the appointment with that shitty hubb- with his highness.”</p>
<p>“I thought I heard an unsavory way of calling him, but I’ll pretend I didn’t hear… Then, shall we go for a little walk outside?”</p>
<p>“Understood. Then I’ll prepare the wheelchair-“</p>
<p>When I went to get the wheelchair placed at the edge of the room, Princess Krell shook her head sideways.</p>
<p>“I’ll walk myself. I have to move properly once in a while.”</p>
<p>“Will you be alright?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I use the wheelchair normally, but I can run you know? You worry too much.”</p>
<p>“Well, I can easily imagine you tripping over thirty times just from walking a bit.”</p>
<p>“That’s too harsh!”</p>
<p>After apologizing “sorry, it slipped out” to Princess Krell puffing her cheeks sullenly, I held my hand out to her.</p>
<p>“Then, let us go. Princess Krell.”</p>
<p>The imperial capital outskirts where Princess Krell’s residence, the small mansion, is located is a natural, verdant place with little human influence, only having the minimum roads constructed.</p>
<p>In the distance, birds’ singing echoes, and from the nearby brook, the sound of gushing water can be heard. Overhead isn’t the blue sky and white clouds, but a green ceiling made up of broad deep green leaves soaking up the sunlight. The wind caressing my skin is cooler than in the imperial capital, pleasantly cooling my skin heated by the day’s warm sunshine.</p>
<p>It’s the natural healing untouched by human hands that can’t be felt in the imperial capital where stony buildings stand out.</p>
<p>“Nice wind. And the temperature is just right too.”</p>
<p>Walking beside me, Princess Krell wore a cool light blue dress and summer sandals, looking cheerful as she clicked along. Her outfit is completely summery, but the current season is spring. With the temperature drastically dropping when the sun sets in the evening, if she stays like that she’ll undoubtedly end up shaking from the cold. Of course we’ll return before then.</p>
<p>With the sun parasol hooked on my left forearm, I nodded back to Princess Krell smiling my way.</p>
<p>“Indeed. Though unfortunately, it’ll rain this evening.”</p>
<p>“? Why do you think it’ll rain in the evening?”</p>
<p>Of course, since the advanced technology to accurately predict the weather doesn’t exist, there’s no way to know for certain if it will really rain.</p>
<p>So in that case, this is-</p>
<p>“My intuition.”</p>
<p>“Intuition?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But I didn’t just guess randomly. There are dark clouds in the low western sky, and it’s said that cold wind blowing through is a sign of rain coming.”</p>
<p>“Well, whatever the reason, your intuition is often right.”</p>
<p>“Let’s end our walk before it rains.”</p>
<p>“You don’t plan to have me walk for that long a time, right? No, rather, since I’m frail you shouldn’t let me exercise for long periods.”</p>
<p>I handed the water canteen I had put in my black shoulder bag to Princess Krell. It held cold, icy water.</p>
<p>“Be sure to properly hydrate. Even one mouthful.”</p>
<p>“Always the worrywart.”</p>
<p>“It’s only natural to worry.”</p>
<p>Despite her complaint, Princess Krell accepted the canteen and brought it to her lips.</p>
<p>Even if it feels cool, don’t let your guard down. The body is constantly losing moisture, so when going out on hot days, it’s important to hydrate before you get thirsty.</p>
<p>“Fuu… Oh, in that case Roth needs to replenish moisture too. Want a drink? “</p>
<p>“I’m fine, I’ve been drinking since earlier.”</p>
<p>“…Then that means-“</p>
<p>Seeming to realize something, Princess Krell stared fixedly at the mouthpiece and blushed. She’s probably embarrassed thinking we indirectly kissed. But no matter how much I love Princess Krell, I properly separate the master and servant’s canteens.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I have a separate canteen.”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s right! I was sure that we… “</p>
<p>“Disappointing?”</p>
<p>“Not disappointing!”</p>
<p>Saying that, she threw the canteen back at me. Skillfully catching it, I stowed it back in my bag. That throw just now had considerable speed. If it had hit anyone but me, a metal canteen would’ve smashed into their face, possibly. I should warn her not to do it to anyone but me. Only I get to see her flustered concealment.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>When Princess Krell seemed to spot something in the break in the trees ahead and hurriedly rushed over, I lengthened my strides so as not to be left behind. There is… Oh, come to think of it I hadn’t shown her.</p>
<p>I stopped and stood next to Princess Krell enraptured by the scene before her eyes, opening the black parasol overhead.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know there was a flower field like this nearby.”</p>
<p>In the middle of the forest with many closely growing trees, there was a hollow place devoid of trees, as if scooped out. Vibrantly colored flowers were crammed blooming there. Overhead was a hole in the green ceiling, nothing blocking the sunlight pouring down on the glittering petals.</p>
<p>Kneeling by the spot, Princess Krell gently touched the petals of the flowers within reach. Seeing her figure, I inadvertently parted my lips.</p>
<p>“Nothing could be better than you enjoying it.”</p>
<p>“Did you make this, Roth?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Though I just tilled this spot where trees happened not to grow by chance and planted bulbs. With the creek flowing nearby, there’s no need to water either.”</p>
<p>To be honest I didn’t expect it to grow this beautifully. A plant’s vitality is on a different level from humans, I strongly feel.</p>
<p>“…Roth.”</p>
<p>Shifting her gaze from the flowers to me, Princess Krell laughed as if seeing something funny.</p>
<p>“You’ve really changed dramatically compared to when we first met.”</p>
<p>“You think so?”</p>
<p>“I do. In the past… though it was only four years ago. Back then, Roth didn’t have a shred of compassion and was a dangerous person constantly directing killing intent at his surroundings.”</p>
<p>While reminiscing about the past with a snicker, I also smiled wryly remembering back when I first met Princess Krell.</p>
<p>“At that time… everything in the world looked like enemies. I hated everything in the world… I especially considered the country’s leaders like royalty my enemies.”</p>
<p>“Considering Roth’s past, it’s understandable you became that way, but… I still think calling our first meeting ‘Royal Leg-Gnawing Garbage Girl’ was too harsh.”</p>
<p>“I was also quite prickly at the time.”</p>
<p>I behave normally in expression and words. But internally I painfully feel contrite.</p>
<p>Certainly those weren’t words to throw at a dejected girl when first meeting her, especially. I should have tried harder to grasp Princess Krell’s feelings then. If the current me was there, I probably would’ve beaten that me half to death.</p>
<p>“To me, Princess Krell seems to have changed considerably too.”</p>
<p>“Ohh? How so?”</p>
<p>“You’ve grown stronger.”</p>
<p>When I said that, Princess Krell made a dry smile.</p>
<p>“I suppose so… Thanks to you, I’ve become feared enough to terrify many people…”</p>
<p>“While it’s true you’ve gained strength and influence, what I mean is mental.”</p>
<p>When we first met, Princess Krell had closed off her heart. She couldn’t assert her own views, only impassively enduring attacks from her surroundings. She continually attacked herself, thinking everything was her fault, she was no good. Never smiling, she was practically an unsmiling doll.</p>
<p>“Now your self-esteem has risen, you smile frequently, and trouble us by taking action yourself, polishing your incompetence.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you praising me only to insult?”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>Waving off Princess Krell’s question.</p>
<p>I’m not trivializing that on top of being busy with practically no personal time, she causes me more useless trouble. Though I do wish she’d give me a break. Really. Because she’s cute I’ll forgive her.</p>
<p>“Well, at any rate… people change over a span of years.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. We’ve both gro- no.”</p>
<p>As if recalling something, Princess Krell lifted her face and broke off her words, narrowing her eyes at me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>“I do think you’ve mellowed out considerably, but your attitude and conduct toward imperial palace associates hasn’t changed, has it Roth? Especially toward those who scorned me.”</p>
<p>At Princess Krell’s words, I tilted my head.</p>
<p>“? Why would I need to change it?”</p>
<p>“You should! I know it’s for my sake but… please don’t increase the injured at the imperial palace any more!”</p>
<p>“Impossible.”</p>
<p>“Think a little before answering…”</p>
<p>Hanging her head dejectedly, Princess Krell said that, but even if it’s a request from my beloved master, I can’t consent. I have no kindness for foolish scum who made my precious woman suffer.</p>
<p>“Geez… you really are a troublesome butler.”</p>
<p>“My apologies.”</p>
<p>“Nevermind, I get it. I fully understand Roth’s personality and know telling you is pointless.”</p>
<p>“To know my personality inside out… how requited.”</p>
<p>“We’ll prepare a four gram surprise gift for your left ring finger another day.”</p>
<p>“Why does it become that… Also, it won’t be a surprise if you tell me beforehand.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, my mistake. Please forget that conversation.”</p>
<p>“When told to forget, I can’t forget it~”</p>
<p>Princess Krell chuckled, the last sound between us before silence descended.</p>
<p>The wind grew colder than earlier, and faint croaking started from somewhere. They say frogs start croaking before rain, so this surely means rain this evening?</p>
<p>While thinking that and watching the white dove, Princess Krell suddenly said,</p>
<p>“Do you think the culprit will really appear?”</p>
<p>“You mean the one targeting the etoile magical key?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Though sudden, I answered.</p>
<p>“Can’t say either way at this point. As I said yesterday too, there’s the possibility they’re targeting something else while threatening to steal the etoile magical key, or it could just be a prank. Right now there’s too little information to make a definitive prediction.”</p>
<p>Realistically speaking, just touching the glass case instantly brings down that trap I can only describe as a lump of killing intent. How would someone unaware of that steal the etoile magical key? The moment you touch it, it’s over… No, it’s bad to have the preconception that stealing it is impossible. If the bastard who sent the notice really intends to steal the etoile magical key, they’ve surely prepared means to get past traps at that level. They can’t be crazy enough to challenge a hopeless battle if they have no chance. Reality isn’t so sweet that you can force your way through.</p>
<p>“It seems like just having Roth guard would be enough.”</p>
<p>“Naturally. The only ones with a chance of penetrating my protection are magicians wielding Seventh Heaven’s Key magical keys. Even then, it’s questionable whether they could penetrate or not. However, just protecting isn’t enough this time.”</p>
<p>Just protecting once, they’ll probably watch for when I’m gone and attack again. If we don’t capture the culprit conclusively, there’s no guarantee of future safety. We can’t just drive them away.</p>
<p>“We have to capture them for the problem to be resolved.”</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s possible? No offense, but that director is a bit… well… unreliable, to say the least.”</p>
<p>“It does seem impossible.”</p>
<p>I can’t trust someone who nearly killed us by accident. If Princess Krell’s body had been harmed… that director would be seaweed compost by now.</p>
<p>“However, I did tell them to bring in magician guards from the imperial palace that day. The magicians and guards should somehow handle security. The museum side probably wants me and Princess Krell to join as fighting forces, but I have no intention of helping more than the minimum.”</p>
<p>“What will you do if it’s stolen?”</p>
<p>“Nothing can be done. The etoile magical key would simply be stolen.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a bit cold?”</p>
<p>Princess Krell spoke to me somewhat resentfully.</p>
<p>I understand how she feels, but this isn’t based on my personal emotions.</p>
<p>“This isn’t something I should get involved in to begin with, Princess Krell. If I who boast absolute defense helped from the start, they would learn nothing. Then they’d start relying on me every time something happens in the future. I only protect my beloved Princess Krell, so they need to become able to protect with their own power.”</p>
<p>It’s the same as education. If you help with everything, the child won’t grow at all. Sometimes you have to coldly abandon them and make them develop the power to resolve problems themselves.</p>
<p>Hearing my opinion, Princess Krell rounded her eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>“Unexpectedly, Roth may be good at using the carrot and the stick.”</p>
<p>“You think so? Simply put, I’m just unmotivated this time since there’s no real harm to me or Princess Krell. If any harm came to Princess Krell, I’d chase that culprit to the ends of the earth, then burn their body until not even bones remained.”</p>
<p>“There should be limits, so please don’t overdo it even if that happens. Though with Roth here, I don’t think that situation would occur anyway.”</p>
<p>“True. I believe there are no daredevils who would lay a hand on Princess Krell. Because then I’d lose control of the brakes.”</p>
<p>“All we can do is hope no foolish people appear.”</p>
<p>“We can only hope. Well then, shall we start heading back?”</p>
<p>Since we walked while chatting for a while, we’ve come quite far. Looking back, I can’t see the mansion, only greens filling the view from the densely growing trees. We won’t get lost just returning the way we came, but I can’t make Princess Krell walk this distance and time any further.</p>
<p>Changing our walking direction towards the mansion, Princess Krell asked me.</p>
<p>“When do you next plan to go to the museum?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking seven days from now. Visiting again too soon when they likely haven’t made any preparations would be meaningless.”</p>
<p>“Oh that’s right.”</p>

<p>Remembering something, I held up a forefinger and told Princess Krell.</p>



<p>“Next time we’ll eat out when returning from the museum.”</p>



<p>“Eat out? That’s rare. Despite absolutely refusing to eat out before because ‘having another man’s cooking enter Princess Krell’s stomach displeases me.'”</p>



<p>“An acquaintance of mine is the owner chef of the restaurant ‘Lamitt’ in Mifras. They have very delicious tomato stew.”</p>



<p>“Ohh… If Roth recommends it that much, it must be exquisite.”</p>



<p>“Yes. I’ve been there repeatedly trying to steal the flavor-“</p>



<p>And at that moment.</p>



<p>I heard a bash nearby, so I stopped talking and turned my face towards the sound.</p>



<p>There was-</p>



<p>“A dove.”</p>



<p>At an angle to our right, a small white dove perched on top of a thin branch extending from a tree trunk, staring fixedly at us.</p>



<p>Its eyes were red, and there was almost no dirt on its white body.</p>



<p>Wild doves living in forests and such would immediately flee at full speed just from large creatures passing nearby, but this dove showed no sign of escaping whatsoever.</p>



<p>While considering if it was a pet dove that escaped and came to the forest,</p>



<p>“How cute.”</p>



<p>Princess Krell approached the white dove and stroked its small head with her fingertips.</p>



<p>For a moment, I thought the pigeon might flee, but contrary to my expectations, it didn’t. Instead, it narrowed its eyes, appearing content, and even rubbed its head against me.</p>



<p>Considering its friendly demeanor, my assumption was mostly correct.</p>



<p>Drawing closer to the pigeon, Princess Krell turned back with delight and said, “Look, Roht! This little one is incredibly friendly!”</p>



<p>“That seems to be the case. However, there are many birds of prey in this area, so it might become prey before long.”</p>



<p>“Why do you have to say such things!”</p>



<p>“Because it’s the truth.”</p>



<p>A pigeon tamed by humans and forgetting its wild nature would make a good meal for the harsh natural predators. According to my prediction, this pigeon wouldn’t survive more than three days. Perhaps by evening today, it might become prey for nocturnal raptors. Nature can be unforgiving.</p>



<p>“But, it really seems accustomed to humans. It’s not at all wary…”</p>



<p>“Yes, maybe it was kept by a kind person and developed a liking for humans.”</p>



<p>“Or maybe it’s taking advantage of humans who offer it food without asking for anything in return.”</p>



<p>“Stop, that’s making the little one less adorable.”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s not uncommon for pampered animals to take advantage of humans—huh?”</p>



<p>At that moment, I noticed something and stopped speaking, focusing on the pigeon’s legs. It had four reddish claws gripping the branch firmly, but slightly above its ankle, there was a shiny object attached. This is…</p>



<p>“A ring, huh.”</p>



<p>Murmuring the identity of the silver object, I gently removed it from the pigeon’s leg.</p>



<p>It had an ordinary design, with no decorative gemstones or inscriptions, just a regular ring. It seemed to be made of pure silver, so it was probably of considerable value.</p>



<p>Why would a pigeon wear this on its ankle?</p>



<p>The reason quickly occurred to me. Actually, there was only one possibility.</p>



<p>“It seems this pigeon was used in some sort of ritual.”</p>



<p>“A ritual?”</p>



<p>“Yes, well, it was a fad among young women for a while. They believed that if they caught a wild pigeon and attached a ring to its leg before releasing it, the ring would reach their future partner. There was no basis for this superstition, and it was a silly ritual. Anyway, it seems this pigeon is quite accustomed to humans.”</p>



<p>Though I couldn’t understand why people would believe such baseless rumors, young women were drawn to romantic things, and this fad spread around the imperial capital about three years ago. As a result, many pigeons were caught, had rings attached to their legs, and were set free. It became a social issue, and such acts are now prohibited… but apparently, there are still some people who secretly do it.</p>



<p>Foolish individuals who can’t follow rules, it seems.</p>



<p>“The ring will reach their future partner, huh?”</p>



<p>“Yes, that’s the idea, but… Krell-sama?”</p>



<p>I shifted my gaze from the ring in my hand to Princess Krell and was slightly surprised.</p>



<p>The light in her eyes had vanished.</p>



<p>Usually, her eyes sparkled and showed innocence, but now that charm was gone. Her eyes looked murky, as if she had peered into the world’s darkness or abyss. She stared intently into my eyes without a trace of a smile.</p>



<p>Why did Princess Krell suddenly emit such a dark aura?</p>



<p>I quickly understood the reason and slipped the ring back into my pocket, taking her hand.</p>



<p>“Please don’t worry, Princess Krell. Only you will occupy the seat of my partner, and I have no intention of letting any other woman sit there. The one I love is only you.”</p>



<p>“! Uh, well…”</p>



<p>Returning to her senses, Princess Krell mumbled something hesitantly. Seeing her like this, I continued my reassurances.</p>



<p>“There’s absolutely no chance that I would be interested in other women. Since I was born, you’re the only one I’ve ever looked at with desire.”</p>



<p>“That’s quite bold of you to say to the person herself!”</p>



<p>“! My apologies.”</p>



<p>Oh no, my emotions got the better of me, and I ended up using an indecent expression. I should choose more refined words that would be acceptable even in high society.</p>



<p>“I only want to have children with you, Princess Krell!”</p>



<p>“You’re making it worse!”</p>



<p>Her shout echoed through the deserted forest.</p>



<p>Choosing elegant words is quite difficult.</p>



<p>While contemplating that, I continued to express my love to Princess Krell as usual. In the meantime, the pigeon had flown away from the branch without me noticing.</p>
