<h2>Chapter 3: The Princess Who Drank Poison is Destined to be Saved by the Prince’s Kiss after Seven Days</h2>



<p>With seven days left until the announced date.</p>



<p>“I contacted the imperial palace but…how are the security arrangements going, Director?”</p>



<p>In the director’s office of the Magic Museum.</p>



<p>While standing behind Princess Krell sitting on the sofa, I asked Director Strom Clayburn facing us across the desk.</p>



<p>With the announced date of the crime approaching, surely they haven’t taken no preventative measures. But with this guy, I can’t help but feel a little uneasy. Really.</p>



<p>Although I had some concerns about the director’s competence, unexpectedly, the director smiled contentedly.</p>



<p>“Of course, it’s perfect. When I requested it, the imperial palace agreed to dispatch twenty of their imperial mages on the day. Also, I’ve increased the number of resident security guards, and security around the ‘Magic Key Room’ in particular is even more robust.”</p>



<p>“Well, I suppose you could say it’s excellent work. If I were greedy, I would want fifty imperial mages for maximum security, but I can’t complain. Let’s deal with twenty mages and the resident guards.”</p>



<p>This museum is very large, so ideally I wanted to place more manpower both outside and inside. Since unforeseen situations arise unexpectedly, in order to respond to any situation, the more people the better. I’m scheduled to help with security on the day too, but…I’d rather not get too involved.</p>



<p>While voicing dissatisfaction internally, I continued asking the director.</p>



<p>“Has anything unusual happened inside or outside the museum? Even small things are fine.”</p>



<p>“No, nothing in particular. The museum continues to be open as usual, and we haven’t limited the number of visitors. It’s completely normal.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>I cupped my chin in thought.</p>



<p>I figured they would take some kind of action beforehand, but it seems my prediction was off. Normally when committing some kind of crime, you’d scout the location and check escape routes, I’d think… Or maybe they already finished their preliminaries without anyone noticing or getting suspicious. Can’t rule out that possibility either.</p>



<p>While organizing my thoughts internally, the director suddenly made an anxious face.</p>



<p>“However,”</p>



<p>“Did something change?”</p>



<p>I immediately asked, and after a pause, the director said this.</p>



<p>“Lately, my daughter has been ignoring me.”</p>



<p>“Don’t care.”</p>



<p>I immediately replied to his trivial concern. What, his daughter isn’t talking to him? Definitely unrelated to this case.</p>



<p>However, ignoring my words (annoyingly), the director continued.</p>



<p>“She’s turning fourteen this year but…I don’t remember doing anything to make her hate me, and I have no idea what’s causing this.”</p>



<p>“……”</p>



<p>I desperately suppressed the urge to jab my fist into the back of the director’s head.</p>



<p>Fourteen years old is a rebellious adolescence. She’s in transition between child and adult, so she’s just a little mentally unstable. It’s the so-called rebellious phase, and she’ll settle down on her own after a while, so wait it out patiently.</p>



<p>“Are you sure twenty people is enough…? I’m starting to get worried.”</p>



<p>If this guy is the director, I should’ve asked for at least a hundred people rather than fifty.</p>



<p>Glancing back at me with a troubled expression after observing the situation silently, Princess Krell tilted her head cutely. Ah, adorable.</p>



<p>“Isn’t twenty mages enough?”</p>



<p>“It’s enough, but the more people the better for security. And the director is like this too… Besides, since it’s an important national treasure being targeted, you shouldn’t hesitate to commit manpower. Did the prime minister request this, by any chance?”</p>



<p>“Yes. This is the maximum number of people he can lend.”</p>



<p>“That trash…”</p>



<p>I pictured the unpleasant face of the prime minister in my memory, filled with the urge to smash my real fist into it. What does he mean by maximum he can lend? There are over two hundred imperial mages, so dispatching sixty or more shouldn’t be a problem. He probably just didn’t want to reduce the personnel protecting them. Uncooperative in protecting an important national treasure, how disgraceful for a prime minister.</p>



<p>“Did he say anything else?”</p>



<p>“Um…he strongly emphasized to protect it no matter what.”</p>



<p>“Giving the bare minimum help yet acting all high and mighty…” Princess Krell. Shall we head to the imperial palace tomorrow or so? I’m just in the mood to punch that thing called the prime minister and send him flying.”</p>



<p>“Don’t use violence on national leaders. Roth is already disliked by those in power.”</p>



<p>“Then there’s no problem. Rather, I want to be more hated by them. No one has the power to punish me anyway.”</p>



<p>“That’s why you’re called a troublemaker…”</p>



<p>Princess Krell rests her palm on her forehead.</p>

<p>Watching our exchange, the director looked at me with a gaze like he was seeing something unbelievable.</p>



<p>“V-Violence against national leaders?”</p>



<p>“That was a story from about a month ago.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think that counts as a while ago… Just what did you do?”</p>



<p>I answered indifferently.</p>



<p>“Nothing really. I just punched and hospitalized the Minister of Finance and Foreign Minister for badmouthing Princess Krell within my earshot. To be precise, I broke eighteen bones in each of them.”</p>



<p>“So that’s why they’re on leave…”</p>



<p>“Yes. Though I do regret it a little. I should have beaten them until they could never stand up on their own again. Princess Krell, I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>“You shouldn’t be apologizing for that…”</p>



<p>Sighing, Princess Krell picked up one of the baked treats on the desk and tossed it into her mouth. Next, she turned to me and scolded me.</p>



<p>“Roth, though it’s true that you won’t be punished no matter what you do, there are still good and bad things, as they used to say a long time ago, right? Even if it’s for my sake, when you send people to the hospital without a second thought, everyone gets scared when we go to the imperial palace.”</p>



<p>“I don’t care what they think of me.”</p>



<p>“I’m really troubled by it! Please show some restraint.”</p>



<p>“I don’t want to.”</p>



<p>“That’s why you should think before giving an answer!”</p>



<p>Princess Krell shouts, but I have no intention of compromising.</p>



<p>No servant who loves their master would stand idly by when their master is insulted. It’s the same for me.</p>



<p>However, it’s not desirable for me to do things Princess Krell doesn’t want. Just this once, I’ll reluctantly compromise.</p>



<p>“I guess there’s no helping it. Let’s make it just enough to say to the Prime Minister, ‘Don’t get cocky; I’ll expose evidence of your affair.'”</p>



<p>“So stop doing things that would make enemies… Also, why on earth does Roth have evidence of the Prime Minister’s affair?”</p>



<p>“Gathering information is a butler’s duty, Princess Krell.”</p>



<p>“I’ve never heard of a butler doing that.”</p>



<p>“That’s because Princess Krell knows too little about the world; she’s a novice when it comes to information.”</p>



<p>There are many butlers who gather information. Especially if they’re personal butlers, they are like close aides to their masters. They gather information to protect their masters and to gain an advantage in negotiations by having valuable information. In particular, because Princess Krell holds a special position, I put extra effort into gathering information for her. By the way, Princess Krell is afraid of ghosts. It’s adorable. I love her.</p>



<p>As I pour tea into the empty teacup, the museum ‘s director asks Princess Krell.</p>



<p>“Your Highness, who is Roth… I mean, what kind of person is he?”</p>



<p>“What kind of person?…”</p>



<p>“Well, I mean, is he really just a butler? It’s not ordinary for a butler to confront the dignitaries of the empire without fear, and also, the fact that he can’t be punished…”</p>



<p>It’s only natural to be curious.</p>



<p>However… it’s not something that’s hidden, and it doesn’t matter if it’s known, but explaining everything would be troublesome. Roth and the museum’s director will only be associated for a very short time until this incident is resolved. There’s no obligation for me to explain everything in detail.</p>



<p>I nod to Princess Krell, who meets my gaze for a moment, and she lowers her eyes and nods back.</p>



<p>“I’ll spare the details, but let me tell you that Roth is a very important person for the empire.”</p>



<p>“…Such a person, why would he be a butler? Couldn’t he obtain any position he desires?”</p>



<p>“Hah.”</p>



<p>I laugh and reply.</p>



<p>“It’s precisely because I desired it that I ended up in the position of Princess Krell’s butler. Titles and high-ranking positions are like garbage to me. They were actually offered to me, but I immediately declined.”</p>



<p>“Why are you so fixated on being a butler?”</p>



<p>It’s decided.</p>



<p>“Because the person I love needs me.”</p>



<p>I have no interest in titles, fame, or money. Many people have those things, and there are substitutes even if they lose them. The happiness derived from such things is fake.</p>



<p>On the other hand, as a butler, the happiness I get from being by Princess Krell Calerond’s side is unique and irreplaceable, something no one else has. It’s my one and only happiness.</p>



<p>My happiness equals Princess Krell’s happiness. That’s the equation. I think we should get married. Let’s do it.</p>



<p>As I speak what I have understood since the moment I was born, Princess Krell blushes and covers her face with both hands.</p>



<p>“Roth… Please don’t say such things in public, I told you so many times…”</p>



<p>“I apologize. Then, I’ll tell you after we return home. In about eight hours.”</p>



<p>“That’s enough already!”</p>



<p>“I’m not satisfied. If you keep me waiting, I’ll have withdrawal symptoms.”</p>



<p>“What kind of symptoms are those?”</p>



<p>Ignoring Princess Krell’s yell, I inform the museum ‘s director.</p>



<p>“Basically, I act with Princess Krell in mind. If, for example, you were to offend Princess Krell and I judged that she was hurt… I’ll crush you mercilessly, so be careful. Many of the empire’s officials have already become human flower arrangements, so I won’t hold back. Honestly, I felt a strong urge to kill when your previous trap misfired.”</p>



<p>“I-I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>



<p>“Good. Also, your daughter is just going through a rebellious phase; she should calm down as time passes.”</p>



<p>“Oh!”</p>



<p>And just as a harmonious atmosphere started drifting about,</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>A knocking sound on the director’s office door suddenly echoed through the room.</p>



<p>“Enter.”</p>



<p>After a beat, the director called towards the door. Then, the door opened hesitantly, and at the same time, a recently familiar face appeared.</p>



<p>She’s…if I remember correctly.</p>



<p>“Pardon my—-“</p>



<p>The person who entered stopped moving when she saw Princess Krell sitting on the sofa and me standing behind.</p>



<p>Wearing a white coat stained with large amounts of blue and yellow paint, and holding what looked like a stack of documents in her right hand. With her appearance, she looked more like a young aspiring painter rather than a museum employee. Also, perhaps to prevent paint from getting on it, her hair was tied back in one bunch.</p>



<p>She looks quite different from last time.</p>



<p>As I silently watched the door, Princess Krell greeted her in a kind voice.</p>



<p>“Hello, Erne-san. You seem to be in the middle of work.”</p>



<p>“Ah, um… Hello, Princess Krell. Um…”</p>



<p>She tried to string words together in a panic, but it seems she was having trouble finding the words from being more panicked than expected. I can understand why she would feel that way, but as an adult, she should have a little more composure. Especially since some nasty nobles would try to punish something like being too nervous to speak as disrespect. Well, I’ve mercilessly crushed nobles like that though.</p>



<p>As Erne panicked, I wondered if I should give her a lifeline, but the director laughed wryly and called out to her.</p>



<p>“Erne, did something happen?”</p>



<p>“Oh, um…it’s about the restoration of Naft the 2nd’s stone painting, there’s a small problem…”</p>



<p>“A problem?”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>Erne approached the director and traced the papers in her hand with her finger as she spoke.</p>



<p>“In the previous restoration…over fifty years ago, the restorer at the time seems to have made a mistake, and black powdered Cocoun stone paint was applied under the red eye paint. For a perfect restoration, it looks like we’ll need to shave the stone.”</p>



<p>“Shave the stone? We can’t do that. As much as possible, the stone paintings need to be repaired without damaging them.”</p>



<p>“But then the restoration won’t progress…”</p>



<p>“Hmm… Isn’t there some way to restore it without shaving the stone?”</p>



<p>“I’m looking, but nothing so far.”</p>



<p>The two made troubled expressions in unison, furrowing their brows as they stared at the papers.</p>



<p>It seems they’re struggling with the painting restoration work.</p>



<p>A task like restoring it to exactly how it looked originally is an extremely difficult effort that those of us without experience can’t understand. Glancing over, Princess Krell was tilting her head at their complicated conversation. No matter how hard she tries to listen, she can’t understand with her lack of knowledge.</p>



<p>However…from what I’m hearing, it doesn’t sound too hard for me to comprehend.</p>



<p>“Powdered Cocoun stone paint dissolves well in salt water. After peeling off the top red paint, patiently continue wiping with a new, clean brush soaked in salt water to cleanly remove just the black paint.”</p>



<p>“Salt water—!!”</p>



<p>As if saying “That’s right!”, the two opened their eyes wide in unison, and Erne hastily wrote something down on the papers in her hand. Beside her, the director raised a voice of admiration.</p>



<p>“Even though you’re not a professional, you know a lot. Did you aspire to be a painter or something in the past?”</p>



<p>“No. I just happened to see it in a book I read before.”</p>



<p>“Still, that’s amazing. You really helped us out. With this, we can restore it without having to shave the stone… Right?”</p>



<p>“Of course!”</p>



<p>Erne nodded vigorously, showing fighting spirit.</p>



<p>While it’s good to enthusiastically work, she can’t let her guard down.</p>



<p>“Salt water will seep into wounds, so please be careful, Erne-san.”</p>



<p>I pointed to the bandage wrapped around Erne’s right index finger. The boundary between the bandage and her skin was red and swollen. Seeing my warning, Erne panicked and hid the affected area with her left hand—Hm?</p>



<p>Right after feeling a sense of discomfort, Erne wrapped her hand behind her back, then awkwardly laughed.</p>



<p>“How embarrassing.”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s nothing major. I just cut my finger on the stone’s jagged edge during restoration. The bleeding’s stopped, so it won’t interfere with work. I didn’t drip any blood on the paintings or anything, so please don’t worry.”</p>



<p>“If you’re okay, that’s good… But be careful, okay? There are a lot of injuries during restoration work.”</p>



<p>“Yes. Well then, I’ll get back to the workshop. Thank you for the advice, Roth-san. Please relax, Princess Krell.”</p>



<p>Leaving those parting words, Erne left the director’s office.</p>



<p>After the quiet open and close sound faded, Princess Krell asked the director.</p>



<p>“Just what is Erne-san restoring?”</p>



<p>“She’s restoring the stone portrait of Naft the 2nd, the seventh king of the ancient Ritual Kingdom, Princess.”</p>



<p>“Um…”</p>



<p>Seeking help, Princess Krell glanced at me. With no interest in history or art, most talk about the museum would be incomprehensible to Princess Krell. Then she shouldn’t have asked.</p>



<p>However, her troubled face was so cute that I decided to teach her and provide another opportunity for Princess Krell to gain knowledge.</p>



<p>“About twenty-three hundred years ago, south of the Caliard Empire was a large country called the Ritual Kingdom next to the Aigum River. Their seventh king was Naft the 2nd, and since paper art mediums didn’t exist in their time, they painted portraits on white, square stones. Paintings on white stone are called stone paintings, so Erne-san is restoring the stone painting of Naft the 2nd.”</p>



<p>“They’re restoring a twenty-three hundred year old painting… It’s amazing it survived without damage.”</p>



<p>“We’ve experienced several thefts, and all the thieves clearly understood the value of the paintings. They were handled with great care, knowing that any damage or scratches would decrease their worth. Of course, in our museum, we also handle them with the utmost caution.”</p>



<p>“The stone paintings have the characteristic of being less susceptible to degradation compared to paper paintings, but there is a risk of the pigments being damaged by humidity and light. If left unattended, they can be covered with mold to the point where the painting becomes completely invisible. King Naft II is a famous and popular symbol of the Litoral Kingdom. His portrait stone painting is particularly valuable, so we have to handle it with utmost care. The responsibility in case something happens is heavy. It’s a matter of life and death, quite literally.</p>



<p>“Elne seems to be even more capable than I expected. She’s still young, yet entrusted with the important task of restoring such significant portrait stone paintings… I really admire her.”</p>



<p>“She is indeed very talented. She’s a curator with the ability to restore over forty art pieces in just five years.”</p>



<p>The director proudly boasted about his subordinate.</p>



<p>She might indeed be talented, but…</p>



<p>“If she’s so talented, I’d appreciate it if she didn’t trigger traps that could kill us.”</p>



<p>“Oh, come on! You’re safe, aren’t you? I don’t like men who keep dwelling on things forever!”</p>



<p>“I suppose having a young curator with such achievements is quite rare. She truly is amazing. I need to learn from her.”</p>



<p>“Roth, don’t you have any pride?”</p>



<p>If losing Princess Krell’s favor means being hated by her, I’d gladly throw away any pride, even if it means being reduced to a pile of mud. In fact, I’d gladly destroy it to pieces to gain her affection if I have to discard my pride.</p>



<p>Well, that aside.</p>



<p>“I was honestly surprised that Princess Krell didn’t know about King Naft II.”</p>



<p>“Likewise. King Naft II is a big name, and his name is almost always mentioned in world history.”</p>



<p>As both the director and I say this, Princess Krell blinks repeatedly.</p>



<p>“I-I see. Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Yes. Princess Krell, do you know the fairy tale called ‘The Poisonous Drink King’?”</p>



<p>“The poisonous… Ah, I vaguely remember hearing about it.”</p>



<p>It’s only natural; this fairy tale is quite famous.</p>



<p>The story is quite simple: a beloved king is poisoned with bright red poison in his drink and dies. It’s a bit cruel for a children’s story. I wasn’t a child when I first heard the tale, but young children would surely be shocked. After all, it has what is called a “bad ending.”</p>



<p>“It’s a world-famous fairy tale, and the protagonist, who is the king who gets poisoned, is a name known to everyone. His name is Naft II.”</p>



<p>“Ah!”</p>



<p>That’s right. This fairy tale is modeled after the life of Naft II. In reality, records about him show that he was a benevolent king trusted by many of his people.</p>



<p>His death, like in the fairy tale, was due to poisoning.</p>



<p>“In the fairy tale, it’s written that he was poisoned with bright red poison, but in reality, the poison that took Naft II’s life was called ‘Tree Blood,’ a highly toxic substance. It has the property of being neutralized if exposed to temperatures above 70 degrees Celsius for two minutes… However, without prior knowledge of the poison’s existence, one cannot prevent it. The king, unaware of the poison mixed in his wine, drank it all at once and died, still holding the glass.”</p>



<p>The director explains with an air of an expert, raising his teacup with one hand.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Poisoning is still a method of assassination used today. It is difficult to detect poison instantly mixed into food or drinks, resulting in many deaths. Even now, people die from it, so it would have been nearly impossible to prevent it in the times when magical technology was said to be underdeveloped.</p>
<p>After taking a sip of tea, the director continues with more information.</p>
<p>“‘The Poisonous Drink King’ is a mysterious work with unknown author and age. However, it is clear that it is modeled after Naft II, and some theories suggest that it was created by one of his devoted followers after his death.”</p>
<p>“That’s right… Wasn’t the murderer said to be a disgruntled astronomer whose ideas were rejected?”</p>
<p>“You’re quite well-informed, Roth. However, that’s just a hypothesis. No evidence has been found to support it.”</p>
<p>The identity of the assassin who killed the esteemed King Naft II is something archaeologists from all over the world are trying to uncover. When that is revealed, history, which has stood still, will begin to move again… or so a book with a headline like that was once sold in a bookstore. That’s just how much attention and popularity this king has.</p>
<p>After hearing the whole story, Princess Krell lets out a big sigh.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m painfully aware of my own ignorance…”</p>
<p>“Given Princess Krell’s intelligence, I believe you can learn a lot by studying a little. Of course, I’ll accompany you until you’re satisfied.”</p>
<p>“Please do.”</p>
<p>“Gladly.”</p>
<p>I accept my master’s modest request and bow my head slightly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When we left the Magic Museum, it was past 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The view of the city from the carriage window appeared different from the daytime. The city lights and numerous buildings were illuminated, and people who had finished their day’s work were walking along the cobblestone main street. While the expressions of the passing people varied, most seemed to exude a sense of relief and accomplishment after finishing their work. Laughter from men already drinking at a certain liquor store echoed through the night, despite the fact that it was just getting started.</p>
<p>As I enjoyed the pleasant atmosphere of the city, Princess Krell suddenly asked me a question.</p>
<p>“By the way, what about the three girls staying at the museum ? We’re going to the restaurant now, but…”</p>
<p>“Of course, I told them to prepare their own meals. Occasionally, they must learn to take care of themselves. Being unable to cook at all is fatal for servants, you know.”</p>
<p>While I usually cook for our meals, eventually those three should be able to handle meal preparations on their own. They are excellent in most things, except cooking, but… Princess Krell seemed concerned.</p>
<p>“Are you sure about that?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m just asking them to cook, and even if they fail, skipping one meal won’t kill them. They’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“Not about them, but about the kitchen.”</p>
<p>“I can’t guarantee that.”</p>
<p>That’s something I can only pray for.</p>
<p>There’s a good chance that they might chop the knives without knowing how to use them, or start unnecessary flambéing and cause chaos around the stove… I don’t want to think about it, but there’s a very real possibility of such a tragedy happening. Please, girls. Seriously.</p>
<p>“I almost forgot, but those three are as much of a disaster as you, Princess Krell.”</p>
<p>“Please stop casually lumping me together with them as a disaster.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I love you, including your disaster side.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the issue!”</p>
<p>Princess Krell gave her usual dissatisfied expression, and I chuckled as I got off the carriage, helping her into the wheelchair. We entered the restaurant marked with an elegant sign reading “Lamit.” The coachman had parked the carriage nearby, so we could leave it to him.</p>
<p>“Welcome.”</p>
<p>As soon as we entered, a black-haired waiter approached us, inquiring about the number of guests and whether we had a reservation. As expected of a place preferred by the upper class, the language and manners were impeccable.</p>
<p>The restaurant was divided into private rooms and open seats without partitions, with most customers dining in the open seats since private rooms had an additional charge. Private rooms were mostly used by individuals with publicly recognizable faces or highly distinguished nobles, and Princess Krell, being a member of the royal family, fell into that category.</p>
<p>While being guided to a small and tidy private room, Princess Krell and I took our seats facing each other across the table.</p>
<p>“That chef from earlier, is he an acquaintance of yours?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he is. His name is Webber, a man who constantly has cooking and muscles on his mind. The so-called muscle-cooking idiot.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard that word before… How did you get to know him?”</p>
<p>“Before… when I had just become Princess Krell’s butler, I visited here for cooking research. At that time, I met him after he had half-killed a magician causing a commotion inside the restaurant. As a reward for that, he taught me some cooking recipes.”</p>
<p>“It’s an unusual way to make friends…”</p>


<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">YOU ARE READING STOLEN TRANSLATION. READ THE ORIGINAL TRANSLATION AT GADGETIZEDPANDA.COM</p>


<p>By the way, the dishes I learned from him at that time are occasionally prepared at the museum . They are exceptional in taste, as they were passed down by a top chef. I can’t help but think it was good to know him, though just barely. But I wish he would stop recommending me muscle training every time we meet. I do think that his muscular physique, characteristic of a man who is obsessed with muscle training, is beautiful, but Princess Krell doesn’t like overly muscular men.</p>
<p>Princess Krell seemed surprised.</p>
<p>“The way you met is so like you… Honestly, I didn’t think you had any friends. You’re always by my side, and I thought you had no time to make friends.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. I’m always by Princess Krell’s side while she’s awake. However, once Princess Krell goes to bed, I occasionally go out for various reasons, mainly for information gathering.”</p>
<p>“Oh… going out in the night streets…”</p>
<p>She started to say something but then stopped, narrowing her eyes as she looked at me.</p>
<p>“In the night streets… you’re not doing anything strange, right?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by ‘strange play’?”</p>
<p>“That… well, something I find hard to say… you know…”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>
<p>Having sensed what Princess Krell wanted to say, I returned her words with a slight exasperation.</p>
<p>“Princess Krell, I have absolutely no intention of being intimate with anyone other than the woman I love. So, I won’t go to places like that even for fun. Besides, it’s impossible for me to profess my love to Princess Krell and then go to such a place. It just doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>“Y-You’re right. R-Roth is serious, so, of course, you wouldn’t go to such places.”</p>
<p>Princess Krell heaved a sigh of relief when I said that. Then, the waiter from earlier arrived with the restaurant’s wagon, carrying the dishes.</p>
<p>There was a salad with salami on freshly baked bread, a butter sautéed river fish, and the main dish, tomato stew. The aroma of the spices tantalized the senses, increasing our appetites.</p>
<p>Although I am confident in my cooking, it seems I can’t compare to the professional who designed the dishes. Well done, that muscle guy.</p>
<p>“It looks delicious… but isn’t it too much?”</p>
<p>“It’s just the right amount for us. If there’s anything left, I’ll eat it all.”</p>
<p>“Haha, you’re still a big eater despite your appearance.”</p>
<p>After the waiter left, Princess Krell reached for the fresh green salad first. The salad, dressed with a special dressing in addition to the salami, had earned a great reputation among the customers.</p>
<p>“Mm, it’s delicious.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear.”</p>
<p>After confirming that Princess Krell started eating, I also began my meal.</p>
<p>A servant must not start eating before their master. Princess Krell says it’s okay, but it’s a matter of common sense and rules for a servant. Just because the master permits it doesn’t mean I can break that rule.</p>
<p>Using my fork and knife, I cut the butter sautéed river fish and brought it to my mouth. The spiciness and saltiness complemented the white fish well. The amount of spices and the degree of cooking were exquisite. This is a recipe I wasn’t taught, so I really want to know how to make it. I think the three girls at the museum  would enjoy eating it too…</p>
<p>…I felt a sense of incongruity.</p>
<p>I stopped eating and looked up at Princess Krell. She held a spoon and was about to put a spoonful of Webber’s masterpiece, the tomato stew, into her mouth.</p>
<p>It was just a normal scene, nothing strange about it, considering we were having a meal. I checked the surroundings, but nothing seemed out of place.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, I sensed an intense feeling of danger. My spine straightened as if cold water was poured down my back, and my senses sharpened. Don’t stop, keep thinking.</p>
<p>I had the illusion of another me warning me. Focus my attention on one point.</p>
<p>In front of Princess Krell was a dish with the tomato stew. It looked like an ordinary tomato stew. I had eaten it before, and its appearance was exactly the same as before. The arrangement of the ingredients might be different, but there was no significant change in appearance.</p>
<p>However, there was one thing. Not through sight, but with my heightened sense of smell, I detected something abnormal.</p>
<p>Among the aroma of the stew, there was a faint, stimulating scent that pricked my nose.</p>
<p>“Wait! Princess Krell!”</p>
<p>With my whole body shivering, I immediately called Princess Krell’s name.</p>
<p>But she had already put the stew into her mouth.</p>
<p>“R-Roth? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Spit out the stew right now! Quickly!”</p>
<p>“What are you talking ab– Ahh?”</p>
<p>Just after Princess Krell spoke with a puzzled expression, a single tear of blood flowed from each of her eyes.</p>
<p>“Protective Shield Key!”</p>
<p>Summoning my magical key, I leaped over the table and rushed to Princess Krell’s side. At the same time, an intense anger toward myself surged up. Why didn’t I taste-test the food before Princess Krell ate it? Why didn’t I notice the lethal poison that had been mixed into the dish much earlier!!!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>While I was consumed by regret, Princess Krell shed tears of blood, clutching her chest and coughing up blood in my arms. In pain, repeatedly.</p>



<p>“Roth… this, is…”</p>



<p>“I apologize; it’s my fault for letting my guard down.”</p>



<p>To suppress the anger filling my heart like a geyser, I bit my lower lip until it bled.</p>



<p>This is a deadly poison. There is no chance of survival, an embodiment of murderous intent.</p>



<p>If a doctor were to examine Princess Krell’s condition, they would surely declare that there is no hope of survival. Right now, her body is being destroyed by the poison that entered her system, and in a few minutes, her heartbeat and breathing will cease. She’s fallen into the grasp of the inescapable scythe of death.</p>



<p>If I do nothing, my beloved Princess Krell will die.</p>



<p>Therefore—to save her, I will bear all her pain.</p>



<p>“Regarding the details and the punishment you have for me—Endure all the suffering.”</p>



<p>“Eh?!”</p>



<p>Gasping for breath, I pressed my lips against Princess Krell’s, overlapping them with mine. The soft sensation of her cherry-red lips and the taste of iron from the blood reached me. To call it romantic would be an understatement; this kiss was far too bloody and macabre.</p>



<p>This kiss held no love or carnal desire.</p>



<p>It was merely a means to save Princess Krell’s life and punish myself for putting my master in danger—a form of atonement.</p>



<p>Pain Transference was a magic that only I, possessing the Guardian Shield Key, could use. Its effect meant I would take on all the suffering that the person I kissed held.</p>



<p>In other words, I would become a substitute.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Ntkb7BX/wme8p4.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>Everything, the poison tormenting Princess Krell and the wounds she received from the poison.</p>



<p>After twenty seconds had passed, I parted my lips from Princess Krell, who now looked weakened. Her face was flushed red, not from embarrassment or trembling in shame, but with traces of tears of blood, and she gazed at me with an expression on the verge of tears.</p>



<p>“Roth, you can’t be…?”</p>



<p>“!!”</p>



<p>My heart throbbed once violently, and I, like Princess Krell a moment ago, shed blood tears from my eyes, enduring the intense pain coursing through my chest while clenching my back teeth tightly.</p>



<p>It was scorching. The heat throughout my body was so intense that I felt as if I were sinking into a burning inferno, losing my ability to think rationally. I vomited blood repeatedly, and the floor was stained with the viscous substance. Despite the burning heat, I couldn’t stop shivering with chills. My head throbbed, and I felt nauseous. If this excruciating pain continued for more than a dozen minutes, I might succumb to the urge to thrust a knife into my throat.</p>



<p>No, I couldn’t die.</p>



<p>Because right now, a much greater flame of fury was burning within me than the pain.</p>



<p>“Roth! Roth!!”</p>



<p>As Princess Krell called me with a heart-wrenching voice, I responded without looking at her.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, Princess Krell. Indeed, I’m tempted to die, but I won’t. My magical key, the Guardian Shield Key, grants protection. After a while, the poison raging inside me will weaken, and the pain will subside.”</p>



<p>I had somewhat gotten used to the pain. The poison’s effect was still active, but at least I could manage to speak.</p>



<p>Leaning against the wall, I pointed at the dish of tomato stew placed on the table.</p>



<p>“…Do you remember what Naft II drank before he was assassinated?”</p>



<p>“Naft II? Oh, it was the red tree sap, right?”</p>



<p>“Yes, exactly. It’s the sap of a short red tree that grows along the river… When living beings ingest it, they experience unbearable pain and die shortly after. Just like I am now.”</p>



<p>Since ancient times, this poison had been used for assassination. Its strength and immediacy were unparalleled, ensuring almost certain success upon ingestion. However, red tree sap was dangerous even through skin contact, as it could invade the body and lead to death. It was dangerous even for the user, making it one of the most lethal toxins.</p>



<p>But… the use of red tree sap might make it easy to identify the culprit.</p>



<p>“In the kitchen…”</p>



<p>“I-I can’t move y–“</p>



<p>“No, Princess Krell. We have to move right now. We can’t let that bastard escape.”</p>



<p>I tightly gripped the Guardian Shield Key, rose from my seat, and headed towards the kitchen, focusing my energy on moving forward.</p>



<p>It had been a while since I felt such intense anger. It was nearly indistinguishable from a murderous impulse, but I wouldn’t kill. At most, I’d leave him half-dead, as I always did.</p>



<p>With my white shirt stained with blood and an expression colored by fury, I emerged from the private room, causing the other customers to stop in surprise and watch me. Some seemed as if they wanted to ask if something was wrong, but a single glance from me silenced them.</p>



<p>Now was not the time to entertain their well-intentioned concern.</p>



<p>Exuding a tense atmosphere, I pressed my hand against the wall and proceeded towards my destination. On the way, the waiter who had shown us to our private room called out to me.</p>


<p>“C-Customer!? What happened–“</p>
<p>“It’s perfect timing. Show me the way to Webber. Right away.”</p>
<p>“B-But to the head chef’s place? Shouldn’t we get you treated first–“</p>
<p>“I can get treated later as many times as needed. Now, what’s important is getting to that bastard before he can escape.”</p>
<p>With a stern gaze, I spoke, and after a brief moment of hesitation, the waiter reluctantly led me to the kitchen. Good, this would save me the trouble of searching for him.</p>
<p>“Head chef, a customer is–“</p>
<p>“Hm?…Hey! Roth, what the hell happened to you? Why are you all beaten up just from having a meal?!”</p>
<p>When the waiter called out, Webber abandoned the pan he was seasoning with oil and rushed over to me without even turning off the stove. His large, worried face showed signs of concern and agitation.</p>
<p>Yeah, I knew it. Webber wasn’t the culprit. He was a guy who poured his heart and soul into his cooking, not someone who would do something so cowardly. He simply wanted me and Princess Krell to enjoy his delicious dishes.</p>
<p>I knew from the start that Webber wasn’t the culprit.</p>
<p>So why did I come to him?</p>
<p>It was because… I needed his testimony to confirm my deductions.</p>
<p>“Webber, I have one question.”</p>
<p>“Come on, now’s not the time for that…”</p>
<p>“It’s crucial.”</p>
<p>I grabbed Webber’s shoulder and asked.</p>
<p>“When you serve your tomato stew, do you plate it while it’s still boiling hot?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah. That’s right.”</p>
<p>“How long do you let the tomato stew cool down in the plate before the waiter takes it to us?”</p>
<p>“You mean the cooling time?”</p>
<p>After a pause, Webber answered.</p>
<p>“We let the tomato stew sit in the plate for about thirty seconds before serving. We don’t want our customers to get burned when they eat it right after it’s served.”</p>
<p>“During that time, does anyone touch it?”</p>
<p>“No, we tell everyone not to touch it, and we use an hourglass to time it, so no one comes close until the sand runs out.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>His answer made me smirk.</p>
<p>Though the excruciating pain throughout my body had slightly eased, the burning sensation and chills remained, and blood tears still flowed. Just breathing made me feel like I would cough up blood.</p>
<p>While anyone else might have gone insane in such pain, I released Webber’s arm and smiled at Princess Krell, who was anxiously looking at me.</p>
<p>“Please, step back a bit.”</p>
<p>“Eh–“</p>
<p>Without waiting for a response, I walked forward and forcefully grabbed the head of the black-haired waiter who had accompanied us this far, slamming his face onto the frying pan still hot with oil in a fit of rage.</p>
<p>“!!!!”</p>
<p>As everyone present was astonished, the waiter with his face burning from the scorching oil tried desperately to escape. However, I held him down with far greater strength than he possessed, so there was no way for him to get away. Of course, I wouldn’t let him.</p>
<p>“Roth, what are you–“</p>
<p>Interrupting Princess Krell’s words, I spoke while my rage was still boiling.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who mixed the red tree sap into the food, aren’t you, you scum!”</p>
<p>Despite the pain, I kneeled on the back of the waiter’s head, which had turned bright red. Then, I grabbed his collar, threw him into the dining area in front of the customers, and stomped on his oil-covered face as he lay on the table. I forcefully grabbed his hair, causing him to almost lose consciousness in the middle of the broken table, and demanded loudly for everyone to hear.</p>
<p>“I’m asking you a question. Did you poison the food?!”</p>
<p>“Y-you…!”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t.”</p>
<p>He immediately denied it.</p>
<p>It took some courage to outright lie in this situation. But I was so sure that he was the culprit, which was why I had inflicted so much pain on him.</p>
<p>Oh well. I might as well demonstrate a simple deduction.</p>
<p>“You think you can still escape at this point? I’ll tell you something. The red tree sap, the poison raging inside my body, is neutralized when exposed to temperatures over seventy degrees for two minutes. From the moment the dishes were ready until Princess Krell took a bite of the stew, fifty-six seconds had passed. It took you twenty-three seconds to plate the dishes. It took twenty seconds for you to guide us from the kitchen to our private room. That adds up to ninety-nine seconds. If you had put the poison in the dish, it should have been neutralized by the time it was brought to us. So, the only person who had the opportunity to poison it after you plated it is you, right?”</p>
<p>“…Ugh.”</p>
<p>“Your silence is the answer, huh?”</p>
<p>The waiter’s gaze shifted slightly to the upper right. Apparently, when humans are thinking of lies or excuses, they tend to look up and to the left. In other words, this guy was still trying to find a way to escape even at this stage.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>That fact irritated me immensely.</p>
<p>“I… don’t care about the pain I’m experiencing right now. I don’t even care about the dishonor I’ve suffered in trying to save Princess Krell. If I could protect her, that would be enough. But…”</p>
<p>Gritting my back teeth, I stared at the waiter with a murderous gaze, tightened my grip on his hair, and slowly raised the Guardian Shield Key in my other hand.</p>
<p>A dangerous and disturbing emotion oozes out, the kind one should never harbor in their daily life. The desire to kill this man wells up within me, unconsciously nesting in my voice and gaze.</p>
<p>Even before Princess Krell, my mistress, I shouldn’t allow myself to feel such emotions. Normally, I can maintain my composure and never let any ugly emotions show, even for a moment. But right now… I couldn’t stop it.</p>
<p>“I can’t possibly forgive you for making me feel this emotion, even for an instant. The fact that you attempted to harm the one I love, I won’t forgive you. Here—”</p>
<p>As I raised the Guardian Shield Key over my head, preparing to strike with all my might,</p>
<p>“Roth.”</p>
<p>With that call, a strong slap on my cheek snapped me back to my senses.</p>
<p>The rage that had been boiling up inside me receded like a wave, and I turned the Guardian Shield Key in the air, causing it to vanish into thin air. I released the grip on the waiter’s hair, and he fell into the center of the broken table, unconscious with his eyes rolled back. The intense killing intent from up close must have been too much for him to bear, causing him to lose consciousness.</p>
<p>I glanced at the unconscious man and then bowed my head to Princess Krell, who had appeared beside me at some point.</p>
<p>“I apologize. I lost control for a moment.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please try to stay composed. I called the knights, so we’ll leave the rest to them. I appreciate that you were thinking of me, but… you don’t need to get your hands dirty.”</p>
<p>“……Yes.”</p>
<p>The moment I heard those words, the strength I had been forcibly channeling into my body as I moved due to anger dissipated, and I dropped to my knees. The blood tears had stopped, but the sharp pain in my chest and the urge to cough up blood still persisted. However, my condition was undoubtedly better than right after I used the Pain Transference. By now, after an hour or so, the coughing and chest pain should have subsided.</p>
<p>Well, there’s still the matter of the knights’ interrogation before the poison leaves my body.</p>
<p>I thought about that with annoyance as I waited for the arrival of the knights.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next morning at 8:00 a.m.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Princess Krell.”</p>
<p>I bowed to Princess Krell, who entered the dining hall just as I finished setting the freshly made breakfast on the table, and she walked over and returned the greeting.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Roth. Did you sleep well last night?”</p>
<p>“I apologize, but I didn’t sleep much.”</p>
<p>“! Is the poison still…?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that. It’s just that you didn’t give me a goodnight kiss.”</p>
<p>“I never did such a thing!”</p>
<p>“Just kidding.”</p>
<p>Engaging in conversation with Princess Krell, I poured cold water into a glass.</p>
<p>It was true that I didn’t sleep much. Although I had successfully neutralized the toxic components of the red tree sap, I still suffered from headaches and nausea for a while after returning to the museum . Moreover, the anger that I had suppressed resurfaced when I was alone, making it impossible for me to sleep well.</p>
<p>“Don’t say things that sound bad. Well, they’re just scared on their own.”</p>
<p>She said with a dissatisfied expression as she took her usual seat.</p>
<p>Originally, we should have spent the entire night being interrogated at the knights’ base. An attempted assassination of a member of the royal family is a serious crime, and it cannot be settled with a brief interrogation. Not only me, but also the shop staff and witnesses there would have been detained for a long time. However, when the leader of the dispatched unit, a young man, arrived, Princess Krell made a strong request: “He is my retainer, and he is suffering from the poison’s effects. Please conduct the investigation at a later date when he is in perfect health.” The courageous young man hesitated for a moment, but when Princess Krell said, “Do you have any objections to that?” with a frightening expression, he quickly shook his head with a terrified look, and we were able to return home within about five minutes of the knights’ arrival.</p>
<p>Princess Krell is amazing, I honestly thought at that time. The authority of a “royal” appears to be formidable.</p>
<p>Oh, right. After watching the poison-drenched waiter, who had fainted on top of the shattered table, being taken away by the knights, I informed Webber to calculate the amount of damage to the shop and submit an expense claim to the imperial office. We had broken quite a lot of things, but it was necessary damage to protect the royal member, Princess Krell. If I explained it that way, the office would likely pay the claim without any fuss. After all, those people wouldn’t dare oppose me.</p>
<p>As I thought back to last night, Princess Krell looked around and tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, where are those children?”</p>
<p>“They’re cleaning.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t they clean after having breakfast?”</p>
<p>“Milady, it’s not just ordinary cleaning. It’s also a punishment.”</p>
<p>“Eh, a punishment?”</p>
<p>“Yes. In summary, it means Princess Krell’s intuition was right.”</p>
<p>The moment she heard that, Princess Krell covered her forehead and let out a sigh.</p>
<p>Yeah. The real trouble started after we returned to the museum . The three servants who were waiting at the entrance rushed towards me, their shirts stained with blood, and exclaimed, “Who did you kill?!” with misplaced worry. Especially Farah, who grabbed my arm in tears, saying, “We’re taking you to the interrogation room right away!” I almost felt like punching them all. What do they think of me?</p>


<p>After explaining everything that happened to Princess Krell, and after everyone understood, we entered the museum . I escorted Princess Krell to her bedroom and was planning to do a quick inspection before heading to bed, but… when I saw the kitchen, I was hit with a wave of despair.</p>



<p>On the carriage ride to the restaurant, Princess Krell had expressed concern about the three using the kitchen, asking if it would be alright. Well, her bad feeling had become a reality. The walls were as black as if they’d been smeared with charcoal, and the floor was oddly sticky, making a squelching sound with every step. Naturally, the cutting board was chopped into pieces, and the pot seemed to have taken on a bizarre shape.</p>



<p>How on earth could this hellish scene have come about?</p>



<p>I glared at the three servants with not just anger but also bewilderment, and they all averted their eyes, trying to escape my gaze. They were perfectly in sync in that regard too, which made me even more exasperated.</p>



<p>Usually, I’d make them kneel on the sticky floor and give them a scolding, but unfortunately, I was too exhausted from the accumulated fatigue and the poison’s damage. So, I simply told them to use detergent and clean up in the morning, and retreated to my room.</p>



<p>Since they seemed repentant from their expressions, I decided to spare them the lecture. I thought I was being too lenient.</p>



<p>Besides, cleaning that mess up would be quite a task. That alone would probably serve as a significant punishment. They were now desperately polishing the floor, looking like they were about to cry. Breakfast might turn into lunch at this rate.</p>



<p>“It looks tough.”</p>



<p>“Well, they brought it upon themselves. If I helped them, it wouldn’t be much of a punishment.”</p>



<p>“Well, I guess… By the way, are you completely okay now?”</p>



<p>In response to Princess Krell’s concern, I nodded.</p>



<p>“I’m fine, no problems.”</p>



<p>“Really? You could take the day off, you know? Now that I think about it, I don’t think Roth has ever taken a break since becoming my butler…”</p>



<p>“Please don’t treat me like an ordinary person. I’m fine. Besides, what would you do without me?”</p>



<p>“I-I’m not like that! I can manage on my own…”</p>



<p>“Don’t pretend. I think if you were left alone to do something, you’d fail at everything. You’re like a child; if I take my eyes off you, I won’t know where or what you’ll be doing. Princess Krell equals a child. You’re in your late teens, so grow up. Otherwise, you won’t be able to get married.”</p>



<p>“Also, there’s something I want to tell you.”</p>



<p>“W-What is it?”</p>



<p>As Princess Krell stopped cutting the omelette, I straightened my back and spoke.</p>



<p>“I didn’t really plan on getting too involved in the case of the etoile Magic Key theft. It had nothing to do with us, as it was about the country’s treasure being targeted. However, last night, when your life was in danger, it became something that concerns us.”</p>



<p>“W-Wait a minute!”</p>



<p>Putting down her fork and knife, Princess Krell interrupted my words.</p>



<p>“Are you saying that Roth thinks last night’s incident is related to the museum’s threat letter?”</p>



<p>“I think the possibility is high. There are many suspicious points, and it’s quite likely that the waiter was trying to kill you, Princess Krell, to hinder the theft of the etoile Magic Key.”</p>



<p>The timing was perfect. There were many other suspicious aspects, so it’s highly probable that there’s a connection. The motive would be to eliminate Princess Krell, the biggest obstacle to stealing the Ethowa Magic Key.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason may be, I have no intention of forgiving the culprit this time.</p>



<p>“In that case, could that waiter guy be the culprit of the threat letter?”</p>



<p>“I considered that possibility, but it disappeared this morning. This paper is the information the knights extracted from the waiter last night, and it was found in the mailbox this morning. He said he was given money and asked to do it. However, we still don’t know anything about the client.”</p>



<p>“I guess reality isn’t that kind, huh…”</p>



<p>“Yeah. We’re still in a situation where we don’t know when danger might approach you, Princess Krell. But going back to what I was saying… I’ve decided to be deeply involved in this case.”</p>



<p>Here is my attempt to translate the Japanese text into natural English:</p>



<p>My anger has not subsided. If anything, it has grown larger than it was yesterday. I’m just keeping it suppressed with my usual self-control, but… When I come face to face with the culprit, I may not be able to restrain my emotions and end up lashing out. Just yesterday, I almost killed that waiter in a fit of rage. I do regret it, but I’m not confident I won’t do it again next time.</p>



<p>So―</p>



<p>“If I try to do something against Milady’s wishes again… please stop me. If you deem it necessary, feel free to use your magic on me. I’d rather not become someone Milady doesn’t want than…”</p>



<p>“It’s alright,” Milady said gently, grasping my hand. “That won’t happen. If it comes to that, I’ll stop you without hurting you, I promise.”</p>



<p>“…Thank you very much.”</p>



<p>I bowed deeply in gratitude and respect for her merciful nature. And secretly vowed to flatten any foolish offender who dared take the life of my kind mistress.</p>
