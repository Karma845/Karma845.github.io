<h2>Chapter 1: Rarely, The Box Contains Important Troublesome Letters</h2>

<p>The Carreralonde Empire, where the bloodline of the first emperor who took the throne about 100 years ago has ruled the country for generations.</p>
<p>Looking back on the history of this country, it can be seen that the number of civil wars and riots is overwhelmingly large compared to surrounding countries. One of the reasons is thought to be that the king from over 100 years ago imposed oppressive policies such as heavy taxes, which greatly provoked resistance from his own citizens. If he had considered the lives of his citizens and practiced politics for the people, riots and coups would not have occurred so easily… Although riots and coups took place repeatedly, with the country’s leadership changing many times, in the end the new leaders also took self-serving policies, provoking rebellion from the dissatisfied citizens… And so they repeated endless civil wars.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first emperor from 100 years ago learned from the mistakes of the previous kings and decided to directly reflect the opinions of not only members of parliament but also the citizens in politics, setting up suggestion boxes throughout the country. The effect was tremendous, and the number of domestic riots dropped to zero after the boxes were installed. Although there are some who complain that minority opinions are not adopted, they are properly presented with compromise proposals. Things like blood and violence flying around as in the past have noticeably disappeared, and the country has become evaluated by foreign nations as peaceful.</p>
<p>The suggestion box system continues even now after 100 years have passed, with citizens’ opinions being dropped in daily.</p>
<p>But in recent years, a rumor has spread about the suggestion boxes.</p>
<p>In the imperial capital Mifras, there is an unusual black suggestion box set up, different from the normal ones. If you write down your worries on a piece of paper and drop it in there, a mysterious beautiful young man in black clothes will come to visit and resolve your worries.</p>
<p>That’s the rumor.</p>
<p>\*\*\*</p>
<p>In a study in a mansion on the outskirts of the imperial capital.</p>
<p>“This week there are… 18 letters. 10 more than last week, maybe because the location I set up this time was easy to find.”</p>
<p>I took out the letters of consultation dropped into the black suggestion box and counted the number. I usually place it deep in the back alleys where no one would go, but this time I set it up behind an inn facing the main street, so there were probably more people who found it. Alright, it was easy to find this week, so next week I’ll try placing it in a spot that’s hard to find unless you search for it.</p>
<p>While entertaining such mischievous thoughts and opening the letters, Princess Krell said to me as I held the black suggestion box.</p>
<p>“The suggestion box is for listening to the people’s opinions, so I think it’s questionable to place it where it’s hard to find. If someone who really wants to consult can’t find it, isn’t that contradictory?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, that opinion makes sense.”</p>
<p>“So-“</p>
<p>“However,”</p>
<p>As I continued opening the letters one after another, I told the princess my argument.</p>
<p>“Those who really want their worries heard and want help will desperately search for this black suggestion box. Giving up halfway means it’s just that degree of worry.”</p>
<p>For example, if the black suggestion box was placed in a visible location on a main street, trivial questions and worries would likely be dropped in in large quantities. That would render the black suggestion box useless.</p>
<p>After explaining politely and clearly, the princess seemed somewhat convinced.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Yes. There’s also the reason that I’m looking forward to hiding the black suggestion box myself.”</p>
<p>“That’s completely your personal motivation!”</p>
<p>“Not personal, just catering to the market. Men feel romantic about treasure hunts.”</p>
<p>“Geez… Since it’s officially public business, please do it seriously.”</p>
<p>“I’ll handle it appropriately.”</p>
<p>I lightly bowed my head.</p>
<p>The excitement and surprise when discovering something you were looking for has irreplaceable value. This must be a common feeling among both men and women. The pleasant sensation when you lose documents that have to be submitted tomorrow, frantically search for them, and then find them is abnormal.</p>
<p>By the time our conversation finished, I had opened all the letters, so I handed them to Princess Krell.</p>
<p>“Now, please read whichever you like.”</p>
<p>“You already opened them? It hasn’t even been 2 minutes…”</p>
<p>“As a butler, it’s natural skill. I’m extremely competent.”</p>
<p>“Don’t praise yourself. Alright, I’ll read them.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please do.”</p>
<p>With a quill pen in one hand, I listened to the princess’s voice. Now then, what’s the first worry?</p>
<p>“‘I discovered the rumored black suggestion box, so I dropped this in. I don’t have any particularly big worries, but if forced to name one, it would be that my wife’s seasoning is bland. However, the atmosphere at the dinner table becomes hellish if I say so directly, so I can’t bring myself to tell her. Is there a way to convey it without hurting my wife’s feelings?’ …But-“</p>
<p>“Tsk, way off. Starting with such a silly question…”</p>
<p>At the silly question that would be foolish to seriously consider, I inadvertently clicked my tongue. Looks like it was bad to set it up in an attention-grabbing spot after all. Next time I should bury it in the ground of some back alley where nobody would go…</p>
<p>“Don’t let your mind wander, Roth.”</p>
<p>“! My apologies. To think of other things…”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to go that far!”</p>
<p>“I’m joking.”</p>
<p>I lightly bowed my head and took the letter Princess Krell had just read aloud.</p>
<p>“The consultation contents are extremely silly, not even worth dropping in the black suggestion box.”</p>
<p>“I feel like that’s too harsh, but for this one Roth doesn’t need to go directly, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Advice at this level can be adequately handled by returning the letter. I feel there’s no need to even return the letter, but…that would affect the reputation of the black suggestion box.”</p>
<p>Narrowing my eyes, I slid my gaze over the letter’s contents.</p>
<p>For the consultations sent to the black suggestion box, I take two kinds of responses.</p>
<p>One is me directly visiting the consultant and providing assistance to resolve their worries. The other is sending a letter detailing my and the princess’s opinions on the consultation. I judge which are important cases for the former, but this one is obviously the latter.</p>
<p>The princess immediately began seriously thinking up an answer.</p>
<p>“For this… the only thing I can say is, can’t they make the food themselves? Or add seasoning after their wife makes it, and such?”</p>
<p>The princess’s proposal was proper and innocuous as expected. If they don’t like the taste, try saying so directly. And if that doesn’t work, make it themselves, add seasoning. Nine out of ten people would come up with a similar answer.</p>
<p>But this was a worry dropped in the black suggestion box. There’s no fun at all in writing commonly obvious answers anyone could think of.</p>
<p>So I decided to add a little accent to the response.</p>
<p>\—Why can’t you understand that the bland seasoning is evidence your wife is concerned for your health? First, be grateful that a warm meal is prepared when you return home. There are many lonely excellent warriors in the world who have to make their own meals after coming home. Realize, understand, and be grateful for your blessed circumstances, and proudly get trampled. If you complain about your wife, your hair will thin as the seasoning becomes thicker, so be wary. Keep eating blandly seasoned food for life while feeling grateful.</p>
<p>“This resolves it, right?”</p>
<p>“I feel like… no, there are very noticeable thorns.”</p>
<p>“Words that stick in your heart generally have thorns. Unpleasant things stick in your memory more easily right? It’s because they pierce you that they remain.”</p>
<p>“It’s troublesome that you’re unnecessarily persuasive.”</p>
<p>With a wry smile, Princess Krell reached for the next letter to read aloud. Since the first was a miserable(?) one, I hope the next is at least a little better…</p>
<p>“‘Lately, due either to my carriage aging or other reasons, it makes creaking sounds whenever I use it, and the horse pulling it can’t get up to speed. What should I do?’ …This one too-“</p>
<p>“Is way off, yes.”</p>
<p>Somehow, even though I expected it, when an off-base question actually comes I feel let down. It makes me want to just quit this whole black suggestion box thing.</p>
<p>Princess Krell also heaved a fed up sigh.</p>
<p>“Are they all weird questions this time?”</p>
<p>“That’s the current situation, yes. Were last week’s life consultations about a man left with only emptiness and self-loathing after focusing too much time and energy on criticizing others more to your liking?”</p>
<p>“I’m not asking for consultations that make me struggle to respond, but… These don’t seem like contents worth dropping in the black suggestion box in the first place, do they?”</p>
<p>Indeed, that’s what I think too.</p>
<p>The black suggestion box is, in brief, supposed to resolve worries that you can’t tell anyone about, or worries that just the people involved are unable to grasp the clue to resolving.</p>
<p>It’s not really meant for casually dropping in letters on a whim.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>“Our motto is to sincerely face and derive responses for any kind of content. So let’s answer these consultations seriously this time too. Though reluctantly.”</p>
<p>“You’re reluctant, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes. To be honest I don’t want to answer these kinds of questions at all. Now then-“</p>
<p>After candidly stating my true feelings, I took the letter from Princess Krell and read the contents.</p>
<p>“This worry doesn’t specifically state what they want to do with the carriage.”</p>
<p>“? Don’t they want to repair the carriage?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, that’s one way to interpret it. However, if they wanted to repair the carriage, they could just take it to a repair shop. The fact they went so far as to drop it as a worry in the black suggestion box means they’re asking if there’s a better way to use the broken carriage, right?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that overthinking it?”</p>
<p>“That level is just right.”</p>
<p>Better to add a twist than give a halfhearted answer.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I set my pen running across the paper.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p><em>I will assume you are using a wooden carriage, based on it making creaking sounds. The wooden carriages circulating in the imperial capital use high quality timber, so try coating it with honey and leaving it in the forest overnight. Come early morning, many rhinoceros beetles will gather, awakening your boyish spirit. Also, if stag beetles gather and start gnawing the carriage, you can expect it to lighten, and when pulled by the horse it should reach the same speed as when a boy notices his mother’s footsteps and hurriedly throws his dirty books under the bed. I personally want to see a carriage all sticky with honey dashing through the town, so I would be delighted if you adopt my proposal. It will definitely be amazing, so let’s do it by all means.</em></p>
<p>After reading my response, Princess Krell said with a straight face.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel like it resolves anything at all.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Well, regardless of whether the recipient takes this advice, properly facing and responding to the worry maintains the integrity of the black suggestion box, I believe. Besides, if I went directly, that would be another story, but for letters I’m just presenting ideas without ever stating I’ll resolve it.”</p>
<p>“You’re a bad person.”</p>
<p>“It teaches that things won’t always go your convenient way.”</p>
<p>For small worries, you should do your best to resolve them with your own power as much as possible. Life isn’t so sweet that someone will always lend a hand when you’re troubled.</p>
<p>While putting the second letter in its envelope, Princess Krell spoke in a way that was hard to tell if she was amazed or exasperated.</p>
<p>“But you sure can come up with all those words in just 10-something seconds, can’t you?”</p>
<p>“When people think about foolish things, their mind speeds up a hundredfold compared to normal.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard such a thing!”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I just made it up now.”</p>
<p>Laughing, Princess Krell brought the milk tea-filled cup to her mouth.</p>
<p>As ever, she drinks with a sense of dignity.</p>
<p>Unintentionally captivated, I watched her, but it seems the princess didn’t notice my gaze as she smiled and praised the taste of the milk tea.</p>
<p>“As always, it’s perfectly delicious. Just the right sweetness I like, flawless.”</p>
<p>“You honor me.”</p>
<p>Bowing my head, Princess Krell placed the tea cup on its saucer and made a regretful expression.</p>
<p>“Really… It would have been even better if you were just a little kinder.”</p>
<p>“? I think I’m plenty kind.”</p>
<p>“Are you seriously saying that?”</p>
<p>She looked at me as if to say, you’re kidding, right?</p>
<p>“Certainly, Roth is close to perfect as a butler. Your work is flawless, physical ability far above normal people, quick thinking and abundant knowledge. Your skill with magic is exceptionally high, and you’re peerless as a guard too.”</p>
<p>“As the princess’s butler, that level of competence is only natural.”</p>
<p>“But-!”</p>
<p>Princess Krell forcefully pointed her index finger at me.</p>
<p>“Your mouth is devastatingly foul! You spout relentless demeaning words like an open faucet… I’m quite hurt, you know!?”</p>
<p>“Abusive language? Me?”</p>
<p>“You weren’t aware!?”</p>
<p>I laughed, covering my mouth, at the princess’s wide-eyed astonishment.</p>
<p>“I’m joking. I’m aware my mouth is bad and I have no intention of correcting it, of course.”</p>
<p>“I think you should make efforts to fix that.”</p>
<p>“I cannot lie to you, Princess. The only things my mouth will utter to you are words brimming with affection.”</p>
<p>As I continued staring fixedly into her eyes without averting my gaze, the princess shyly looked away.</p>
<p>Seeing her so adorably like this is very soothing on the eyes. But at the same time, I worry if her lack of resistance to kindness means she’ll get deceived by some weird guy at a social event. Though I won’t let her attend such events.</p>
<p>“You’re too naive, Princess.”</p>
<p>“I-I can’t help it! I was never loved by anyone until I met Roth!!”</p>
<p>“I’m well aware. Therefore, I will gift you with more affection than you missed out on until now.”</p>
<p>“Stoooop!! Show at least some embarrassment!”</p>
<p>“Impossible. Affection monopolizes the space in my heart, leaving no room for shame.”</p>
<p>At my matter-of-fact way of spouting endless affectionate words like breathing, the princess made a very resentful expression. I want to tease her and enjoy this more, but unfortunately consultation letters still remain. I should stop for now. Of course I’ll resume later.</p>
<p>“Princess, there are still consultation letters left. Let’s continue. See, your hands have stopped.”</p>
<p>“Whose fault is that…”</p>
<p>Flapping her heated red face with one hand, the princess took the next letter. I wonder what kind of silly consultation will come next.</p>
<p>And while making various predictions, I noticed something.</p>
<p>“Hm? Did something happen?”</p>
<p>For some reason, the princess had frozen up looking at one letter.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem she’s puzzling over the contents. Narrowed eyes, the smile gone from her mouth – not at all the expression when reading a consultation letter.</p>
<p>Perhaps something that agitated her heart was written there.</p>
<p>Sensing from long association that the princess was displeased about something, she silently handed the letter to me with an empty expression.</p>
<p>“Here. This letter is addressed to Roth.”</p>
<p>“? Addressed to me by name?”</p>
<p>Taking the letter with a question mark in my mind and lowering my eyes to the paper- I immediately understood why the princess had gotten in a bad mood.</p>
<p>In short, it was a love letter.</p>

<p>In the past, a consultation seeker I had gone to directly and resolved their worries had sent a letter expressing thanks and romantic feelings to me. Of course, they didn’t reveal their identity, so it was addressed ‘To the gentleman in black’. Although I’ve been handling consultation requests through the black suggestion box for about 2 years now…this was a first.</p>
<p>“A love letter in the black suggestion box… Some people are quite strange.”</p>
<p>I folded the finished letter and placed it on my desk with a wry smile. And Princess Krell, who until now had been openly projecting her displeasure while staring hard at me, opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“You look happy…Roth.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I don’t have any ill intentions. Having someone harbor affection for you isn’t something I dislike.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Hearing my words, Princess Krell pursed her lips sullenly.</p>
<p>That very cute expression makes me want to admire it for a good hour and then write an impression piece. However, it’s against my wishes to leave my beloved master unhappy. If possible, I want her smiling face always.</p>
<p>“But I’m not happy about it.”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>“As you know, the only affection that makes me happy is from none other than you, Princess, whom I love from the bottom of my heart. And in my heart, there’s only enough space to receive your affection.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Gradually, a flush spread across the princess’s cheeks. If it were evening I could claim it was the sunset’s doing, but unfortunately it’s still morning and the sunlight isn’t hitting her. There are absolutely no excuses for her blushing red face.</p>
<p>…Let’s tease her a little.</p>
<p>I made an uncharacteristically sad expression that I don’t normally show.</p>
<p>“Well, the important you… don’t seem to think much of me.”</p>
<p>“Eh-“</p>
<p>The princess reflexively opened her eyes and mouth wide.</p>
<p>Before she could string words together, I continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, you’ve never given me an answer at all to my confession, have you? I’m sorry, Princess. An unwanted confession from a man you don’t even like must have been nothing but unpleasant. From now on, I absolutely won’t ever-“</p>
<p>Pretending to be a young man hiding his wounded heart while forcing a smile, as I started to bow my head,</p>
<p>“That’s not true at all!”</p>
<p>Princess Krell placed both hands on the desk and stood up, yelling in a loud voice she normally doesn’t use.</p>
<p>Next, she placed her right hand on her chest, looked straight into my eyes, and spoke.</p>
<p>“There’s no way I could ever hate Roth! You gave me hope to live, you’re my benefactor! You reached out to me when I was scorned by many and lost the will and meaning to live. Someone so important, so special… Hate you… As if…!”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she gradually grew more embarrassed. By the end her voice was so small I could barely make out the words.</p>
<p>I probably overdid it on the mischief.</p>
<p>With slight regret, I brought my hand to my mouth and apologized to Princess Krell, laughing.</p>
<p>“My apologies, Princess Krell. That was too mean of me.”</p>
<p>“! It was an act!?”</p>
<p>I nodded to the princess, her face bright red and with tiny teardrops in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Of course. There’s no way you would hate me, and most of all, I’m not the kind of man who would give up after one failed confession. If it doesn’t work the first time I’ll confess ten times, if ten times doesn’t work then a hundred times, if a hundred times doesn’t work then a thousand times – I’m the kind of man who will keep confessing until I get an answer.”</p>
<p>“I really thought I’d hurt Roth and… felt guilty!”</p>
<p>“Hehe, that you felt guilty means you consider me that much, doesn’t it? Don’t worry, I’ll keep waiting forever. However,”</p>
<p>I stared into the princess’s eyes and murmured faintly.</p>
<p>“Occasionally, not having words hurts.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The princess closed her mouth and glanced around the room, then finally looking up at one point on the ceiling, said with her face still red,</p>
<p>“Re…reservation, then.”</p>
<p>“Understood. Tch.”</p>
<p>“Did you click your tongue!?”</p>
<p>“? Isn’t that your imagination? There’s no way I would do something so crude in front of you.”</p>
<p>“It’s amazing you can lie so boldly… I’d doubt you, you know?”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>At the princess’s doubtful gaze, I feigned ignorance. Lies are also one of a butler’s weapons. If I can’t keep a straight face I can’t call myself capable and first-class.</p>
<p>Perhaps sensing that pushing wouldn’t change my answer from experience, the princess heaved a big sigh and then changed the subject.</p>
<p>“We, well, got quite off track but… Is it alright to just suddenly visit like this? I think it’s very rude to show up without notice.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I contacted them beforehand before leaving the mansion, and they’re closing the museum this afternoon. There are no visitors.”</p>
<p>“Going so far as to close up?”</p>
<p>“A natural decision, I’d say.”</p>
<p>The notice of intent this time is top secret that must not be heard by unrelated parties. Even discussing it in a room off limits to outsiders, it’s unclear who could be listening from right outside in such a state. We should avoid hushed talks in that situation.</p>
<p>Plus, since the targeted item is a national treasure this time, we can’t be too lax.</p>
<p>“A high class magical key that the empire prides itself on – the etoile magical key – is being targeted, so if we’re negligent it may be stolen.”</p>
<p>“The etoile magical key?”</p>
<p>Repeating it, Princess Krell brought her hand to her chin.</p>
<p>“If I remember right, it’s a magical key designated as the empire’s most important national treasure, said to hold power far beyond other magical keys.”</p>
<p>“Since no one has formed a contract with it, the powers it hides are a mystery.”</p>
<p>I glanced out the window at the imperial capital coming into view.</p>
<p>The power called magic, which uses mana – an energy that shouldn’t exist in this world – is employed by magicians, all of whom possess special tools collectively called magical keys.</p>
<p>Simply put, magical keys are tools indispensable for magicians to use magic, like partners bound in a magical contract.</p>
<p>There are still many mysteries surrounding magical keys, which continue to be treated as mysterious, unknown tools. The discovered magical keys are classified into seven ranks, with higher ranks holding greater, absolute power.</p>
<p>Mob of the Earth – First Heaven’s Key</p>
<p>Knight of the Garden – Second Heaven’s Key</p>
<p>Arbiter of Death – Third Heaven’s Key</p>
<p>Golden Paradise – Fourth Heaven’s Key</p>
<p>Evil’s Despair – Fifth Heaven’s Key</p>
<p>Wisdom of the Sky – Sixth Heaven’s Key</p>
<p>Holy Sanctum of God – Seventh Heaven’s Key</p>
<p>It’s said these ranks were recorded on a stone tablet unearthed from some ancient ruins several hundred years ago. The most numerous are the Second Heaven’s Keys. Conversely, the fewest are the highest rank, the Seventh Heaven’s Keys. Only five Seventh Heaven’s Keys have been discovered in the world, and since the last one appeared, no new key discoveries have been reported.</p>
<p>“While many magical keys exist around the world, the number becomes extremely low for the top two ranks, the Sixth and Seventh Heaven’s Keys. Combined there are probably less than fifty.”</p>
<p>“There are that few?”</p>
<p>“You may not grasp it using yourself or me as the standard, but they really are that precious. The etoile magical key being targeted this time is counted among the Sixth Heaven’s Keys.”</p>
<p>“In other words, an extremely limited high class magical key.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. There are many who want to obtain high rank magical keys, so it’s no wonder it’s being targeted.”</p>
<p>“I see. Though even if they get it, there’s no guarantee they can form a contract, right?”</p>
<p>High rank magical keys with advanced ranks can’t be contracted by just anyone. Unless the person is judged suitable by the key itself, it won’t become their partner. It’s said the Seventh Heaven’s Keys even draw in those they deem appropriate masters themselves.</p>
<p>“Well, I understand magicians wanting to form contracts with higher rank magical keys. A magician’s contract with their key is also a contract of life. If the magician dies the key remains unharmed, but if the key is destroyed, the magician will also die. To protect their life, they want strong keys as well.”</p>
<p>“Ah, so that’s why magical keys are called a magician’s life.”</p>
<p>“I explained it to you right after you formed a contract with your key, didn’t I? And said it’s important so don’t forget, right? Didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Oh, um~ did you~? I don’t really remember~”</p>
<p>Princess Krell conspicuously avoided my gaze and pretended to panic.</p>
<p>Even though I told her repeatedly to engrave it in her mind… When we get back, I’ll punish her with ankle whipping. Of course, restrained for a long session. I can picture her cute pained screams.</p>
<p>While imagining Princess Krell crying and screaming from the pain, the horse neighed and stopped. Looking out the window, a white dome-shaped building towered there.</p>
<p>It seems we’ve arrived.</p>
<p>“Shall we get off then? Wheelchair or princess carry, which do you prefer?”</p>
<p>“Um…”</p>
<p>Normally she’d yell ‘wheelchair!’ instantly, but surprisingly, after a brief hesitation,</p>
<p>“Princess carry is appealing but for today please bring the wheelchair,”</p>
<p>is what she said.</p>
<p>It’s rare for her to respond like that. As I looked at her, she had a smug ‘take that!’ kind of expression.</p>
<p>Certainly, how to respond to that is difficult. However, her later conduct and behavior are half-baked.</p>
<p>Please expect a counterattack in response to your reply, Princess.</p>
<p>“Understood. Then tomorrow we’ll have you move around all day by princess carry instead of wheelchair.”</p>
<p>“Have mercy!”</p>

<p>At my words, Princess Krell stuck out her lips sulkily.</p>
<p>That extremely cute expression makes me want to admire it for a good hour and then write an impression piece. However, it’s against my wishes to leave my beloved master unhappy. If possible, I want her smiling face always.</p>
<p>After getting off the carriage, we went around to the staff entrance at the back of the building rather than the main visitor entrance at the front.</p>
<p>When I called the mansion to notify them of our visit, I was instructed to enter through the staff entrance at the back as the main entrance would be locked. Even though they were the ones seeking our help, I feel bad for suddenly closing the museum in the afternoon, so without any particular complaints I agreed… However, for some reason the staff member I spoke to was unusually flustered, repeatedly apologizing remorsefully over and over. For a moment, I wondered if he found pleasure in apologizing, but on second thought it’s not unreasonable for him to be afraid.</p>
<p>Pushing Princess Krell’s wheelchair, it took a few minutes to get to the back of the museum.</p>
<p>“Um… Roth.”</p>
<p>“Yes, what is it?”</p>
<p>“What are they doing?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s exactly as it appears, no?”</p>
<p>She spoke as if asking ‘are you stupid? an idiot?’ Replying in a tone implying as much, Princess Krell hung her head and slumped her shoulders.</p>
<p>“What exactly… do you take me for!?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, of course you’re…”</p>
<p>I turned my face forward and saw the adults lined up, bowing deeply with shaking shoulders in front of the staff entrance we were headed to. Of course it’s probably not all the staff. Even though they closed, there’s still a lot of work to be done. But based on their age, it seems all the museum higher-ups are gathered.</p>
<p>Their shaking shoulders are probably from feeling awe and fear.</p>
<p>After the excellent bows, I returned my gaze to Princess Krell and told her.</p>
<p>“Let me say it again. It’s exactly as it appears.”</p>
<p>“Ohh… After meeting Roth, I’ve changed in various ways… Even though I used to be a weak, bullied existence, now just walking down the street makes me an evil overlord feared with awe and terror…”</p>
<p>“It’s extremely different from before.”</p>
<p>“It really is. But I didn’t want this kind of over-the-top awe…”</p>
<p>Speaking feebly, Princess Krell heaved a big sigh.</p>
<p>Unlike attention-seekers, being the center of attention is difficult for the princess. Naturally she dislikes being stared at by crowds, and doesn’t like going to crowded places either.</p>
<p>For someone with her inwardly-oriented personality, though not quite introverted, being regarded with awe and fear like this is by no means pleasant.</p>
<p>In other words – they are ruining the princess’s mood.</p>
<p>I brought my mouth near the princess’s ear and asked.</p>
<p>“If their attitude bothers you, should I blow all their minds away?”</p>
<p>“Don’t resort to violence… there’s no need to go that far.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s bear with it. I’ll comfort you plenty when we get back.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>At that, Princess Krell faced forward and tightened her expression.</p>
<p>Her dependence is steadily increasing.</p>
<p>I mentally took note, and pushed the wheelchair to approach the staff below.</p>
<p>“Um, first of all, thank you for suddenly closing the museum for us. The director… Mr. Strom Clayverna is…”</p>
<p>As Princess Krell looked around for the director, the youngest female staff member closest to us raised her hand. Her characteristic long, beautiful brown hair reaching her shoulders and matching colored eyes, she was around my shoulder height and tall for a woman. Pretty courageous.</p>
<p>She explained to us in a slightly shaking voice, leaving the silver ring on her left ring finger as-is.</p>
<p>“Th-the director is currently… in the exhibit room on the museum’s third floor… for the etoile magical key…”</p>
<p>“The third floor? Um, I don’t know the way, so could you show us? It’d help…”</p>
<p>“Ah, show you…?”</p>
<p>The woman – Erne – made an overtly reluctant face… no, she was on the verge of tears. She desperately looked to the other staff as if seeking help. But she only received encouragement to ‘do your best!’, and was effectively abandoned.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>She seemed about to really start crying… Ah, there are teardrops in her eyes.</p>
<p>…No helping it. I don’t want to lose any more time, and most of all, being cried at is annoying.</p>
<p>After telling Princess Krell to wait, I left the wheelchair and approached the woman with a hopeless expression, plastering a lie-filled smile on and touching her cheek.</p>
<p>“It’s fine not to have excessive anxiety. Many people are afraid, but Princess Krell is a very kind person. She absolutely won’t cause any danger. And if by some chance you happen to incur her wrath, I’m by her side.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Could you guide us to the director? I’d appreciate you taking on the task.”</p>
<p>I wiped the teardrops floating on the woman’s eyes with a handkerchief, casually taking her hand.</p>
<p>Then, flushing red, the woman nodded, seemingly forgetting to speak.</p>
<p>Perfect. Humans are so easy to handle, I love it!</p>
<p>After handing the handkerchief to the woman, I returned to Princess Krell. And my master’s cheeks were puffed out, glaring at me with sharp eyes. If I had to compare, like a squirrel who stuffed a large quantity of acorns in its cheek pouches, threatening an intruder on its territory.</p>
<p>“…Why am I being treated like the villain?”</p>
<p>Princess Krell sullenly said to me. Was that what bothered her?</p>
<p>“Give up. Even if just nominally, you’re royalty and an existence feared by the people.”</p>
<p>“It’s clearly for a different reason I’m feared…”</p>
<p>“It’s better than being tormented and mistreated. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Yes… haa.”</p>
<p>I pushed the wheelchair and headed to the woman who’d guide us.</p>
<p>“Then please. Um…”</p>
<p>“Oh, apologies for the late introduction. I’m Erne Oriudel.”</p>
<p>“A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I’m Roth Grantle, personal butler to Her Highness Princess Krell Carreralonde of the Third.”</p>
<p>After the brief self-introductions, we followed behind Erne and entered the museum.</p>
<p>With it being operated by the empire and displaying many national treasure-class valuables, the security inside was strict as expected at all times. Two or more security guards were stationed on each floor, all of whom were magicians with a certain level of ability. Though rank doesn’t determine everything in magician ability, they were without a doubt Third Heaven’s Key or higher.</p>
<p>As we just passed through floors, I murmured while looking at the floor exhibits. Or rather, the glass cases protecting them.</p>
<p>“Are the cases protecting the exhibits… specially strengthened anti-magical glass?”</p>
<p>Erne nodded at my murmur.</p>
<p>“That’s right. We use custom ordered ones that block all magic from Fourth Heaven’s Keys and below, and are also resistant to physical impacts. With the magician security guards too, it’s close to impossible for the exhibits to be stolen.”</p>
<p>“I see. With that level of security, our assistance may be unnecessary.”</p>
<p>“That might be the case.”</p>
<p>I spoke in a soft voice so as not to make her vigilant. As expected, Erne relaxed her initial tension and was at ease with me. With this much, her fear towards Princess Krell has probably already faded.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>“Roth… You seem to be enjoying yourself quite a bit.”</p>
<p>“Are you jealous? Pouting? Sulking? Whichever it is, I quite liked that way of speaking just now, so would you mind repeating it once more?”</p>
<p>“Tha-t’s no-t i-t!”</p>
<p>Waving her arms around in irritation, Princess Krell turned her face away with a huff and mumbled sullenly.</p>
<p>“It’s just… why are you kind to others yet harsh to me…?”</p>

<p>So it’s jealousy. Marvelous.</p>
<p>A jealous Princess Krell is very cute, but leaving her pouting could turn to displeasure eventually. If I’ve made her jealous, I have to properly care for her too. This is common sense worldwide.</p>
<p>I brought my mouth near the princess’s ear where Erne couldn’t hear.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Not just her… but all smiles I show anyone besides you are fakes.”</p>
<p>“But even if they’re fake, a smile is still a smile, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s better to smile than be curt with a third party, a stranger at that. It puts them at ease, improves their impression, and various advantages are born. This is what’s called interpersonal skills. And the 100% pure, deceit-free smiles are only for you, Princess.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a smile.”</p>
<p>“Think back on my normal conduct. I don’t smile at a blunderer like you. I only give you affectionate words and love.”</p>
<p>“I think those should come as a set with smiles.”</p>
<p>“You’ll definitely have the chance to see them someday, so look forward to it.”</p>
<p>Though who knows when someday will be.</p>
<p>I muttered inwardly as I pulled my face away from Princess Krell and called out to Erne, who kept glancing this way as she walked ahead.</p>
<p>“Miss Erne. As I said earlier, Princess Krell isn’t someone to be feared.”</p>
<p>“Oh, um, it’s just… she’s such an exalted person living in a different world from me, so of course I…”</p>
<p>For an instant, Erne looked at Princess Krell but immediately averted her gaze awkwardly.</p>
<p>So she can’t be intimate and loved like other royalty, after all?</p>
<p>Princess Krell has never participated in public duties, and most citizens only know the name Krell Carreralonde the Third Princess. With the mystique of being royalty and bad rumors taking root, it’s said she’s a fearsome person who won’t tolerate the slightest rudeness.</p>
<p>Especially the imperial palace staff are very afraid of her. They seem to have done various things to the princess in the past, so they probably fear retaliation… Though of course, my presence factors largely as well.</p>
<p>“It’s as Roth says.”</p>
<p>There, Princess Krell smiled at Erne and said,</p>
<p>“I’m not someone to be feared. My body is frail, and without someone’s support I can’t even live properly. On top of that, I don’t have the disposition to stand above others despite being royalty.”</p>
<p>“Yes. She’s an incompetent, good-for-nothing princess who can only spin her wheels uselessly at everything she does. Pitiful.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that too harsh?”</p>
<p>I silently tilted my head since it was the truth. Perhaps realizing it was factual, Princess Krell didn’t say anything back and just glared at me.</p>
<p>“Jealousy is an ugly thing.”</p>
<p>Watching our interaction, Erne brought her hand to her mouth as she laughed and stopped in front of a huge iron door. Above it was written ‘Magical Keys Room’ in small letters.</p>
<p>In other words, the etoile magical key is exhibited here, and the client director is inside.</p>
<p>Erne knocked on the door three times firmly and slowly pushed it open.</p>
<p>“Director, I’ve brought Her Highness Princess Krell and her attendant.”</p>
<p>Following Erne into the room first, Princess Krell and I also went inside.</p>
<p>Frankly put, it was impressive in one word.</p>
<p>A square room. Displayed in the glass cases lining the walls were dozens of magical keys, even including some classified as Fifth Heaven’s Keys. As a magician proud to be first-rate, I can’t help but be interested in the many valuable keys.</p>
<p>“Were there any magical keys that caught your interest?”</p>
<p>“I may be Princess Krell’s butler, but first I’m a top-class magician. All magical keys have appeal regardless of rank.”</p>
<p>At my reply, Princess Krell said in surprise,</p>
<p>“Oh my, I think there’s only one key in this room that outranks Roth’s though?”</p>
<p>“You mean… that one?”</p>
<p>I shifted my gaze to the single glass case in the center of the room.</p>
<p>Frankly put, it was anomalous. Even through the glass case I could feel the dense mana the key contained, and it had some kind of allure making me reluctant to look away.</p>
<p>Right next to that magical key, about a meter from the glass case, a man was standing upright looking at us. His hair was burnt umber mixed with white, slicked back, and he wore black-rimmed glasses. Behind the lenses kind eyes could be seen, the very image of a gentleman the word suits.</p>
<p>Meeting our eyes, he brought his hand to his chest and politely bowed once.</p>
<p>Since he’s in this room, that man must be…</p>
<p>Guessing the man’s identity, I moved my stopped feet and the wheelchair and walked over to him. As I did, the man pasted a gentle smile on his face and introduced himself.</p>
<p>“A pleasure to meet you for the first time, Princess Krell Carreralonde. And Mr. Roth Grantle, her attendant. Thank you for taking the time to visit us today. I’m the museum director, Strom Clayverna.”</p>
<p>“Likewise, a pleasu- huh?”</p>
<p>After receiving the director’s greeting, Princess Krell tilted her head in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“Director, you’re male? From the handwriting I thought the letter was from a woman…”</p>
<p>“Ah, she’s the one who wrote the letter.”</p>
<p>Understanding the princess’s reaction, the director gestured at the nearby Erne.</p>
<p>“When the notice arrived, my hands happened to be dirty… so I had Erne write it in my stead.”</p>
<p>“I see, so that’s what happened…”</p>
<p>“Princess Krell was worried needlessly.”</p>
<p>“Well… Since there are many women at the museum, I think it was the right call coming along. Roth might unnecessarily plant extra feelings otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Princess, your mouth is foul.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t say that to me alone.”</p>
<p>After our normal back-and-forth, I turned to the director.</p>
<p>Since he seems to already know about us, self-introductions are unnecessary. I want to get to discussing the theft notice written in the letter right away, but… There’s one thing I absolutely have to say first.</p>
<p>“Director. While you may have your circumstances, isn’t it a bit discourteous for the highest person in charge of this museum to not come out and greet Princess Krell, royalty as she is?”</p>
<p>“Ro-Roth!”</p>
<p>“Princess, this is important.”</p>
<p>Kind-hearted Princess Krell might forgive small matters, but if she lets this slide once, it will mean the same treatment will be permitted for other royalty. There must not be a precedent of tolerating some disrespect.</p>
<p>When I glared slightly, the director apologized remorsefully and bowed his head.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>“Sincerest apologies. You’re completely right, it was inexcusable discourtesy to one of your standing. Please impose any punishment on me.”</p>
<p>Hearing the apologetic words, Princess Krell frantically waved both hands.</p>
<p>“Th-that’s fine! Rather, we’re the ones at fault for dropping by so suddenly… Let’s call it even, alright? Roth, that’s fine with you too, right?”</p>
<p>“If that is how you judge it, Princess, I have no objections. However, might I ask your reason for remaining in this room, Director?”</p>
<p>“I-I see…”</p>
<p>The director nodded over and over, a blind spot. Really, those entrusted with many valuable items should be able to come up with this much easily. I want to see the face of the imperial official who appointed him.</p>
<p>“But in the first place, I think this case should have been handled by the imperial government rather than the black suggestion box. Did you consult the imperial palace?”</p>
<p>“I did make an inquiry, but they dismissed it as mischief…”</p>
<p>“Well… I’m not surprised.”</p>
<p>How peace-addled can they be when national treasures might be targeted? I didn’t trust the imperial government to begin with and was disappointed, but this case has made me lose even more faith.</p>
<p>But then it’s likely any request from the director to increase security would also be refused at the threshold. Troublesome, but it can’t be helped.</p>
<p>“I’ll contact the imperial palace myself. Also, for the time being, let’s increase the guards in this room by two.”</p>
<p>“Is it alright not to move the magical key to the back?”</p>
<p>“Moving it to the back also means fewer eyes on it. Leaving it exhibited in this room means there are visitors watching, so the culprit can’t easily commit the crime.”</p>
<p>The points to be wary of are these two. I’ll request trustworthy magicians from the imperial palace for security that day, and increase normal security in this exhibit room.</p>
<p>With security already strict at the Magical Museum, this much should be plenty.</p>
<p>When I stopped the fountain pen that had been running across the memo paper, Princess Krell said to the director,</p>
<p>“We’ll participate in security on the day too.”</p>
<p>“Will that be alright?”</p>
<p>“Yes. With an imperial treasure being targeted, I as royalty and a magician feel obligated to lend my assistance as well. That’s fine, right Roth?”</p>
<p>“As you command, my lord.”</p>
<p>If Princess Krell says she’ll go, I don’t have the option not to accompany her. If alone, she might meet with danger from the other guards.</p>
<p>Besides, Princess Krell probably can’t even make it to the museum alone in the first place. I can picture her getting lost on the way and crying in the carriage. I want to hold and comfort her all night- I tore the memo paper.</p>
<p>“I’ve written down what the director should do, so please refer to it as a reference.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes this is- huh!?”</p>
<p>When I handed the memo to the director- Thud!, some sound for adding drama resounded, shaking my eardrums. When I looked around going ‘huh?’, barriers rose from the floor, blocking our escape as if to trap us. Forming a circle with the etoile magical key at the center, exactly.</p>
<p>“Director, what’s this?”</p>
<p>“Could it be… Erne?”</p>
<p>Moving her neck stiffly like a clockwork doll, the director looked to Erne, who had one hand touching the glass case containing the etoile magical key. I thought she hadn’t participated in the conversation at all, so what is she doing?</p>
<p>She had rounded eyes in shock herself, dripping what seemed to be cold sweat profusely.</p>
<p>“Director… Why haven’t you deactivated it?”</p>
<p>“Erne, why are you touching the glass case…?”</p>
<p>After a beat,</p>
<p>“”…By accident.””</p>
<p>Right after both answered the other’s question with that- I sensed dense mana being generated overhead and looked up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>I understood the instant I saw, but the barriers probably appeared to prevent escape. And with Erne touching the glass case, it’s likely an escape prevention trap to contain those trying to steal the etoile magical key.</p>
<p>I get that much, and it shows they have solid security, so good.</p>
<p>However… this is overdoing it.</p>
<p>“A high voltage lightning cannon… would turn the culprit to charcoal…”</p>
<p>“That’s some intense security.”</p>
<p>“Is this the time to speak so lightly? We’ll be entirely roasted at this rate, thanks to some foolhardy pair.”</p>

<p>I say that maliciously, but the culprits have already stopped listening. Lying face down, holding their heads and trembling. Morons. At least try to protect Princess Krell.</p>
<p>In contrast, Princess Krell laughed merrily and grasped my hand.</p>
<p>“That’s scary but… My butler will definitely protect me, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course. No matter the magic, I will block all of it – Guardian Key.”</p>
<p>I thrust out my right hand and muttered my beloved key’s name.</p>
<p>In that moment, a large key giving off a deep blue radiance appeared before me, around 50 centimeters long.</p>
<p>It had an artistic spiral tip, was clad in blue mana, and shone reflecting light. Grasping it powerfully as it appeared made an indescribable feeling of omnipotence well up inside me. With this partner I can overcome any hardship. At the same time, I feel something like a bond.</p>
<p>“-Release.”</p>
<p>I twisted the magical key thrust into empty space counter-clockwise.</p>
<p>Then, a click I shouldn’t have been able to hear in the surroundings rang out- immediately following, spears of violent violet lightning roared as they rained down from the ceiling. A direct hit would undoubtedly reduce our bodies to blackened crisps.</p>
<p>But that future will not come to pass.</p>
<p>“-Twin Royal Shield.”</p>
<p>The instant I raised the magical key in my right hand overhead, a diamond-shaped dual barrier instantly appeared covering us. Glittering as it chaotically reflected the exhibit room’s lighting and the lightning inside, it perfectly blocked the lightning’s might. All impacts, force, and roaring were rendered meaningless.</p>
<p>Though it would have been no joke taking that lightning head on… Is this all?</p>
<p>Spitting in my chest, I spoke to Princess Krell next to me looking up overhead.</p>
<p>“Please wait a moment, Princess Krell. It will stop soon.”</p>
<p>“Yes. As always, a beautifully enchanting barrier. I feel I could watch it forever.”</p>
<p>“You honor me immensely. I also think I could watch your beautiful face for any number of hours, days, or years.”</p>
<p>“That would be troubling.”</p>
<p>As we had that exchange, after waiting one minute-</p>
<p>The light and mana reaction from the raining lightning completely disappeared, so I confirmed and dispelled the barrier. I thought the exhibit room might have become a dreadful scene, but looking around, it was the same as before. I see, it seems to be calculated to prevent any damage to the exhibits. Though that doesn’t change it being excessive.</p>
<p>“Princess Krell, are you hurt?”</p>
<p>“Of course not.”</p>
<p>“I’m aware.”</p>
<p>“Then why’d you ask!?”</p>
<p>“Obligatory safety confirmation. Now then.”</p>
<p>After soothing Princess Krell by stroking her hair, I approached the two breathing sighs of relief and knelt down.</p>
<p>“You two, any last words? I’ll graciously allow three letters for now.”</p>
<p>“Don’t jump ahead, Roth!”</p>
<p>Princess Krell rushed over from the wheelchair and grasped my shoulder. Still unsatisfied, I turned to face her and spoke while looking closely at her beautiful face.</p>
<p>“If you had exposed my most precious Princess Krell to mortal danger, proper etiquette would be displaying your head before the masses. In my book, that is.”</p>
<p>“Think in terms of common social norms, not Roth’s! And most things aren’t dangerous with you by my side anyway!”</p>
<p>“Oh my, we’re both still teenagers so… please keep that kind of thing to the bed.”</p>
<p>“Just what are you talking about!”</p>
<p>After yelling extensively, I put Princess Krell back in the wheelchair. She seems to be in a good mood today for some reason.</p>
<p>“I’m joking.”</p>
<p>“That’s why Roth’s jokes don’t sound like jokes…”</p>
<p>“I’m skilled at making lies seem not to be lies. However, I’ll at least hear your excuses.”</p>
<p>A slip-up won’t get them off lightly. If it had just been Princess Krell here without me… the possibility exists this museum could have sunk to the bottom of the earth. Of course, Princess Krell would have been the only survivor. I have to admonish them properly here, or they might repeat the mistake.</p>
<p>Waiting for the two to speak, the director was the first to open his mouth.</p>
<p>“…I find it strange to be alive now.”</p>
<p>“I suppose so. You would have died if I hadn’t been here.”</p>
<p>Before adding ‘certainly’- the director deeply bowed his head.</p>
<p>“Sincerest apologies. I put you two, who came to help, in danger. I take full responsibility, so impose any punishment on me.”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s not it, Director! I’m also at fault for carelessly touching the glass case!”</p>
<p>“Erne, be silent!”</p>
<p>“But-“</p>
<p>Princess Krell and I exchanged looks.</p>
<p>This is that situation. Where the victim feels like the offender. And just silently watching, we don’t know how to react, only feeling awkward. It starts to feel foolish to deal with them. Even though we’re the injured party.</p>
<p>“Haah. Princess Krell.”</p>
<p>At my weary call, she nodded and spoke to the two.</p>
<p>“Since there’s no particular harm done, it’s fine if you reflect on it. Just don’t let this happen again.”</p>
<p>“…We humbly thank you for your generous spirit.”</p>
<p>We just didn’t feel like watching their fruitless fight over blame.</p>
<p>Haaah, seriously. I only intended to listen a little and give advice, but it tired me out more than expected. I want to hurry home and get foot massages from Princess Krell and heal.</p>
<p>As I thought that and tried to leave pushing the wheelchair, the director called out to me.</p>
<p>“By the way, about Roth’s magical key earlier…”</p>
<p>“Director. Prying into a magician’s magical key or magic is a breach of manners.”</p>
<p>I say that, but as expected the director persisted.</p>
<p>“I’m aware. However, I can’t help but ask as a fledgling researcher.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I asked Princess Krell what to do, and she told me, ‘It’s probably fine to tell him a little?’ As ever, it seems she has a generous spirit.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>With a sighing nod, I faced the director.</p>
<p>“My magical key is- the Guardian Shield Key. Its rank is Sixth Heaven’s Key. None stand above me in protection.”</p>
<p>There. This time we finally left the exhibit room.</p>
<p>The director still seemed to have more to say, but suppressed his desires well, and together with Erne beside him, continued bowing until our figures disappeared day too.”</p>
<p>“Will that be alright?”</p>
<p>“Yes. With an imperial treasure being targeted, I as royalty and a magician feel obligated to lend my assistance as well. That’s fine, right Roth?”</p>
<p>“As you command, my lord.”</p>
<p>If Princess Krell says she’ll go, I don’t have the option not to accompany her. If alone, she might meet with danger from the other guards.</p>

<p>“Just what are you talking about!”</p>
<p>After yelling extensively, I put Princess Krell back in the wheelchair. She seems to be in a good mood today for some reason.</p>
<p>“I’m joking.”</p>
<p>“That’s why Roth’s jokes don’t sound like jokes…”</p>
<p>“I’m skilled at making lies seem not to be lies. However, I’ll at least hear your excuses.”</p>
<p>A slip-up won’t get them off lightly. If it had just been Princess Krell here without me… the possibility exists this museum could have sunk to the bottom of the earth. Of course, Princess Krell would have been the only survivor. I have to admonish them properly here, or they might repeat the mistake.</p>
<p>Waiting for the two to speak, the director was the first to open his mouth.</p>
<p>“…I find it strange to be alive now.”</p>
<p>“I suppose so. You would have died if I hadn’t been here.”</p>
<p>Before adding ‘certainly’- the director deeply bowed his head.</p>
<p>“Sincerest apologies. I put you two, who came to help, in danger. I take full responsibility, so impose any punishment on me.”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s not it, Director! I’m also at fault for carelessly touching the glass case!”</p>
<p>“Erne, be silent!”</p>
<p>“But-“</p>
<p>Princess Krell and I exchanged looks.</p>
<p>This is that situation. Where the victim feels like the offender. And just silently watching, we don’t know how to react, only feeling awkward. It starts to feel foolish to deal with them. Even though we’re the injured party.</p>
<p>“Haah. Princess Krell.”</p>
<p>At my weary call, she nodded and spoke to the two.</p>
<p>“Since there’s no particular harm done, it’s fine if you reflect on it. Just don’t let this happen again.”</p>
<p>“…We humbly thank you for your generous spirit.”</p>
<p>We just didn’t feel like watching their fruitless fight over blame.</p>
<p>Haaah, seriously. I only intended to listen a little and give advice, but it tired me out more than expected. I want to hurry home and get foot massages from Princess Krell and heal.</p>
<p>As I thought that and tried to leave pushing the wheelchair, the director called out to me.</p>
<p>“By the way, about Roth’s magical key earlier…”</p>
<p>“Director. Prying into a magician’s magical key or magic is a breach of manners.”</p>
<p>I say that, but as expected the director persisted.</p>
<p>“I’m aware. However, I can’t help but ask as a fledgling researcher.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I asked Princess Krell what to do, and she told me, ‘It’s probably fine to tell him a little?’ As ever, it seems she has a generous spirit.</p>
<p>With a sighing nod, I faced the director.</p>
<p>“My magical key is- the Guardian Shield Key. Its rank is Sixth Heaven’s Key. None stand above me in protection.”</p>
<p>There. This time we finally left the exhibit room.</p>
<p>The director still seemed to have more to say, but suppressed his desires well, and together with Erne beside him, continued bowing until our figures disappeared.</p>
