<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Burnt Bacon and Egg</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go already!~ Hurry up!~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t get too close to me. It won’t look good to other people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of Aoi’s classmates, Satou Takayuki, was about to enter a hotel with a young woman in a business suit. Seeing this, she was confused on how to react to the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this what you’d call compensated dating? …No, no, even so, it’s still a little…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi hid her boast-worthy body behind a pole, her eyes focused on the two people in front of her as she looked for an answer that she failed to find. She wanted to think that it was all her misunderstanding and pretend to not have seen them, but her own beliefs made her unable to do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because this action wasn’t ‘right.’ The heroes that Aoi looked up to wouldn’t turn a blind eye to this kind of thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good grief… Seriously, how did I find myself in this kind of situation?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Despite showing a cramped smile, Aoi still tried to judge the situation rationally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tried to recall what happened up to this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though I don’t have time for this…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, how did Aoi manage to witness this scene?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To find out about the cause, we have to go back a few hours prior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miyama Aoi was in her first year of high school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Long, raven-colored hair. Mature-looking, dignified beauty. A tall height, even taller than the average boys. Slender arms and legs, all the curves in her body were in the right places. The mole under her left eyes, along with her bewitching smile would capture the heart of anyone who laid their eyes on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On top of that, her appearance wasn’t her only charm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aoi-chan, Aoi-chan, I don’t understand this problem, can you help me?…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Which one? Ah, that one. I get you, it’s a hard one for me too. What I did to solve it was to use the same method as the previous problem and go from there…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In line with her intelligent-look, she was also good at studying. Moreover, she was good at teaching others. Her classmates would always thank her for her easy-to-understand explanation that they received whenever they came to ask her questions about their studies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, that’s a first year? She doesn’t look like an amateur at all!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s so tall… Taller than the rest of us… The basketball and volleyball club will go to war to get her on their side…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her excellence wasn’t limited to her studies as she was as accomplished in sports. She was so talented that she managed to catch the eyes of all the sports clubs the moment she entered the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Above all, there was a certain incident that boosted her popularity to sky high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Miyama-san, help! Satou got into a conflict with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpais</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">! They’re still staring at each other, but they could start a fistfight at any moment!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it. You should call the teachers first, I’ll try to calm them down in the meantime.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the early school year, one of her classmates, Satou Takayuki, had a standoff with a group of second years. It was Aoi’s resolute attitude that prevented the incident from turning into a massive brawl between the two sides.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I’ll try to tell them as quickly as possible! But, Miyama-san, why are you carrying that bucket? Wait, was that water from the toilet?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The method she used to resolve the incident was a rather forceful one though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hm? What is it, Miss Honor Student? You should get away from here, it’s danger—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Firstly, she dumped the bucket of water on Takayuki to calm him down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please forgive him, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpais</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“““Y-Yes…”””</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, without a pause, she bowed her head toward the second years who had been staring daggers at Takayuki. Seeing her actions, the venom in their eyes were instantly gone and they seemed ready to let him off with this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this incident resolved, Aoi’s presence became more well-known throughout the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, she managed to become the central figure for the freshmen in a span of a single month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Miyama-san, Miyama-san! Are you free today? If so, can you go to the art club with me? My </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> asked me to bring you there with me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No can do. Miyama said that she can’t do club activities because she has to help out at home. So, until you’re needed, Miyama, how about we go karaoke?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Karaoke with Miyama? Can the boys join too?~ If so, can I go with you guys?~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren’t you in the soccer club? Your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> will chew on your a** if you miss out on the first day of club, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she became a popular girl, naturally, her classmates started to try to hang out with her. They’d inquire about her schedule and send out various invitations to spend more time with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Karaoke, huh? …Hm, that’s a good idea. A good way to get to know each other better…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right?! Then, let’s go~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On one condition, though. Rope Satou in too, let’s make it a class event.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, just because she was popular, that didn’t mean Aoi would let everyone lead her by the nose. Aoi was the type of a person who’d state out her intention clearly. She was also good at controlling the conversation so that she didn’t get swept by the other party’s momentum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Satou is a little… You know… Ahaha…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So lame. This guy is obviously scared of Satou.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re that scared, just go to your club already, Suzuki!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps due to the well-known delinquent’s name being mentioned, the boy’s momentum quietened down considerably. Seeing this, the girls immediately pounced on him. But, Aoi didn’t pay any heed to that scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Satou-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school, by herself, Aoi approached the isolated delinquent. Said delinquent was Takayuki, the boy who almost got into a fight with a group of second years not long after the school started. There was a rumor that he did it because he was protecting a girl that was being harassed by the second years, but the rumor didn’t stop him from being isolated by the rest of the class. At best, the rumor only made people stop treating him like a delinquent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you want to go karaoke with us?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miyama Aoi was the only person who was able to send out such an invitation to someone like him. The act left the other classmates surrounding her dumbfounded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, Aoi wasn’t a saint. She could express her likes and dislikes clearly and Takayuki was definitely someone she disliked. However, despite her personal feelings, it was clearly against her sense of justice that someone who wasn’t even a real delinquent was being isolated like this. Hence, she tried to change the boy’s situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m flattered by that invitation, but dear Miss Honor Student, sadly I’m born with the skill called ‘reading the air’, you see?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, I’m surprised. I called out to you because I thought you’re unable to do exactly that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, their faces are clearly screaming for me to not come with them, it isn’t hard to figure that out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After being called out, Takayuki didn’t even try to look at Aoi’s direction as he continued fiddling with his phone. After he said his piece, he stood up and moved his gaze around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing that, the students around him who were expressing their displeasure, immediately jolted in surprise. Their shoulders shook at the sight of him. However, Aoi didn’t even flinch. Wearing her beautiful smile, she confronted Takayuki once more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In any case, keep your meddling in moderation, please, Miss Honor Student.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s for me to decide, Satou-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without any hesitation, Takayuki sent her a fearless grin, turned his back on her and left the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi just saw him off until his back left her sight before turning around to her classmates. With a shrug, she said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Too bad, I got dumped.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a reason why her classmates put complete faith in her. She wasn’t just a pretty face or a brainless leader that could only say pretty things. She was a real leader with an unshakeable will.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This rooted from her self-confidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that scared me… Miyama-san, you got guts, seriously!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know right? Unlike that Suzuki guy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you bringing me to this?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A month after the school year started, she already showed enough achievements that she could be proud of. Everyone could safely depend on her. Her school life started off well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sorry! Aoi, I want to ask you something, can you come with me for a second?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the case, until this moment came.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You need a love advice? From me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi slipped out of the classroom with the person who asked for her help and went to the back of the school building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. Please help me, you’re the only one I can count on…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other person was Ukai Tomoe. Aoi and her had been friends since middle school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although her classmates were inviting her to karaoke, Aoi herself liked Tomoe quite a lot and Tomoe was someone who’d prefer to get things done by herself rather than asking for help. Situations where she’d come out to ask for Aoi’s help like this were rare, so it was only natural that Aoi would prioritize helping her out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm, fine. Ever since my first love was broken, I hated all kinds of love stories, but for you, I’ll be your love counselor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Wait, did I ask the wrong person for help?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To those words, Aoi showed Tomoe a fearless grin, an expression that she’d never show to her classmates. In response, Tomoe’s tense body relaxed a little as she showed a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just kidding, but are you sure you want to ask me for love advice, Tomoe? I only ever confessed to someone once and honestly it was a sh**ty confession.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sh**ty confession?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Basically, I just forced my ideal into that person and it was a huge mess. I don’t think you should use it as a reference.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-That’s… But, you received a lot of confessions from boys, at least, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, but you know, most of them were just half-hearted confessions that everyone would forget in ten seconds. Honestly, I think you’d better ask someone other than me, or I’ll end up destroying your love life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, are you calling yourself the romcom destroyer now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Aoi’s joke, Tomoe let out a giggle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl had natural brown hair that was tied into a ponytail. Her wheat-colored skin looked healthy and smooth. She had a slender, yet trained body, courtesy of her being a member of the track team. Normally, there would be a cheerful smile decorating her cute face, but this time, her expression was grim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what do you want me to do? Yes, I advertise myself as an omnipotent beauty, but there are also things that I can’t do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, yes, yes, I can’t even call you a narcissist because you’re just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> capable, but has anyone ever told you that your personality is rotten? Anyway, you should be able to help me, it isn’t a big problem or anything… Um… I just want you to introduce me to a certain </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the art club…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe just brushed off Aoi’s arrogant and prideful words and stated her business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… I guess I can do that much… What’s his name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… It was…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name that came out of Tomoe’s mouth was the name of a second year student from the art club. But the name sounded feminine for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Tomoe, I’ll help you out to the best of my abilities if things come down to it, but this love consultation isn’t for you, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha… You know…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought you’re going to confess to your childhood friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Aoi’s words, Tomoe’s face turned ugly, like a child that was about to cry. But it only persisted for a moment before she wore a cheerful smile. She made her voice a tone higher, trying to hide her true feelings about the matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not! Jeez, I told you that Nao and I are just childhood friends, nothing more!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomoe, you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-Besides!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After stumbling on her words for a moment, Tomoe forced herself to speak in an upbeat and cheerful tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nao found someone that he likes! Not me, but a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">from the art club! She seems to be mature, kind and smart too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words were enough for Aoi to fully grasp the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe was walking on the path of unrequited love.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since I’m his childhood friend, I have to help him out, right? That guy is hopeless at everything other than baseball. He’s especially hopeless about love!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Tomoe, who was forcing herself to act cheerfully, Aoi let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I agree with you. Your childhood friend is hopeless.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good grief…” Aoi said as she grabbed Tomoe’s hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Aoi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you keep acting like this, you’ll be a bother to your clubmates, so come with me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She dragged her puzzled friend by the hand and moved out to a different location to find out more about the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As far as Aoi knew, Tomoe was especially close to her childhood friend, Mihara Naotsugu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their relationship went as well as your typical childhood friend relationship that one would find in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">anime</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Their houses were next to each other, they knew each other for so long that one wouldn’t be surprised if they said that they introduced themselves to each other the moment they came out from their mothers’ wombs. They went to the same school from preschool to high school. Oftentimes, people around them would call them ‘married couple’ or ‘siblings’, but whichever it was, it was a general consensus that they were meant for each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, why did Naotsugu fall in love with another girl?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, no, no, that’s not it, Aoi! Nao and I are like siblings! Family! We’re too close to each other to consider each other as a romantic interest!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The answer came out of Tomoe’s mouth along with a painful smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In her normal state, Tomoe would act as a mood-maker by utilizing her cheerful smile to brighten the atmosphere around her. But in her current state, the same cheerful smile looked painfully awkward. This state of hers was enough to convince her clubmates that she wasn’t in the situation where she could afford to attend her club activities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;*Sigh*. Look here, Tomoe, I really don’t care about which girl that childhood friend of yours ended up with. I don’t mind introducing that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to him, not at all. Just stop forcing yourself to smile, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Ahaha… But, Aoi—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell me everything. That’s my condition before I start helping you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You’re so mean, Aoi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of them had moved from the back of the school building to a restaurant located in front of the station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before Tomoe reported that she wanted to take a day off from her club activities, she texted one of her clubmates about it, stating that she didn’t feel that good and wanted to go home early. The reply to that text was, ‘I know it, you’ve been looking off all day,’ and she easily got the permission for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was then when Aoi realized that her best friend was in a worse state than she imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, at this time of the day, barely anyone from our school comes here. Besides, I can see if someone familiar comes in from here, you don’t need to worry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow, you’re so thoughtful, Aoi. Amazing. The best. A perfect beauty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have to go this far if I want to make you talk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so, huh? Hahaha… I’m really no match for you, Aoi…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Along with a dry laugh, Tomoe let out a big sigh before her face crumpled pitifully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know… Like I said, there’s nothing going on between us. Nao and I are childhood friends. The feelings he has toward me is ‘love toward family members’ instead of ‘love toward the opposite s*x’. It’s not strange that Nao fell in love with someone else…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m asking this just to make sure. Are you sure that isn’t a misunderstanding on your part?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it isn’t a misunderstanding.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shaking her head slowly, Tomoe told Aoi that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was Nao who told me about it first… He told me that he found someone that he loves…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no room for misunderstanding based on his words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi’s eyes widened involuntarily. Her lips trembled for a moment before forming a cruel looking smile. Her smile still looked pretty, but it made everyone who saw it felt a chill running down their spines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait for me here, I’m going to break a motherf***er’s bones real quick.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aoi?! Wait, calm down a little!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m calm. Calm enough to spare his dominant arm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That isn’t the point! His future as a baseball player will be ruined if you break any of his bones!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a desperate persuasion from Tomoe, Aoi managed to suppress her anger. She was currently taking a few deep breaths while sitting down on her chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Phew. I calmed down. Now that I think about it, breaking his bone is a bad idea. If I want to deal with him, I have to do it in a way that doesn’t leave physical evidence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You haven’t calmed down at all!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Just kidding. I won’t actually do it, so calm down. Still, what he did was horrible. You like him, don’t you, Tomoe?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, that’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I may not know much about love talks, but there’s no way that I’ll ignore your situation. You’re my best friend. We’ve spent our middle school lives together. I won’t let your love life end this way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe’s shoulders shook as she heard Aoi’s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, really? Is it that obvious that I like him?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, whenever you’re talking with him, you always wear that ‘maiden-in-love’ look.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The only one who isn’t aware of your feelings toward him back in middle school is that dense idiot. Honestly, if we were to tell our friends from middle school about this, they’d be more than happy enough to finish him off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Uuu…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl was shocked to find out that more people knew about her feelings than she expected. But, after letting out a long groan, she seemed to be over it and moved on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-But, Aoi… I’m happy for him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her cheeks were tinted with shades of red as she confessed her feelings to Aoi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nao has always been staying by my side, protecting me like I’m his real sister. If she could fall in love with someone without minding my presence, it would make me feel happy…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe looked resolute and unwavering as she said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Tomoe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I said that, but I know that I’ll mess it up somehow, so please, Aoi, help me! I want to help him with his love!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her best friend asking for help while disregarding her pain, Aoi couldn’t bear to reject her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if it meant to send her off to a thorny path, she just couldn’t bring herself to deny Tomoe’s decision to walk on that path.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it, I’ll see what I can do. But keep in mind that even if I managed to introduce that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to you, it doesn’t mean that everything will work out fine, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm! Thank you, Aoi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the blossoming smile on her best friend’s face, Aoi’s heart ached.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t mind it. I’m only helping you for my own self-satisfaction, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi was more than familiar with the pain that was hidden beneath her best friend’s pretty smile.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This happened during the summer vacation back when Aoi was still in the third year of grade school. Miyama Aoi found herself in distress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It happened on a mountain in her neighborhood. Aoi wandered along the mountain paths that were covered in thick greenery. The cause of this act was she was trying to find a place to hide, so she went to the path no one would ever come to normally. The problem here was she didn’t take into account that the sun would be setting soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Uu…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when the sun had finally set, she was stuck in a pitch dark path where barely any light could go through. She had no choice but to wander around aimlessly until she found an abandoned shrine in the middle of the forest. Having nowhere else to go, she hid her body inside the dilapidated shrine and began to weep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the reason she started crying wasn’t because of her distress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it because of the darkness? The anxiety of not knowing when she could return to her normal life? The fear of the possibility that a mountain beast might come to prey on her? For the young Aoi, all of those were trivial matters, things that were not worth mentioning. As for her, the pain that was eating her heart out overpowered any feelings that the darkness brought her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pain of her broken heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu… Haru-kun, you dummy…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi was heartbroken as she had confessed her feelings to the person that she admired, but all she got was a clear rejection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the young Aoi didn’t think about the reason why she was rejected in the first place. Instead, she spent her time sulking about the fact that she got rejected by said person. And so, to make herself feel better and to make said person feel bad, Aoi decided to hide herself in a secluded place. She was too young to think about the consequences of such actions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hic… It was… My first time confessing… Hic… But you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surrounded by the darkness, tears kept pouring from Aoi’s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her distress was caused by her rash behavior, but she wouldn’t realize it until much later. The young Aoi foolishly believed that she was so pretty that everyone in the world liked her and rejecting her was the same as rejecting herself as a human being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hate you… I hate you so much, Haru-kun…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how many tears she shed, no matter how many curses she uttered, the pain in her heart didn’t disappear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, no matter how things actually went, it was her first time experiencing love and being heartbroken at the same time. The pain that she felt was akin to being pierced by thousands of needles. No matter how many times she screamed, the pain didn’t disappear, nor did someone come over to comfort her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, it was her just deserts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, the reason why she got rejected was because she selfishly imposed her own selfish ideal on the boy she confessed to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the reason why no one came over to comfort her was because she was the one who went to a deserted place like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Someone, please, save me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With nothing in sight, in the pitch darkness, Aoi’s heart began to reach its limit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from the pain of her broken heart, she also had to bear with the anxiety over the fact that there was no other person nearby.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If left alone, the fear and pain that she felt would eventually eat her heart out and leave a traumatic scar on her mind. That was only if they didn’t end up killing her heart off completely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi~ Is anyone there?~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those horrible things would definitely happen if a certain boy’s inaudible voice didn’t reach Aoi’s ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hic. Who is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She answered his call with a voice filled with both anxiety and anticipation. The boy’s voice was familiar, but she had a vague idea that this encounter wouldn’t lead to a romantic one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, such a troublesome princess. I’m here to pick you up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a boy came over to her side with a flashlight in hand. He had the same height as her, but his appearance was unruly. Unlike adults, it felt like she couldn’t really depend on him for anything. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, the young Aoi didn’t know. It was this boy who’d eventually save her from her pain. It was this boy who’d eventually become her ‘hero.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This encounter with the young ‘hero’ would turn into the most impactful moment of her life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;*Sighs*. What do I do now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi was on her way back after parting ways with Tomoe at the restaurant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wandering around while looking at the passersby&#8217;s faces. Her expression would alternate between hopeful and disappointment as she tried to compare the people’s faces with a particular boy’s face from her memory. This was a bad habit that Aoi always did whenever she was feeling hopeless about something. Driven by her annoyance toward her own weakness, she’d try to look for that person who reached his hand out to her back when she was at her worst.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do I keep doing this whenever things don’t go the way I want it to? I really need to stop— Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After scolding herself for being so weak-hearted, Aoi turned her gaze forward, only to see a strange sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I finally found you! Please, I can’t bear to live without you anymore!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop! Don’t hug me out in the open like this! Also, stop saying things that could be misunderstood like that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle of the street, right in front of the station, in the direction Aoi was facing, a man and a woman could be seen. From the look of it, they seemed to be arguing about something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi raised her eyebrows, wondering what it was that made them act like this in broad daylight. But then she realized that one of them was one of her acquaintances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was one of her classmates. To be exact, it was Takayuki, the person she had such a bad impression of to the point that she’d grimaced whenever she ran into him like this. That same person was being embraced by an older woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please! Hear me out, please! I really can’t take it anymore! I-I can give you more than usual…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot, stop! I told you to watch your words!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The older woman looked to be in her twenties. She was dressed in a suit, implying that she was an OL. Said woman was about to take out a 10,000 yen bill, but Takayuki promptly held her back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The exchange between them was so quick to the point that a normal person wouldn’t be able to see it. But Aoi wasn’t a normal person. She didn’t miss a single moment in their interaction. With her disposition, she would never overlook such actions happening before her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine, I get it! I’ll make an exception for you, but next time, make a proper appointment with me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! I promise to do that next time!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, Aoi decided to follow the two people who were about to engage in a dubious act.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, what to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After recalling the events that happened in the span of a few hours, Aoi finally managed to calm herself down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She already took a picture of both of them entering the hotel with her phone, so she had already got the evidence she needed to report Takayuki to the school, where they would punish him accordingly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But, is this really enough?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Pondered Aoi. The situation was quite suspicious and it was hard to misunderstand anything from that exchange. But, there was a possibility that there were some kind circumstances that she wasn’t aware of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi had learned various ways of enacting justice from a lot of dramas that she watched on TV. That was why she tried to learn about the situation properly before actually taking action. She didn’t want to wrongly accuse someone innocent, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she was immersed deeply in her thoughts, the two of them had already left the hotel. However, fifteen minutes barely passed since they entered the hotel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time was too short for such a deed to be done, yet the woman’s face was that of satisfaction. She thanked Takayuki multiple times before parting ways without looking burdened in the slightest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi’s mind was thrown into confusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fifteen minutes was too short of a time for them to do anything. Takayuki could claim that they were just going there to borrow the restroom and everyone would believe him. In addition, their clothes still looked tidy and proper. The most they could do in fifteen minutes would be getting a room, undressing and dressing themselves back up and nothing more. But there was no sign of them even doing that. So, what the hell were they doing inside?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were a lot of questions in her mind, but the more time she spent asking those questions to herself, the further Takayuki walked away from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, jeez, whatever!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The situation made Aoi quickly cut her line of thoughts and started running.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, one should think twice before taking an action, but the situation demanded her to take an immediate action. It was the kind of situation where doing something would be better than doing nothing. Using that logic as a base of her action, Aoi moved her feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, what the hell?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fueled by her fear, uneasiness and doubt, Aoi reached Takayuki’s position in a blink of an eye. Without time to catch a breath, she unleashed the pent up feelings in her chest and slammed it down on the boy in front of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">No sex, no life!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">” (T/N: This is in English.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand what you’re trying to say, but that’s a hell of a grammatical error that you made there, Miss Honor Student.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she got ahead of herself and the words that meant to serve justice against the other person ended up humiliating her instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Love counseling? It isn’t prostitution?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not. I won’t do something shady like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So suspicious. Is there another meaning behind ‘love counseling?’ It’s just a ruse, isn’t it? Otherwise, there’s no way you’d be open about it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why would I even make such a lame excuse to you? What’s in it for me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since it wouldn’t look good if two high school students were to be found quarreling in front of a hotel, they moved to a nearby coffee shop to talk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then again, I’m not an actual counselor. All I do is to listen to their complaints.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, you coming out of a hotel with an older woman like that is more suspicious than anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Aoi pointing that out, Takayuki let out a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guilty until proven innocent, huh? So you’re that kind of person, Miss Honor Student…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi’s gaze turned into a glare after seeing the other person’s nonchalant attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy she was talking to was a tall boy with black hair. He had a rather long bang that was partly tied with a bright red hairpin. His gaze bore irreverence while his mouth wore fearlessness. There was an air of maturity coming from him due to the way he was dressed, a shirt and a neat pair of pants. In a glance, he looked pretty harmless, but there seemed to be something fishy about him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To put it mildly, he looked like the kind of guy one needed to be on guard against.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After seeing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, do you think I’d believe you just like that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, Takayuki was known to be a delinquent who got into troubles with a group of second-years as soon as the school started. There were a lot of bad rumors going on about him concerning his middle school days. Compared to Aoi, who was an honor student, he was the exact opposite end of the spectrum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, Aoi disliked the red hairpin that he wore. No, it wasn’t because it didn’t look good on him, but it was because of her personal distaste due to the fact that she remembered her childhood hero wore something similar to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why Aoi had no intention of letting Takayuki off this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, whatever. What can I do, anyway? You got everyone on your side, so no matter what I say, they’ll definitely listen to you instead of me. I’m just a poor little carp on a cutting board, my fate is sealed, boohoo.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, he didn’t seem perturbed at all even though he was aware of his dire situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in this kind of situation, his irreverence didn’t change. From the way he was sipping his drink, it showed nothing but his graceful movements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. No matter what random things you say, you can’t deceive me. I’ll let you know that I already took a picture of you as evidence and sent it to a trustworthy person, so don’t even think of doing anything to me here. The moment I smell something suspicious from you, I’ll immediately report it to the school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, you’ve covered all your bases, huh? It can’t be helped, then I guess I’d have to do this…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He placed his cup on the table before confronting Aoi’s gaze head on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His eyes were still, akin to that of a dead animal. They gave Aoi a sense of dread, but she persisted and stared right back at them. The boy in front of her was like a super-villain that she had to face. Even if there was a fear inside her heart, she must suppress it to be able to thrive over him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her sense of justice backing her up, she confronted the boy in front of her with a resolute gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Can you please let this one slide?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words that came out of his mouth threw Aoi into a state of bewilderment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was a strange thing to say. Aoi couldn’t believe what she was hearing at the moment. She thought that he would try to fight back a little harder at least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You didn’t catch that? Okay, I’ll repeat it… Can you please let this one slide, Miss Honor Student?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh? Satou-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I get it, I’m in the wrong here, but you know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi couldn’t believe what she was seeing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you please not report this to the school? Please, I beg you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Takayuki who was sitting with composure was gone, replaced by a humble-looking Takayuki, who was sitting with a straight pose while bowing his head down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Satou-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you really feel that way?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t understand what do you mean by that, but I’m not trying to hurt anyone here. I know that I’m in the wrong, I shouldn’t have acted suspiciously like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you do know how to apologize, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. Also, I don’t want to be expelled, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… So even someone like you is afraid of being expelled?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course I am. I’m not the kind of person who’d treat expulsion lightly. If possible I want to avoid it at all costs. That’s why, please let this slide. I’ll get on my knees if I need to, but we’ll need to move to a more appropriate place first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t need to do that… Also, you don’t need to speak politely to me either…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, got it…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi couldn’t hide her confusion after witnessing Takayuki acting all-obedient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, this was Takayuki, the delinquent who got into troubles with a group of second-years at the start of the school year and the one who got a lot of bad rumors going on around him. But, looking at the situation, it felt like Aoi was the bad guy here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In any case, I’ll hear you out first. I’ll decide on what to do with you afterwards.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since he was more obedient than she expected, she decided to lend him an ear. She didn’t let her guard down though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Firstly, who was that person?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A regular of mine… You know, for my love counseling service. I can’t really divulge her personal information and the content of the counseling to protect her identity, but I assure you that we aren’t sexually involved with each other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm… So, what is this love counseling thing, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a service where I help people to deal with problems concerning their love lives. I’m specialized in dealing with people who have an unrequited love or people with a broken heart.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You said you’re not an actual counselor… So, how did you get clients in the first place? I can understand if your clients are someone from the same school as ours, but I can’t wrap my head around you getting adult clients as well…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, they contacted me through my social media, that’s how.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I see it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi was able to confirm that Takayuki had an account under the name of ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Baku</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’ on his phone. The account had a deformed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">baku</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> as its profile picture and its follower count was over five thousands. (T/N: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Baku</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a mythical creature from Japanese folklore. It looks like a tapir and is known as a dream-eater. In the past, people would pray to it to help them get rid of their nightmares. Also, just some information for you who don’t know, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">baku</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> isn’t classified as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yokai/</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">evil spirit, it’s a holy beast.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My account is mainly about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">anime</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">stuff, occasionally, I’ll post about love counseling if the concerned party doesn’t mind me posting it. Most of the counseling I performed, I did in DMs. Also, it’s rare for me to get face-to-face counseling like I just did. I only got money through face-to-face counseling though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seem to be telling me the truth… From what I’ve read, your posts are quite popular too. I remember seeing some of them on the hot topics once in a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Most of the things that went viral were just my impressions on a certain </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">anime</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Well, most of them are romance, but they’re irrelevant to the counseling service, honestly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… I’m not well-known in this matter, but from your exchanges with your clients, you seem polite and the other parties also seem to be very grateful toward your service…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is something wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing. As far as I can see, at least.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was hard to tell what was on Takayuki’s mind, but at least he answered all Aoi’s questions clearly. She couldn’t feel any sense of guilt that a villain would normally have from him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And so, why did you choose a hotel for this particular counseling session?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since it’s a private matter, it feels wrong to talk about it at a restaurant or a coffee shop like this. I wanted us to talk in a place where no one is around, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see your point, but you know that going to that kind of place with an adult woman like that is bad, don’t you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, I know that I’m wrong…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were no lies in his words. But still, Aoi felt that he was still hiding something from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, still… Love counseling, huh? I’ve been looking into it and it seems that you’re doing pretty well with this business of yours, but are you sure that you aren’t offering something like massage or illegal drugs?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Putting aside the matter of massage, if you’re really suspecting me of selling drugs, why don’t we just stop this and call the police right now? It’s easier for me to prove my innocence that way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so, huh? I went too far, I’m sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From their exchange, Aoi concluded that whatever it was that he was hiding, it didn’t seem like a crime or anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If, by chance, her conclusion was wrong and Takayuki was actually doing something horrible, that just meant it was impossible for her to deal with him by herself in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Phew, fine, I get it. I’ll let you off for today. But, if I were to see something similar happen again, I’ll report it to the school immediately, okay? Keep it in mind. I’ll be watching you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, thank you, I won’t be repeating the same mistake in the future… Jeez, I thought I’m gonna die for a second there, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki let out a sigh of relief and smiled. The familiar irreverence in his face had disappeared, replaced by the face of a normal high school boy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or maybe he had been acting like this since the start. After all, Aoi had been in a bad mood even before she ran into Takayuki. There was a possibility that she was venting her anger toward him unconsciously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, you got paid from the counseling service, right? You aren’t doing it voluntarily?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh… Yeah… I charged 3,000 yen for a counseling and if I can’t finish the problem in a day, I’d raise it to 5,000.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, that’s a good price. Even if something goes wrong, no one would make a fuss about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t treat me like a scammer. I do my job properly, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re still playing in the gray area, do you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Let’s do this, if you need any counseling, I’ll do that for you, free of charge. You can determine whether I’m a scammer or not after seeing the result.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The matter was pretty much resolved with that. But Aoi was feeling petty after dealing with this kind of misunderstanding, so she decided to harass him a little for the hell out of it. She glanced at the coffee shop’s menu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Uh, Miyama?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don’t mind, I can buy you a drink or something…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe, you’re quick on the uptake. I’ll take you up on that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Aoi’s mischievous smile, Takayuki’s shoulders slumped in dejection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From an outsider’s perspective, their exchange was like that of a petty princess and her poor servant, but there was no way that Aoi would realize this.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi had a belief that even heroes need a break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, if one were to be on guard 24/7, it’d be inevitable that they’d be too tired to function. That was why one should rest whenever one had time to spare. To Aoi, that was how a hero should be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! YUUUZUUUU! Why is everything so annoying?! It’s hard to see Tomoe acting like that! Yuzu, should I really introduce her to that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the arts club? Tell meee!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t ask me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Coomee ooonn!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So troublesome…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi’s day off was mostly her visiting her bad friend’s room and venting her heart out to the poor girl. In addition to that, Aoi would always stick her face in the girl’s belly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the bad friend would never appreciate this act and would always try to shove her away from her side. She’d use light violence if necessary sometimes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you so mean to me, Yuzu? Heal my heart, please…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me tell you a fact, Aoi. From the human’s perspective, it feels good to lay their head down on a cat’s belly, but from the cat’s perspective, said human is nothing but a bother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon! We’re friends, aren’t we? Friends are supposed to share their happiness and sorrow, aren’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. In other words, it’d be justified if I were to inflict as much pain on you as much as you bothered me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“AAHH! My chest! You’re hitting my chest!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl who was pushing Aoi away with a book was Amami Yuzu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like Aoi, she was also in her first year of high school, but unlike Aoi, her body was slender and her back was a little hunched. The glasses that she wore gave her a rather subdued atmosphere, this atmosphere was further enhanced by the fact that she was wearing all black. At first glance, she looked like your typical shy bookworm, but she had this gloomy air that projected her unwillingness to interact with other people. Aoi gave her the nickname ‘The Gloomy Bookworm’ due to her rarely showing her emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although they were the complete opposite personality wise, they had been friends since back when they were freshmen in middle school. Yuzu was rather blunt with her words when she was dealing with Aoi, but she was friendly enough to recognize their relationship as friends. Nowadays, they didn’t talk to each other as much due to them being in different classes, but Yuzu was still someone who had been friends with Aoi the longest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So mean… Your belly exists to comfort me, does it not?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Yuzu was the only person that Aoi would ever show her pathetic appearance to. Well, aside from her own family, at least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re annoying, do you know that? Anyway, it’s what Tomoe had decided, so just let her do what she wants to do. She wants to suffer, so let her be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, I don’t want her to suffer like this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t even understand her feelings and you’re still acting like this. You’re as arrogant as ever, Aoi.”</span></p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4625" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-717x1024.png" alt="" width="717" height="1024" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-717x1024.png 717w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-210x300.png 210w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-768x1097.png 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-75x106.png 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-1076x1536.png 1076w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-125x180.png 125w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2.png 1434w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzu hurled more merciless words at Aoi. Words that were so sharp that it’d definitely hurt the other person if they didn’t know her that well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was this merciless attitude of hers that made Aoi feel comfortable confiding in her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I’m arrogant. It’s because I’m arrogant that I want to help her ease her pain. It’s just, I don’t know how to!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t need to know how to. Tomoe had already decided to do this, so just let her be. It’s her decision, you have no rights whatsoever to meddle in this matter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Toward Yuzu, who never took her eyes off the book in her hands while spouting out those sharp words, Aoi smiled while saying, “As expected of my bad friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In any case, instead of trying to do something about what she had already decided, I should just help her with something else, huh? By the way, Yuzu, you were also in the same class as Tomoe and Naotsugu back in middle school, right? What do you think I should pay attention to in regard to those two’s relationship?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t ask me. Just pay attention to the obvious things, it should be enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. How about this? Let’s contact our middle school friends. If they heard about this, they’ll definitely feel the same way as us and we can use our collective brain power to think of a way to help Tomoe. There will be some boys who’ll try to go after Tomoe, but I can just protect her from those guys, at least until she is back to normal again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do whatever. I don’t care. In any case, you can’t solve this problem of yours by yourself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Aoi, Yuzu was her salvation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whenever she felt lost, whenever she lost her confidence in herself, Yuzu’s harsh words would always guide her to the proper way. There was proper advice hidden beneath those hurtful words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, Aoi always treated Yuzu’s words as encouragement. Even though there was a possibility that she was just being delusional, Aoi ignored that. Yuzu was her only bad friend, the only person who was able to treat her mercilessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only that, it was Yuzu who always stayed by her side whenever she did stupid things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, back in middle school, Aoi still didn’t know how far she should go to enact her ‘justice.’ Back then, she tried to sneak out to school at night to retrieve an item that one of her friends left at school. It was Yuzu who scolded and went together with her to retrieve the item.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi trusted Yuzu because of this. No matter how inconvenient the situation was for her, Yuzu would always stay by Aoi’s side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, there’s only so much a single person can do. But, what if we ask for help from something that isn’t exactly a human?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? That’s an unusual joke coming from your mouth, Yuzu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not joking, there’s this urban legend…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words intrigued Aoi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzu then closed her book and stared at Aoi’s eyes. The words that came out of her mouth afterwards, sounded like a bad joke, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you heard of the tale of ‘The Love-Eating Monster’?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, well if you live in this city, you’ll end up knowing one or two things about it. It’s a monster that’ll appear in front of a woman who got heartbroken and eats her love out of her heart, right? But, that story was inspired by a ghost story…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Love-Eating Monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi wasn’t unfamiliar with the words that came out of Yuzu’s mouth. In fact, she knew the person who was the source of the story as she had tried to investigate the matter. But, even after that investigation, she didn’t know what exactly triggered the start of the rumors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That rumor died down a while ago, didn’t it? Why are you bringing it up now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It won’t be a bad idea to rely on a monster when it comes down to it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttered Yuzu before reopening her book and acted as if she had said what she wanted to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Monster, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing Yuzu, whenever she said something strange like this, she was hinting that something was about to happen. It was something that happened a few times in the past. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, Aoi was aware that she shouldn’t rely too much on Yuzu’s cryptic advice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Too bad, rather than monsters, I believe in heroes more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzu tilted her expressionless face at Aoi before asking,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hero as in the guy who saved you a long time ago? You haven’t given up on looking for him yet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no reason to give up in the first place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi answered Yuzu’s question with a fearless grin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve been searching for him for seven years already, no?.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Back then, I asked the adults about him, but none of them knew who he was! I thought they were just mad at me for acting like a brat, but when I asked them about him again after things had calmed down, they still told me that they didn’t know who he was.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No other answer then, it’s the ‘girl in a white dress’ phenomenon. A staple of summertime ghost stories.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He exists! Stop treating my hero like an illusion!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she firmly stood her ground, Aoi was still feeling uneasy about everything. After all, it wouldn’t be too far-fetched that she was just experiencing a mild hallucination due to her stress back then. However, that possibility didn’t make her heart waver. She still firmly believed that one day she’d be reunited with her childhood hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I believe in my memory and feelings. He does exist. That’s why until the day I reunite with him again, I promise to live my life proudly!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, helping Tomoe is part of that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that’s just for my self-satisfaction.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Replied Aoi smugly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, my friend is suffering, of course I’ll help her!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You and your pretentious bull…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi said that as if it was a matter of course, meanwhile Yuzu sighed in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the two of them trusted each other with their lives, they wouldn’t depend on each other as much. That was the kind of relationship that two girls have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the weekend, Aoi started her week earnestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oh, the girl who likes foxes? Sure, I’ll do it for you. You owe me one, okay?~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like what she said to Tomoe, it wasn’t hard to introduce her to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the art club.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, Aoi knew one of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpais</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the art club personally since they went to the same middle school. All she needed was to text and make some arrangements with them so that Naotsugu could meet with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> that he liked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, Aoi had a bad feeling about all this. That was why, when she received that text from said </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, she let out a groan. Though, she decided to proceed with the plan anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since this part of the plan could be finished quickly, she did it before the homeroom started.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The next step is to make sure that everything will go well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything went smoothly so far, but it was just the beginning. There was still a possibility that some kind of problem would appear later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo~ Everyone~ Good morning!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Tomoe.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before the homeroom started, Tomoe entered the class while greeting everyone. Aoi returned her greeting while watching her closely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning. You’re so energetic this early in the morning, Tomoe-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning. Isn’t morning practice tough, Tomoe-chan? It’s amazing that you willingly attend it… Track club members are something else…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know right? Even the soccer club doesn’t have morning practice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s because you kept skipping on your practice!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment Tomoe entered the classroom, the atmosphere brightened up. Before long, she became the main topic of the conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was part of Tomoe’s charm. Unlike Aoi, who had the charisma of a leader, Tomoe had the charm of a class mascot, something that made her loved by everyone. Not only was she dependable as the girls could freely rely on her, she was also easy-going and treated everyone the same way regardless of their gender. It was no surprise that she was so popular in her class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, this popularity of hers could also become a source of trouble for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomoe, if this continues, your childhood friend will be buried in the schoolyard. May I receive your permission to lay down the necessary groundwork first?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?! Did someone send death threats to him?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunch break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi decided to take Tomoe to a less populated place for lunch, on a deserted stairway at the end of the hallway. Of course, Tomoe understood that she did this to help her out with her love problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Did that idiot offend someone by accident?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she didn’t know why that childhood friend of hers received a death threat from someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that part was a joke, but it’s the truth that if this keeps up, his reputation will plummet to the ground quickly.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-How could that be?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomoe, stop pretending. I know you’re aware of the cause.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Tomoe’s hunched back, Aoi let out a deep sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone regarded you and Naotsugu as the perfect couple. If that guy were to go out with someone else, it wouldn’t look good to other people around you two. They’ll probably think that he hurt you somehow. If that were to happen, who knows what they’d do to him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?! I-I know how they are thinking about us, but will they really go that far?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They will. At least in our class, there are more people who care about you than you think. I’m planning to spread a rumor about you and him growing apart, they wouldn’t immediately bite it, but it’s fine, the rumor will serve its purpose as a damage control when things come down to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Aoi’s words, Tomoe nodded with her eyes downcast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomoe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know what to do, don’t you? To make everyone believe the rumors I’m going to spread, you need to do this. Avoid Naotsugu for a while. Any excuses with work, like you’re busy with your club and such. Also…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi stopped her words for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was hesitating. After all, she knew what kind of pain that her best friend would experience if she were to hear her next words. But, it wasn’t like she had any choice in the matter. If she were to stop now, her best friend would suffer a more painful experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While sending her a quiet glance, Aoi mercilessly slammed down her words at Tomoe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When he finally gets a girlfriend, you won’t be able to stay by his side anymore. Your role will be taken by his girlfriend. Though, I don’t think I need to tell you this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;A-Ahaha… Yeah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smile on Tomoe’s face looked fragile, but she didn’t shed any tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sight of her twitching cheeks and her trembling shoulders made Aoi’s mind wander, so she asked her a question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You love him as a man, don’t you? Then, why are you hurting yourself like this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m wondering, if you’re in my position, what will you do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll just abandon him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, you’re so scary…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Aoi’s harsh words, Tomoe let out a weak laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, Aoi knew that it was impossible for Tomoe to just abandon him. If she could do that, she wouldn’t be struggling like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;But, yeah, I love Nao. I’ve always loved him for a long time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since her best friend was doing this far to help her out, Tomoe decided to not hide anything from her anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why? If you still love him, you could just push through, I think it’ll work out well. Well, it’ll be hard for you to do it alone, but you can always ask for help. I refuse to believe that you don’t have a chance to go out with him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, maybe that’s the case. If you were to help me, I could probably go out with him in the end since you’re that amazing, but Aoi, I already made up my mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was clear that her own words hurt her, but Tomoe looked resolute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to help Nao out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi sensed an iron will behind that fragile smile. The will that would never crumble even if her action ended up destroying her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was when she realized that no amount of persuasion would be able to make Tomoe change her mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Surely he doesn’t want you to go through this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course he doesn’t. This is just my selfish desire. Hehe, I sound like an idiot just now, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. You’re an irredeemable idiot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi stared at Tomoe in dismay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’m the same as you. Only an idiot would help out her friend going down a path filled with thorns like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, Aoi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t apologize or else I’ll get angry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good grief.” Aoi put her hand on her forehead before letting out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I only want to make my best friend happy, but why does it turn out this way?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite her inner complaints, Aoi proceeded with the plan and things had been proceeding smoothly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The timing and Aoi’s social skill made it a success. It was a month after the school year had started and everyone was starting to get used to their new school life. During this time, even though they were busy, they had the lenience to care about their surroundings. If Aoi, someone who was well-liked among them, were to spread a rumor like that, they wouldn’t question the authenticity of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, if Tomoe were to act as planned, the rumor would gain even more credibility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, the plan was entering its next step.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, seriously? I can go to a mixer with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few days after Aoi started her plan, she stopped by a restaurant on her way home. With her was a good-looking boy with a shaved head, Mihara Naotsugu. The boy was smiling at Aoi innocently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His body looked well-built and he was quite tall compared to your average boys. He was even taller than Aoi, not to mention Tomoe, whose height was just average at best.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I know a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the art club. Well, I called it a mixer, but it’s more like a meeting between the sports club and the cultural club. But, remember that other people will attend the meeting too, so you have to work on it yourself if you want to approach her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s enough for me! Thank you, Miyama!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t thank me, thank your childhood friend instead. If she didn’t ask me to do this, I wouldn’t even bother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see! Thank you, Tomo!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Completely unaware of what was going on, Naotsugu expressed his gratitude to Tomoe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi almost stepped forward to sack him in the face, but she managed to hold it in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Being thankful isn’t enough! You should worship me, respect me and take this gratitude to your grave– no, to your next life!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Ow! Stop slapping my back like that, it hurts! Even the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpais</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the baseball club wouldn’t hit me as hard! You’ll give me rashes on my skin!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before worrying about that, you should worry whether your crush would be creeped out or not if you were to approach her so suddenly! Your body has grown to be this big, but you’re still acting like a child!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speak for yourself! You haven’t changed at all! You always slapped my back whenever you got the chance to!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe gently patted Naotsugu&#8217;s back, in which he responded to her without holding anything back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah?! I did it to encourage you! Instead of complaining, you should be grateful to me for it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m grateful to you, but I don’t appreciate the violence!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe had the same attitude as usual– No, she tried to act the same way as usual. She was trying to reenact the exchange that she did countless times in the past with Naotsugu. The action gave Aoi a sense of deja vu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If one didn’t know her circumstances, they wouldn’t feel any discomfort after seeing that exchange. In fact, even her childhood friend didn’t notice anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this only made Aoi feel even more worried about her. What kind of pain did she have to endure to pretend that nothing actually happened? How long could she endure that pain before she eventually broke down? Aoi couldn’t help but feel anxious about Tomoe’s unstable state of mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your body is massive, but you’re still a big a** loser! Are you sure you’re okay? Can you even greet her properly later?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Of course I can! Back when she asked me to be a model for her painting, we talked quite a bit! Rather, we got along well! She must have a good impression of me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That could change for the worse if you’re too pushy, so be careful, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, if you’re acting too distant, you’ll just creep her out, so be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger! …W-Wait, then what should I do?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Keep your eyes off her chest for starters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D**n, that’s a tough one!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, Tomoe managed to keep her act up until the moment they broke up.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Aoi, watching Tomoe’s behavior was like watching an inflated balloon that could burst at any moment. Due to this, she felt really uneasy about her situation. That was why as soon as she got home, she immediately texted Tomoe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Are you okay?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After seeing the text that had been sent, a rush of embarrassment came over her. She felt ashamed of her own stupidity. Of course Tomoe wasn’t okay, her question was completely pointless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She hurriedly tried to delete the message, but before she was able to do so, a reply from Tomoe came.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I’m good!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reply came with a sticker of a cute-looking rabbit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing that her best friend could still act like this, Aoi felt relieved. But immediately after that, another reply came from Tomoe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I’m good, but you know, if only I didn’t fall in love with Nao, maybe I wouldn’t feel like this. Maybe I could help him more willingly.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before five seconds had passed, Tomoe deleted it and in its place, there was a new reply that said, [Sorry].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What should I do? Should I really leave her alone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After looking at that short reply, Aoi muttered.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What kind of reply should I give to that one word reply? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi pondered. But even after the night passed, she still couldn’t find an answer to both questions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miyama Aoi wasn’t good at handling love affairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t like she hated it, but she wasn’t particularly fond of it either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To her, love was something that she’d read in novels or watch in dramas. Something that she could use as a topic of conversation with others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather than romance, Aoi preferred stories that were related to heroes. If romance stories were something that she read to help her socialize with people, stories about heroes were something that she enjoyed wholeheartedly. She adored heroes so much that she filled her own bookshelves with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">shounen manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and American comics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, not even those heroes that Aoi adored would be able to help Tomoe with her troubles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, it wasn’t because they were powerless or anything, but her problem was something that was out of their jurisdiction. After all, what Tomoe needed wasn’t a hero of justice, but an expert of love.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if Aoi tried to pretend that she was a beautiful girl with hundreds of years of knowledge about love, she still couldn’t think of anything to say to Tomoe. She could probably give her an advice or two, but they wouldn’t help resolve Tomoe’s problem at its roots.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As far as Aoi was concerned, there was only one person that would be able to help Tomoe with her problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi was looking at her social media while idling on her bed when she remembered about a certain account with the name of ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Baku</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’. Yes, the account that Takayuki used for his love counseling service.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hehe, I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She went through the account’s page and browsed through the interactions between him and his followers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He wasn’t Kaitou Ranma or anything, but the way he responded was polite, despite being a delinquent. Not only that, he always tried to help his clients patiently until they managed to come to a conclusion. (T/N: Kaitou Ranma was a period drama about a detective that lives in the Meiji Era. I don’t know much about it, so I don’t exactly know what the reference entails, sorry.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Love counseling, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, Aoi decided to give it a try. Maybe this account that she found while searching in the dark would be her ray of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Satou? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">That</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Satou Takayuki?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, that guy with dead eyes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next morning. On the way to school, Aoi planned to stop a student or two to find out more information about Takayuki. Before asking him for his love consultation service, she wanted to find out more about the person himself first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was looking for a girl that went to the same middle school as him. It would be more preferable if she were from a different class. Of course, with her identity as the perfect beauty, she had a wide arrange of contacts and she had already befriended the right person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, since it would be strange if she were to bring up the topic out of nowhere, Aoi started their conversation with a small talk before approaching the topic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Satou, huh? That guy is bad news. The thing about him is he’s the kind of person that attracts all sorts of problems without trying. There were rumors about him having some beef with other delinquents, but since he always got away unscathed, it seems like he’s really tough in fistfights. Back in middle school, he was often spotted together with girls and they all cried in front of him, so I assume that he’s a playboy of some sorts.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl was Aoi’s friend from another class, Takayama. As she was speaking, she fiddled around her silver-rimmed glass to ease her nervousness. For Takayama who didn’t stand out much from the rest of the girls, it was hard not to be nervous around someone like Aoi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rumors, huh? …Takayama-san, have you witnessed those rumors in person?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I saw a group of rough-looking adults wearing black suits bowing at him once and I never thought about trying to get myself involved with him ever since.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? That’s quite something, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, right, those guys looked like guards of a selfish young lady or something, you know, the kind that you’d see in dramas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, what kind of connection does he have? That actually scares me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi tried to compare the Takayuki that she knew and the Takayuki that she heard from rumors, but she failed to make any connections between the two. It felt like they were two different people. The Takayuki that she knew was merely an ordinary high school student. Seeing the discrepancies between the rumors and the real person, Aoi tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Anyway, Miyama-san! It’s better for you to not involve yourself with that guy! It won’t end well for you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to involve myself with him, but he owes me something, so it’s all good. I doubt that he’ll try to hurt me or anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? He owes you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I can ask for a favor from him, that’s why I’m trying to find out what kind of person he actually is. I want to use the favor wisely, after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why she decided to investigate him. Though she had no intention to find out about the secret that he tried so desperately to hide. The result of her investigation was quite something, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, that idiot… What kind of trouble did he get into this time?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Aoi’s words, the student in front of her scratched her head before letting out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face looked stunned as she grumbled, “That guy, seriously…” But it seemed like there was a sense of familiarity toward Takayuki in her tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Miyama-san, let me be honest with you. I hate that guy, I don’t give a d**n about that idiot, but you see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayama hurled abuses and curses at the boy, but there was something else hidden between those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though he’s a jerk and an irredeemable a**hole, you can count on him. Whatever your problem is, he’ll help you earnestly. So, please don’t be too harsh on him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words were clumsy, but the feelings inside those words were genuine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi wasn’t skillful enough to confirm what exactly those feelings were, but she was able to tell that Takayama was telling her the truth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What Aoi managed to notice though, was the worry hidden between the curses and abuses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll keep that in mind, but Takayama-san, what kind of relationship do you two—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“L-Look at the time! I-I have to go now! See you at school, Miyama-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Aoi tried to ask her for more details, Takayama cut the conversation short and dashed out toward the school’s direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It seems like I need to find out more about Satou-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she watched Takayama’s moving back, Aoi silently resolved herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t know whether he would become a ray of hope for her, but the boy named Satou Takayuki was too much of a mystery to be left alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To gather more information about Takayuki, Aoi tried her best to avoid coming into contact with her classmates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t want her classmates to know that she was asking people around about him. Before long, not only she managed to dig out information about him from her friends, but also from the friends of her friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result was 30% of them had a favorable impression about him, 50% of them admitted to hating his guts, but they had to acknowledge that he had good parts in him and the rest of them either had no interest in him or just didn’t want anything to do with him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently Satou Takayuki was more famous than Aoi had expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t expect this…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time Aoi’s investigation concluded, it was already noon. She managed to come to a conclusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki was a delinquent, but there was something in him that made people attracted to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is he a demon? A snake? Or probably even a monster?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, Aoi decided to ask for Takayuki’s aid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that he was more experienced in regards to the matter of love was part of the reason for that, but more than that, Aoi wanted to see what kind of surprise he would show her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi decided to contact him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She already managed to get his contacts by using ‘monitoring’ as a pretext, so that first hurdle was gone. Though, back when they exchanged contacts, Aoi remembered that the boy had a sour look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Aoi quickly operated the message app and sent him a text. All while grumbling that he should be more grateful toward her, after all it was rare for a boy to be able to exchange contacts with a pretty girl like her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[We have to talk.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But, I haven’t done anything yet.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, not about that, the other thing.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You’re scaring me. Can you be more clear?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What else do you think I’m talking about? It’s about the matter of love consultation.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Got it. Is it urgent?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Not really, but it’s preferable if it’s resolved quickly.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I have an appointment until five today, we’ll talk then.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If you don’t mind, you could just tell me the place where you’ll be having an appointment at, so I can get there as soon as possible.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Got it. Look for the park fifteen minutes away from school. The one where there’s a fountain in the middle.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, okay.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Please be there on time– No, it’s okay if you’re late. It’s better if you don’t come at all.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Roger.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right after she finished exchanging texts with Takayuki, the school bell rang, signaling the end of the lunch break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phew.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After letting out a sigh, Aoi wrote a schedule in her note so that she wouldn’t forget about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Satou-kun. Appointment. Park. 4.30]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she scheduled herself to arrive before the appointment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She kept telling herself that she was doing this to keep an eye on him, but in truth she was just curious what he was up to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to see what you’re up to, Satou-kun~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi couldn’t help but let out a smile at the thought. It was an inappropriate expression to make in this kind of situation but she couldn’t care less about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, Miyama Aoi had not lost her adventurous spirit yet. The thought of discovering a hidden side of someone she knew made her heart pound in excitement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi saw a strange sight at the park.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No! I want to play with Takayuki-kun more!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Taka-nii! Let’s play more!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to go home!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a humanoid lifeform that was being surrounded by children from every side. It seemed to be struggling to breathe due to a little girl hugging its face firmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmph! Mmph!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The humanoid lifeform, Takayuki, let out a groan in protest before he gently peeled the children off his body one by one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, despite his efforts, the children kept clinging on to him, creating an endless loop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon! You guys are troubling him! Stop it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s time to go home!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously. Sorry about this, Takayuki-kun. I keep troubling you to take care of these children…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the loop didn’t end up being an endless one as the mother of the kids forcibly pried her children away from Takayuki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huff… Huff… I-It’s fine, the benefit goes both ways anyway… A-Anyway, see you guys later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">““Bye!””</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki saw the kids off while panting heavily. He then let out a deep sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Didn’t I tell you not to come early?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he turned his glance to Aoi, who was sitting quietly on a bench while witnessing his pathetic state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The current time was 4.52pm according to the large clock installed in the park.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You did. But, consider this from my perspective, Satou-kun. You have a ‘criminal record’ already, so it’s my obligation to monitor you, especially when you were acting suspiciously like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As her words hit a sore spot, Takayuki let out a groan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Aoi held his weakness, he couldn’t really go against her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, I gotta admit that you surprised me. I never expected that you’d be so popular among the children… Sorry that I doubted you. I can bow my head if you want me to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No need to. It isn’t like I’m doing this for free.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The children seem to be attached to you, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re children, they could be attached to anyone who is kind enough to them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki brushed the dust off his uniform before sitting down next to Aoi without any hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what do you want to talk about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it okay to talk about it in the open like this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This park is a playground for the grade schoolers, no high schoolers or adults would ever come here to hang out. The kids won’t come here to play after 5pm, so there won’t be anyone to disturb us. We can talk for an hour or so here. Well, of course we can move to a better place if you want to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, here is fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why she asked that question was to test Takayuki. She was already aware that there were no people around them, but she wanted to make sure that he considered her circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, Takayuki passed her test with flying colors. She decided that it should be okay to talk to him about Tomoe’s situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, this is about my friend who lives in the next town over.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, she wouldn’t carelessly give out Tomoe’s name here. After all, she decided to consult Takayuki about her problem without telling Tomoe herself. With this, even if the content of their conversation was somehow leaked, no one would connect it to Tomoe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, so it’s the matter between Ukai and Mihara. Their problem is trickier than you thought, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, Takayuki managed to see through her lies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What are you even talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry about this, but I figured it out the moment you contacted me. Well, even if I’m not a certified counselor, I should know this much if I want to call myself one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi tried to suppress her reaction by acting as calm as possible, but it seemed like there was no point in doing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, I won’t say anything to anyone. Even if I were to do it, everyone knows that it’s a bad idea to get on your bad side, so it’s pointless.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ugh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon, stop sulking. I can go on with your lies, but I just don’t want to complicate things later in the future, okay? Please, just bear with it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Takayuki said that in an aloof tone made Aoi shut her mouth close. She wasn’t childish enough to keep sulking in this situation, though, so she snapped out of it quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After keeping a mental note on this shortcoming of hers, she proceeded to ask Takayuki a question,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of the future, can you give me some sound advice for them, Satou-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before we get to that, let me ask you a question, Miyama. So, what you want to do is to ease Ukai’s broken heart, right? It isn’t for something stupid like wanting to be recognized by everyone for your feat of solving her relationship problem, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hate it when my question is answered with another question… But, yes. I’m only doing this for Tomoe. Feat or whatnot, that superficial thing doesn’t matter. I won’t betray my friend’s trust in me for such a trivial matter. I just want to make Tomoe happy, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amazing. As expected of our Miss Honor Student.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This much is expected. Tomoe is my best friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After hearing Aoi’s answer, Takayuki smirked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your relationship is so beautiful… Ah, this isn&#8217;t sarcasm or anything, I’m genuinely praising you. Normally, people only came to me carrying dirty feelings like jealousy or betrayal. I really respect you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But his eyes weren’t smiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a possibility that he was just messing around with her, but Aoi dismissed it. The initial impression she had of the boy was off by a mile. He always did something beyond her expectations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that we’ve gone through all that, let’s begin. First thing first, though. There’s no sure-way to solve this problem of yours. The source of the problem is Ukai herself, after all. We can’t really do much until she becomes sick of the situation on her own.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was irreverence in his expression as Takayuki said his words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, Aoi didn’t take his words well. She tried to suppress her bad mood and ask him another question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you telling me to just give up and let her suffer?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not what I mean. Here’s the thing, the problem is that this is what Ukai wanted. She was the one who put herself in this kind of situation. But here comes the question. Why did she do that in the first place?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m an outsider in this matter, so this is just my speculation, but I think she’s too devoted to Mihara. Her devotion is already on the level of being abnormal. I’m not implying that it isn’t okay to hide her feelings like that, it’s completely fine. Taking a step back and letting her childhood friend chase after his love is also fine. The problem here is that she’s trying to actively help him. She brought this suffering upon herself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After hearing Takayuki’s words, Aoi pondered over Tomoe’s past behavior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, there was something off about it. Yes, Tomoe was a kind girl who’d always put others before herself, but even for someone like her, this action was abnormal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you have any idea about this, Miyama? She seems to be thinking that she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">has to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> help Mihara no matter the cost. Does she have a life debt to him or something? Or maybe she’s feeling guilty about something? If it’s the latter, then she’ll be treating this suffering as just deserts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seem to know about something, but you don’t know whether it’s okay or not to tell me about it without asking her permission first. Got it, I’ll ask her for permission myself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi blinked her eyes and tilted her head at Takayuki, who said everything so casually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you think it’ll be better if I’m the one who asks her for permission?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think it’s right for me to hear it from you. I know you’re involved with the case directly, but it’ll be better for me to hear everything from the person herself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You want to talk with her? …Well, fine, I’ll let her know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Honestly, I prefer face-to-face counseling. Well, if you’re worried that I’ll do something, you can just stay by her side. Well, that should be it for today, we’ll continue this tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I thought you said that there’s no sure-way to solve this problem, why do you look so confident?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi asked while glaring at him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than anyone, Aoi understood that she could use her beauty as a means of intimidation. That was why her glare looked both enchanting and intimidating. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it’s true, there’s no cure-all for this situation. What we need to do for Ukai is to make her forget about her feelings completely. To do that, she has to go through this suffering to the point that she’ll regret everything. You, as her best friend, can help her with this, but not me since I’m a stranger to her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Takayuki maintained the same attitude of aloofness and irreverence. He met Aoi’s glare with a fearless smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s how it normally goes. But there’s this neat thing that I have, a power that’s similar to magic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi opened her eyes wide after hearing those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one would blame her if she were to lash out at him in anger. Throwing out a joke-like sentence in the middle of a serious talk was anything but rude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it doesn’t matter if you believe me or not, everything will end the same way anyway. All you need to understand is that I can solve Ukai’s problem.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was clear from his tone that he wasn’t joking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute, are you being serious right now? There’s a magic that you can use to solve her problem?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Aoi’s question, Takayuki answered in a dignified manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I have the power to eat other people’s love.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He nonchalantly answered her question like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Could it be?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Takayuki’s attitude, Aoi felt irritation and anticipation swirled inside her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In all her life, there was only one person who could say such an absurd thing with confidence like that. However, that wasn’t enough for Aoi to make a final judgment on the matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that he was wearing a similar looking red hairpin with her childhood hero wasn’t enough. The fact that he looked similar to her childhood hero also wasn’t enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unless Aoi could confirm that everything he said was real, she wouldn’t come to any conclusion just yet.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ukai Tomoe loved sprinting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thrill she felt when she gave it her all to dash under the sound of the signal pistol.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feelings when she moved her legs and stopped thinking about anything else but to move forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sensation of moving as fast as she could as she aimed for the finish line.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All those feelings were something that Tomoe couldn’t help but fall in love with. During that short amount of time, she could take her mind off her worries and the sense of freedom she felt when running was something that she enjoyed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the current Tomoe wasn’t able to feel that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ukai, you should clean up and take a break today. You don’t look good today. You’ll only hurt yourself if you keep this up for a moment longer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe obeyed the harsh words of the captain of the track club.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She understood where they came from. They didn’t chase her off because she became worse at running. Rather, it was because she couldn’t stay focused when she was running.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than anything else, she felt embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She felt like her action was insulting the sports itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;*Sigh*”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe’s steps were heavy. Each step was filled with her anguish and regret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there were people around, she’d always try to make it as if she was okay, but whenever there was no one around, she’d always find herself sighing and doing nothing all day long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so, I still have to do it…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt painful, yet Tomoe reminded herself over and over that this was something that she must do. No matter how much she was hurting, no matter what she had to sacrifice, she told herself that this was her duty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That idiot over there, why do you look so down? I can see why the captain sent you home early.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Aoi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After hearing someone calling up to her, Tomoe was finally able to register her surroundings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was then that she realized that Aoi was waiting for her in front of the school gate and she was currently forcefully grabbing her collar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, you’re so out of it. At least pay attention to your surroundings, you’ll get into an accident if you walk around listlessly like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu… T-There’s no way that’ll happen! I-I’m perfectly fine!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure you are. You know that I can tell you’re forcing yourself to act cheerful, right? Seriously, if you keep this up, nothing good will happen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi released her hands from Tomoe’s collar and firmly grabbed her shoulders before pulling her closer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In any case, follow me. There’s someone that can solve your problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words were like finding an oasis in the middle of a desert. Tomoe, who was nearly at her limit, had no reason to turn her best friend down, so she nodded her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, I’m Satou Takayuki, a love counselor. Nice to meet you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment she sat down in front of her notorious classmate, Tomoe regained her vigor out of fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki’s irreverent smile somehow triggered her survival instinct.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Aoi? You’re making me doubt our three years-long friendship…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi dragged her to a restaurant that hadn&#8217;t even opened yet without giving her a chance to resist. Then she dragged her to the corner of the restaurant only to find Takayuki there, waiting for her with his usual irreverent smile. Considering how many bad rumors were circling around about the boy, Tomoe’s reaction was justified.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine, Tomoe, just trust me. I hold one of his weaknesses, so you don’t need to be wary of him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aoi, while I’m thankful to you, your words just made me scared of you instead of him…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;See, Satou-kun? I told you going to a cafe will be better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cafes are no good, too many people there. This is as good as we get because it isn’t like we can rent a room in a hotel somewhere. I had a lot of trouble trying to get permission from the owner’s wife to borrow this place, you know? Give me a break.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, so that’s why you were playing with the children the other day. It was to gain her trust.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Though I could only use this place for specifically high school students&#8217; clients.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Tomoe saw them talking normally in front of her, she let her guard down a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy was here to help her, she understood that much at least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First of all, let me apologize, Tomoe. I told him about your situation without asking for your permission. Even if I’m your best friend, I did something inappropriate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The counseling began with Aoi bowing her head to Tomoe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-Don’t be! Y-You were only thinking about me, you don’t need to apologize!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, I shoulda asked for your permission first. Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Seriously, you don’t need to act like this, it isn’t a big deal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe responded to Aoi’s apology with a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she knew that she didn’t do anything wrong, Aoi still apologized. Tomoe began to appreciate the loyalty of her best friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, let me tell you this, Miyama didn’t mean to tell me that she was talking about you. It’s just, I managed to guess it thanks to me knowing roughly about our classmates’ love lives.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki gave Aoi, who was still bowing her head, a follow up. Then, he continued,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, no matter how hard you’re trying to keep your situation a secret, it will leak sooner or later. I know that you guys are spreading rumors to keep everyone from going after Naotsugu’s a**. But you know, what? That won’t stop people from finding out about the truth. Also, Ukai, if you keep this up, you’ll reach the limit eventually and when that happens, even that awfully dense childhood friend of yours will notice that there’s something wrong with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki’s words made Tomoe’s shoulders jolted in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, it wasn’t like she hadn&#8217;t thought about that outcome. It was just, she had been busy trying to prevent that outcome from happening,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard that you had to take a leave early from your club today. Sure, you can get by for a few days if you tell people that you aren’t feeling well, but if the situation doesn’t change, eventually, people will connect the dots and find out about your situation with Naotsugu. That will be enough for people to make up absurd rumors about your childhood friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The calm remarks from a third party had enough of an effect to make Tomoe’s face turn pale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What little energy that she had was starting to fade away at a rapid pace. She began to worry that all of her efforts had been in vain or maybe even counterproductive. Tomoe hung her head down and clutched her chest tightly. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If only I could erase these feelings, everything would be easier for me,’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> she thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And so, let’s finish it all before it’s too late, Ukai. I’m going to take those feelings away from you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Um, what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She failed to understand his words. Her head that had been hanging down was involuntarily raised up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until just now, his words had been filled with things that made her feel despair. The sudden lifeline that he gave her threw Tomoe’s heart into turmoil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Um, Aoi?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just trust him for now. It isn’t like we have a lot of choice here. Don’t worry, if he were to try something strange, I’ll break his fingers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Puzzled, Tomoe turned her gaze toward her best friend. But, Aoi’s reply didn’t clear her confusion at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Buzz off! Hands off my fingers, I won’t do anything to her!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my? You should be happy, a beautiful girl is holding your hand willingly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If anything I’m going to cry because you’re gripping it so tightly… Anyway…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki tried to pry Tomoe’s hand away from him before turning his gaze back to Tomoe. His pathetic look was gone, replaced by a calm and serious look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ukai. Tell me everything about your circumstances. If you don’t do this, I won’t be able to do anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Could it be…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe took a glance at Aoi, but before Aoi could open her mouth, Takayuki already cut her off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Miyama hasn&#8217;t told me anything. This is a sensitive matter for you, isn’t it? She knows better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe nodded weakly. She felt ashamed for suspecting her best friend even after everything that she had done for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But still, we won’t get anywhere if you were to keep your mouth shut like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe nodded and looked up. Her gaze met Takayuki’s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His eyes, normally looked gloomy and stagnant, similar to that of a dead animal’s, perfectly reflected Tomoe’s figure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Tomoe was still hesitant to tell Takayuki about this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I understand your feelings. Speaking your heart out is hard, everyone also feels the same way, but you know what? Your silence won’t fix anything, Ukai. I know that it’s hard for you to trust me, but know that it was Miyama who brought you to me. She’s genuinely concerned about you, so just trust her instead. And so…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki stared at Tomoe’s eyes and asked her a question, as if trying to probe her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ukai Tomoe, what was it that made you willingly throw yourself into this path ridden with thorns?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before long, Tomoe’s mouth began to move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">* </span><span style="font-weight: 400">  *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It happened back when Tomoe was a fourth grader. During a picnic in the middle of autumn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why Tomoe fell in love was because she actually fell down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, her love began when she fell off a cliff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t hard to figure out the cause. As a kid, Tomoe was a tomboy who loved to run around. She was the kind of kid who’d let her feet lead her everywhere. During that time, Tomoe was running on a mountain road that looked more like a mountain trail than anything. Her parents warned her to not go too far but to no avail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even back then, she was already the fastest kid in her age range. The bumpy mountain road, filled with thick tree roots, rough rocks and rough paths were only fueling her determination to run faster rather than making her wary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she was running around and came across a thick patch of grass, her world flipped upside down. But Tomoe, clueless as she was, didn’t even notice her situation until the moment her body was about to hit the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouchie… Hehe, that was a failure! But at least the cliff wasn’t as high as I thought.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe found out that she had messed up when she noticed Naotsugu, who managed to break her fall spectacularly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naotsugu himself had been chasing after her out of worry. The moment he saw Tomoe was about to fall into the cliff, he jumped in to save her without hesitating. In the end, he ended up falling right under Tomoe’s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-Nao! Your leg! Your leg!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m… Fine! I-I can take this much… T-This barely hurts me, instead i-it’s making me yawn. B-But, can you call my parents here? I-I’m a little tired…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Y-Yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it turned out, neither of them were seriously injured.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like Naotsugu mentioned, the cliff wasn’t that high. Naotsugu’s body was strong enough to endure the fall and break Tomoe’s fall on top of that. Aside from that, there was actually a clinic just near their picnic spot, so they could receive treatment almost immediately. The fall wouldn’t hinder their normal lives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or at least that would be the case if they lived in a perfect world. Sadly, Naotsugu’s leg had to be sacrificed for their well being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry… I’m sorry, Nao!…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine, it’s fine! I love milk anyway! I’ll drink enough of them to get better in no time!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naotsugu’s words somehow came true when school started, though he still had to wear a cast on his left leg. Both his overall health and broken leg was healed a week ahead of schedule with no aftereffects. In fact, as soon as he wore off his cast, he could immediately play baseball again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, he was unable to participate in the baseball tournament he wanted to be in. No matter how fit he was, it was impossible to participate in a tournament with a broken leg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe’s first love began from this point. The fact that Naotsugu risked his life to save her from a tough situation was enough to make those feelings appear in her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, she never confessed her feelings to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because starting from this time onward, their relationship had become slightly distorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomo is in danger! I have to save her!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having almost lost his childhood friend right in front of his eyes, Naotsugu grew to be overprotective of her. As long as Tomoe didn’t reject his presence, he’d always try to find a way to stick by her side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The accident had distorted the nature of their relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her childhood friend caring for her made Tomoe happy. Alongside that happiness though, there was a slight pain. Over time, the pain that she felt became stronger and stronger to the point that it became unbearable for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now, that pain was ready to tear Tomoe’s heart apart.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In other words, you’re in love with Mihara, but at the same time, you feel guilty for loving him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Tomoe finished telling her story, Takayuki summarized the content in a muttering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing his muttering, something clicked in Tomoe’s mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel guilty? …I guess so, huh?&#8230; I feel guilty for loving him…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A wry smile appeared on her face, but it only showed for a moment as she immediately covered her face with both hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, everything was my fault, you know? If I didn’t do such a stupid thing, Nao wouldn’t be injured… He could have participated in that tournament back then… But… But… Instead of feeling bad about it, I fell in love with him instead! I thought that he was cool back then! He sacrificed his life for me and I was all giddy about it! Hahaha! I’m so disgusting, right? I know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, her words were filled with grunts before she started screaming her words out. Not long after, she started to laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She laughed at her pathetic self.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At her own feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right! I made a fool of myself and thanks to that, Nao had been treating me like an annoying little sister that he couldn’t get rid off even if he wanted to! Sure, I could confess my feelings to him and we could probably live happily ever after, but I don’t want that! I don’t care about my feelings for him! Hell, if I could throw these feelings away, I would do it in a heartbeat! All I wanted is to go away from his life, I’ll be content with that! That should be the thing that I wanted but… When Nao said he fell in love with someone, I became a wreck like this… Seriously, I’m such an idiot…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her best friend struggling to say anything more as her face was starting to be covered with tears and snot, Aoi opened her mouth, trying to say something. But, no words came out of her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was nothing she could say to her. Tomoe was currently in a really fragile state, if Aoi were to be careless with her words, she’d end up hurting her best friend even more. She started to blame herself for her powerlessness. The girl simply couldn’t stand seeing her best friend’s tears any longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi knew that Tomoe was by no means in the wrong here. So, she decided to tell her to accept her own feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let Tomoe be ridden in her guilt and suffer for a bit more, driving her to the limits with cold words. And after all that, try to comfort her somehow with warm, yet strong words. Reward her suffering with the warmest feelings she could provide. The method was clumsy, but this was the only thing that Aoi could come up with to stop her best friend’s tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re not done yet, Ukai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, before Aoi could do anything, Takayuki called out to Tomoe, completely ignoring Aoi’s dilemma.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, why do you act like you’re giving up? Didn’t I tell you before that I’m going to take your pain away? I’m going to do it now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His words sounded so light that no one would be blamed if they were to take them as a bad joke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If one were to follow the common sense, there was nothing Takayuki could do here. The cause of Tomoe’s problem was something that was irreversible, even Aoi, her best friend, couldn&#8217;t think of a way to solve her problem. Takayuki’s confidence reminded Aoi of a certain young boy who said something similar to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Stop joking. There’s no way you could do such a convenient thing. Or are you telling me that you’re going to use magic right now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, Tomoe called bull on his words. According to common sense, there was no way that kind of convenience method existed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exactly, I’m going to use my magic right now. It’s a tiny little magic that will make your pain and suffering disappear, but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Except that the boy who was sitting in front of her with his lips curved up didn’t look like someone who’d act according to the common sense that Tomoe knew.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way he smiled made Tomoe feel eerie. It made the boy in front of her seem inhuman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My magic isn’t omnipotent. Once I erased those feelings, it’s gone forever. Just like you can’t fix a cracked egg, you can’t get your love back no matter how hard you’re crying to me. That’s why I’m going to ask you, are you okay with this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Irreverent and confident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had an expression that said he could overturn the world even if he wanted to. Evil was a word that could describe his expression. If Takayuki were to admit that he was actually the devil at that moment, Tomoe would easily believe him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yes, I’m okay with that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, Tomoe gave in to the devil’s whispers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, the devil in front of her was able to grant her something that she had always wanted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For that reason, making a deal with the devil didn’t sound so bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll believe your nonsense as long as I can erase these feelings, Satou…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Let me ask you once again just to make sure. You’re okay with this? I won’t accept any take backs after this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, just proceed.”</span></p>

<p><b>“I mean, I never wanted to be Nao’s lover. I just want to help him achieve his dreams.”</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe shrugged off Takayuki’s words as she spoke of her true feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she wiped her face that was stained with tears and snot with her uniform and smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m ready.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe stood up from her seat and declared those words proudly with the most Tomoe-like smile that Aoi had ever seen. It was the smile of a person who’d brave through any danger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phew… I see… Well, sit down first, we have to follow the procedure if we want to do this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, her smile didn’t last long as it was replaced by a cramped smile filled with embarrassment. She regretted acting so courageously like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This won’t hurt, relax.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Are you sure?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Miyama, go grab— I mean, support her from behind. Yes, just like that, perfect. Now, Ukai, like I said, this won’t hurt, you can even keep your eyes opened if you want to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? W-Wait, what are you going to do to me?! Why does the procedure look so ordinary? I-I’m not going to die, am I?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ordinary looking procedure made Tomoe feel uneasy more than anything. She expected something more grandiose, but instead she had a feeling like she was facing a dentist right now. It was supposed to be nothing big, but the dread she felt was immense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, don’t worry, it’ll be done in a jiffy, Tomoe… Right, Satou-kun?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi turned her glance toward Takayuki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. We’ve gone through the most painful process, so all I need to do is to finish it in one go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki’s expression didn’t change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a confident smile on his face, he casually extended his fingertips to Tomoe’s forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For me, eating out someone’s ‘love’ is as easy as taking candy from a baby.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment his finger touched Tomoe’s forehead, the latter’s consciousness was cut off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi witnessed everything up close.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the moment Takayuki’s fingertips touched Tomoe’s forehead and she lost her consciousness. Then right after that, something that looked like mist emerged from her limp body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mist-like substance looked glittery as it swirled around Takayuki’s finger. Eventually, it turned spherical before Takayuki casually threw it into his mouth as if he was eating candy. From his gesture, it seemed like he was used to doing this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s hard, bitter and salty. It tastes like burnt bacon and eggs. The classic taste of regret and anguish.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Contrary to his spiteful tone, his expression was cheerful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, when he noticed that Aoi was staring at him, his expression turned awkward. He let out a few coughs before changing his expression to his normal one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Miyama… Like I said, this is something similar to magic. Ukai lost consciousness because her body finally let go of all the tension that she felt previously. She’ll regain her consciousness soon, so don’t worry–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Satou-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Aoi’s unexpectedly firm tone, Takayuki stood up straight. He was trying to decide what kind of expression should he show to her in this kind of situation, an important decision since it concerned his life and death. After all, if he were to make a wrong decision here, he’d most likely be finished socially. One thing was certain for him, though. No matter what he said here, the end result would be the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, there was no one in this world that managed to perceive his power, let alone understanding or remembering it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What was that just now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, something that exceeded Takayuki’s expectations happened right in front of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That glittering mist…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You can see it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it wasn’t only his expectation that was overturned, his common sense was also overturned by the girl in front of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Am I not supposed to see it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noticing Takayuki’s frozen expression, Aoi let out a smile as she tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Uh, not really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki decided to run away since there was no way that he could deceive her at this point. But before he could do anything, Aoi already grabbed his hand tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was then that he noticed Tomoe’s body resting peacefully while leaning on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Satou-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, let’s talk this out. I know how you feel, but as human beings we should try to solve everything by talking it out first! So, please let go of my hand— Huh? Miyama?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That red hairpin.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki stopped his pleading as he made eye contact with Aoi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He didn’t notice it because he was afraid of her, but unlike what he had expected, there was no anger in Aoi’s eyes. Instead, there was an indescribable pure and intense emotion there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My hero. My cool hero.”</span></p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4657" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-717x1024.png" alt="" width="717" height="1024" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-717x1024.png 717w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-210x300.png 210w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-768x1097.png 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-75x106.png 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-1076x1536.png 1076w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-125x180.png 125w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3.png 1434w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Aoi said something that only a select amount of people would understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was prayer and hope hidden beneath those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki’s eyes widened in response to that. The face he made looked so weird that it wouldn’t be strange if Aoi were to laugh at him for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha… Hahaha! What the hell, hero? That’s not something you’d normally say to a monster like me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though he laughed, there seemed to be sadness hidden beneath his laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoi didn’t know why Takayuki was making a face like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was one thing that she knew. No matter how inexplicable the situation was, there was one thing that Aoi was sure of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We met again, my hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the fact that she was finally reunited with her childhood hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mihara Naotsugu’s love life was going well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the help of his childhood friend, he managed to befriend the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> he had a crush on. At first, he was afraid of being unable to talk with her since they were in different clubs, but with Tomoe giving him enough courage to do so, he managed to successfully capture his crush’s interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At this point, if I were to confess to her, won&#8217;t she accept it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot, what did I tell you?! Don’t be too pushy or else she’ll come to hate you instead!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, even when his love life was successful, he never forgot to go home together with his childhood friend. It seemed like it was ingrained within his body to do so without him realizing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“G-Got it, I won’t do that! So, should I pull back a little? That way she won’t think I’m being pushy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot, if you do that, she’ll think that you came to hate her! Think about it for a second! She’s a quiet and ladylike person, if you were to pull that move on her, you’ll just hurt her!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-Then, what should I do?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For starters, keep your eyes off her chest!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D**n, that’s a tough one!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was how they usually interacted with each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomoe was like a little sister to Naotsugu, someone that he had to protect. She was also a good friend that he could rely on. It was because of Tomoe’s help that his dull self managed to catch an eye of his crush. For that, he was grateful to Tomoe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“With that said… I guess we can’t walk to school together anymore, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why, when Tomoe said those words as a joke, it made Naotsugu stop in his tracks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? What are you so surprised about? Think about it for a second, I’m a girl, a pretty one to boot. If I were to keep staying by your side, you won’t be able to get a girlfriend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-That… B-But… I-It’s dangerous for a girl to walk to school by herself!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll be fine! I can just go with my friend! Rather, I’m thankful that I won’t be going with you since I’ll be going with the most beautiful girl at school every morning! Eat that, you loser!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomo, I’m not joking—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know what, Nao?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To prevent Naotsugu from saying anything else, Tomoe held her finger on his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. I can get by myself even without you, Nao.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she showed him a fragile smile that seemed like it was about to disappear at any moment, Naotsugu understood everything. But sadly for him, everything was too late. That was why he could only respond to her with a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He started blaming himself for being the worst kind of a**hole to his best friend. He convinced himself that someone like him should just ram his head to a pole and die right then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. I guess so, huh? We’re already high school students, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naotsugu then muttered the words that would change their relationship forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, he finally realized that relationships were something that could change over time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phew… Everything’s finally over…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying what she needed to her childhood friend, she immediately parted ways with him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she had no plans afterwards. After all, parting ways from him was something that she did in spur of the moments. She just wanted them to be apart from each other, that was it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;At least I managed to say everything properly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for some reason, she was wearing a proud smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pain of her broken heart made her tremble a little, but it wasn’t enough to make her cry, hell it wasn’t even enough to make her stop walking. She knew that over time, even this painful experience would turn into a good memory for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, now what should I do?~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she walked along the road, she suddenly felt a small vibration coming from her phone. When she opened it, she found out that one of her classmates invited her to a karaoke session.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, well, I guess that’s what I’m gonna do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a grin on her face, she turned around and started walking again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the lonely way home, to the place where her friends were at.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Everything seems to be okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re so overprotective, don’t you realize that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speak for yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aftercare is part of the service.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Watching Tomoe from the shadows were Aoi and Takayuki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the determined look on Tomoe’s face, the two were sure that she was going to be okay. Nevertheless, it was human nature to be worried over others, so they didn’t stop watching her until she was out of their sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’ve seen enough, so I’m going now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, Satou-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope, I’m busy. Save it for later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can’t you spare some time for me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope, the kids will cry if I dawdle any longer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kids?&#8230; Ah, is it the payment for borrowing the restaurant the other day? Well, since it’s that important, it can’t be helped then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s unrelated. I need to hurry because the limousine will arrive anytime soon, so see you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Limousine?! Wait, what?! Hey, I’m not done yet!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki managed to slip out from Aoi’s grasp when she let her guard down a little. His movements were too quick for Aoi to follow and he managed to get far enough to disappear from her sight. However, there was something that Takayuki managed to overlook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, I can ask him tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the fact that they were classmates. Whether he liked it or not, he’d have to deal with her again tomorrow.</span></p>
