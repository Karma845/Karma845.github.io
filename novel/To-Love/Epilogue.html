<h3>Epilogue &#8211; Sugar Spice, the Love-Eater</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You got kissed, but you don’t look flustered at all. You seem used to it. Are those rumors about you being a playboy true? “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not. Besides that was my first kiss.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-That was your first kiss?! You must be glad that you did it with a pretty girl like her then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-Partner, you’re making a scary face.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A while after Haruka ran off, Aoi managed to recover from her shock and was currently together with Takayuki. It was clear that she was in a bad mood from the glare that she was giving him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki wasn’t dense enough to not notice her feelings. Though, he wasn’t conceited enough to think that the reason for her feeling this way was because she had the hots for him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And he was correct for thinking like that. The reason why she acted this way was because of her childish jealousy, not romantic feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-Right, Miyama, do you want to go to a coffee shop nearby? I’ll pay for your drink.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I have to pass. I’ve planned to go to the new crepe shop with Yuzu— I mean, my friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki didn’t hate her for it, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their relationship was different than back when they were kids. If it was back then, he’d dislike her selfishness because she was someone that he hated. Now, he felt happy that she held him in such high regards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Have fun with your friend then. I hope your mood will get better.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why he didn’t mind her sulking like this. He could try to comfort her, but he knew that words meant nothing. Instead, he promised himself to live up to her expectations so that she could be proud of him as her hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, he waved his hand to Aoi and walked away. He thought that this action was the correct action to take for the time being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Um, S-Satou-kun!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But his steps were stopped by Aoi’s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike her usual dignified voice, her voice cracked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-Me too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki turned around, only to find out that Aoi was right in front of him. He was about to fall from surprise, but Aoi grabbed his hand and prevented the fall. While holding his hands with all her might, Aoi said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I cherished the time I had with you too, Satou-kun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With embarrassed smile, eyes locked to Takayuki’s, Aoi told him her true feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks to you, I became the person I am now! That’s why, this time, I’ll help you! I’ll turn you into a proper human being, so one day you can fall in love with someone someday!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see. I’ll be counting on you, partner.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While staring at the red-faced Aoi, Takayuki smiled at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t his usual irreverent or fearless smile, but rather a mature-looking one that one would never expect coming from a young man like him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“! T-That’s all! T-That’s all I wanted to say!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After making that confession, Aoi ran away like a rabbit. In no time, she managed to get out of Takayuki’s sight, as expected of the talent that even the track club coveted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, seriously, that girl…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing this scene, a wry smile appeared on Takayuki’s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her smile was so pretty that it actually made his heart skip a beat. If he didn’t know the context of her words, he’d most likely blushed too when he heard her confession. Then there was the other girl who confessed her love to him. Thinking about the two of them made Takayuki let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after all those things happened, he still couldn’t sense any trace of love for those two.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A monster like me trying to be a hero again? How presumptuous of me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think so. I think it’s interesting to see a fallen hero trying to rise up again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takayuki turned his gaze toward the person who answered his self-deprecative question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s been a while, isn’t it? My lovely contractor, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sugar Spice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Takayuki Satou.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of his gaze was a witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dressed in a pitch black dress. With cat-like eyes and an irreverent laugh, the supernatural being appeared out of thin air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s about time for you to understand the significance of the price that you had to pay for. So, how does it feel?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the unexpected reunion, Takayuki was at a loss. But, the witch covered the silence with her words. Like the Cheshire Cat, a crescent moon formed on her lips as she started to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is the ‘romantic feelings’ that you sacrificed back then worth the price of your ability?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed. Seven years ago, to save a girl, Satou Takayuki offered his romantic feelings as a price to the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the reason why he was unable to love anyone in his life. Not Takayama Yui, Amamiya Haruka nor Miyama Aoi. No matter how pretty and wonderful the girls around him were, he would never fall for them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, the love-eating monster had no need to feel love itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Right. I really didn’t know anything back then. Now I know the weight of the price I paid.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the first response he managed to utter to the witch. He forcefully made a relaxed smile before confronting the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehe, is that so? No amount of regret will be able to make me return it to you, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a wicked smile, she continued to ask him a series of questions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, did you regret the choice you made back then? Did your past self irk you so? If only you didn’t try to save that selfish princess back then, you wouldn’t need to suffer like this. In the end, you stopped being a hero. Was everything worth it? Tell me, do you regret it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the poor boy who turned into a monster because he was greedy for power, the witch asked the question; “How does it feel, to live a living hell like this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t regret anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To her surprise, there wasn’t a slightest hint of hesitation in his words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Honestly, I feel so rewarded right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no falsehood in his words. He looked too confident and happy for the witch to assume that his answer was a mere bluff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have the best partner, Miyama Aoi, by my side. Honestly, it’ll be greedy of me to ask for more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha… I agree with you. She’s the perfect match for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing his answer, the witch’s body shook in amusement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, I haven’t given up, Witch. I still remember your words. Or are you telling me that your words back then were a lie?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not. Well, not like it matters much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her smile deepened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In this world, nothing can beat true love. Not magic, not super power.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said those words casually. As if she was talking with a friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as she closed her mouth and finished her words, her body turned into countless crows and disappeared from Takayuki’s sights. If he didn’t know any better, he would probably think that he was hallucinating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’ll do my best.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite that, Takayuki still managed to direct those words at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much love he ate, his determination won’t change. To reach that goal, he made a solemn vow to the world and himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Do your best.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shortly after the witch disappeared from Takayuki’s sight, a certain high school girl walking near the school gate muttered those words. She made a similar looking smile as the witch, but her appearance was completely different from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Oops, no, no, that isn’t right…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then she realized that she wasn’t supposed to play that character when wearing this appearance. So, she wiped the smile off her face, wore her usual expressionless look and put on her glasses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you wait long, Aoi? …Why is your face so red? Did you catch a cold? Shall we call it off for the day?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m fine! I-I just… I-I did my best this time!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She casually exchanged words with the bad friend that she met near the school gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the youthful look of her friend in front of her, the witch entered her mundane life again.</span></p>
