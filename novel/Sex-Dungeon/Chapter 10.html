<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; The Erotic Book and The Hourglass</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Harumachi-sensei went home, I pondered what to do afterwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My original plan was to explore the third floor with Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Sensei had gone home abruptly and if I were to explore, it would be on my own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My strength would be greatly reduced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as well as exploring, I had other options.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Lucky Band] and [Special Sleepover Ticket].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these two items, I can do erotic things to someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even without using them, I could easily have sex with Fuyushima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was also possible to raise my Lv.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exploration or Sex?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little troubled but I easily came to a conclusion without spending too much time on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All I have to do now is explore&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, that&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gear up, stand at the entrance to the dungeon and let out a big sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I feel between my legs is weariness and a slight ache.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve ejaculated so much that I can&#8217;t even seem to get an erection anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t possibly use my penis any more, no matter what position I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My libido is sated and exploration would be better than eroticism at the moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..okay”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I firmly grasped the [Romance Crossbow] and started to walk towards the end of the stone corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I walk, I look at the palm of my hand and see the number 17 written there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eight times with Fuyushima-san and once with Harumachi-sensei.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My Lv, which was 8 previously, seems to have gone up.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘With this Lv, it&#8217;s probably okay to explore alone&#8230;.but I can never be too careful.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lvl of monsters in the third floor is between 10 and 15, so all the enemies that appear are of a lower rank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Based on my experience so far, I can win almost without danger if my Lvl is 3 higher than theirs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only this time, I should have little difficulty in combat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued down the first and second floors, using the direct passageways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, I arrived at the third floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A reddish-black landscape unfolds before my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The third floor is still eerily coloured.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I braced myself, pulled out my smartphone and launched the mapping app.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My last exploration ended quickly, so the map was barely filled in.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I went with the right-hand method last time, so this time I should try to go along the left-hand wall&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deciding on this plan, I turn left at the first fork, which divides into left and right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The road immediately turned at the end of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look beyond it with alarm, and this time there is a straight passage of about 30 metres.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;. It&#8217;s quiet. No sign of the monster.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Breathing slowly, I move forward.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, it seems like the troublesome enemy &#8230;&#8230;[Dungeon Runners] on the third floor are not nearby.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the [Angry Butterflies] and [One-Eyed Balloons] are basically silent monsters, so I can never be too careful.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They may be higher in level, but if I strike them by surprise, they&#8217;ll take some serious damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue on my way and carefully make my way down the passage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a considerable sense of tension, partly because Harumachi sensei is absent for the first time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I make a mistake today, there is no one to help me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; and about fifteen minutes into the exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the first of several turns, I saw something unusual.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘! That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of the turn, a long passageway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle of it, there is something floating in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was red, spherical in shape and about two metres in diameter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looked like a perfectly large balloon, but it had a huge, gaping eye in the centre, with a vicious mouth with fangs protruding just below it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no doubt&#8230;&#8230;it’s a [One-Eyed Balloons].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly hid in a corner and put my smartphone in my pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with both hands on the [Romance Crossbow], I peaked out to see what the enemy was up to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps I was lucky not to be spotted, but there was no sign of alarm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are just floating in the air, staring at the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I closed one eye and saw that the number floating in the air was 13.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems to be four levels lower than me but how advantageous will it be in battle?</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I have some distance and I can strike first. The question is how many arrows to use&#8230;.’</span></i></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While aiming using the iron sights, I pondered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can probably get at least two shots off before the enemy gets close to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there are a total of five arrows in the [Romance Crossbow].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether to use two of them here is a bit of a question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I can return home once I run low on arrows, but there is a good chance that I will unexpectedly encounter a lot of enemies on the way back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is better to save arrows and fight close quarters as much as possible.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; let&#8217;s just shoot once. I think it’s not gonna be a hard battle due to the lvl difference and it&#8217;s better not to waste arrows.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After much deliberation, I came to that conclusion.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lvl 13 is a middle class enemy in this third floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be a waste to use two arrows against one opponent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I keep my finger on the trigger with my sights perfectly set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I aim for the middle of the [One-Eyed Balloons].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The monster hasn&#8217;t noticed me, so it should be quite surprised by my sudden attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If possible, I&#8217;d like to take that opportunity to get close to the monster at once and aim for a follow-up attack with the knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, my index finger pulled the trigger.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bash!</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An arrow is shot out at high speed from the [Romance Crossbow].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It flew into the middle of the [One-Eyed Balloons] and sucked in, just as I aimed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the moment it landed, a bang sound rang out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Ooo!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unexpected ending caused an unintentional cry to leak out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The  [One-Eyed Balloons] , which was supposed to be floating at the end of the passage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It burst like a real balloon, flattened and fell to the floor and&#8230;..immediately turned into a swarm of light particles.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the battle was over with a single blow.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Amazing&#8230;&#8230;this [Romance Crossbow] is powerful to begin with, but the effect increased by lvl has made it even more powerful?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lvl 13 enemy was killed by a single blow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Twin Dolls] we fought yesterday didn&#8217;t fall even after two shots at lvl 11, so considering that, their attack power seems to have increased considerably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there is also the possibility that the arrow just happened to be the weak point of the [One-Eyed Balloons].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even then, it wouldn&#8217;t be a one-shot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s more natural to assume that my attack power has simply increased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take out my smartphone again and resume my exploration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can never be too careful, but from the feel of the current battle, it still looks like I won&#8217;t have a hard time against the enemies on this floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to fill in the map at a slightly faster pace than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way, I encountered the [One-Eyed Balloons] again, but this time it was lvl 12.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, I defeated it with a single blow and continued my exploration in almost no time at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..and about 40 minutes after the start of the exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the map nearly half full, I finally spotted a familiar entrance at the end of the passage.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Nice, the small room &#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart is racing, not from nervousness but from anticipation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There will be enemies, so of course I have to keep my mind sharp, but even so, I don&#8217;t feel like losing because of the previous battles and my attention has completely turned to the items.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t wait to see what items I would get this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Su…..Haa…..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realise that I have let my guard down and try to take a deep breath to calm myself down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Yeah, I think I may have got my heart rate down a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I&#8217;ve regained some of my wariness to the monsters inside, although my expectations for the items haven&#8217;t been completely extinguished.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a few deep breaths, I finally approached the entrance to the small room with my stealthy footsteps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cautiously peeked inside and saw that there was a…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;. I see, the guardian of the treasure chest is an [Angry Butterflies]’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, the treasure chest is in the centre of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a huge yellow butterfly perched on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it spread its wings, it would be about the same size as a [One-Eyed Balloons].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In reality, it is unbelievably large.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks beautiful in its own way, but if I look closely at the pattern on its wings, it looks like the Japanese character for 『anger』.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[『怒』]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t think of any other name than [Angry Butterflies] when I look at this pattern&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would have been easy for the writer of the diary to give it a name.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Lvl&#8230;&#8230;13? It&#8217;s the same level as the [One-Eyed Balloons], which I defeated with a single blow just now.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I close one eye and look at it, the number 13 floats over the [Angry Butterflies].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a number that almost makes me feel relaxed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I hurriedly told myself not to let my guard down and put more strength into the hand that held the [Romance Crossbow].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no guarantee that I will be able to defeat them with a single blow this time as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The monster will do everything in its power to defeat me and if I’m not careful, it will be obvious that I will be in for a world of pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And…</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘As I recall, the [Angry Butterflies] attack by scattering scaly phosphorus. Even if I can defeat it, it will leak it out and that would be dangerous if I inhaled it.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recall the characteristics of the [Angry Butterflies] described in the diary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the [Angry Butterflies] do not attack directly to inflict damage, they are covered with harmful scales.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I inhale it, I’ll lose control of my body for a certain period of time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, it is said that the scales turn into light particles once they are defeated, but the anomaly continues even if they are defeated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If a [Dungeon Runners] were to unluckily run into me in such a situation, I would surely take heavy damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such a situation that should definitely be avoided.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘For the time being, I should be prepared to use all the remaining arrows I have left.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I brace myself, and quietly set up the [Romance Crossbow] so that no one can detect my presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Angry Butterflies] remain perched on the treasure chest and do not move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It does not seem to notice me at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly pulled the trigger.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bash!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ＢＵＡＡ……!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;a hit!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An arrow pierced the two wings of the [Angry Butterflies], and it let out what sounded like a cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, because of the arrow, it was unable to move its wings and fell to the ground and began to writhe. &#8230;&#8230;A few seconds later, it stopped moving as if it had run out of power, and at once turned into particles of light.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..I won, right?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Watching the particles of light being absorbed into the dungeon, I lowered the [Romance Crossbow].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an easy victory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although  I was cautious, I was able to end the battle with a single blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that I can confidently defeat enemies up to at least lvl 13 with a single blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Alright.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming that the light particles have completely disappeared, I enter the small room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, there&#8217;s nothing particularly wrong with my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scales seem to have disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approached the treasure chest as it was and slowly opened its lid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside…</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..eh’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked inside the treasure chest in anticipation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was something very unexpected inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the kind of thing that&#8230;&#8230;boys wouldn&#8217;t be able to mistake for something else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The kind of magazines that kids shouldn&#8217;t see at the end of a convenience store bookshelf.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I actually keep a few of them in my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, I mean, this is &#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ero, erotic books&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rub my eyes and look again but the contents of the treasure chest remain the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are just the usual instructions and the&#8230; erotic book with an obviously quesntionable cover.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This erotic book is the item&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The effects of the previous items were not clear from a quick glance, but this time they are even more unpredictable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks like a very ordinary erotic book, and to be frank, it wouldn&#8217;t look out of place even if it were sold in a convenience store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the illustration on the cover is right in the middle of my strike zone, so I would normally like to read it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the manual, bewildered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I read this,I&#8217;ll know what this item is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The&#8230;..manual says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『The [Supreme Erotic Book], the ultimate erotic book that projects the reader&#8217;s desires. As the content directly expresses the reader&#8217;s proclivities and desires, it is guaranteed to satisfy their desires if read. By writing a name in the name box on the back cover, the reader can be made aware that he or she is the owner of the book. Number of times it can be used: ∞ times.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I see”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After reading the manual, it finally makes sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought the cover was very much to my liking but apparently that was only natural considering the item&#8217;s effect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a projection of my desires, so it&#8217;s only natural that it&#8217;s to my liking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the effect of this item is quite tricky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Simply put, this item can only be used as a masturbation toy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There appears to be no effect of raising Lv.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ability to show that you are the owner by writing your name may seem like a strange feature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, my mind was able to successfully conjure up an effective use for this [Supreme Erotic Book].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;No, this item was probably designed to be used in that way in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that I can write my name on it shows that the creators had a clear aim in mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put the [Supreme Erotic Book] in rucksack and stands up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got some good stuff, but the exploration is not over yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I will retreat since I’ve an item and there are only two arrows left in the [Romance Crossbow].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at this rate, I have to dive into the dungeon again.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it might even be possible to complete the items on the third floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the small room as it was and went back the way I came, looking at the map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay&#8230;.. resuming the exploration”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After returning home and recharging my arrows, I returned back to the third floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing at the entrance, I regained my confidence with the [Romance Crossbow] in my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Supreme Erotic Book] that I obtained earlier was left at home and there is no risk to explore from this point on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I don&#8217;t want to take any damage, so let&#8217;s concentrate on the safety during the exploration.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘For now, given the shape of the map, it&#8217;s better to turn right at first&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My smartphone screen shows a half-filled map.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, the third layer also seems to be a 400 metres square, and what has been revealed so far is mainly its left side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The right side is largely unexplored.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take the first branch to the right and continue walking along the wall on the right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, I see the entrance to the small room I discovered yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pass through with caution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a possibility that the guardian has been defeated and a different monster has accidentally entered the small room and that it will attack me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; However, it seems that this fear was unnecessary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was only an empty treasure chest in the small room.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘There have never been two enemies in a small room before&#8230;..and maybe monsters other than the guardian are not allowed to enter&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I proceed down the passage, pondering in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I can&#8217;t say I have a lot of experience in the small rooms and there is no way I can come to a clear conclusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to stop thinking and concentrate on the exporation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then&#8230;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..!!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I notice a small sound of something repeating rhythmically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually, but &#8230;&#8230; clearly, the sound is getting closer to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is coming from ahead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a turn about ten metres ahead, but it seems to be coming from beyond.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘A [Dungeon Runners] or &#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately realise what the sound is and set up my [Romance Crossbow] in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps this is the sound of footsteps running down the passage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t think of anything else, and I&#8217;m probably right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Dungeon Runners] is a kangaroo-shaped monster, so its footsteps seem to have a characteristic rhythm, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">thump, thump, thump.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound continued to get closer &#8230;.. and eventually a brown thing came flying out of a corner with great force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ＧＵＢＵＵ！”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A brown thing was running too fast and crashed into a wall and squealed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s definitely a [Dungeon Runners].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I calm down and set my sights on the enemy, who is staggering and slowing down, but still coming towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s no need to rush to shoot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With my current attack power, if I hit it, I should be able to take it down with a single blow, or at least stop it from moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The worst thing that can happen is that I miss and while I&#8217;m reloading, the monster will get too close.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ＧＵＵＵＵＵ!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Dungeon Runners] rushes towards me with a ferocious cry, perhaps as a threat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I am not afraid and slowly pull the trigger.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bash!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow is fired at high speed and flies in a straight line to the Dungeon Runner with a precise aim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ＧＵＢＵＵ……!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow pierces its chest and the [Dungeon Runners] falls backwards, blown away by the impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pull the lever of the [Romance Crossbow] and load the next arrow, muttering to myself, [Okay].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it stands back up, I&#8217;ll immediately hit it with another one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will never allow it to get close.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;.. However, it seems that such preparation was not necessary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Dungeon Runners] flapped its legs and writhed in agony, then stopped moving limply and turned into a particle of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Okay”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, I lowered the [Romance Crossbow] and nodded to himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The  [Dungeon Runners] coming at me at breakneck speed was terrifying, but it was good that I was able to fight it successfully without letting it disrupt my pace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;d say it was a battle with a hundred points.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wipe away the sweat that is now starting to seep out of me and pick up my smartphone again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The exploration continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it is, ten, twenty, thirty minutes&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily, the exploration went on without encountering any enemies and the map filled up steadily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And before I could discover the last small room, I reached the middle of the floor.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hmm &#8230;..I knew the entrance to the next level was here &#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What appeared in front of me was a long, continuous descending staircase.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is the entrance to the fourth floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, the wind is blowing towards the back, as if inviting me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, I turn my backs to the staircase and resume my exploration on the third floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There should be one more item in the third floor and it would be a bit reckless to challenge the fourth floor alone, where the enemy levels are higher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be better to concentrate on exploring the third floor today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went back the way I came and took the last branch in a different direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I take this passage, I should be able to fill in the blanks on the map.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;. And how far does this dungeon go? The diary only had data up to the fifth floor, but&#8230;&#8230;’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While proceeding through the corridors, for the first time in a long time, I have doubts about the dungeon itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The third floor is almost finished and probably tomorrow I will move on to the fourth floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, I should be able to reach the fifth floor soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what happens after that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does it end at the fifth layer, or does it continue on to the sixth and seventh floors?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, how far will it go?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are so many things I don&#8217;t know.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, it&#8217;s probably useless to think about it, but the number of&#8230;..floors directly affects the number of items. &#8230;..If I end up on the fifth floor, I might not be able to waste too many items’.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number of items is three per floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This means that if the dungeon ends at the fifth level, there are only seven items left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I consume them carelessly, I may regret it later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, items with a usable count of ∞ times will stay with me forever&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But, the number of usable times is inversely related to the effectiveness of the item&#8230;..’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked back at the items I’ve acquired so far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The four items with an infinite number of times are the [Fate Intertwined Umbrella], the [Lucky Band], the [Romance Crossbow] and the [Supreme Erotic Book].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What they all have in common is that they do not directly lead to increased lvl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are all effective in getting a girl into the mood, but they do not directly induce sex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">None of them can be used to instantly increase Lv.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, the [Night-Calling Candle] and [Craving Extract], which definitely increase Lvl, can only be used a small number of times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps the number of times they could be used was reduced because they were more powerful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I could use them as many times as possible, the exploration would have been a piece of cake.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just as I was thinking about it, my footsteps jerked to a halt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around the corner, a slightly longer passageway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of it, I saw a familiar entrance.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Small room&#8230;..With this, at last, the third floor has been conquered?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got into the right frame of mind and approached the entrance, killing any sign of life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a sneaky peek inside and&#8230;..found a treasure chest and a monster guarding it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The red, round appearance is the [One-Eyed Balloons].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its level is&#8230;..15.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The highest level of the third floor, a fitting end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath, I set the sights of my [Romance Crossbow] on the centre of the [One-Eyed Balloons], which turned its back to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have four arrows left, so I have plenty of time to spare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a top-level enemy and I don&#8217;t mind firing two shots.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly prepare to reload and calm my breathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after taking enough time to steady my aim, I slowly pull the trigger.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bash!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ＫＥＫＥＥ!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The now-familiar sound of firing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow flies on target and pierces the middle of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the [One-Eyed Balloons] does not burst.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, since it has a high Lv level. The monster seems to be durable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ＫＥＥＥＥＥ!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [One-Eyed Balloons] turns towards me, drifts through the air and approaches.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is surprisingly fast.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems to be trying to take a bite out of me when I see its fanged mouth viciously open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I calmly pull the lever of the [Romance Crossbow] and load the next round.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I fired a second arrow into the mouth of the [One-Eyed Balloons] that was right in front of me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Pan!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A loud popping sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I closed my eyes but when I opened them&#8230;.the monster was no longer there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the floor and saw that the flattened red thing had turned into particles of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;It looks like I&#8217;ve won.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuu&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exhaling a tired sigh, I lowered the [Romance Crossbow].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [One-Eyed Balloons] that loomed right in front of me was quite powerful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I wasn&#8217;t used to fighting, I would have escaped in panic and ended up taking damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that sense, it was a close contest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, a victory is a victory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went into the small room and opened the lid of the treasure chest to check the loot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;an hourglass?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the treasure chest was the usual instruction manual and a small hourglass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately picked up the manual and read the contents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『The [Hourglass of Stagnation], an hourglass that can stop the thoughts of any target. The effect is triggered by looking at the target and placing it while strongly reminding it to [stop]. Duration: 30 minutes. Usable number of times: once.』</span></p>
