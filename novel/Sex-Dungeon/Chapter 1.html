<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Candles and Spring.</h3>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What&#8217;s going on&#8230;..?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our house where we live.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a detached house in the suburbs with seven rooms.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only feature is that it has a basement, but other than that it is an ordinary house with nothing special about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, at the entrance to the basement, I, Sohei Saino, was standing there, stunned and in a daze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of me was a long stone corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The walls are hung with torches every few metres for illumination, giving it the atmosphere of a Western fortress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not the scene of our basement, no matter how I look at it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I scrub my eyes to take another look at the basement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the result remained the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could only see a stone corridor.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.Should I call the police in such a situation?　Or the fire department&#8230;..?　No, I should go to the hospital and have my head examined, right&#8230;.?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to think hard about the situation, but I couldn&#8217;t come up with a good solution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Calling my parents would probably be the best thing to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But unfortunately, I don&#8217;t know how to contact them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My parents are both adventurers, and I&#8217;m sure they are currently exploring some ruins in the jungle somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My father and mother have a carefree personality, so they usually don&#8217;t keep in touch with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They rarely contacted me and I had no way of getting in touch with them.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘ &#8230;&#8230;Well, let&#8217;s do a little research here’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a bit of pondering, I decided to do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess I am my parents&#8217; blood after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unknown is right in front of me and it&#8217;s somewhat exciting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s explore it for a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I step into the corridor in my socks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The floor is reasonably flat despite being made of stone, so it&#8217;s not a bad foothold.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the next time I came in, I&#8217;d better put on proper shoes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I don&#8217;t know if there will be a next time&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘…….Where is the air coming from?? I can feel the gentle wind blowing towards me. Also, the surrounding so far doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s being encroached on by vegetation and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any danger of it collapsing.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I examine the environment as I walk carefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the place is built reasonably sturdily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I lightly tap on the wall, all I get in return is a solid, hardened wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn’t feel like it would collapse at all</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I continue to walk down the corridor, I eventually see a wall ahead of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it a corner?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is more than 50 metres from the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must have already passed under the neighbour&#8217;s house.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on in this place.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Showing no sign of danger,I approached the corner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The presence of torches means there must be people here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be best not to make a bad move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked carefully, keeping my body against the wall, and then slowly just poked my head out of the corner.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..There doesn&#8217;t seem to be anyone. So, another corridor&#8230;..and at the end of it, a descending staircase, eh?’</span></i></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I exhale loudly, trying not to make a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the moment, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not in any danger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the corridor is still long, and this time the end seems to be a staircase.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m still unsure if this is a safe place.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let&#8217;s go a little further&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just going to have a quick look, but somehow I still think I can go further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m reasonably quick on my feet, and if I find anything dangerous, I should be able to run my way back to my house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s a strong lock on the basement door, so I should be able to avoid the worst if someone comes after me.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I head for the stairs, trying not to make a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;But on the way, I found something strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About five metres from the corner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t recognise it when I saw it earlier because it was blended in with the colour of the corridor, but there was a thin notebook-like object that had fallen there.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; What&#8217;s this?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked it up and opened it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The language in which it was written seemed to be Japanese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The contents are&#8230;.some kind of memorandum.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It contains illustrations of animals in places, with some numbers and text that seems to be explanatory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, only about a quarter of the book is written, the rest is blank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the first page and read the contents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, in handwritten characters, it reads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『O you who have picked up this journal. I entrust my experience to you for your absolute happiness.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“???”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The description on the first page raises a question mark.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sentence is clearly a message to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does it mean that the book was written&#8230;&#8230;with the intention of dumping it here beforehand?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around again, checked that everything was clear, and turned the page.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the next page, a few sentences are itemised.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let&#8217;s see&#8230;&#8230;『In this labyrinth, there is a thing called Lv. Those with high Lv are strong, and those with low Lv are weak』&#8230;&#8230;? Don’t tell me, this is a game manual?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first sentence is a bit of a letdown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it would contain information about this stone corridor, but what was actually written down was like a description of a role-playing game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn&#8217;t look like it, but maybe it really is a game manual.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I decided to read the next sentence as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『You can check your Lv by looking at your palm in the labyrinth. You can check the lvl of others and monsters by looking with one eye closed.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at your palm&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to look at my own palm, half-convinced by the unfamiliar description.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there it was&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My eyes widened involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My open right hand.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was supposed to be nothing there, but in clear blue letters, the number zero was written.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Are you kidding me&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suspected some kind of trick, but I was unsure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When on earth were these numbers written?</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Was this a prank by someone to keep me from noticing&#8230;.?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, that&#8217;s highly unlikely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realised that, I would definitely notice if a pen ran across the palm of my hand.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Could it really be that what is written in the book is true?’</span></i></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With an eerie feeling, I turn my attention back to the book.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next description reads.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Lv for Monster is refers Level, and Lv for Human refers to Love. Both are indicators of strength, but monsters become stronger through combat experience, whereas humans become stronger through intercourse.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, haaa &#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stupidity of the written text makes me blurt out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can understand that monsters get stronger by fighting, well, I can understand that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But humans get stronger by having sex&#8230;..?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;d like to see a more sane description.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, the number &#8220;0&#8221; in my palm is right, but&#8230;..’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling a bit of a sore spot, I look at the numbers on my right hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is true that my experience of sexual intercourse is zero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am a virgin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that respect, this description is not wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My current Lv&#8230;&#8230;Love is zero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suppressing an impulse to smash the book on the floor, I look at the following description.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘So, um, the next part is&#8230;&#8230;『There are three treasure chests per floor in the labyrinth. The contents of the treasure chests are various magic tools, all of which can be used outside the labyrinth. The contents of the treasure chests are restored after a year, and the use of these magic tools is an effective way to raise the lvl.』&#8230;&#8230;.Magic tools huh?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to this book, there is a good amount of treasure in this labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The term 『magic tools』 is a bit dubious, but I&#8217;ll take it’s word for it, for now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As an adventurer by blood, I am more excited by such a setting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what kind of things will actually appear, but I suddenly want to go to the end of this mysterious passage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at the next sentence, feeling my heart start to race with anticipation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This sentence seems to be the last.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『If you take more than a certain amount of damage in the labyrinth, you are forcibly transferred back to the entrance of the labyrinth. At the same time, all magical tools you have obtained since you started will be lost and will be returned to its original treasure chest. It is essential that you return alive with as little damage as possible.』”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Forcibly transferred back to the entrance if I received a certain amount of damage and I&#8217;ll lose all the results of my exploration, but I won&#8217;t die&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It sounds more and more like a game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, it seems that the entrance is a safe point, and if I die, I start over from there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike the real-life adventures that my father and mother have had, this seems to be a lot less risky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I have my doubts about whether the ‘transition’ will be triggered if I was really about to die. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;alright’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slam the book shut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mind is made up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The adventurer&#8217;s blood that flows through my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems to inevitably drive me to adventure.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is this what they mean when they say You can’t fight what’s in your blood.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, anyway…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s try a dungeon crawl&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A labyrinth suddenly appeared in the basement of our house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to explore it and returned back for the moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My parents always tell me that preparation is the key to adventure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be a fool&#8217;s errand to venture into uncharted territory without any preparation.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;okay’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After completing my preparations, I stand again at the entrance to the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wore leather gloves on my hands, sturdy boots with steel plates on the soles of my feet and a safari jacket, a hand-me-down from my parents. A survival knife on my waist and a small backpack containing various tools on my back. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have a lot of adventure gear at home, so it&#8217;s all pretty serious equipment.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘According to the book, there should only be low-level monsters on the first floor&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My goal this time is to keep an eye on things, collect as many items from the first floor as possible, and make it back alive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reconfirm my goal in my head and step in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My current Lvl is 0, whereas the monsters in the first floor have Lvls 1-5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to try it once to see how far I can go and see how much the difference in lvl affects the battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also want to get at least one of the 『magic tools』 mentioned in the book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I shouldn&#8217;t get too greedy, but I should know what the rewards are for adventuring such a labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling my heart pounding, I continue down the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually I passed by the place from before and arrived right in front of those stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> From here on, it&#8217;s the monster area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first layer of enemies are the monsters.</span></p
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The enemies in the first layer are the &#8220;Lamenting Raccoon&#8221;, &#8220;Dormouse&#8221;, &#8220;Blue Rose&#8221;, &#8220;Hollow Cypress&#8221; Four types of monsters&#8230;&#8230;.nothing extraordinary I suppose.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before going downstairs, I recall the contents of the journal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve already read that book in its entirety, and the information from the first to the fifth layer has been drilled into my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That should be enough knowledge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuuuー&#8230;&#8230;Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I exhale, calm my mind and walk down the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m more excited than anxious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like an adventurous child.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; I must have gone down about fifty steps.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stairs eventually came to an end and I stepped into the first floor.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Nothing appears different from before..the wall and floor are still the same cold stone. The gentle wind is still blowing but the smell it carries is something close to being ominous&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I carefully make my way down the passage, a little concerned about what lies ahead.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/5.png"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, this is a labyrinth. The paths are intricately divided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The book didn&#8217;t describe the structure of the labyrinth and from here on, I&#8217;ll have to explore on my own.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘For now, let&#8217;s just follow the wall on the right&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded to myself in my mind and walked slowly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mazes can be easily conquered by placing your hand on the wall on the right side and just following the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is called the right hand method and is one of the typical solutions to mazes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there are many cases where this does not solve the maze, but at least I don&#8217;t have to worry about losing my way back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I decide to go back, all I have to do is turn around and walk along the wall again.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.. okay’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whenever I come to a turn, I proceed with caution and keep looking out for anything dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Forward, check around, turn, forward, check around, turn..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The labyrinth is complex and I will certainly get lost if I explore in the dark.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe next time I should come back with a map.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, even if I get lost, it is said that if I take more than a certain amount of damage, I will be transferred to the entrance, so perhaps I can make an emergency escape by inflicting self-injury.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The exploration so far went relatively well, and about ten minutes passed without incident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first floor seems to be reasonably large, and if my senses are correct, I am now about 300 metres away from the staircase in a straight line.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is why I haven&#8217;t come across any monsters yet, so the floor area is probably much larger than I imagined.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But what’s with the torchers? They are still burning brightly&#8230;&#8230;is there a principle behind it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such a question naturally comes to mind when I look at the torches hanging at equal intervals on the walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know that the combustion reaction takes place because there is air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The problem is that they kept burning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s been a long time since I discovered this labyrinth and the flames are still lit up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I recall, torches are supposed to last for two hours at most.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, I&#8217;d probably lose it if I’m that bothered&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I simply tossed the question aside and concentrated on the exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is an incomprehensible world with concepts such as Lv.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should abandon common sense accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, I arrived at a slightly open space that looked like a small room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held my breath and peeked inside from the entrance.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘In the centre is a treasure chest&#8230;&#8230;But that thing that doesn&#8217;t move by the wall is a Hollow Cypress I assumed&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room is about ten mats in size.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle is a treasure chest made of wood and iron that looks like it might contain treasures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And in the corner of the room grew a tree about two metres high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was not a single leaf on it, and the trunk of the tree had three cavities that looked like human faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The expression on his face is truly “empty”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks just like the illustration in the book, and there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that that&#8217;s a hollow cypress.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘His face is facing this way, but &#8230;&#8230; does he notice me? &#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The eerie appearance of the hollow cypress, I inwardly pondered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it is aware of me, it might be difficult for me to secretly open the treasure chest and take away the contents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, of course I don&#8217;t have the guts to do that, and I wanted to experience combat at least once, so I wouldn&#8217;t ignore it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m going to fight properly and go through the treasure chest with impunity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I close one eye just to be sure and check the lvl of the hollow cypress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A number 1 comes to mind in my vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lv1&#8230;&#8230; considering the fact that my Lv is 0, it could be said to be a moderate opponent. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m ready, drew my knife and jumped into the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UAAAAAAA&#8230;&#8230;!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A small moan of lamentation rises from the mouth of the hollow cypress.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Am I a threat to it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hollow cypress moves towards me in a nosy manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not quick, perhaps because it is dragging its roots.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It can&#8217;t seem to move as fast as me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Understanding the hit-and-run technique, I strike a blow with my knife to the torso and quickly move away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels like striking a rotting tree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather than cutting, it feels more like crushing.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The attack is going through&#8230;..!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling the response, I slashed again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time it&#8217;s the branch part that&#8217;s like an arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I succeeded in severing it as I aimed, and I quickly moved away again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UAA&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps flinching from my attack, the hollow cypress moved sluggishly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slashed again at its torso from a safe direction now that its arm is gone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I put all my strength into it and went deep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hollow cypress scattered large pieces of wood in response to my attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UA, A&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The body of the hollow cypress collapses, losing its strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the current blow was quite effective.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to attack me anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The body of the fallen hollow cypress instantly transforms into particles of light and scattered in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it was, the light particles were sucked into the ground and walls of the labyrinth, and a few seconds later everything disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s just me and the treasure chest in the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I&#8217;ve won the battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, phew&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I relax my shoulders and take a deep breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was my first time in combat and I was quite nervous, but apparently I did well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I only attacked it three times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it&#8217;s a lvl 1 monster, I could probably win rather easily now.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But it’s tiring indeed&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A great sense of fatigue was felt in my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m an ordinary student, and today is the first time I&#8217;ve ever fought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve never been in a fight in my entire life, so it&#8217;s also my first time hurting someone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though the battle lasted only a few minutes, I was very tense and tired.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let&#8217;s just take the contents of this treasure chest and go home today&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheathing my knife, I approached the treasure chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to explore as much as possible, but with my current condition, I should probably return home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should just fish out this treasure chest and end my exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly opened the treasure chest, thinking that I would have a hard time exploring the dungeon from now on.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘A candle and a piece of paper &#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the treasure chest was a plain white candle and a sheet of paper with something written on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the paper and read its contents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The writing is still in Japanese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The content seemed to be an explanation of this candle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『A candle that calls the night. When this candle is used, men and women in the room will strongly desire each other. Not for outdoor use. Can be used: once.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino, something bothering you&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? No, it&#8217;s nothing.　Is there something wrong with me?　No, there isn&#8217;t.　Of course not. Hahahaha&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That reaction is suspicious enough&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Monday, the day after my first dungeon expedition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I arrived at school, my friend immediately reacted suspiciously to me in the morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is there something wrong with my attitude today?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This friend who is always with me seems to have easily spotted the anomaly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Yesterday, I obtained my first 『magic tool』 in the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name is &#8220;The Candle That Calls The Night&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the manual that came in the treasure chest with it, it apparently has a aphrodisiac effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was quite difficult for me to keep my composure after acquiring such an item.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, it&#8217;s nothing. Look, the teacher is coming now, so go back to your seat.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?? Well, tell me if there&#8217;s something wrong.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to get rid of my friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That friend showed some concern for me, but went back to his seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phew&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not a good actor it seems and maybe I&#8217;m not the best at hiding things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have a lot more things to hide in the future, and it looks like I&#8217;ll have to train myself to act accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t really want to do that kind of training, but &#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, I might have a lot of things to do in the future, like cheat on girls&#8230;..’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel a prickle of guilt in my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the book, the magic tools obtained in the labyrinth are suitable for raising Lv.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And human Lv is the number of times you have sex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, the magic tools are things that make girls want to have sex.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘As a man, I&#8217;m happy about it, but&#8230;&#8230;is it really morally permissible&#8230;&#8230;? Well, now that I&#8217;ve got it, I&#8217;ll have to use it&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my mind&#8217;s eye, I picture my room at home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve already set up the &#8220;candle that calls the night&#8221; that I got in the dungeon yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All I have to do now is bring in some girl and light the candle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My lvl can get out of zero today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa &#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh once more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m certainly happy when my LV goes up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll be able to hold the girls and incidentally, I&#8217;ll be able to fight more easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But my conscience also appeals to me to ask whether that is really the right thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason I have this problem is because I&#8217;m a virgin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if I won&#8217;t feel guilty afterwards once I&#8217;ve had sex with a girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oraora, let&#8217;s start the morning assembly!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was troubled as it is, my homeroom teacher, Harumachi-sensei, enters the classroom with a rough tone in her voice as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I always wonder why this teacher acts like such a yankee when she looks so beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the clothes she wears are always jerseys and her long hair is shaggy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has no sex appeal at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face is a legitimate beauty with bright eyes, but she&#8217;s ruining her good looks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she had done better, she could have started a fan club.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a waste of time and money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All stand up!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Harumachi-sensei enter the classroom, this time a dignified order echoes through the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The owner of the voice is Natsuno-san, the chairperson of the committee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a cute girl, with strong-looking, hung eyes, a ponytail and a very short stature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she doesn&#8217;t like to be called cute, and is famous for not speaking to anyone who says that word to her for a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s a small but terrifying leader of this class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve never defied Natsuno-san, either, because I&#8217;m too afraid to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hekkushun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A loud, airless sneeze echoes through the classroom in the middle of a bow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person is called Akitsu-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is smiling affectionately at everyone around her, saying, [Ehehe, sorry] in a relaxed manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san is always like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has droopy eyes, a kind face and a calm personality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, her body shape is heinously glamorous and the difference between her neckline and breasts is tremendous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is sometimes courted by boys, but Natsuno-san, the chairperson of the committee, always protects her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are completely different, but they must be a good pair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one sitting next to me, with the correct posture and attention, is Fuyushima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She kept staring straight ahead, not paying attention to Akitsu-san&#8217;s sneeze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she looks as if all the noise is out of her ears is numbingly cool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have never seen Fuyushima-san speak more than necessary, and she is too quiet and somewhat out of touch with the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her appearance is also aptly described as a &#8220;Yuki Onna&#8221;, and her well-defined face and chilly gaze have always made some boys go crazy for her or something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Snow Woman)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only disappointing thing about her is that, despite her height, she doesn&#8217;t have breasts like Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I think it&#8217;s good that she&#8217;s small and cute too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘When I look at it this way, our class is full of variety&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think absentmindedly while thanking them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei, Natsuno-san, Akitsu-san, Fuyushima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are four beautiful women in this class who could easily be idols or actresses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the point of view of the boys in other classes, this may be an enviable environment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I think about those four, I naturally think like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I use the &#8220;candle that calls the night&#8221;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;d like it to be──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I want it to be one of these four people&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once that thought appeared, I couldn’t ignore it any longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spent the rest of the class thinking about how I was going to rape one of the four of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Class was over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood alone in front of the staff room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hands were shaking a little from nervousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not even sure if I can act properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ After much deliberation, I was able to reach a conclusion about the evil scheme I had been thinking about all through the class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who should be the first target out of the four?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And what would be the means to achieve this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a lot of trouble and considered many times the possibility of realising it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as a result, here I am.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The staff room where the teachers would be working.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s in there too, doing her work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, the one I decided to give my virginity to──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me. &#8230;&#8230; Um, Harumachi-sensei, can we talk?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? Oh, what&#8217;s up, Saino? This is unusual.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei immediately replies to my voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks a little surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not very often that I come to the staff room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I don&#8217;t have bad grades and I&#8217;ve always been able to take care of myself as much as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My parents were too irresponsible and caused a lot of trouble for other people, so maybe I looked back on that as my role model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the second time I&#8217;ve come to the staff room on my own business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s desk, made as apologetic a face as possible and opened my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, Sensei. This is a little hard to say, but &#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..I have a very bad feeling when Saino makes a face like that&#8230;..Well, say it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a slight frown on her beautiful face, Harumachi Sensei urges the conversation onwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, my acting is working reasonably well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn&#8217;t seem to doubt my words, partly because of my good conduct on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bowed deeply in front of her with a vigour that can even fool me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, I&#8217;m sorry!　My stupid parents finally did it &#8230;&#8230;! I may not be able to pay next year&#8217;s tuition fees&#8230;.!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaa?! Oi,oi,oi&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m sure Saino&#8217;s parents are adventurers, right?　What on earth have they done &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They used all our&#8230;&#8230; savings to buy the latest equipment for underwater exploration&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously&#8230;..!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei looks stunned at my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t seem to realise that I&#8217;m making things up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she really believes my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I scream inwardly with pleasure at this state of affairs, my voice trembling as I plead with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, please persuade my stupid parents to stop!　They won&#8217;t listen to me, but they might listen to you, Sensei! I&#8217;m sure you can cancel the order now&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The performance was so convincing that I was surprised at myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears come naturally and I really feel like I am in need of help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like a first-class actor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I had no talent as an actor this morning when my friend detected something unusual, but apparently I can give a good performance if I really try.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;and my best performance seems to have successfully fooled Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see,&#8230;.. all right!　I&#8217;ll get ready right away, so wait for me. Vice principal, I&#8217;m going out early today. Is that alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei asks the vice principal while hurriedly starting to get ready.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that my act was effective on Harumachi-sensei and the vice principal nodded broadly, saying, [of course.]</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Okay&#8230;&#8230; now&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just had to keep an apologetic face and waited for Harumachi-sensei to get ready, while inwardly striking a gut-punch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, come in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to disturb you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was about a ten-minute walk from school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I arrived at my house, opened the door and went inside with Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was not the slightest sign of suspicion on the teacher&#8217;s part.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She politely puts her shoes together and doesn&#8217;t seem to be aware of what I&#8217;m up to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, where are your parents? Show me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably in the living room. This way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooouuu..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nod to Harumachi-sensei and step into the living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The &#8220;candle that calls the night&#8221; is upstairs in my room, but it would be too suspicious to bring her there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have no choice but to do the deed in the living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the door leading into the living room, then deliberately raised my voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?　I’m sorry, Sensei. I don&#8217;t think my father and mother have returned yet. They will probably be back soon, so could you please wait a moment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mu&#8230;&#8230; I see. Well, it&#8217;s an emergency and I&#8217;ll wait as long as you want.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. Then, please sit here. I&#8217;ll bring you some tea and snacks in a minute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After giving an excuse to Sensei, I promptly exit my living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The destination is, of course, my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly picked up the &#8220;candle that calls the night&#8221;, took a deep breath and went back into the living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Saino, what&#8217;s that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, this is an aromatic candle. My mother collects them as a hobby, but I never get a chance to use them, so I thought I&#8217;d give them a go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..?  Well, I don&#8217;t mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei said with a slightly strange expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This excuse was perhaps a bit pathetic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she didn&#8217;t seem to have any reason to refuse and allowed me to use the candles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lit the &#8220;candle that calls the night&#8221; in front of Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s eyes, feeling a tingling sensation in my brain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I put it on a plate so that it wouldn&#8217;t fall over and put it on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei and I look at the somewhat flickering flame.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The colour of the flame is a very ordinary red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the next moment, my heart skipped a beat.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A very strange sensation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A very sad feeling, as if my heart is constricted, overflows from within my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I looked at Harumachi-sensei sitting across the table, that emotion invaded my head like an explosion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t leave such a beautiful person alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want her to be mine, right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My thoughts are filled with such desires, and my breathing becomes severely disturbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it seems that the other side is the same, Harumachi-sensei dyed her cheeks and looked at me with an excited face.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is the effect of the &#8220;candle that calls the night&#8221; &#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a frightening kind of mental domination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Saino &#8230;&#8230;, uh, you know, that &#8230;&#8230;, can I go over there for a little bit &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei stands up from her seat without even waiting for my reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her gaze is moist and I can see what she is thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere is that of a cat in heat, or perhaps a beast of prey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, she seems to be thinking only of having sex with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Harumachi-sensei&#8230;&#8230;! Khh&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to muster up the strength to continue sitting in the chair while I felt the overflowing love for Harumachi-sensei running rampant in my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would definitely make it easier to negotiate with Harumachi-sensei in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if we were to establish a relationship, I would like to have the construction that 『Harumachi-sensei was the one who approached me』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That would definitely make it easier to negotiate with Harumachi-sensei in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I held back, Harumachi-sensei grabbed my shoulders tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-hey, Saino, is there anything that&#8217;s bothering you? At Saino&#8217;s age, I mean, don&#8217;t you get lonely and all that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you say&#8230;.lonely&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;m a teacher, you know&#8230;..! Well, if the students are lonely, that&#8217;s&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s face is slowly approaching while continuing the conversation with rough breathing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her cheeks are red and she has a completely fuming face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart beats fast at the thought that my homeroom teacher, whom I always see at school, has this look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The distance between the two of us is approaching zero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino &#8230;&#8230; n-chu, n-chu, n-ha, n-chu &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei passionately munching on my lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soft.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lips of the teacher are pliable and elastic, and she pecked at my lips again and again as if she was devouring them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled away from her with my last ounce of energy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, no, please stop&#8230;! I&#8217;m your student&#8230;.!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh &#8230;&#8230;! No, no, Saino, you don&#8217;t have to think about anything! Leave everything to me. Chuu&#8230; nchyuu-chuuuu&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Against my resistance, Harumachi-sensei kisses me again with a face that has forgotten reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both her words and her actions are completely like a sexually harassing teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..This would have been enough to complete the construction of 『Harumachi-sensei approached me』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There seems to be no need for patience anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, too, don&#8217;t seem to need to hold back anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I threw any reasoning left on my sanity and put my hands on her breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has rather large breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnn&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei lets out a sharp exhale while continuing to kiss me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there is still no sign of rejection of my hand, and she looks like she&#8217;s feeling good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaah, nnnn, Saino&#8230;..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our lips part and Harumachi-sensei removes her jersey she is wearing with a frustrated hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her skin is being exposed more and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her underwear is a colourless beige, but it also gives a sense of life and a kind of eroticism.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her breasts are still voluptuous and her buttocks are also large.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t tell from the top of her jersey, but her thighs are plump and show maturity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, her waist was also well-defined, so there was no impression that she was fat at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had the body of a gravure idol, full of sex appeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei then, without hesitation, puts her hand behind her back and unhooks her bra.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then pulled the shoulder straps from her arms, exposing her breasts to the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A light brown nipple appears, much like the colour of her underwear.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily stared at them and gulped and swallowed my spit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t have time to notice my gaze and continues to put her hand on her shorts as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with great vigour, the teacher&#8217;s crotch was exposed.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘ Uwaa&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was severely disturbed by the sight before my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s secret place was hairless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was slightly shiny and probably shaved every day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a little irritated, perhaps she waxes quite often.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This made it clear to me that she was no innocent teacher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino&#8230;! oh &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was shocked but Harumachi-sensei, now completely naked, came at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hand went to my lower body, and without hesitation opened my zipper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.!! Fufufu, Saino is also a man after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment my zipper is lowered, the gap reveals a hard meat rod wrapped in boots.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s eyes turned scary and ferocious at seeing it, and her breathing became even more laboured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like a zebra being attacked by a lion, but I make my meat pole even harder to welcome it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m in heat as much as she is in heat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t wait for Harumachi-sensei to eat me out sexually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei&#8230;..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, wait for me, Saino&#8230;..! I&#8217;ll take you to heaven right now&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei straddles my thighs as I sit there, mouthing lines like those from an erotic novel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she intends to do it in a face-to-face sitting position.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;!!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a watery feeling on my thighs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently her love juice spilled from her crotch and has soaked my legs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little worried, but it seems no foreplay is needed at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, haa&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teacher grabs my dick and places it against her own secret place with a face that throws off her ability to think.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A slippery sensation strikes the tip, and the tip is enveloped in a slight warm feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnngh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Zubuzubu&#8230;&#8230;!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s buttocks against my thighs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was enveloped by the warm, entwining feeling of all my flesh, and my face involuntarily fell back at how good it felt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah, haa&#8230;.. Sain—oh &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While still deeply connected, I looked at Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then naturally our faces came closer and our lips touched each other again.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aaaa&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling my heart burning with love, I responded to Sensei&#8217;s kiss enthusiastically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei and I continued to put our lips on each other again and again, and finally our faces were separated and we looked at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, hmmm, hah&#8230;&#8230;Saino&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling of warm, enveloping soft flesh on my dick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then the feel of warmth of Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s skin all over my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was happy and had a tremendous sense of fulfilment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But with the effect of the &#8220;candle that calls the night&#8221;, my desires grew endlessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to discharge all of my lust into this pleasurable hole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such male instincts prevented me from controlling myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The male instinct “Sensei, that &#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I know &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll make you feel so good &#8230;&#8230; nn, haa&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to my urging, Harumachi-sensei nods and starts rocking her hips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her vagina squeezed my penis and that generated a pleasurable sensation.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gritted my teeth uncontrollably at the pleasure I had never experienced before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nngh, ah, nngh&#8230;&#8230; Saino, if you feel like cumming, you can cum anytime you want&#8230;..nngh, ah, ah &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei looks at me as I endure the pleasure and speaks such attractive words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hips are just going only up and down, but also wiggle in many different directions, expertly pleasuring my penis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, she seemed to be experiencing a wave of pleasure. I could tell by her expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, nn, hah, &#8230;&#8230;! Ah, nn, hah, Saino oh&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuu&#8230;..sensei&#8230;.it feels so good,&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too, I also feel good, Saino&#8230;..!　Saino&#8217;s so hard and muscular&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Forgetting our teacher-student relationship, we devour each other&#8217;s  carnal pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei, who normally doesn&#8217;t show feminine parts, is only woman with incredible sex appeal  at this moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnghhhh, ahhh, nnghhhh&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She grinds her hips against mine, causing her to arch her back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she likes to be penetrated at the deepest point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thrust my hips out a little myself and attacked the Sensei&#8217;s uterus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Saino, good&#8230;&#8230;! Ahh &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stroked her hair with both hands and she raised a sexy and charming voice.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hug such a teacher and kiss her neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then sucked her skin as hard as I could while rocking my hips and repeatedly thrusting the innermost part of the body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnn&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei let out a short exhale and contracted her vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I parted my lips to check where I had sucked, there was a solid red internal bleeding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are my woman&#8230; Sensei&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, hmmm, hah, stupid&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that she&#8217;s been marked makes her gasp, choke and taunt me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there is no rejection in her voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, when I looked at her expression, the corners of her eyes were downcast with happiness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a happy smile, as if she had been proposed to by her lover.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn-Ah, ah, nn&#8230;&#8230;Saino&#8230;..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thrusts lovingly from below and Sensei moves her hips in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of love juices splashing and the sound of bodies colliding with each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei grips my shoulders with both hands and bounces her body enthusiastically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such movement made my penis rise higher and stronger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, I&#8217;m already &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, nn, you don&#8217;t have to hold back&#8230;&#8230;! It&#8217;s okay, let it out all the way inside me, mmm, ah&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s my first time and I&#8217;m close to my limit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when I tell her this, Harumachi-sensei does not look the least bit disgusted and allows me to ejaculate inside her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She even wiggles her body fast to encourage me to ejaculate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, nn, hah, nn, ah, ah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei raises the tone of her voice while moving up and down as hard as she can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her breasts bounced in front of my eyes, loudly asserting their softness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her long shaggy hair was also shaking violently as she moved up and down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was enjoying the sight of Sensei&#8217;s disordered figure with my eyes, and ran up to the limit without resisting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh, I&#8217;m cumming &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too, I&#8217;m going to get out&#8230;&#8230;!Saino, come with me, come with me&#8230;&#8230;!　Oooo! Unh, ah, ah, aaaah&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Towards the last moment, both of us are absorbed in pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither Harumachi-sensei nor I can think about anything else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it was, the limit was rapidly approaching, and the moment finally arrived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, ah, it&#8217;s coming out!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Nngh, ah, ah, ah, I&#8217;m cumming, ah ah ah ah ah!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Doku! Doku! Doku! Doku!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pleasure is so great that my mind goes blank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the squeaking vagina, my penis spurts semen from the tip with great force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei holds me and shudders every time the semen hits the innermost part of her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ejaculation lasts a surprisingly long time, all of it pouring into her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah, ah, ah, ugh, Saino oh, nnmm&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the release of semen has reached its conclusion, Sensei slowly releases her body and gazes at me.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her moist eyes and flushed cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression was full of happiness and love.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I deflate and bury my face in the cleavage of her ample breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei gently stroked my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m so happy to be surrounded by such warmth and comfort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, I &#8230;&#8230; am glad that you were my first.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufu&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m also happy that I got Saino&#8217;s virginity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both share our thoughts in an enraptured voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after we have released our desires, our love for each other still remains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 『candle that calls the night』 was supposed to be a one-time item, but apparently that 『one time』 does not mean the number of acts, it mean that it can only be lit once.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What happens if I put out the flame in the middle of the act&#8230;I’m a bit curious.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m not at all ready to try that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to enjoy my hot moments with Harumachi-sensei longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, in that sense, it would certainly be impossible to use the 『candle that calls the night』 twice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we make out for a minute or so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our love soon revived, together with the impulses for each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Saino&#8230;..do it again&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230;.. Um, can I do it from behind&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. I will do a lot of things the way Saino wants. I want us to feel better together&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei and I exchange words and finally separate our bodies for the next act.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And this time, on the floor, we started having sex in the doggy position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, Saino, that feels good&#8230;&#8230;! Nn, hah, aaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei raises a lovely, charming voice at my use of her hips.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7.png"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it was, Sensei and I continued to have intercourse without getting tired of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahhhh-ahhhhhh,ahhh!I&#8217;m coming&#8230;!Ahhnnnnnn!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Khhhhhhhuu&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Doku! Doku! Doku! Doku!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The carnal pole reaches its limit and spurts out semen again at the deepest part of Harumachi-sensei, who lies on her back and opens her legs.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is my fifth ejaculation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It still feels great and an incredible euphoric feeling comes over me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About an hour after we started using the 『candle that calls the night』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei and I continued to have sex without a break, and we both continued to enjoy the pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The instructions said that 『when this candle is used, men and women in the room will desire each other strongly and have intercourse』 and it seems that the effect lasts as long as the flame is lit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the past hour, all Sensei and I could think about was having sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; However, it seems that this is about to come to an end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced over at the table and saw that the candle wick was just about gone and the fire was almost extinguished.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few seconds, the flame finally lost its glow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei looks dazed, as if she has just woken up from sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hands hastily cover her body and her eyes on me suddenly lose their heat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sa, Saito, this is &#8230;..I&#8217;m&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei is distraught and moves her mouth to say something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must feel that she has to make some excuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had mixed feelings about Sensei’s reaction and said to her the lines I had thought of beforehand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, let&#8217;s keep this a secret between the two of us. If this gets out to the students, you won&#8217;t be able to be a teacher again…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu&#8230;! Y-Yeah, you&#8217;re right&#8230;&#8230;t-that would be a big help if you did that&#8230;uuu…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei nodded with a regretful look on her face at my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have finally realised the magnitude of the mistake she had made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s a bit hurtful, to be honest, to be given this kind of look&#8230;.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My chest hurts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The effect of the candle has worn off, so my lust for Sensei is already gone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, it was quite a shock to see the expression of regret on the face of the person I made love to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, you should go for today. I&#8217;ll try to persuade my parents somehow&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei nodded weakly at my words and stood up to start cleaning herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Semen dripped from her secret place onto her thighs but it quickly wiped away with a tissue.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I wonder if my lvl has gone up properly&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt terribly tired and thought about it absentmindedly.</span></p>
