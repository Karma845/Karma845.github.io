<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; The Bell and the Spring</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right, Lv7&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the entrance to the dungeon in the basement of my house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There I checked the number on my palm and struck a gut-punch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was 5 when I saw it before but it had gone up two solid digits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Love can be properly raised by hand jobs and blow jobs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doing it with Fuyushima-san in the classroom after school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was triggered by the [Craving Extract] and made me ejaculate twice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first time with her hand, the second time with her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to check it as soon as possible, so I went home immediately in this way and it seems that such acts are still recognised as 『sexual intercourse』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does this mean that ejaculating using the body of the opposite sex is acceptable?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or was it possible that I had semen inside her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reasons for this are not clear and may need to be tested in the future.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, it&#8217;s good that it went up anyway. This should give me more options to take in the future.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I don&#8217;t necessarily need penetration, it makes it a bit less of a struggle to get to the next level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I won&#8217;t able to have sex every day and handjobs and blowjobs are easier in many ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would also be slightly easier to persuade the girls, although slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to continue to be proactive in my off-the-books activities and focus back into the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just came here with the intention of just checking the lvl for now, so I&#8217;m not well equipped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s gather my gears and start the exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I go to my room and change into my usual safari jacket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve collected all the tools I need, including the knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m getting used to wearing this equipment a lot.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the knife can be taken out quite smoothly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first floor has also been conquered and I may have left the beginner&#8217;s level as an explorer.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.. Now let&#8217;s go’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, I go to the kitchen and have a glass of water before making up my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today I’m heading for the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a new area I&#8217;ve never explored before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I know the details of the enemy from reading that journal but there will still be dangers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a little anxious but very excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am, after all, the son of an adventurer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just as I clenched my fists in the heat of the moment…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…… PinPon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My doorbell rang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was jolted back to reality by it and twisted my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who on earth had come to visit me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t remember buying anything in particular by mail order, nor do I remember making any promises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no idea about the visitors at all.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Did Dad and Mum send me some weird stuff again&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most likely to happen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My parents often send things home from their excavations at overseas sites.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are not intended to be kept separately, but they are all souvenirs for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of them are junk, but sometimes there are things of considerable value mixed in, so I can never be too careful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a good chance that they had been sent to me this time, too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.I’m coming!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouted loudly towards the front door and left the kitchen.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was fully prepared for an exploration but it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered if the courier would see me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up my seal and opened the front door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Eeeh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A stunned voice unexpectedly escapes my mouth when I see a person standing there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wearing a familiar red jersey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Messy hair.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A model-like face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person who came to visit me, it&#8230;&#8230;was none other than Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha,hello, Saito….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Se,Sensei?!!&#8230;.Why are you here?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Sorry, I&#8217;ll explain, just let me in. If anyone sees us &#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s not good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she said this, Harumachi Sensei forcefully opened the door and came inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was bewildered, but I couldn&#8217;t stop Sensei from doing so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I certainly don&#8217;t think it would be good for anyone else to see this scene.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If strange rumours started, it would make my life at school very difficult.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what exactly does this mean?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is Sensei, who was afraid to get close to me, coming to visit me at home?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, I finally understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei, who had been in a state of distress ever since she had a relationship with me, thought she had to do something about it, so she gathered up her courage and came here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she thought that if she didn&#8217;t get it right, her suffering would continue forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or perhaps she wanted to apologise to me.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for me, I don&#8217;t need an apology at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at that time, Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s eyebrows were slightly furrowed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so&#8230;&#8230; Saito, what&#8217;s with that outfit?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh!? Oh, uh, uh, this is &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I began to stutter involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had almost forgotten about the shock from Sensei’s visit that I forgot that I’m fully dressed in exploration gear. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not loungewear by any stretch of the imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei looks at me with suspicious eyes as I panic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is completely suspicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finally came up with an excuse and immediately spoke it up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, um, my parents are taking me on an adventure next time, so this is a rehearsal for that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I see. Well, preparation is important.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei nodded in agreement and stopped pursuing the matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she looks at me seems a little worried, but is this a concern for my safety as I head off on my adventure?</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, I&#8217;m a little happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The relationship with Harumachi-sensei has been strained for the past few days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But from the look in her eyes, it seems that she never thinks badly of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, well, come this way. The living room&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, no, &#8230;..can we move to another place? That&#8230;. that one&#8217;s a bit, you know&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei stops me as I try to show her the living room and gives me an awkward look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, the living room is where Sensei and I made love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a bit scary for her to go to the same place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I understand. Then is my room okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sa, Saito&#8217;s room&#8230;..Umm, umu, no choice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei reluctantly nodded at my suggestion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably didn&#8217;t really want to be alone with me in such a place but she decided it was better than the living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guide Sensei and lead her up the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My room is on the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not that big, but it should be enough for the two of us to talk.</span></p><<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Now, what should I do? &#8230;&#8230;We&#8217;re alone but it might not be a good idea to use the rest of the [Craving Extract].’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I arrive at my room with these thoughts in mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Craving Extract] has one dose left, but I’m not sure if I  should use it here or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike Fuyushima-san, Harumachi-sensei has already experienced the effects of an item once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, I used that powerful [Night-Calling Candle].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the conversation turns unnaturally erotic this time, I may indeed have put Sensei’s suspicions on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, Sensei seems to have come to have a serious talk, and it would be too strange to give her a spermicidal drink.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; nn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was ruminating  about it, I opened the door and invited Sensei inside.</span></p>
<<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei looks a little nervous but she sits on a cushion on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei scurries around, moving her gaze and observing my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel a little embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think my room is that dirty, but I wonder how it looks from a woman&#8217;s point of view.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that there will be a fair amount of times in the future that I will have girls over here, so maybe I should make it a bit more fashionable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I bring you a cup of tea?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; No, thanks. But I&#8217;d like you to sit down, too, Saito.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following her instructions, I sat down opposite Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei then straightened her back and coughed a single [kohon].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino, about the other day&#8230;&#8230;first of all, let me apologise. I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei bows her head deeply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she is truly sorry from the bottom of her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that sex was forced on me by the power of the item, and to be honest, I don&#8217;t feel comfortable if she apologise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, it is me who must apologise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, I&#8217;m sorry too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; why is Saino apologising for? I’m the one who should be the one apologising&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s just that &#8230;&#8230; I was willing to hold Sensei at the time&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s&#8230;..well, that&#8217;s&#8230;..right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei blushes and scratches her cheeks, perhaps remembering our intimate session.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We certainly made love back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m also the same, just thinking back on it makes my heart pound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as she doesn&#8217;t know about the [Night-Calling Candle], she will never realise that it was a fake emotion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ko, kohum! So, um, &#8230;&#8230; about the future&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei, perhaps coming to her senses, deliberately clears her throat before continuing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is probably where Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s talk begins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I&#8217;m a teacher and Saino is a student, right?　So, after all, we have to make sure that things like that don&#8217;t happen in the future.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8230;&#8230;may be true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I want to be clear about where the line is. Specifically, I don&#8217;t want to meet you alone, for example. You never know when I might go crazy again and attack Saino&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s tone of voice as if she is afraid of something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must know that the emotional outburst at that time was something she could not control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even coming here today must have been quite terrifying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she didn&#8217;t call me out or something because she wanted to apologise to me in person, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though he acts like a yankee, Harumachi-sensei seems to be a respectable human being who is a teacher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. Let&#8217;s do that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nod and agree to the teacher&#8217;s proposal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, even I had my own thoughts about the Sensei&#8217;s painful appearance over the past few days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was quite distressing to see a woman make such a face because of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I have a difficult personality, 『I force them to do erotic things, but I don&#8217;t want them to be unhappy or suffer』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;m being kind or a brute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good. &#8230;&#8230; Then I&#8217;m leaving now. Thank you for today, Saino. See you at school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. I thank you too, for talking to me properly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bow my head, feeling a little sad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I may no longer have close contact with Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am aware that she is a teacher, and if I get too close, she will surely get hurt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I use the [Fate Intertwined Umbrella], she will suffer a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without a very useful item, it is impossible to do something erotic without causing Sensei pain.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘hah &#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exhaling a sigh in my heart, I watched Sensei walk out of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doing sex with Harumachi-sensei was great and our physical chemistry was pretty good too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that would be in the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can only cherish the memories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei leaves my room as it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she disappears from sight and instead I hear her footsteps going down the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should probably see her off, but I can&#8217;t muster the energy to do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps the sound of the front door opening will soon follow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Well, let&#8217;s dive into the dungeon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stand up, feeling weak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a pity that I can&#8217;t do erotic things with  Harumachi-sensei, but I can find new items to enjoy with someone else to make up for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If all I want to do is raise Love, I can do it with anyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stretch, take a deep breath, change my mood and do a few light warm-up exercises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when the blood was flowing, I finally left my room and went down the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then I suddenly noticed something strange.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Huh?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a slight feeling of discomfort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, did I hear Harumachi-sensei open the front door?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s been some time since she left my room and she should have left my house long ago. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a somewhat bad premonition, I headed for the basement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Saino,&#8230;&#8230; what the hell is this&#8230;..!??”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;shiー”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The entrance to the stone labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Harumachi-sensei, who should have left, was standing there with a puzzled expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. explain. What is that?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the living room of my house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, I was being interrogated by Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s eyes are serious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she is somewhat aware that I am exploring that underground labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that being seen fully equipped was quite fatal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought she had left, but for some reason Sensei was at the entrance to the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When asked why, she said she thought she heard a voice calling her and before she knew it, she was walking towards it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dungeon has air flowing towards the back, so perhaps the voice was just a strange echo from the draft in the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, given the mysteriousness of the dungeon, it&#8217;s not impossible that someone really was calling for Sensei. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..Anyway, I tried to cover it up somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there is no easy way to do such a thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So now, I&#8217;m being questioned in a strong tone of voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don&#8217;t know how to explain&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rack my brains to think of excuses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I can&#8217;t think of a good way to deceive Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can no longer hide the existence of the labyrinth and it seems I have no choice but to explain it honestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made up my mind and slowly opened my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As for that labyrinth, I don&#8217;t know why it was built in my basement either. I don&#8217;t even know when it changed the basement to that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s a hard story to believe.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was shocked at first, too. But then I got &#8230;&#8230; a bit excited.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you&#8217;ve been exploring there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I explain to Sensei, while keeping the existence of the journal under wraps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that this has happened,I have no choice but to divulge about the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the existence of the item must be kept secret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why the journal with its details should be kept hidden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei puts her hand on her chin and ponders a little as I explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a while, she looked up and asked me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s at the end of that passage?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it&#8217;s like a labyrinth. The structure is sturdy and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any danger of it collapsing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. &#8230;&#8230; Hmm. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei is thinking again after hearing my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The face of a woman lost in thought is also picturesque, but now is not the time to be gawking at it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I waited patiently for Sensei&#8217;s next words, anxious for further pursuit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, about a minute later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei, who continued to think silently, nodded her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, Saino. Let me accompany you on your exploration.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If Saino is doing something dangerous, I can&#8217;t leave you alone because I&#8217;m a teacher. I want to see for myself what it&#8217;s like to explore.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking into Sensei&#8217;s eyes, which are burning with a sense of mission, I can&#8217;t help but say nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conclusion Harumachi-sensei draws is a perfectly reasonable one for a teacher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is the teacher&#8217;s duty to protect the safety of the students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for me, it&#8217;s very troubling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dungeon is inhabited by monsters and there is a high possibility that Harumachi-sensei will judge the search as dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In some cases, she might ban me from exploring, or worse, she might report the existence of the labyrinth to the police or something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that happens, it&#8217;s all over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…..I won&#8217;t take no for an answer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei glares at me with a strong gaze as I scowl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could only nod feebly, yes, in light despair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then prepared equipment for Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mother&#8217;s usual safari jacket and a number of suitable tools.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed to be a little tight around the chest area but the size was almost perfect and just right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei dressed quickly, put her backpack on and immediately pulled me towards the entrance to the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. Let&#8217;s go, Saino.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei re-tightens her shoelaces and urges me to start my exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded at her emphatically and turned my feet into the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart is already filled with despair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had even one encounter with a monster, Sensei would immediately judge this place to be dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And from my experience so far, that time will surely come if I continue exploring for 30 minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like a dead end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.follow my lead.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, I walk down the stone corridor, ahead of Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t put her in danger and I&#8217;m by far the most knowledgeable about how to conduct an exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be better for me to go ahead and secure the area so that Sensei can walk safely afterwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei and I go down the stairs and enter the first floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed something unusual and stopped in my tracks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the time I was descending the stairs, I had felt that the wind was somehow different from usual and apparently the feeling was right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scene at the entrance to the first floor, spread out before my eyes, was a little different from what I had seen before.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘There&#8217;s a straight road &#8230;&#8230;!?’</span></i></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I entered the first floor, it should have a junction, with the road just splitting off to the left and right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, looking at it now, it is no longer a junction but a crossroads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The change in wind intensity appears to have been due to this structural change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong, Saino?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, no…..it&#8217;s nothing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly racked my brains as I responded appropriately to Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And soon I had an idea as to the cause of this change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps this straight road is a direct passage to the entrance of the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stairs to the second floor is in the middle of the first floor, which is four hundred metres square.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, it&#8217;s 200 metres straight ahead from the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The corridor in front of me seems to go on for a long time, so this guess is probably correct.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the reason for this is&#8230;&#8230;perhaps related to the fact that I finished taking all the items from the first floor?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is true that once I have obtained all the items, I have no use for the first floor and it is nice to have a direct passage to the next floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alternatively, it could be because I have defeated all kinds of enemies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fighting in the labyrinth basically has no benefit and it wouldn&#8217;t be a bad idea to have a bonus, such as a shortcut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Either way, this labyrinth is quite clever.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.. Okay. If this is how it&#8217;s going to be, I&#8217;m going to have to go for it &#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Determined, I stepped into the newly emerged path.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had half given up but when I saw this direct passage, I decided to go for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The longer we stay in the labyrinth, the more likely we are to encounter monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, using this passageway, I could enter the second floor in the shortest possible distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Find an item quickly on the second floor and use it instantly on Harumachi-sensei&#8230;&#8230;! If the item is capable of mental domination or memory alteration, I might be able to successfully mislead sensei&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I clenched my fists in determination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a horribly gamble, but it&#8217;s the only thing I have left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I need the power of the item to break out of this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;over here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei follows me briskly down the direct corridor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no sign of suspicion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She never went on an exploration, so she probably thinks it&#8217;s best to follow my lead.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The enemies in the second floor are the [Electric Sheep], [Mandragora], [Laughing Pumpkin] and [Thorny Bug]&#8230;four types of eneimes&#8230;&#8230;.I remember all their characteristics. Don&#8217;t worry, it’s going to be okay&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recall the contents of the diary in my mind as I walk and formulate a plan on how to deal with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The monsters in the second floor have levels between 5 and 10.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My lvl 7, so I should be able to withstand any fights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it was, Sensei and I reached the descending staircase leading to the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gulped and swallowed my spit and went down the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei also followed silently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Going down the stairs was long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Similar to the stairs on the first floor, this stairs must have about fifty steps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually the stairs end and a flat floor comes into view.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘!!! This is the second floor&#8230;&#8230;!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere was slightly different from the landscape of the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The colour of the walls and floors is different, perhaps because of the different types of stone used.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first floor is grey, whereas the second floor is green.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, everything else is quite similar to the first floor. The structure and the width of the corridors are exactly the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stability of the scaffolding is the same and the ease of fighting will be the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Torches are also on the walls at regular intervals and there seems to be no shortage of weapons in case of emergency.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; this way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a little hesitation about how to proceed, I start walking along the right-hand wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I’m unsure where to go, it is better to use the right-hand method.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was able to find items quickly this way on the first floor and I&#8217;d like to jinx that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a lot of strange things&#8230;&#8230;.and what’s with these torches too&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know either. Common sense doesn&#8217;t seem to apply here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.Somehow, though, I think I might understand a bit of the urge to be adventurous.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei says so and taps the wall with a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kon-kon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei must have felt a little of the fun in exploring uncharted territory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Sensei has the qualities of an adventurer, too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We continue to walk cautiously down the passageway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily, we don&#8217;t encounter many monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A reasonable amount of time has passed since we entered the second floor, but the labyrinth remains quiet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, about 15 minutes after arriving at the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned the corner for the umpteenth time and the sight I saw ahead made my heart skip a beat.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The small room &#8230;..!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About five metres beyond the turn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was what appeared to be an entrance, identical to the one seen several times in the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is certainly the small room with the treasure chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Sensei, please follow me quietly”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“??? Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Semseo follows my instructions and closes her mouth while making a curious face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then approach the entrance to the small room stealthily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, cautiously, I peered into it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;good, there’s the treasure chest and that&#8217;s the laughing pumpkin…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the room, as expected, was the treasure chest and a monster guarding it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The treasure chest looked the same as usual but near it was a giant orange pumpkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was big enough for an adult to stand inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a little hard to see from my angle but it&#8217;s hollowed out like a wicked smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It might resemble something you often see at Halloween.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at it with one eye closed and the number 10 came to mind.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Shit&#8230;&#8230;the highest level enemy at a time like this?!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inwardly venomed, I gripped the handle of the knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was good that I hadn&#8217;t encountered any monsters up to this point, but it seems I was out of luck at the last minute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, please wait here for a moment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;?? Aaa…okay. I understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei nods honestly at my words, although she doesn&#8217;t seem to understand the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei is standing behind me so she can&#8217;t see what&#8217;s in the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably doesn&#8217;t know why I have a knife in my hand.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..okay, here I go!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I readied myself and stepped into the small room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHAHAHAHAHA!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An eerie laughter greeted me as I entered the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at the giant pumpkin&#8217;s face as it fully turns towards me and its eyes are squinted in a funny way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t seem to catch me by surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHA!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuh!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The laughing pumpkin lets out a sharp squeal and sends something flying from its mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s fast.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly jump to the side and just barely avoid it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It hit the wall and fell to the floor. It was a pumpkin seed the size of a tennis ball.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is the seed attack mentioned in the diary&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I run around to the side, I recall the contents of the diary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most striking feature of the laughing pumpkin is the way it attacks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although they cannot move on their own, they send seeds flying at high speed and attack at long range.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As might be expected, it does not seem to be powerful enough to penetrate the flesh, but it is said to have enough impact to be sent flying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHAHAHA! GYAHAHAHAHA!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The giant pumpkin spins itself in front of me while laughing mockingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I run as fast as I can to escape its sights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s as if I&#8217;m running away from a rotating turret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The speed of rotation is not that fast but not fast enough where I can relax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if I keep running away, I have no chance of winning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made sure I had some room to manoeuvre and lunged at the laughing pumpkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“SEI!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHA!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I run my knife across the pumpkin, slightly to the side of its face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had a hard surface. Just like a real pumpkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The laughing pumpkin sounds surprised, but turns towards me without flinching at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I did not do much damage to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn it……”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the front of its face closes in, I run back to its side again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of the close distance, it is easier to escape the sights than before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can go around curves faster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ggh!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt something entangling and pulling at my leg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rushed to check and saw an ivy extending from under the pumpkin was holding my leg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHAHAHA!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stop moving and the face of the laughing pumpkin slowly turns and closes in on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then its mouth finally caught my torso.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHAHAHA!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a severe pain. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I barely avoided being hit in the torso because I ducked as quickly as I could but I suffered significant damage to my side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I try not to let the pain bother me, I reattack and stick the knife into the laughing pumpkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.take this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHAHA! GYAHAHA!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I repeatedly attacked the pumpkin&#8217;s face, as if in hatred.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Twice, three times, four times &#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just as I was about to attack a fifth time, another seed shot out of the pumpkin&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cessation of breathing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dull, deep pain in the torso.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clean hit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hand almost drops the knife.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I mustn’t&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My head, which had almost gone blank from the intense pain, recognises the seriousness of the situation and rings the alarm bells.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I keep taking this kind of damage, there&#8217;s no way I can attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even now, I can barely keep my grip on the knife.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I don&#8217;t think I can attack it unguarded and win!　Damn it, how strong is it&#8230;&#8230;!?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A feeling of regret spreads in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The opponent was a new kind of enemy and one that was 3 lvls higher than me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I really wanted the item, it might have been a monster I should have avoided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAA!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The laughing pumpkin, perhaps sensing that my heart is breaking, shouts louder than ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haiboku.[Defeat]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:I use the kanji word because the next line says two. The kanji is [</span><span style="font-weight: 400">敗北</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These two words came to mind and I involuntarily closed my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I did so, the pumpkin moved its mouth to attack me once more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──But the action was abruptly interrupted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYA!? GYAHA!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The giant pumpkin that shakes its body and turns its back.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘W, what’s happening&#8230;..?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was puzzled by the pumpkin&#8217;s strange behaviour, a familiar voice echoed in the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino, I’m coming to save you! Over here, you fucking pumpkin! Turn around!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Se, sensei &#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s voice, which can be heard from the other side of the pumpkin, made me involuntarily open my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I smelled something, it was the smell of something burning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Sensei is burning the back of a laughing pumpkin with a torch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..!　Oryaaa!!!”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAA!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with quick reflex and all my might, I grips my knife with both hands and thrusts it into the pumpkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The laughing pumpkin, which had been distracted by Harumachi-sensei, screamed at the unexpected attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put all my strength into it and swing the knife down once more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A full-throated blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blade dug deeply into the laughing pumpkin, and──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHA&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a slight grunt, the pumpkin&#8217;s huge body transformed into a swarm of light particles.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The particles are then quickly sucked into the floor of the labyrinth and disappear without a trace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All that was left was me, Sensei and the treasure chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei was still holding the torch and her body was shaking badly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei&#8230;.thank you for saving me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rub my still sore stomach and bow to Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I definitely could not have won on my own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I owe my current victory to Sensei for sure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she was not at all pleased, on the contrary, she came running to me with tears in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino&#8230;.! You idiot&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a soft touch and she smelled good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I belatedly realise that I am being hugged and I finally relax my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei hugged me tightly and asked in a tearful voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you doing such a dangerous thing&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Because it’s a labyrinth, is it not good?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not, you idiot&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to my answer, Harumachi-sensei angrily tightens her arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out one sigh as I embraced her hug.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems I&#8217;ve made her quite worried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s only natural, though, since I&#8217;ve shown her my struggles up to this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hand that embraces me doesn&#8217;t move away no matter how long it takes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While receiving her scolding, I was vaguely thinking weird things.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Does Sensei maybe like me&#8230;&#8230;or something?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These endless reprimands and hugs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like that&#8217;s not the kind of thing a teacher would do to just any student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s really worried about me and really cares about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what it feels like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you listening, Saino? I am angry, you know&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I&#8217;m listening tentatively.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei, perhaps realising that I was distracted, put strong pressure on her arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I responded and hugged Sensei, feeling somewhat happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei didn&#8217;t care and continued her sermon&#8230;..It was more than thirty minutes later that I was finally released.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. hmph”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a long sermon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei finally released me and turned her face away from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes and cheeks are red, probably from crying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve never seen this expression before.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; She&#8217;s so cute.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a puff of air while thinking about the sulking teacher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The battle and the sermon are now over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I can finally open the treasure chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I originally wanted to go down to the second floor to obtain these items.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I squat in front of the treasure chest and open the lid.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What treasure will be inside&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A shiny, silver-coloured, metal vessel-like object.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In shape and size, it is similar to a cup.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is rounded at the bottom and has a string attached to it, so it obviously cannot be placed on a desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is also distinctive in that its mouth is wide open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the manual that came with it and read its contents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『The [Nightmare Inducing Bell], when struck with metal and rung, can render the person closest to the user unconscious for ten minutes. The subject will have a fabricated memory that [nothing happened] and will never question the memory. The subject will also dream about the events that occurred during the unconscious state that night. Number of times it can be used: twice.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. I see, this is a bell.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found out the identity of the item and unintentionally blurted out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei gave me such a leering look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. What is that?　Is Saino exploring this place to get something like that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, er,&#8230;..Nnn-&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How should I respond?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While thinking about various things in my head, I kept uttering meaningless words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be impossible to make Sensei forget about the labyrinth with this item.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I can&#8217;t force her to keep secrets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although expected, the item did not seem to fit the situation very well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaーnnn&#8230;.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take out my knife and ring the [Nightmare Inducing Bell] with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A high metallic sound echoes in the small room and at the same time, the light disappears from  Sensei&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I don&#8217;t know if this will work, but let&#8217;s try it anyway.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A plan popped into my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no proof that it would work but with no other options, I decided to give it a go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A total gamble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, well, I can&#8217;t have everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approach the unconscious Harumachi-sensei and hug her tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you, Sensei&#8230;&#8230;! I can&#8217;t control this feeling any longer&#8230;..! I love you, Sensei&#8230;&#8230;I love you&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spun passionate words of love, putting as much emotion as possible into my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Sensei shows no reaction to this and remains lifeless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gently lay the lifeless Sensei on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I put my hand on the garment and roughly removed it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A white camisole appears from inside the safari jacket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I rolled it up, it revealed her shiny skin and a pure white bra.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bra was embroidered and looked a little expensive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps when she decided to visit my house, she put an effort into her underwear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, I love you &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I shouted, I forcefully shifted her pure white bra upwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I munched on the exposed nipple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The light brown tip I had seen a few days before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sucked it hard and squeezed the whole breast as if I was squeezing a mother&#8217;s milk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s no way I can get any milk out of it but the taste is strange because I can taste some kind of sweetness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I don&#8217;t plan just focusing on that part, I then move on to the lower half of my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Nightmare Inducing Bell] has an effect time of only ten minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, there is no time to get carried away with her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you&#8230;&#8230; I love you&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whispering my love, I removed her trousers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her  shorts are also elegant white, matching her bra.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pull her trousers completely off her legs and roughly slip the remaining piece of cloth down as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s secret place was quickly exposed, her groin and the secret cleft are all in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t stand it any longer, Sensei&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say this in a feverish voice and remove my trousers and underwear as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My meat hooks are on the warpath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that I have become quite excited by the unusual situation of raping the teacher in the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or was my reproductive instincts heightened by the deadly fight with the laughing pumpkin earlier?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Sensei remains vacant-eyed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She still does not seem to realised that she is about to be raped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I positioned Sensei by opening her legs wide and readied her body for a normal penetration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then went straight on to stick my dick into her vaginal hole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnnn…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s mouth emitted a slight exhalation as she seemed to feel the sensations, albeit unconscious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pushed my hips against her and conquered the deepest part of her body at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the best feeling I had ever had.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The warm, entwining sensation is the same as ever, although it&#8217;s not slippery due to the lack of love juices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no better hole for squeezing a meat stick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, oh &#8230;.. I always wanted to do this&#8230;&#8230;! I&#8217;ve missed you so, so much &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bury my face in Sensei&#8217;s neck while inserting myself and whisper in a deliberately shaky voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to shake my hips right away, but I hold back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the instructions, Sensei will dream about this when she sleeps tonight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to perform exactly what I want to make sure that the Sensei&#8217;s mind works exactly as I want it to at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stay in that position and slowly start to move my hips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I whispered in Sensei’s ears as if pleading with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, I like to explore this labyrinth&#8230;..!　A grown woman like you might not understand. But I think of exploring this place like it&#8217;s my reason for living. &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230; nn&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei shows no reaction and only lets out a few breaths.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body&#8217;s definitely responding to me, perhaps,it was because of the gradual supply of love juice into her vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body temperature seems to have risen and even though she is unconscious, her body seems to be becoming more and more aroused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue to whisper to Sensei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;So Sensei, please don&#8217;t take this labyrinth away from me! If my favourite teacher does that to me, I&#8230;. I can&#8217;t bear myself to hate you&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nngh, nnnn, nnhaah, nn&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouted and also intensified my extraction to show my passion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the key to getting Harumachi-sensei to keep the labyrinth a secret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I find my purpose in the labyrinth but on the other hand, I have fallen in love with Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So if Harumachi-sensei banned me from exploring the labyrinth, I wouldn&#8217;t know what to do anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is that kind of anguish that I have to gamble&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, ah, I don&#8217;t like it&#8230;..I hate it so much if you do that to me,&#8230;&#8230;! I will be in despair, I might die&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, ahhh, uu, nn, ahhh &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hug Sensei tightly and shake my hips as I continue the performance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lines are quite exaggerated but no matter how much I say, it is never enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to appeal to my agony so that Sensei changes her mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Sensei only hears this line in her dreams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will not be held accountable for the words I utter and it is worth saying it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaah&#8230;..Harumachi-sensei&#8230;..! I want to be like this with my teacher all the time&#8230;&#8230;! I don&#8217;t want to hate you, Sensei&#8230;.! I want to explore this labyrinth too&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu,nnn, aaaa,haa&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei’s tone of breath gradually becomes higher and higher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in this state, she seems to be moving firmly towards climax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think the chemistry between my body and Sensei&#8217;s body is the best after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, Sensei,Sensei..! I really love you!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnaa,aa,aann,nfuuunn,haaa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I scream out my love to her and give the last spurt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thrusts repeatedly at high speed, and Sensei&#8217;s mouth lets out a whining cry that she can&#8217;t afford to hold back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of us are close to our limits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her vagina is no longer overflowing with love juice and there is a guttural sound with each piston.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put strength into my hand holding Sensei and pushed forward with all my might towards the last moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to let it out&#8230;&#8230;! I&#8217;m going to put all my love for you inside you, Sensei&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I declare that I&#8217;m going to cum inside and I push my dick in and out in small increments.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, it is not out of love but filthy lust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s terribly selfish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I keep up the act of being out of control with love and rapidly prepare for ejaculation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The heat between us continued to build, and then&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Sensei, I love you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmmm!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Doku! Doku! Doku! Doku!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pleasure was so great that my eyes were about to go blank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My dick releases semen from its tip and slams into the Sensei&#8217;s innermost part.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, the climaxing vagina squeezes my dick to receive the semen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to grind my hips and release and at the same time, I whispered to tSensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, I love you, I love you&#8230;..If the teacher forbids me to explore&#8230;&#8230; I will die&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230; nn&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei leaks an empty voice while receiving semen in her womb.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to whisper to her and poured all of my desire into her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Huh? Um&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Well, Sensei, let&#8217;s get out of this labyrinth.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, ah &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;yeah, that&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exactly ten minutes after ringing the [Nightmare Inducing Bell].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Harumachi-sensei regained consciousness, I suggested leaving the labyrinth in a natural tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei looked dumbfounded for a moment but immediately nodded in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s clothes were completely restored.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn&#8217;t seem to feel particularly uncomfortable because I had fixed it before the effect time ran out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, her  bra would be a little off and her vagina would still be wet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the [Nightmare Inducing Bell], as the instructions say, left Sensei in no doubt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Follow me, please, but be as quiet as possible in case the monsters come out again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei follows my instructions and follows behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turn back through the labyrinth, inwardly relieved at her lack of questioning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, there is no sign of any enemies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the enemies on the second floor have something in common, their movements are slow and heavy, so the path we once took was relatively safe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We escaped from the second floor and went to the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, we walked down a direct passageway and towards the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without realising the time, it was already nine o&#8217;clock in the evening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My body was very tired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. Saino, don&#8217;t come in here again. Promise me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the basement door, Harumachi-sensei makes a strong demand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at her, she had very serious eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are the eyes of someone who is seriously worried about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I return the question, feigning disappointment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure you can&#8217;t let me go….?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, It’s a no.It&#8217;s obvious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei responds immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her reaction is natural, since she had just seen a deadly fight with a laughing pumpkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t look Sensei in the eye and just gave her a small nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..I promise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teacher reminds me once more that I look depressed and starts to walk up the stairs leading to the ground floor of my house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I comply, inwardly sticking my tongue out, but continuing to act dejected.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I wonder what her attitude will be like tomorrow&#8230;..I hope she&#8217;ll sympathise with me and allow me to explore, as I&#8217;m hoping she will&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think about this while looking at the Sensei&#8217;s buttocks swaying in front of my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei will dream about the sex we just had, tonight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder how much my enthusiastic performance will move Sensei&#8217;s heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..How exciting and anxious I feel, as if I&#8217;m waiting for a reply to my confession.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, I did the best I can…..’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh and thought idly about how good I felt about the sex earlier.</span></p>
