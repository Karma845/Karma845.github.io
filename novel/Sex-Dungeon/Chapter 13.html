<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; Dungeon Dating, Winter</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Let&#8217;s go to the living room for now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the entrance to the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spoke to Fuyushima-san, who gazed at me quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How did she get into the house? When did she know where I live in the first place?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are so many questions, but it&#8217;s impossible to talk calmly in a place like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think we should sit down and talk about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san nods and walks towards me, as if she had no objections.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, she is terrifyingly expressionless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I led her towards the living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we arrived, I pulled out one of the chairs from the dining table and made her sit there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to ask you a question, why are you at my house?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was called&#8230;&#8230; and before I knew it, I was here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I ask her while taking a seat opposite her, Fuyushima-san answers without changing her expression.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, it’s the 『call』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s to be expected, I would say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, that does not explain the locked door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue to question her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought I locked the front door and the basement&#8230;&#8230; How did you get in? Was it open by any chance?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, they were open.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, this is to be expected.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the dungeon has the ability to 『unlock』 in addition to 『call』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the dungeon itself is supernatural, so it&#8217;s not at all surprising that it can do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I half-understood but it seems that there was nothing wrong with Fuyushima-san after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh and looked up at the ceiling then changed my mind and looked at Fuyushima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, I was able to grasp how Fuyushima-san discovered the dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next it&#8217;s time to reveal information about the dungeon and negotiate for it to be kept secret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The difficulty level is not so high.</span></p<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She thinks I&#8217;m the 『Destined Person』and all I have to do is order her keep quiet after I&#8217;ve said a few words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I simulated the conversation in my head for a bit, then smiled and opened my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you were surprised to see that thing in the basement, weren&#8217;t you? That was…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My smile unintentionally hardened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What did Fuyushima-san just say?</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I know&#8230;&#8230;?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was unable to say anything, Fuyushima-san took something out of her uniform pocket and showed it to me.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a grey, thin diary.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;.Uwaa, seriously?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately realised what diary was and involuntarily looked up to the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Dungeon has thoroughly revealed its secret to Fuyushima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did it steal from my room or did it prepare another identical diary?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know which, but that thing in Fuyushima-san&#8217;s possession was&#8230;&#8230;clearly that 『diary』 that I have picked up before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Worst of all, it seems that Fuyushima-san has already found out about the dungeon&#8217;s 『intercourse frequency is Lv』 rule.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, she will know about the items.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is bad, this is&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl I cheated and preyed on reveals the seed of my magic trick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what she is thinking because of her expressionless face, but I am sure that in Fuyushima-san&#8217;s mind, the validity of everything I’ve done so far is being deliberated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A very bad development.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you know&#8230;&#8230; its &#8230;&#8230;aa, uh, &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened my mouth to say something, but nothing meaningful came out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve done nothing but wrong and now that the item has come to light, there&#8217;s no excuse.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter what I say, it&#8217;s all too late now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Would it be better to get down on my knees and apologise now? &#8230;&#8230;</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But to me, who was at a loss, Fuyushima-san muttered a few words with a blank expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Saino-kun is,indeed, the man of my destiny.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heeh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san&#8217;s words unintentionally caused a sound of dismay to leak out.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Saino-kun is,indeed, the man of my destiny?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words were so random to the situation,that for a moment I couldn&#8217;t catch up with my understanding.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the unexpected still continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it was, Fuyushima-san slowly lowered her head and said…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me help you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I no longer have any idea what it means, and I am immensely confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is she bowing?</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Let me help you?</span></i></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder what she&#8217;s talking about&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t show it in her expression at all, but I wonder if she&#8217;s that much in love with me?</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But the crisis is over, right?&#8230;&#8230;.for now?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have no idea what Fuyushima-san is thinking but she does not appear to blame me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her head is still bowed deeply and she even seems to be rather humble towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Fuyushima-san is serious and wants to help me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am a little lost.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is very convenient for me that Fuyushima-san has this attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, is it really safe to bow her head here?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a good chance that something troublesome could happen later on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be unwise to simply increase the number of people involved in the dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though&#8230;..the answer is obvious from the start.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Can I help you explore?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s an excellent offer, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san is saying this because she knows that 『intercourse raises the lvl』, so of course she is going to help me to 『raise my lvl』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was nothing short of an attractive offer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright then,please lend me your help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I agree, Fuyushima-san finally looks up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm, still the same expressionless face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if she doesn&#8217;t understand what kind of deal she signed&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. now, do you want to lvl up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oops&#8230;&#8230;.Apparently, contrary to my worries, she understands her role.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, she&#8217;s very motivated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression did not even move but her attitude was very positive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. No, let&#8217;s not.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I dare to refuse that tempting invitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason is simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m going to sleep with Akitsu-san today and I&#8217;ve already made plans to have sex with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to save my energy for that time because it will be the first time I fuck Akitsu-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve become a very extravagant man, it seems, to turn down a girl&#8217;s invitation to have sex with another girl. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That so&#8230;..I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san nodded, still showing no emotion at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, a girl would feel a little hurt if she was rejected after asking for sex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Fuyushima-san doesn&#8217;t seem to have that kind of thing, and I didn&#8217;t even get the feeling that she was bothered at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this state of affairs, even if I confessed, [I&#8217;m going to raise my LV with another girl today], she might not even move an eyebrow. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I like Fuyushima-san&#8217;s attitude, I leave my seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, even if we won&#8217;t be doing any ecchi stuff, let&#8217;s try exploring together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san&#8217;s Lvl 10 and Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s is 7, so in simple calculation Fuyushima-san should be stronger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The question after that is whether she can fight properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be better to confirm it today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she can&#8217;t fight at all, I can decide not to let her take part in future battles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I don&#8217;t intend to force her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Fuyushima-san, let&#8217;s dive into the dungeon for a bit. It might be scary, but I want to know how strong you are, Fuyushima-san.&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. let’s go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without any fear at all, Fuyushima-san nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s amazing&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s as if she doesn&#8217;t feel any fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does she have any martial arts training, like Harumachi Sensei?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then let&#8217;s get ready.Follow me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I led Fuyushima-san to the room where Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s belongings were also stored.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there I prepare her equipment for the exploration.I, myself also finished preparing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san is close to me in height and has no breasts, so her clothes are my spare expedition clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her skin is white and her arms are thin, but it suits her surprisingly well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san herself didn&#8217;t seem to be interested and didn&#8217;t even glance in the mirror, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, we changed our clothes together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will just say that Fuyushima-san didn&#8217;t hide her body at all and it was a real eye-opener for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Well, shall we go?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m looking forward to working with you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh,&#8230;..um, I, too, am looking forward to working with you but let&#8217;s just take it easy for now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Entrance to the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We, who had made preparations, exchanged a few words and went into it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Fuyushima-san is equipped with the [Romance Crossbow] and I have a knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because when I asked Fuyushima-san which was better, the bow gun or the knife, she pointed to the bow gun without hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I can&#8217;t really imagine Fuyushima-san wielding a knife, so the choice felt right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I will ask her to switch to a knife later on to test her melee combat skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..You&#8217;ll first have to fight the weaker enemies in the first floor. If you hit one, you should be able to take it down.So, focus on your aiming. But if you miss, I&#8217;ll follow up, so don&#8217;t worry about that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san nodded expressionlessly at my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t seem nervous at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she is this calm, she should be able to match the aim of the [Romance Crossbow] well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that sense, Fuyushima-san may have the talent for a sniper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went down the stairs, inwardly hoping it would be a reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san just silently followed a few steps behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually we arrived at the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From here onwards, the area is inhabited by monsters and there are multiple dangers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Fuyushima-san still shows no emotion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks around, but doesn&#8217;t seem to feel fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, the diary is still stored in the desk drawer in my room, and I found out that the diary Fuyushima-san was carrying was a different 『second book』, but the contents written in&#8230;&#8230;were exactly the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had details about the monsters and Fuyushima-san was aware of the dangers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She knows, and yet she is not scared of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..For now, let&#8217;s just wander around at random and look for the enemy. I&#8217;ll lead the way, Fuyushima-san, you follow me at a suitable distance.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san nodded at my instruction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming her obedient answer, I entered the right passage instead of the direct passage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s been quite a while since I&#8217;ve explored the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know the monster will be weak and I might be able to walk somewhat easier than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We head deeper and deeper down the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m going the right way, so I won&#8217;t lose track of the way back and there&#8217;s no mapping.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san is still following along,expressionless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t seem nervous and seems to be concentrating well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is literally fit for using the [Romance Crossbow].</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How about a formation with Fuyushima-san covering from the rear. Sensei and I will be the vanguard&#8230;..?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my head, I try to simulate a three-man battle with Fuyushima-san participating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have the one with the highest attack power, so I will initiate first by shooting the [Romance Crossbow]. Then I will give the [Romance Crossbow] to Fuyushima-san and pull out my knife and charge it with Sensei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a bit tough for me and Sensei to be vanguards at the same time but we might be able to work on it somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…..that sounds like a good way to fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still feel that the more people I have, the greater the numerical advantage I have and the better I can get around.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Now, the question is whether Sensei will agree&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What worries me is whether Sensei will accept Fuyushima-san&#8217;s participation in the exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei is a student-oriented teacher, so she might try to stop dangerous activities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She understands that I want to explore but Fuyushima-san does not and she is a girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were good reasons for not allowing her to explore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But as we continued our exploration, I spotted an anomaly at the end of the passage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A grey animal with a round body rolling and repeatedly thumping weakly against the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a&#8230;marauding rat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lv. 2.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has not noticed us yet, partly because it is about ten metres away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked back, Fuyushima-san nodded quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she slowly came up next to me and readied the [Romance Crossbow].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that my silent instruction to 『Make a preemptive strike』 was understood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san carefully adjusted her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, I have already explained how to use the iron sights.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;.She’s looking pretty good&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I admire Fuyushima-san&#8217;s figure, who calmly sets her sights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her cold eyes that look into the sights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her breathing is very calm and the &#8220;[Romance Crossbow] didn&#8217;t waver at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks like a skilled sniper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t imagine the arrow will miss the target at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san slowly put her finger on the trigger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then…</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bash………………Katsun!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A [Romance Crossbow] arrow was fired at high speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It went towards the end of the corridor, but stopped when it hit the floor long before&#8230;..the marauding rat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">………..aree??</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.O,one more time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because the place where hse was hit was so far away, The Marauding Rat was completely unaware that it had been sniped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ordered another shot, and Fuyushima-san nodded in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san quietly takes aim again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after enough time, a second arrow was fired.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bash…………Katsun!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow flew off without hitting the floor, it failed again and this time the arrow hit the ceiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s an even bigger miss than the first shot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the Marauding Rat didn&#8217;t even realise it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..this thing looks broken.”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ee&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san looks at me and makes a quick excuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is still expressionless and seems to harbour no feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be that it&#8217;s not an excuse or something, but the weapon is really broken&#8230;..?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily pulled a face, but decided to check the truth of the matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give it to me. I&#8217;ll shoot it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I received the [Romance Crossbow] from Fuyushima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I set it up and looked into the iron sights and took aim&#8230;..hmmm, there seems to be nothing out of the ordinary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went aim straight for the marauding rat and pulled the trigger.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bashu….!!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;a hit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The marauding rat did not even scream as it died. It was immediately transformed into a particle of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unintentionally, both of us fell silent, and an awkward air flowed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I fired the arrow, I hit the enemy exactly where it stood and there was nothing broken in the [Romance Crossbow].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one that is rather broken&#8230;&#8230;seems to be Fuyushima-san’s shooting sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W,well, everyone has trouble aiming at first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Unn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san nods at my consolation words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she was expressionless, I felt a little sorry for her.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;d prefer if she at least hit one target…..’</span></i></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is very rare for Fuyushima-san to show her emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I am sure that she is feeling more restless inside than it appears from the outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She needs a proper follow-up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought for a moment, then said aloud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, let&#8217;s practice a little. If you get the hang of it, Fuyushima-san might be able to guess well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Practice &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, practice. See the torch on the wall at the end of the corridor? Try shooting at that as a target.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I explain to Fuyushima-san while pointing towards the direction where the marauding rat was just now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The distance to the target is less than 15 metres.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s more difficult than before, but if I teach her how to aim properly, she should be able to hit the target reasonably close.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Like this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san holds up his [Romance Crossbow] on the spot and points it at the torch, which is the target.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/12-720x1024.png"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, her posture looks good  but where on earth is the &#8230;..sight pointing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked into the iron sights while avoiding hitting her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.okay, the aim is accurate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the sight is pointing at is definitely the target, the torch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not the floor nor the ceiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she remains like this, she will hit the target perfectly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;now, I understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s only one reason why the arrow missed.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Her shooting posture is bad&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first glance, Fuyushima-san&#8217;s shooting posture seems very ideal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is wrong and perhaps a big shift has occurred at the timing of pulling the trigger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was looking at the enemy at that moment to see the trajectory of the arrow, so that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t notice it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right, let&#8217;s shoot together once. Hold it steady.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, I stick close to Fuyushima-san, lightly hugging her from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sweet smell of the air was wafting in, but I ignored it for now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I support Fuyushima-san&#8217;s arms and make minor adjustments to my posture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san doesn&#8217;t complain, she just does as she is told.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is as expressionless as ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she is being held closely by a man, it seems that she is neither disgusted nor thrilled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her reaction like that, I can&#8217;t help but have strange thoughts about playing a naughty prank on her, forcing her to distort her expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that she has no shame at all is also something to think about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Lv, do you want to raise it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“! N,no, we&#8217;ll do that another time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps sensing my desire, Fuyushima-san suddenly tempts me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But unfortunately, I can&#8217;t take that offer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’re in a dungeon and today&#8217;s semen is for Akitsu-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I calm myself and stabilise Fuyushima-san&#8217;s posture and correct her so that her aim doesn&#8217;t sway when she pulls the trigger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, it&#8217;s good like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s fire a shot like this, shall we?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuyushima-san, try pulling the trigger slowly, just moving your finger.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following my instructions, Fuyushima-san moves her index finger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then…</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bash&#8230;..!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Okay!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow released goes in a straight line to the end of the passage and successfully shoots through the torch, which is the target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sparks that scatter with a crack are somewhat beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..Fuyushima-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though the shot was successful, Fuyushima-san was unresponsive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked into her face but as usual, I could not see any emotion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But eventually, her mouth spun words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I&#8217;ve seen this kind of thing in a drama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa&#8230;&#8230;yeah, I guess so. It&#8217;s probably a rather common situation in romance stories. But it&#8217;s not a real bow gun that shoots, it&#8217;s a toy gun”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn. I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d do it here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, That’s true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We talk to each other, keeping our bodies close to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like a summer festival, target shooting stalls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, the female of the couple would perform a poor shot and the male would gently teach her how to do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It certainly wasn&#8217;t hard to say that what we just did was a very similar act to that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;. aree? Isn&#8217;t this a bit of a good vibe&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I notice that the air between us has become a little sweeter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san is still expressionless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But strangely, I get the impression that she seems to have opened up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what tugged at her heartstrings, but&#8230;..it seems that practising the [Romance Crossbow] was a reasonably enjoyable activity for Fuyushima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sign of it is that she seems a bit talkative despite not smiling even a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, we can&#8217;t stay like this forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a little sorry for her, but slowly let go of her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright then, let&#8217;s move on. Next time you&#8217;ll have to use a knife.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We exchange a few words and resume our search.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Romance Crossbow] is in the rucksack I brought with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, I plan to approach the enemy and block all of their attacks, so that Fuyushima-san can concentrate on attacking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will only observe how good she is at attacking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We proceed through the first floor as it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt the same way when I was with Harumachi Sensei, but it felt a little bit like we were on a date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san and I continue through the corridors in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The distance between us is a little closer than before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although there was no conversation, the atmosphere was so</span><span style="font-weight: 400">mehow not bad, probably thanks to the shooting practice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Speaking of which, why did Fuyushima-san decide to cooperate with the exploration?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san seems to be in a good mood, so I ask her about something that&#8217;s been bothering me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t ask her earlier because she seemed in a mood of not wanting to say anything but she might tell me now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I definitely like to hear her motives behind her agreement to follow me in exploring. This is to determine how credible she is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Fuyushima-san didn&#8217;t answer anything, she just stared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder&#8230;&#8230; about her gaze that makes me feel as if she is wondering about something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she is trying to find out if I am a person worthy of confessing her secrets?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.secret”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After spending a considerable amount of time, Fuyushima-san blurts those words out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the result of the judgement was a rejection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she didn&#8217;t fully trust me yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say that much and continue our exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know she had very little trust in me to begin with and I didn&#8217;t expect that much from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m recognised as 『Destined Man』but all I&#8217;ve done so far is erotic things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she trusts me now, I&#8217;m worried about Fuyushima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure if she&#8217;s already got some dangerous criteria when she recognises me as 『Destined Man』 so easily.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It seems that she is willing to cooperate for now and I can find out the reasons later. If I want, conducting an erotic interrogation is a good idea.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While proceeding down the passageway, I fantasise about Fuyushima-san undergoing torture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hands and feet are tied and she is forced to climax continuously with an electric massager and vibrator.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how cold Fuyushima-san is, she must raise her voice in the never-ending pleasure of hell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a bit of fun just imagining it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san, who has no way of knowing about the images in my brain, just silently follows behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kept going down the corridor, while I was torturing Fuyushima-san in my fantasy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">20 minutes have already passed since the exploration began.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would not be surprising if I encountered the second monster by now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment came quickly, partly because of the fast pace at which I was progressing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of several turns.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A short passage of less than ten metres, a dead tree stands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the monster I fought on my first exploration, a [Hollow Cypress].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its level is 3.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed to have already noticed our presence and was walking towards us at a sluggish pace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuyushima-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I call her name, Fuyushima-san nods and comes right up to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face is expressionless as usual, still without a hint of fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This seems to be alright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll catch the enemy&#8217;s attack first, then you can try to cut them with your knife. Try not to hit me by mistake”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I understand. I&#8217;ll do my best.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san nods small at my words and pulls out her knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body is not strangely tense, nor is she too afraid of the blade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This would allow her to attack calmly, just as she did with the [Romance Crossbow].</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Nnn? The same&#8230;&#8230;as at the time of the [Romance Crossbow]?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suddenly have a bad feeling but it is probably my imagination?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UAAAAA&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, the [Hollow Cypress] is steadily closing the distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had less than five metres to go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rushed towards the [Hollow Cypress] with my bare hands, without a knife in my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UAAA!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Hollow Cypress] raises a thick branch like an arm to intercept us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, a man who is used to combat, this is an attack that is full of gaps and can be counterattacked as much as I want.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I dare not do anything and wait for the attack of my opponent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The branches came at me with a buzzing sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UAA&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Hollow Cypress] made a startled sound and I also involuntarily opened my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was able to firmly catch the attack of the [Hollow Cypress] with my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the problem is the response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, if a branch is swung with such force, there should be a certain amount of impact,but I could hardly feel any pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The strength of the branch is about the same as catching an empty plastic bottle.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If the difference in Lv is too wide, I can withstand its attack&#8230;..!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While holding the [Hollow Cypress]’s branch, I think about the effect of Lv in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the enemy&#8217;s Lv is 3, I am 18&#8230;&#8230;there is a Lv difference of 15.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have felt the change in the amount of damage caused by lvl in the past, but when the difference is as wide as it is this time, it seems that no matter how hard the monster tries,it can no longer even be possible to defeat me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UA, UAA&#8230;&#8230;! UAA&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuyushima-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Hollow Cypress] flinches to shake off the restraints.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I blocked its movement, I turned around and signaled Fuyushima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san then approached the [Hollow Cypress] from the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a forceful exhale, Fuyushima-san continues to swing her thin arm in which the knife is held.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her long black hair spreads beautifully with the force of the attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dull, shiny silver blade approaches the [Hollow Cypress] from the upper stage and—</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensing danger, I duck and evade&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards, the blade of the knife ran into the body of the [Hollow Cypress]&#8230;..and with its momentum, cut through the space where I had just been.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UAAA&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Hollow Cypress] turns into particles of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, due to the difference in lvl, I was able to inflict fatal damage with a single blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">……But I’m not the only one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A delayed cold sweat broke out all at once.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘T,that was sooo close!! If I hadn&#8217;t avoided it, I would have been slashed for sure&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san&#8217;s attack earlier was definitely going to cut through my body as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t tell me, she’s doing it on purpose &#8230;&#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lie about being her　『Destined Person』&#8217; has long been exposed and she thought of cutting me open to get back at me&#8230;..?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.??”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the person in question, Fuyushima-san, tilted her head and was looking at me, who had a pale face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She genuinely doesn&#8217;t seem to understand why I&#8217;m in a cold sweat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Apparently, she doesn&#8217;t realise what she has done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Fuyushima-san, that knife..i’m gonna take it back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“? Ok”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san didn&#8217;t seem to be able to guess the reason but she honestly held out the knife with its sheath to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took it and let out a big sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san&#8217;s knife swing was quite sharp and her attack power didn&#8217;t seem to be bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But with that, we can&#8217;t fight together in very close quarters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san has no idea where her knife is going to go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, she&#8217;s probably never wielded a knife before, so that might not be a problem to some extent. &#8230;..</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But&#8230;..she couldn’t shoot and can&#8217;t even wield a knife? &#8230;..’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a lack of combat skills beyond my expectations, I&#8217;m lost in thought about what to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exploring dungeons involves fighting monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Fuyushima-san cannot be relied on as a fighting force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that it&#8217;s like this, should I make her focus on the『Raising Lv』instead of fighting poorly?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san doesn&#8217;t seem to have any resistance to sex either, so I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a bad thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuyushima-san, you were talking about cooperating with the exploration but was that because you wanted to fight monsters? Do you really want to fight?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I don&#8217;t want to fight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked just to be sure, but Fuyushima-san shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This would have been very troubling if the answer had been [I want to fight] but apparently it was the opposite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, she didn&#8217;t look like such a fighting maniac and I wasn&#8217;t worried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, I&#8217;ll ask Fuyushima-san to help me only with Lv. I&#8217;ll contact you only when I want to get stronger…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not good enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san interrupts my words and shows a firm refusal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expressionless face is the same as usual but I can feel a strong will in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was perplexed as to what was going on, but Fuyushima-san continued to speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll definitely go with you on your exploration. I don&#8217;t care if I have to carry your luggage. I won&#8217;t get in the way, so let me help you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken aback.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve never heard Fuyushima-san sound so earnest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression also has a slightly serious colour to it, and it seems that what she said just now was said with great seriousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Why? Why do you want to accompany me on my exploration so badly?&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s&#8230;..not yet….I can&#8217;t tell you. Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked why, Fuyushima-san turns her face down and mouths an apology.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmmm, I don&#8217;t know how it all makes sense..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn’t want to fight but she does want to help with the exploration?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she can help me with my luggage, well, she might be able to help but&#8230;&#8230;I wonder what Fuyushima-san was looking for and why she is determined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t even know why she wanted to help me in the first place, so it&#8217;s really a mystery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;However, it is also true that I don&#8217;t feel anything particularly malicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There may be no harm in accepting it for now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..It can’t be helped, all right. Let&#8217;s explore together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san bowed her head deeply and thanked me for my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think I deserve to be thanked so much&#8230;..Well, it&#8217;s fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be more convenient in many ways if she felt indebted to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, let&#8217;s return back to my house. I have an appointment in the evening. I want to prepare for that too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right, let&#8217;s go then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We turn around and go back the way we both came.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Took the right-hand path, so we could walk along the left-hand wall and not get lost.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We continued through the passage without encountering any enemies and shortly afterwards we close to the exit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuyushima-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we were about to leave the basement, I suddenly noticed that Fuyushima-san was acting strangely and called out to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was staring at the dungeon and seemed to be thinking about something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The look in her eyes is&#8230;&#8230;kind of like she&#8217;s leaving something behind?</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was an air of wanting to continue exploring more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.from now on, I&#8217;m going to ask you to join me in my exploration almost every day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, I’ll come here every day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san nods broadly at my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She still has no expression on her face but she looks somewhat happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why she is so supportive of dungeon exploration at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someday, I&#8217;ll definitely find out why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Fuyushima-san changed her clothes and left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she was leaving, she asked again, [Do you want to raise your lvl?]  and I politely declined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my house where I am finally alone, I got ready for the night with Akitsu-san.</span></p>
