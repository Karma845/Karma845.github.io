<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you very much for picking up my book 『Sex and Dungeon』. I am the author,Minkansukii.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that you can write in the afterword rather freely, so I thought about talking about the appeal of sleep deprivation in my own way, but I decided not to do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And while there is unconscious fornication in this book, there is no sleep fornication. (What&#8217;s the difference between the two, you might ask? They are as different as baseball and football).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, let me say this instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to the people who helped me with this publication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, to Mr Y, the editor in charge. Thank you very much for not only approaching me with the idea of publishing the book but also for politely answering my many questions. I received numerous compliments on my work, all of which hit the points I had intended to make, and I was inwardly tongue-tied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next, Osanai-sensei for the illustrations. I have no words to thank you for providing such cute, beautiful, and erotic illustrations. When I first received the character designs, I was so moved that my heart stopped. I&#8217;m sure all the illustrations you drew will be my treasures for the rest of my life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And to the many people who supported me in writing this work. It is thanks to your support that I have been able to successfully publish my book. The warm words of encouragement I have received are still burning in my heart. I am also grateful for the material support, and I cannot thank enough the fans who have sent me nutritional drinks and other items. I will continue to do my best to live up to your support.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is how I would like to thank those who have helped me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, I would like to spend more than ten pages expressing my gratitude but the word limit is approaching and this is about as much as I can do this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, finally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You, readers who have read this far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the author of this book, I offer you my unsurpassed gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look forward to seeing you again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Novel Minkansukii.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hello. My name is Minkansukii. I am not that Minkansukii, although I am often mistaken for one. Minkansukii because I like sleep fornication. Easy to remember when you know what it means, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">llustrations Osanai</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nice to meet you, I&#8217;m Osanai. This is the first time in my life that I have illustrated a book and drawn an erotic picture. It would be a great honour if I was able to draw even one scene that left an impression in everyone&#8217;s hearts.</span></p>
