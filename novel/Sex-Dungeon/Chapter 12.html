<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; The Animal Trap</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─The half-expected predicament came just after lunchtime.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino-kun, can you come over here for a minute?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was putting away my textbooks on my desk, a soft but somehow powerful voice came from behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s obvious who the voice is without having to look back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a small sigh and then replied to the voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Okay. I’ll follow you, Akitsu-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stand up and turn around, there is, after all, Akitsu-san smiling at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her smile is the same charming smile as usual, but I can sense a kind of anger that cannot be hidden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I glanced at the centre of the classroom, I saw that Natsuno-san was sitting in her seat, flustered, not knowing what to do.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, there&#8217;s no way Natsuno-san can hide it from Akitsu-san, is there?&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t need to think about what happened between them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san, whose relationship with me had progressed so quickly, was in quite a good mood from the morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no way that Akitsu-san, a good friend and perceptive person, would not have suspected Natsuno-san was acting strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have immediately interrogated her and got to the bottom of the matter.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Natsuno-san also tried to keep the secret in her own way, but&#8230;..Akitsu-san was one or two steps ahead of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was impossible to hide things from the start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, let&#8217;s talk on the rooftop♪.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s good. I prefer a place where we won&#8217;t be disturbed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We exchanged short words and left the classroom together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san looked at me with a worried face but I gave her a smile with the message not to worry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I don&#8217;t want Natsuno-san to participate in the discussion from here on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can only see a future where things will get even more complicated.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, Fuyushima-san, who was sitting next to me, looked at me unusually as if she wanted to say something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m her 『Predestined Man』in a manner of speaking, so I wonder if she was a little concerned about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We leave the classroom and head for the stairs without having any conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a tremendous sense of urgency.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san seems to be really angry and I can see her moodiness from her every move.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m getting pretty scared about what she&#8217;s going to say to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, we arrived at the rooftop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rooftop is only open to students during lunchtime, but it is unpopular because it is a bit cold this time of year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, there is no one around but us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Now then, let&#8217;s hear your excuses.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san looks back at me and speaks in a low voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has a scary face, as if she could kill someone with her eyes alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, because of his well-defined face, such an expression is also attractive, but&#8230;..anyway, the strong anger is directly transmitted to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is something I&#8217;m going to have to take seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was not a single thing I could explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to the [Special Sleepover Ticket], sleeping with Natsuno-san is not a problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But beyond that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for the rapey sex, I initiated it and there is no excuse for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; So I choose to 『run away』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I&#8217;m not running away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Running away from interrogation&#8230;&#8230;『postponing an answer』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve brought the tools for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, first of all, I&#8217;d like you to take a look at this.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, I held out a piece of paper from my pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A piece of paper about the size of a note with a heart symbol in the middle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Needless to say, it was the last of the [Special Sleepover Ticket].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?? What&#8217;s this?　Does something like this ticket have anything to do with it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san frowned, not understanding what I had just taken out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she stopped questioning me and it&#8217;s not a bad reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s make her fall into the same trap as her best friend.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, you&#8217;ll see what I mean when you look at the back of this. Take it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;It doesn&#8217;t say anything. Are you trying to make a joke?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Good, the objective has been achieved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her anger seems to have increased even more, but it doesn&#8217;t matter now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I&#8217;ve given her the [Special Sleepover Ticket], then I&#8217;ve done my job.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Akitsu-san a question as a confirmation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I think I brought the wrong paper. By the way, can I sleep with you tonight?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure but do you want to make me angry, Saino-kun? Don&#8217;t try to mislead me.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san chokes me while giving me a quick OK.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is still extremely angry, but it seems that the [Special Sleepover Ticket] has worked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So all that&#8217;s left to do now is to give a random answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have a 『special strategy』 for Akitsu-san that I&#8217;ve been thinking about for a while, so I&#8217;ll just have to put it into action when we get into the futon together tonight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Sorry. I&#8217;m really sorry. I want to tell you everything properly, but for now, all I can do is apologise. I have some things I need to prepare for&#8230;..and I wonder if you would let me explain the situation at Akitsu-san&#8217;s house tonight?　I&#8217;ll definitely tell you everything properly then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;。&#8230;&#8230;You&#8217;re not planning to fool me with sex, are you? Unlike Hiyori, I&#8217;m not going to be satisfied with that, would I?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t do that. I don&#8217;t think I can fool Akitsu-san with that sort of thing.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san, who stared at me with a stern glare, responded in a calm manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve gained a lot of courage through repeated experience and I&#8217;m not in any rush at all at this level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m already good at fooling girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san stares at me with suspicious eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was uncomfortable, as if she was peering into the depths of my eyes, but I never let my mind get distracted and met her gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.I understand. I&#8217;ll let you tell your story tonight. But in return, I&#8217;m going to ask you to accompany me on some experiments. Be prepared”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps judging that there seemed to be no malice on my part, Akitsu-san nodded while offering exchange conditions.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Okay, I survived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least I have succeeded in escaping from this place.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘An experiment&#8230;&#8230;.What on earth is she going to do with me&#8230;?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied a thank you to her but inwardly I am worried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think it is possible I will be mutilated with a scalpel&#8230;..but I honestly have a bad feeling about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;d better do a decisive blow tonight before she does something weird to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, let&#8217;s go back to the classroom. Natsuno-san is probably quite worried about you.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I suppose so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I suggest this, Akitsu-san agrees, albeit with a somewhat pensive look on her face.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Okay, let&#8217;s get back to the classroom before she changes her mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took the initiative and headed for the rooftop entrance and went straight into the school building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san followed me and left the rooftop as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly packed my bags and headed for the teachers&#8217; room, just as I did yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve made an appointment with Akitsu-san and I want to call off the search today as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will have to talk to Harumachi-sensei about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, Sensei’s contact details are not yet registered on my smartphone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll have to get her phone number for the next dungeon exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I arrive at the  staff room and go inside, searching for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei isn&#8217;t&#8230;..there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she hasn&#8217;t come back from class yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly leave the  staff room and wait at the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It should be better to wait here, so I don&#8217;t have to worry about the other teachers thinking I&#8217;m weird.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.she’s late&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, after waiting for five minutes, Harumachi-sensei still hasn&#8217;t appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be that she has received a difficult question from a student?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or is she busy cleaning up after something?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s only been five minutes, and if I wait a little longer, she will come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But time just keeps on passing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s already been 20 minutes since I started waiting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went into the staff room and asked the other teachers, but it seemed that Harumachi-sensei had not returned after going to class.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..I’ll go find her’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m going to be able to see her if I keep waiting, so I walk down the corridor and head towards the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know where she is, but if I look around the classrooms I should be able to find her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I go straight up the stairs and look around the classrooms on the second floor first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..Harumachi-sensei is nowhere to be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to ask some of the students in the area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, sorry. Do you know where Harumachi-sensei is?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Harumachi-sensei&#8230;&#8230;ah, if it’s Sensei, she was teaching in our class just now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A junior female student with pigtails answers my questions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s reasonably strong information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I can trace her from here, I will know where she is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you don&#8217;t know where she is now? Is she still in the classroom?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, she left right after class, so I don&#8217;t know what happened after that&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I see. Okay, thanks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmmm, it doesn&#8217;t work that way easily, does it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thank the girl student who shakes her head apologetically but inwardly I feel a little discouraged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl also didn’t ask me back with my question, but in the end it remains unclear where Sensei is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to search around a bit more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, just as he was about to leave, a female student with pigtails uttered, [Oh, but…].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it may be, but&#8230;&#8230;she might be resting in the infirmary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The infirmary &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The information was so unexpected that I couldn&#8217;t help but parrot it back to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The female student told me the reason with a slightly worried look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Harumachi-sensei suddenly became dazed the moment class ended and left the classroom with unsteady steps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her appearance was clearly not normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks&#8230;&#8230;.I&#8217;ll go to the infirmary.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thanked the female student and ran out into the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, anxiety welled up in my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no doubt that something has happened to Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m simply worried and I have an incredibly bad feeling about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should find Sensei as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I go downstairs and open the door to the infirmary at the end of the corridor on the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Harumachi-sensei is not &#8230;&#8230; there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked the teacher in the infirmary and apparently Harumachi-sensei never came.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Damn &#8230;&#8230; where did she go?’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While closing the door of the infirmary, I think about where Harumachi-sensei went in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I have no idea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, I went to the staff room again, but it seemed that the teacher had not returned.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It can&#8217;t be helped. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to look up anything I can get my hands on&#8230;&#8230;.!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I conclude this and run down the corridor, feeling frustrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, second and third floors. &#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly looked around the classrooms, but could not find Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, I finished looking in all the classrooms, but still Sensei was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Then&#8230;&#8230;that place!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I head for the last remaining place and run up the stairs at full speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The place where I went with Akitsu-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rooftop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Sensei!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I open the door and call out in a loud voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei&#8230;..!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sitting on a bench, she was standing there in a daze, not even noticing him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approached Sensei while regulating my breathing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei doesn&#8217;t react to anything, even though I&#8217;m right in front of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s an expression I&#8217;ve seen before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has the exact same eyes when I used the [Nightmare Inducing Bell] on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Sensei?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A&#8230;&#8230;. Eh&#8230;&#8230; Saino&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to her, Harumachi-sensei regained her senses at once, looked at me and her eyes fluttered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Sensei, feeling a bad premonition running down my spine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, why are you here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? I&#8217;m pretty sure someone called me to&#8230;.Aree?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei answered, but twisted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably realised it was weird when she said it herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who called her and why is that person not here?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I think about it properly, I can find any number of unnatural points.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I had an idea as to the cause of this unusual phenomenon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dazed expression on her face, the calls that can only be heard by certain people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I recall, a similar phenomenon occurred when Natsuno-san came to my house before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even when Harumachi-sensei found the dungeon, it was probably similar to now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Yes, there’s no more doubt left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dungeon is doing something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, for now, please go home and rest today. I, too, won&#8217;t be exploring today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;&#8230;you&#8217;re right. I don&#8217;t realise it myself but I&#8217;m probably pretty tired. My head&#8217;s a bit confused too&#8230;.”&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, get some sleep and regain your strength. You can always explore another time and don&#8217;t worry about me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say a few kind words to Harumachi-sensei, who honestly agrees with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei smiles at that, saying that she understands and stands up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her gait seems normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it&#8217;s safe to let her go home alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We left the rooftop and went our separate ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s house and mine are in opposite directions. So, on the way home, I&#8217;m alone.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.. What was it all about? What is  the Dungeon trying to do?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I walk towards home, I let my thoughts run through my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mysterious phenomenon that attacked Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cause is definitely the dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what on earth was the point of sending Sensei to the roof?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the past, Sensei had discovered the existence of the dungeon and that had led to a dramatic change in the exploration but&#8230;..this time there was no noticeable impact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At best,  Sensei and I got home a bit late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somewhat driven by a sense of frustration, I naturally walk faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t shake off a bad feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I&#8217;ve fallen into some kind of deadly trap without knowing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of trap did the dungeon set for me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually I arrived home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, I have to go to the dungeon and have a quick look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something might have changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; But when I inserted the key into the keyhole of the front door, I noticed something unusual.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oioi, you&#8217;re kidding me&#8230;&#8230;.? The door is unlocked &#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned the key, there was no response or sound of the lock being unlocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lock is definitely unlocked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did I forget to lock it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I stayed at Natsuno-san&#8217;s house last night but I remember locking the door when I left the house properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So could it be that my parents, who had gone on an adventure, came back?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not impossible, but if so, it&#8217;s strange that there&#8217;s no car in the garage.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Damn&#8230;&#8230;it got me &#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here I finally understood why  the Dungeon had called Sensei to the roof.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought the only impact was that we were late getting home but that&#8217;s exactly what it was trying to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what the principle is but the dungeon must have known I was leaving after talking to Sensei and came up with the idea of taking advantage of that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And again, I don&#8217;t know how but it unlocked the front door and invited someone into my house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It could have just aimed for the time when I was in class, but the fact that the dungeon went to the trouble of doing it,means that this someone is probably someone who, like me, can&#8217;t get here until school finishes. This someone is likely to be a student at the same school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dungeon bought time for that person to find the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Khh&#8230;.What to do?　Call the police?　No, no. I can&#8217;t let them see the dungeon and whoever went in there in the first place has probably already seen it. Even if I’m lucky and the police doesn’t check the basement, that person who knows about the dungeon could spoil it in an interview&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I click my tongue involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve tried to wrap my head around it but I can&#8217;t find a proper solution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only possibility is to persuade the person in the house to keep the secret&#8230;..the same means as with Harumachi Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, that was a forceful way of doing it, which was only possible because Harumachi-sensei had a liking for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t even know who was in the house, so I had to say that the chances of success were low.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But I had to do it. It&#8217;s all about negotiation now &#8230;..!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Determined, I open the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; For the moment, there is no sign of intruders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I could feel a weak wind blowing towards the basement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, because of the open basement door, the dungeon&#8217;s unique air flow towards the back of the room has come here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I closed the door as noiselessly as possible and slowly descended the stairs, step by step.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unintentionally, a voice like a dumbfounded one leaks out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stone corridor that can be seen from the entrance to the basement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unexpectedness of the person who was there, for a moment I could not catch up with my understanding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, however, a sense of relief welled up in my heart at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not good that she saw the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m sure this girl will keep my secret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; at least as long as she thinks I&#8217;m 『the one』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Nn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That girl&#8230;&#8230;at the entrance of the dungeon, Fuyushima-san, notices me and slowly turns around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face is expressionless as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after discovering something so out of the ordinary as a dungeon, she was still, as ever, very cold.</span></p>
