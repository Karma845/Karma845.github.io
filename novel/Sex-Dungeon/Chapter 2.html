<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Umbrellas, Summer, and Autumn</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Sensei left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I equipped myself and stood at the entrance to the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My body was fatigued from having sex continuously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I wanted to make sure that it had made me properly strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stepped into the stone corridor and checked my palms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, the number written there was zero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;5. The Love is lvl up, properly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel a little relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, the number on my palm had increased by the number of times I had sex with my teacher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an act that twisted Sensei&#8217;s will, but it certainly seemed to prove something.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;. Okay, let&#8217;s go and verify the effect of Love being raised.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took one deep breath and braced myself.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I have raised my Love, the next step is exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to when I was lvl 0, my combat power should have increased, and I should be able to dive into dungeons more efficiently than yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should also be able to get new 『magic tools』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I descended the stairs and entered the first level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scene was unchanged from yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wind was still blowing, and the path had several branches.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took my smartphone out of my pocket and activated the mapping app.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems to have been developed for games, but it should work in this dungeon too.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.. for now, let&#8217;s continue along the left side today’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, I used the right side and obtained the [Night-Calling Candle].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I went to that small room again in the same way, there would only be an empty treasure chest, so it would be more efficient to take a different route.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly proceeded, keeping my left hand on the wall. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While mapping the area, keeping an eye out for monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dungeon is quiet, a good environment for an ambush.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But after five minutes of walking, I spotted monsters ahead.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;are those [Marunezumi]? Two of them. They haven&#8217;t noticed me&#8230;..?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A pair of round-looking rats appeared about 20 metres.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are about the size of an exercise balance ball and are bumping into each other in a rocking motion.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Are they fighting for territorial control?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are not very powerful, but they are constantly making sharp noises to each other.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Their Lv is&#8230;&#8230;1? This is a good opportunity’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I close one of my eyes to check the monster&#8217;s level and nod to myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The level of the Hollow Cypress I defeated yesterday is also 1.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;re the perfect opponents to test my growth.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I draw my knife and slowly approach the [Marunezumi].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The monsters still haven’t noticed me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when I get as close as ten metres, they turn to me with great vigour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“[[CHUUUUUU!]]”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Marunezumi] make loud cries and roll over towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But their momentum is not that fast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s about the speed of a human walking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t wait for them and ran towards the enemy.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And with that momentum, I first cut the one that was rolling towards me on my left side with my knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“CHUOO&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Marunezumi] that took my blow stops rolling and stops moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then it quickly turned into a particle of light and vanished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly turned back to the other enemy and thrust my  knife right into it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It also turned into a particle of light with one blow.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; phew.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Confirming that I had finished defeating the monsters, I let out a sigh and relaxed from my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then returned the knife to its sheath.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Indeed, I feel a lot stronger. Is this the effect of LV&#8230;.?’ </span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think about that while looking at my palm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This battle ended very quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number of attacks it took to defeat the enemy was one for both.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover,I&#8217;ve adjusted my strength.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering that yesterday&#8217;s [Hollow Cypress] took three blows, it could be said that the attack power has improved considerably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is also different from the time of the [Hollow Cypress] is that I am not so fatigued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, the mental load was great due to the fact that it was my first battle, but this time I don&#8217;t feel that kind of fatigue at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps my mind has become accustomed to combat.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Or does LV even reinforce the strength of the soul?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, the battle is much easier than yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I feel like this, I should be able to kill at least Lv 1 enemies in an instant.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;Okay, let&#8217;s continue exploring then. Yesterday I stopped exploring after one item, but today I might be able to collect&#8230;..all the items on the first floor.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the dungeon rules written in the journal, there are three treasure chests on each floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened one yesterday, so there are two left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If my exploration goes well, there is a good chance that I can complete it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I resumed and continued to walk through the dungeon. Eventually──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘!!!That small room&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After turning the corner several times, five metres away is an entrance to a similar small room</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">I found yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approached it slowly, unintentionally filled with anticipation.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, I found a treasure chest in a similar small room. So perhaps there is a treasure chest in this room as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quietly look into the room, trying not to make any noise.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I knew it, there is a treasure chest&#8230;&#8230;! But surrounding the chest itself is a [Blue Rose]?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, in the centre of the room is a treasure chest made of wood and iron.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as yesterday, the room was also accompanied by monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The type of enemy is the [Blue Rose].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is about the size of a human child and has beautiful, large blue flowers.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The petals are magnificent, but the rest of the flower is thin and frail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it has a number of sharp spines on it, which could injure me if I carelessly touch it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to attack, the flower would be the target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I closed one eye and checked and its lvl was 5.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The highest level of the first floor&#8230;.! That means it&#8217;s a strong enemy&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While pulling the knife out of its sheath, I gulped and calmed down my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This [Blue Rose] is apparently one of the top-class enemies in this first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless,I defeated lvl 1 [Hollow Cypress] when I was still at lvl 0.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Based on that experience, it is not such a bad situation to have an equal Lv.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I readied myself and slowly walked into the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“SHUUUUU&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I step into the room, a blue rose turns towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn&#8217;t come to attack me, but it is threatening me with its sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cautiously look at it, looking for an opportunity to attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few feints, I closed the distance at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seii!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I run my knife as vigorously as I can with as much force as I can muster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few petals fell and the blue rose&#8217;s body swayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I felt a pain in my arm and quickly moved away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alarmed, I looked at my right arm and saw a shallow cut, about ten centimetres long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“SHUUUU, SHUUUU!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Blue Rose] squeals with laughter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, during the earlier attack, it used one of its spikes and scratched my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not much of a fatal damage, but it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve been wounded since I dived into this dungeon.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;Damn. I&#8217;d like a weapon that can attack these enemies at long range&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The range of a knife is at most arm&#8217;s length.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When attacking, I inevitably run the risk of this kind of counterattack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s easy to use and has a high attack power, but it&#8217;s still a close-range weapon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wiped the blood from my arm and rushed at the blue rose again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, as carefully as possible,I sliced through the petals, seeing through its movement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“SHUUUU&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The response it gave was good enough.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My knife successfully ran into the centre of the flower, and the [Blue Rose] grunted and thrashed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t miss the opportunity, and returned the blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“SHU&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blue rose crumbles to the floor and turns into particles of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The particles were then absorbed by the floor and walls as usual, leaving only me and the treasure chest in the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phew&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh and sheathed my knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It went down in the third attack, but it was a very intense fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially as this was the first time I had taken any damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It made me think about the need to devise the battle accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, it is also true that I was able to win quite comfortably against the highest levels of the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exploration on this floor may already be quite easy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps, 『monsters that are the same lvl as meー』 are 『opponents that I can usually beat even if I fight them』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, I&#8217;m still unbeatable on the first floor for my lvl.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, I should open the treasure chest anyway&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stop thinking and approach the treasure chest in the middle of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the main purpose of exploring the dungeon.</span></p
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What kind of items will I get this time?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I open the lid of the treasure chest and look inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was in the treasure chest was──</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.a folding umbrella? and an instruction manual.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the treasure chest was a black folding umbrella and a piece of paper that looked like it would normally be sold in a shop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As was the case with the [Night-Calling Candle], it seems that an instruction manual is included in the box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the paper and read the contents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『[Fate Interwined Umbrella], if the user enter this umbrella with someone of the opposite sex, the opposite sex will develop romantic feelings for user. The longer the user and the opposite sex stay in it, the more effective it is. Usable number of times: ∞ times.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, that’s the function of this item&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I blurted out after reading the written description.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Night-Calling Candle] was a very simple item to increase Lvl, but the [Fate Intertwined Umbrella] is a bit more complicated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there is no limit to the number of times I can use it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps I&#8217;ll be using this for a long time in the future.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, let&#8217;s continue our search.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was tempted to contemplate how to use it, but I forced myself to refocus my objective and put the [Fate Intertwined Umbrella] in my rucksack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can think about how to use it later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, let&#8217;s concentrate on the exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, the exploration is going very well this time and I don&#8217;t feel too tired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My arm still had a scar from the earlier battle with the [Blue Rose], but it was not very deep and did not hinder my physical movement at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Suuuー, haaaー&#8230;..alright.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take one deep breath before leaving the small room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The exploration from here on has to weigh up the risks and rewards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to that journal, if I take more than a certain amount of damage, I will lose the items I have obtained and will be forced to return back to the entrance.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Fate Intertwined Umbrella] will also return to the treasure chest.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It didn’t specify how much damage is considered critical, anyway let&#8217;s just proceed carefully.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue walking down the stone corridor while thinking back to the rules I had read previously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way forward is still along the left-hand wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The path is properly recorded in the mapping application, revealing the structure of the labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And from the shape of the path on the screen, I was able to draw some inferences.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; perhaps the first floor is in the shape of a square of four hundred metres square&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mapping application shows that the path I&#8217;ve been on has a certain regularity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two hundred metres straight left from the entrance, four hundred metres up from there, and then a little further right from there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The path I followed along the left hand side of the road has such an outer circumference, winding and twisting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shape was too beautiful to be called accidental.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If it is 400 metres square, it would be 160,000 square metres&#8230;&#8230;The Tokyo Dome is about 50,000 square metres, which means it is more than three times the size of the Tokyo Dome.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doing a quick calculation in my head, I think about the time and effort it would take to explore every inch of the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It might take a lot of effort to complete the map, given the size of the place and its intricate corridors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far I&#8217;ve managed to get my hands on two magic tools, which is probably a lucky thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue mapping and moving through the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that my earlier reasoning was correct, and beautiful squares were forming on the screen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And less than an hour after I started my exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finally found a small room that looked familiar.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is &#8230;&#8230; yesterday&#8217;s room, right?&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is one treasure chest with an open lid in the centre, and nothing else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scene around the entrance is exactly the same as I remember and I feel quite deja vu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked inside the treasure chest to be sure, and found that it also contained the instructions for the [Night-Calling Candle].</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..So I&#8217;ve just gone round the perimeter yesterday. It was a bit unexpected that the right and left pathways are connected. &#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mark the location of this place firmly on my mapping app and exit the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I expected to find a dead end because it is a dungeon, but miraculously, I didn&#8217;t seem to hit one this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s hard to say whether that&#8217;s luck or not.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘For now, let&#8217;s continue on to the entrance and then head towards the centre this time. I&#8217;m feeling lucky today, and I want to get that last item.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I set a course of action and followed the same pathway I walked yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a path I took once, so it&#8217;s a bit easier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way, I encountered a lvl 3 [Marunezumi], but I defeated it without difficulty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon I was back at the entrance of the first floor.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Okay, now let&#8217;s go this way.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the entrance, a passageway extends to the left and right, which I follow to the left and turn right at the first junction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Presumably this will take me towards the centre.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just as I was about to turn the corner──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UAAAAA!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A blow from a [Hollow Cypress] swung down from around the corner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately protected my head with both arms against the unexpected blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An impact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not that strong but my arms ache and go slightly numb.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I frowned and retreated as far as I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UAAAA!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hollow Cypress…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A strange shape  of a [Hollow Cypress] that can be seen beyond the corner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was definitely the monster I had encountered in the small room yesterday.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; I was caught off guard.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had become stronger and thinking that I could fight, I neglected to be vigilant.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is a dungeon and the enemy will attack without regard to my condition.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The price for almost unconsciously forgetting this is the blow I  just received.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Lv is&#8230;.5?!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I closed one eye and looked at it, and the number that came to mind was 5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the same lvl as the [Blue Rose] I fought earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I braced myself and drew my knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, swinging from side to side, I jumped into the [Hollow Cypress]&#8217;s bosom at the right moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UAA&#8230;&#8230;AA&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A flash of full force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The face of the [Hollow Cypress] is shattered and its entire body is also tilted by the impact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However -&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The handle of the knife in my hand feels like it&#8217;s going to fall off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it did, the knife fell to the stone corridor with a resounding clang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the initial surprise attack had weakened my grip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was too shocked to notice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there was no way the enemy would miss such an opening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Hollow Cypress] regained its stance and swung a branch sideways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A leafless branch crosses in front of me with a [Bun]sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just in time to retreat.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Damn it&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel my cold sweat running down my spine as I tried to figure out what to do in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knife is right next to the [Hollow Cypress].</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s completely within range of the enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I go to pick it up, I am sure to get a painful blow.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Can I damage it by punching it&#8230;.!? No, there is a possibility that my fist would bleed. What if&#8230;..a kick? Either way, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a very good attack&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While working on a plan at high speed, I observe my opponent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Hollow Cypress] is aware that I&#8217;ve lost my weapon, and it just keeps moaning near the knife.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Not good&#8230;.I have to think of a way out of this&#8230;.!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While continuing to be on the lookout for the [Hollow Cypress], I look around.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is there any effective way to attack, or alternative weapons…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After observing the interior of the dungeon, I finally realised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Objects that I had previously unconsciously considered to be part of the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That thing could possibly be a weapon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially against an [Hollow Cypress].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approach the wall and put my hand on the object.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slightly warm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the feel of moderately heavy wood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing I was going to use, it&#8217;s a&#8230;..torch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Okay, it&#8217;s off!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put the right amount of force on it and the torch came off easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hold it with both hands and direct the flame towards the [Hollow Cypress].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling of having it is not bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is slightly thicker, but I will be able to swing it as if it were a baseball bat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UAA&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Hollow Cypress] shows a slight flinch, as if it is not good with flames.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thrust the tip of my torch menacingly and taking my timing into account, I charged forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Son of a bitch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I don’t what to put for </span><span style="font-weight: 400">このっ</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> so I hope this one is ok)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UA, UAAAAAAA! &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A full swing with the torch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The impact causes the [Hollow Cypress]’s body to pop and sparks of fire start to fly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a good response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that attacks with flames are effective against this monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flames quickly spread to the body of the [Hollow Cypress].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UAAAAA&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where it burns up completely, the [Hollow Cypress]’s body turns into particles of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flames instantly disappeared, and soon everything was extinguished.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa…Haa..Fua..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming my victory, I relaxed my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, I felt  fatigue throughout my body.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;I thought I could afford to fight at this level, but I will have to re-evaluate.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is only a monster&#8217;s den.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are always dangers and it is not a place where I can let my guard down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I have to change my mind about Lv.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first time, I assumed that 『monsters that are the same lvl as meー』 meant 『opponents that I can usually beat even if I fight them』, but that would be a mistake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the knife and sheathed it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then turned back the way I came.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The damage is not that serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, due to fatigue from the previous battle, I was not in a perfect state of mind.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That&#8217;s the end of today&#8217;s exploration.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tuesday, the day after the second dungeon exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to school as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my bag was an umbrella that I got yesterday, the [Fate Intertwined Umbrella].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In some cases, this could have been used to increase the number of experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino&#8230;.you look different somehow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeaa. Somehow, it&#8217;s more dignified or&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was seated, my friend spoke to me with a curious look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied appropriately but inwardly I broke out in a bit of a cold sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If my face has become more manly, the cause is definitely yesterday&#8217;s events.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sexual intercourse with Harumachi-sensei and my graduation as a virgin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have peeled off my skin as a man, and that might have changed something about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, at the time I smiled back softly, the classroom door rattled open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who came in was&#8230;.my first-time partner, Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ho, let&#8217;s start homeroom!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The call is clearly awkward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei usually stands at the pulpit with an imposing demeanour, but today she is somehow less powerful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason for this is obvious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that she had a physical relationship with me must have been a shock enough for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no denying that it is unacceptable for a teacher to lay a hand on a student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was observing the situation, Harumachi-sensei noticed my gaze and jumped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, she&#8217;ll be behaving suspiciously for at least the rest of the day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?? &#8230;&#8230;Stand up!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san, the representative of our class, gives the order to greet Sensei, with a question mark over her condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up and bowed with everyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei may not know about it but I know that yesterday&#8217;s affair was due to the effects of a magic tool. That’s why I am able to hide any strange attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe because I&#8217;ve lost my virginity or maybe I&#8217;ve gained some gallantry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Let&#8217;s see, this morning&#8217;s roll call start with──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei looked at me with a complicated expression on her face, but she began the morning homeroom in a slightly quieter voice than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The school classes went smoothly as it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sense was behaving suspiciously but her subject, World History, is not today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today&#8217;s class went on peacefully as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even in such a situation, I was secretly expecting a little something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is, of course──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..Good, it&#8217;s suddenly getting cloudy as predicted’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, there&#8217;s only one thing to look forward to when I’ve got the [Fate Intertwined Umbrella].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An umbrella situation called rain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the morning weather forecast, the weather will change rapidly this evening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A downpour was predicted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a very convenient weather condition to lend a companion an umbrella.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I&#8217;ve actually already decided on that companion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei would surely refuse to get any closer to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why she would never accept a shared umbrella.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be dangerous for a student and a teacher to go home under the same umbrella if someone saw us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I move my gaze and steal a glance at the person I have chosen as my target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My gaze stops in the middle of the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has her hair in a ponytail style today and is staring intently at the blackboard with her strong-willed, hung-up eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Yes, the person I am planning to use the umbrella on is the Class Representative of this class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person I am planning to use the umbrella against is the Class Representative of this class, Natsuno-san, who has a cute little body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was killing time alone in an empty classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san went to the teacher&#8217;s office to do something the teacher asked her to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I&#8217;m waiting for her to be done with her task.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally and with all due respect, I had to check that there was no umbrella in Natsuno-san&#8217;s bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there is not a single umbrella in the classroom umbrella stand.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Did she simply forget her umbrella, or did she bring it but someone stole it?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Either way, luck is still beside me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I waited, fiddling with my smartphone, the classroom door rattled open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Are? Saino, you&#8217;re still here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who entered the classroom was, as expected, Natsuno-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at me and seemed a little surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, I&#8217;m sorry. I forgot to bring my umbrella.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say the excuse I&#8217;ve thought of in advance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The setting was that I had forgotten that I had a folding umbrella in my bag and could not return home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, if I deliberately raise my voice and take the umbrella from my bag, my excuse is complete.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now all that&#8217;s left to do is to phase in a suitable invitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Natsuno-san gave me such a look of disinterest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm&#8230;..then I&#8217;ll go home first.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heee?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; what?　What&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N–no, it&#8217;s nothing. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s words were completely different from what I had expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A strange voice unintentionally escaped my mouth and I hurried to cover it up.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Did Natsuno-san bring a proper umbrella &#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there is none in the classroom umbrella stand&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite my confusion, Natsuno-san takes her bag and walks out of the classroom door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t even look at the umbrella stand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure if she has an umbrella somewhere that isn&#8217;t in the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, my plan has completely failed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gotta go now, Saino. See you tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A,aa, see you tomorrow&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After looking back one last time, Natsuno-san disappeared into the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked away in dismay at the sight of her&#8230;but soon decided to follow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My plan is certainly a failure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If she put her umbrella somewhere else, I should figure it out where it is&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Fate Intertwined Umbrella] will have a chance to be used every time it rains in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus it’s normal for me to know where Natsuno-san&#8217;s umbrella is.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stealthily follow Natsuno-san&#8217;s small back figure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She went down the stairs to the ground floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san walked towards the shoe box as it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello again, Maya. Sorry for making you wait.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe, it&#8217;s fine, it&#8217;s fine~. I&#8217;m always being taken care of by Hiyori”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person who exchanges words with Natsuno-san is the calm, glamorous and beautiful girl, Akitsu-san.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I see, so that&#8217;s why&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I look closely, there is a large umbrella in Akitsu-san&#8217;s hand. Everything made sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the two of them had planned to leave under a shared umbrella.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that one of them had realised that the other had forgotten his umbrella and had made a promise to each other as a solution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rain was so strong that they might get a little wet, but the two petite girls would probably be able to fit under the umbrella together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was aiming for a shared umbrella too, but Natsuno-san already had a prior engagement.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Unlucky&#8230;..this makes it impossible for us to go home together under my umbrella. I guess I&#8217;ll have to give up today&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out the umbrella from my bag and looked at it with a sense of disappointment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Fate Intertwined Umbrella] was easy to use, but this one seems to be very difficult to use.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not every day that I can even ask a girl to join me in a shared umbrella in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For an adolescent man, the hurdle is clearly too high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh and changed my shoes at the shoe locker to go home alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I open my umbrella at the gate and──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Aa♪”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a voice beside me rises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered what was going on and looked in that direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There they are, Natsuno-san and Akitsu-san, who were apparently still having some kind of conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at her face, Akitsu-san was looking at me with a happy expression as if she had thought of something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s see&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.What&#8217;s wrong, Maya?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san asks Akitsu-san about her intentions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san then laughed and opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiyori, since we&#8217;re here, how about you share an umbrella with Saino! For now, there’s no one around to see us and it&#8217;s not often you get a chance like this♪”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ee,eeee??”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sudden proposal popped out of Akitsu&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san looks puzzled by this and glances at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..I was surprised as well.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why did Akitsu-san suddenly give that suggestion?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, it&#8217;s too good to be true&#8230;but I have no idea what Akitsu-san is thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what kind of thinking led her to the idea of sharing my umbrella with Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, look, for the time being, Hiyori will be under Saino&#8217;s umbrella until the convenience store along the way. From there we&#8217;ll switch.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa,wait Maya…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe~♡”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san smiled faintly, opened her own umbrella and went outside alone.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shee then urged us, saying something like [Come on, you two～♪]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Shall we go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;.okay. Sorry, Maya started saying weird things&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha&#8230;must be tough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a wry smile, I open the [Fate Intertwined Umbrella] and make some space for Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san apologetically, while blushing a little bit, came to stand next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, you make a perfect couple…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;..Mouu, this girl sometimes starts doing weird things &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san, laughing happily and Natsuno-san, exhaling a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled vaguely at the two of them like that, while my heart secretly raced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what happened, but we succeeded in sharing an umbrella anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All that remains is for us to go home together for as long as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How effective will it be and what will happen to the relationship between the two of us?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was careful not to get Natsuno-san wet from the rain, while my heart was filled with anticipation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, you&#8217;re both so stiff! You need to be more lovey-dovey!　look at you guys, there&#8217;s nothing going on&#8230;♪”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s after school and it’s raining.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While me and Natsuno-san are sharing an umbrella, Akitsu-san, who is holding an umbrella by herself, is making a lot of noise, as if she&#8217;s having fun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankly, it&#8217;s a bit annoying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, it is quite unexpected that Akitsu-san, who is always so calm and poised, would show this kind of appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My attempt to use the [Fate Intertwined Umbrella] seems to have failed, but a twist of fate, it succeeds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ended up going home under a shared umbrella with Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, according to Akitsu-san, she will switch with Natsuno-san after we arrive at a convenience store along the way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how much the effect changes with the time of use, but it was the perfect chance to develop romantic feelings for both Natsuno-san and Akitsu-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the first time Saino has seen&#8230;Maya like this, right?”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, how should I say&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s odd.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right?　She’s usually absent-minded, but as soon as she finds something interesting, she gets really hyped up. It&#8217;s like a switch in her is flipped.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san sighs with a tired look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, no malice can be detected in her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That aspect of Akitsu-san&#8217;s life was also perhaps viewed rather favourably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, because when something sounds fun, you have to enjoy it as much as you can. Besides, I&#8217;m not bothering anyone, am I?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.I feel like you&#8217;re bothering me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, no, it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like Saino.　It&#8217;s just that &#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ve never been under an umbrella with a boy before&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san is making excuses and is a little fidgety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike her usual tsun-tsun attitude, her appearance is demure and cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can also sense a kind of reserve towards me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is this the effect of&#8230;..[Fate Intertwined Umbrella]?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s only been about five minutes since we left the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Natsuno-san&#8217;s attitude is clearly different from usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under normal circumstances, she wouldn&#8217;t have blushed her cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it&#8217;s annoying for Saino too, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;..? You&#8217;ve been forced to go home together like this&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s not like that. I wanted to talk to you both properly at least once.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I–is that so&#8230;.? Well, we&#8217;re classmates and communication is important&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.??”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san reacts a little sensitive to my casual words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san tilted her head cutely at the sight of her best friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, from Akitsu-san&#8217;s point of view, there seems to be something wrong with Natsuno-san right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue the conversation, inwardly shouting a joyous shout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, I feel it’s more than enough before stopping at the convenience store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And if it works so well in such a short time, it seems that it would be equally easy to capture it with Akitsu-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..As we continued walking and talking, Natsuno&#8217;s attitude slowly changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One minute she puts distance from me and the next minute she’s so close that our shoulders touch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes were glancing restlessly at me and I could see that she was losing her composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san sometimes joined in the conversation, but left the flow almost entirely to me and Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san is steadily falling in love with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wait for the right moment throw out a decisive topic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Come to think of it, Natsuno-san, do you have someone you&#8217;re dating?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ !! No, I don&#8217;t, but&#8230;&#8230;what about it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just that Natsuno-san is cute and it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if you had a boyfriend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a little nervous when I involuntarily called her 『cute』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san has a cute appearance, but she has a terrible dislike of being called 『cute』 by others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So normally she would glare at that person and in some cases,she wouldn&#8217;t even talk to them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『cute』 is an NG word for Natsuno-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Not Good) (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">放送用語</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> NG. if you to know about why it&#8217;s called ‘NG’)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..But apparently that is not the case for her now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment Natsuno-san heard my words, she blushed as if she had exploded──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ah tha, that’s not t,truee…..I, I c..can’t bec…c…cuute …there’s just no way”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Wow. Something really interesting is going on here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Natsuno-san turning bashful and trying to shy away, Akitsu-san looked at us with much interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san does not have the usual tsuntsun attitude, and her appearance is like that of a naive maiden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this what is known as &#8216;dere&#8217;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gap between her usual self and the way she is now was making my heart beat fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;&#8230;! What&#8217;s wrong with me&#8230;.!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san hides her face with her hands and moans cutely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The effect of the [Fate Intertwined Umbrella] was obvious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san was caught up in the magic of this umbrella and developed a love for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took about 15 minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Creating this situation was hard work, but the actual use of the umbrella was all too easy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Oh,we’re already arrived at the convenience store.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Akitsu-san raises her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking ahead, sure enough, right there is a green, red and orange sign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t realise it because I was so engrossed in the conversation, but it seems we&#8217;ve already walked quite a long way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let&#8217;s go in once and switch.”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright～.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh &#8230;&#8230; um, yeah &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I suggested this, I received two different reactions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san is still in her usual calm self, but Natsuno-san seems quite reluctant to leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We went straight into the eaves of the convenience store, quickly switching and resumed our walk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, Natsuno-san was alone and Akitsu-san and I were sharing an umbrella.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehe, now I&#8217;ve become Saino-kun&#8217;s girlfriend~♡”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, ouu&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment we were under the umbrella together, Akitsu-san hugged my arm and attached herself to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to reply, but as expected I was quite surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san didn&#8217;t seem to like that and glared at me with a jealous look, but I couldn&#8217;t do anything in particular about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no choice but to walk on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Is Saino-kun the reincarnation of a legendary host or something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Eh?”　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san secretly whispers to me at a volume that Natsuno-san cannot hear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to listen to all of it, despite the tickling in my ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san turns her straight gaze on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of magic trick did you use on Hiyori?　I couldn&#8217;t tell at all from the position I was walking.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“……！”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san sounds very cold, without a shred of her usual calm,funny atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I involuntarily turned my eyes to her face, her eyes had a very serious glare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The friendly smile that is always on her face is nowhere to be found.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is she angry?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; No, it’s different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can feel in her voice and expression is a 『pure intellectual curiosity』 like a &#8230;&#8230; researcher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The desire to know comes across as frighteningly straightforward.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘W–what&#8230;&#8230;?　Is this really the true face of Akitsu-san&#8230;.?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sudden change of expression is very confusing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san&#8217;s behaviour is just odd.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s understandable that a person can get excited when they find something interesting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this attitude now is clearly too different from her normal appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san is sulking and moving forward at a steady pace, so she doesn&#8217;t realise that something is wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akitsu-san seems to know this and is showing this face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.I didn&#8217;t do anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, I spit out some vague answers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Akitsu-san brought her face even closer and stared at me at a breathtaking distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could you tell me without being pretentious?　Of course I&#8217;ll keep your secret and I won&#8217;t act to the detriment of Saino-kun. I&#8217;m genuinely just curious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no sense of Akitsu-san lying in her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I am still hesitant to confess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she were to find out about the dungeon and the magic tools here, I don&#8217;t know what kind of impact it would have on me in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To me, who remained quiet, Akitsu-san pressed her glamorous body against me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, tell me. If you tell me, I&#8217;ll let you touch my body just a little bit&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a tempting offer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know there were no lies in her words, and I could tell that she meant what she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But inwardly, I was thinking about something else.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is&#8230;.probably the effect of the [Fate Intertwined Umbrella] on Akitsu-san&#8230;..!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A colourful trickery is not something that a girl of her age would do, no matter how much she wants to know the truth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is possible that Akitsu-san&#8217;s sense of chastity is low, but it is clearly not right for her to offer her body so quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Akitsu-san herself soon became aware of this anomaly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I see. I am also becoming a little strange. I think my desire to be touched is stronger than my desire to know your secret.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t have these feelings just now, and I&#8217;m wondering if this current situation has somehow conditioned me, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m changing my mind? Could the trick be&#8230;.a pheromone that only works at close range?　No, but for that &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite my silence, Akitsu-san develops her theory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked a little faster, inwardly breaking out in a cold sweat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as possible, I should leave Akitsu-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they are under the umbrella together for a long time, their romantic feelings should be stronger for that long, but this is not the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she is under the umbrella for a long time, her romantic feelings should be stronger but it would backfire on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I don&#8217;t answer her question, the movement of my eyes and my attitude will tell her the truth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a high possibility that Akitsu-san will reveal my secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; But as I continued to walk faster, Akitsu-san eventually relaxed her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehe, we have arrived at my house～! My lovemaking time with Saino-kun is already over.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuu&#8230;..Maya&#8217;s playtime has come to an end, hasn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m so tired”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I make the same carefree smile that I usually show.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san finally turned around, looked at us and let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, their houses are next to each other, with Natsuno-san&#8217;s on the left and Akitsu&#8217;s on the right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both are ordinary houses with nothing out of the ordinary about them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went with them to the front door, where we said our goodbyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S–see you, again Saino,&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll see you later~, Saino&#8230;♪”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Aaa, I’ll see you guys tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was still worried about the gap between me and Akitsu-san earlier, but I pretended to be unconcerned and replied back.</span></p>
