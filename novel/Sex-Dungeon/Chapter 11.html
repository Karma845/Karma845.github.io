<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Sleepover Tickets and Summer</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After obtaining the [Hourglass of Stagnation], I quickly returned home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The items on the third floor are now complete.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I wanted to continue my exploration, the next step would be the fourth floor but that would be too hasty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that I could raise my Lv level with the items at hand and it would be better to proceed after I had become strong enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi sensei was also absent, which was discouraging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s how the exploration ended on Sunday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m figuring out what to do with my newly acquired items, ate some food, did a bit of studying and then went to bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;And then a new week dawned, Monday morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got ready and went to school and walked through the classroom door as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because it was the beginning of the week, the chatter among my classmates was a little more lively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to some of my friends and then went to my seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Fuyushima-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. nn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I greeted Fuyushima-san, who had already arrived at school and sat down in my seat next to her.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Fuyushima-san just nodded curtly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is as cold as ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though we had been physical with each other so much, she was still expressionless, even towards me, the destined person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unintentionally, I am tempted to suspect that the night was a dream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is impossible for such a vivid memory to be a dream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hooked my bag to the side of the desk and spoke to Fuyushima-san in a whisper so that the other students could not hear me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The other day, thank you for letting me stay over. I&#8217;m sorry for causing you so much trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. It&#8217;s nothing to be apologetic about.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san shakes her head without changing her expression in response to my bowing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Special Sleepover Ticket] has the effect of making her think that sleeping with me is a normal thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of a dungeon item&#8230;..it has wonderful effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, I did not only stay over, I even took her virginity and it&#8217;s a bit unusual that even that is considered normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But well, it&#8217;s very gratifying for me that she thinks sex is nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Convinced of my success, I decided to propose the next act to Fuyushima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, can I come over again next time?　As long as you don&#8217;t mind, of course&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;。&#8230;..Sure, but I want to go to bed early on weekdays.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nice, she still hasn&#8217;t rejected it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;ve put a few conditions on it, but 『I want to go to bed early』 probably means 『I don&#8217;t want to fuck until midnight like we did the other night』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, she accepts the idea of getting laid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still seem to be recognised by Fuyushima-san as her『Predestined Person』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded my head, shouting inwardly with pleasure and pretended to be unconcerned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I&#8217;ll try to go out on weekends as much as possible. Then there&#8217;s no problem, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..un.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, it&#8217;s a promise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I confirm that Fuyushima-san has agreed and smiled, hiding my filthy desires.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a fresh smile that doesn&#8217;t reveal any such condescension, although it is inwardly a vile feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason Fuyushima-san allows me to use her body is because I am the 『Predestined Person』 and if I show too much vileness, she might suspect that I am not really that person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to do erotic things while behaving in a fresh, princely manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san nodded at my smile, still expressionless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t see any particular bad feelings coming from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that my acting was successful.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Okay, that&#8217;s settled for Fuyushima-san, I wonder how &#8230;&#8230;Natsuno-san is feeling. It seems she hasn&#8217;t come to the classroom yet&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shift my gaze from Fuyushima-san to the centre of the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s seat is empty and Akitsu-san, who sits next to her, is also missing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though homeroom time is reasonably close, it seems that they have not yet arrived at school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those two are always supposed to come early&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just when I was getting worried, the classroom door rattled open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, Hiyori~! Let&#8217;s get ready for this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mu, impossible! I can&#8217;t, so don&#8217;t pull me &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mooooo, your uniform is going to get stretched out!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two familiar voices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the two people I was worried about just showed up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;However, they are not easily seen through the open door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the voices, it seems that they are struggling over whether to enter or not enter the classroom.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Natsuno-san, it seems you still haven&#8217;t recovered from the shock of the dream&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the classroom, which is a little buzzing at the sound of the two voices, I alone let out a sigh of disappointment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why Natsuno-san can&#8217;t enter the classroom is definitely because she doesn&#8217;t want to see me.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dream that I showed her in [Nightmare Inducing Bell] is still tormenting Natsuno-san, apparently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, perhaps defeated by the difference in physique, Natsuno-san was eventually dragged into the classroom by Akitsu-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san looks at me and quickly turns her face away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ooo, her ears are so red that it&#8217;s interesting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t see her expression, but I can easily imagine that her eyes are tightly closed in shame.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this condition, it would be very impossible to concentrate on the class.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘hmmm&#8230;..I&#8217;m going to have to take some action’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think about it a bit and then get up from my seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Too much embarrassment is not gonna do good for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she keeps too much distance from me, I can&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;do anything erotic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very least, I should be able to alleviate her embarrassment so that she is comfortable being alone with me.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I approach the two of them, I simulate in my mind the conversation we are going to have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I got close enough, I spoke to them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Natsuno-san and Akitsu-san. You&#8217;re both late today.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Saino-kun, good morning~!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them are Natsuno-san, who bounces her body as much as she can, and Akitsu-san, who greets me with a sweet happy voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is hard to tell because her back is turned, but Natsuno-san seems to have unintentionally covered her face with her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Akitsu-san poked at Natsuno-san&#8217;s back as if she was trying to get her to like it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, Hiyori, you have to reply properly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;&#8230;go, good morning, Saino&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At her best friend&#8217;s urging, Natsuno-san turns away, but manages to take her hand away from her face and return the greeting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, as long as I don&#8217;t see her face, we can have a conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Saturday, she was screaming just hearing my voice on the intercom, so she seems to have recovered a lot better than that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this is still not enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly went round to Natsuno-san&#8217;s front and looked into her face, making a worried expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san, are you all right? Your face is kind of red.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“~~!　It&#8217;s nothing!　It has nothing to do with Saino!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Well, if you have any problems, let me know. If you need advice, I&#8217;m always here for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san immediately turns her face away.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I ignored the overreaction and dared to throw a plaintive voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an unspoken appeal that I was completely unaware of Natsuno-san&#8217;s fondness for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know much about treating women, but if I treat her like this, Natsuno-san might regain her composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it seems that my aim was, to a certain extent, on target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Natsuno-san realised that she was the only one getting excited, but after a short silence, she slowly turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, that&#8217;s right. &#8230;&#8230; th, thank you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san thanks me, revealing her face as red as a boiled octopus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, she&#8217;s cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is fiddling with her own hair, perhaps to hide her embarrassment, which is very new of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even her minimalist body looks even smaller now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave Natsuno-san a gentle smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. But in return, I&#8217;ll consult with you when I&#8217;m in trouble. I&#8217;ll be happy for your help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!&#8230;&#8230;Un, yes! I&#8217;ll take care of it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san blushes but looks up and nods vigorously at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;she looks really happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seems to have forgotten her embarrassment, but is she really that excited about being able to rely on me?</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t think she would be this happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as I had hoped, her sense of shyness seems to have subsided considerably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know her love for me is still strong, but she should have no problem at least having a conversation with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She might even be able to tolerate being alone with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel relieved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But to my relief, a cold gaze was staring at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, that person is &#8230;&#8230; Akitsu-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spoke to Akitsu-san as if to deceive her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, Akitsu-san, if there&#8217;s anything you want to discuss with me, please let me know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;ahaha, that&#8217;s right~♪ call me up and we’ll talk about it more and more♡”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha,haha&#8230;..please be easy on me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I manage to reply to Akitsu-san&#8217;s words, which clearly indicate that I am in danger, with my face scrunched up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Akitsu-san, I am a research subject and a person who is after her best friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a little worried that she might take extreme measures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at least Akitsu-san doesn&#8217;t reveal her true nature in front of Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this moment, I can say that I am safe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We disperse and go to our seats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few minutes later, the opening chime rang out and the classroom door rattled open at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is not wearing a jersey but is dressed in a fashionable outfit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ho, homeroom is about to start!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei calls out to the students in a slightly hoarse voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she&#8217;s not feeling well because she&#8217;s too conscious of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only Natsuno-san, but Sensei is also quite innocent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, her voice is still coming out properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After one night, she seems to have been able to forget about the blowjob for a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei goes on and takes attendance and then passes on a few communications.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Yeah, nothing seems to be particularly relevant to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s easy to move around.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well&#8230;&#8230;then, let&#8217;s get moving today to get some lvl up&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I watch Sensei leaving the classroom after finishing her call, I’ve changed my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The four people I had targeted &#8211; Harumachi-sensei, Natsuno-san, Akitsu-san and Fuyushima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was able to develop a good relationship with all of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, only two of them, Harumachi-sensei and Fuyushima-san, were able to go on to the main stage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the remaining two&#8230;..Natsuno-san and Akitsu-san, I am still only sexually harassing them one-sidedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is time to take a new step forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I&#8217;ve got the tools for that in my bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Special Sleepover Ticket], [Supreme Erotic Book] and [Lucky Band].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person I&#8217;m going to use it on is Natsuno-san, the little chairman who is in love with&#8230;..me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s homeroom ended without incident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a ten-minute break, the first period classes began.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first subject was mathematics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While taking notes on the explanations written on the blackboard, I occasionally glanced towards Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body is as small as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because she is unaware that I am watching her, she does not seem to be embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seems to be concentrating on her lessons.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;d be lucky if she went to the toilet&#8230;&#8230;.Well, it&#8217;s not gonna be that easy.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is not the slightest sense that Natsuno-san is holding back her urge to urinate or have a bowel movement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a bit disappointing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she had raised her hand and left the classroom alone, I could have immediately followed her and given her a [Special Sleepover Ticket].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, today&#8217;s class has only just started.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I patiently wait for my chance, I will eventually get a better one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;d like to give her the [Special Sleepover Ticket] as quietly as possible without other people knowing but in the worst case scenario, I could give it to her in public.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Special Sleepover Ticket] has the effect of making people realise that sleeping on a futon together is normal, so it shouldn&#8217;t seem strange if anyone sees us together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only thing I&#8217;m worried about is how Akitsu-san will react.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though sleeping together is normal, Akitsu-san is trying to protect Natsuno-san from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what kind of action she will take.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to avoid danger, handing it over in front of Akitsu-san should really be a last resort.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..for now, I should focus on my classes too. Midterms are coming up, and I should be able to do some of it just in class, as the dungeon exploration will take up a lot of my time &#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stop pondering at the situation and return my gaze to the blackboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, I can understand Sensei&#8217;s explanations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, I can just do a light revision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hastily copy the board while listening to the explanation then run my eyes over the textbook as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The&#8230;..mathematics class passed without incident.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chance finally came during the break before the fourth period.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was when all the students started to move to the computer room for the next subject, 『Information』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa&#8230;.. sorry Maya, go ahead.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As classmates leave the classroom one after another, Natsuno-san suddenly tells Akitsu-san so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice sounded as if she had remembered something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, who had been watching her from the start, involuntarily jumped my body at that remark.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“??? What&#8217;s wrong, Hiyori?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The key to the computer room. As I recall, Sensei is busy today and asked me to get it for her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa～,Come to think of it, she did ask you to do that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think Sensei told Natsuno-san something like that during class last Friday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had completely forgotten about it, but Natsuno-san seemed to have remembered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san left the classroom with Akitsu-san, where she parted ways and headed towards the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The key is in the teacher&#8217;s room, so she must be planning to go down to the ground floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Needless to say, I followed Natsuno-san with a [Special Sleepover Ticket] in my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Natsuno-san!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeh?&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I caught up with her halfway up the stairs and called out to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san, I wanted to give you this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..?　Um&#8230;&#8230;what’s this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san tilts her head curiously, not understanding the identity of what was offered to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a natural reaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The &#8220;[Special Sleepover Ticket] has only a large heart mark drawn on it, so there is no way to tell what it is just from a quick glance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I don&#8217;t have to explain what it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feigned calmness and answered Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..for now, try to take a look behind it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The back side?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san follows my words, takes the [Special Sleepover Ticket] and looks at the back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Okay, the strategy worked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that if I said it like this, she would accept it easily and it seems that my plan was correct.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, of course, there is nothing special on the back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s just an excuse to hand it over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. It doesn&#8217;t say anything, but &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, well, yeah&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m going to change the subject, but can I sleep with you tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“eeh&#8230;&#8230;?　Umm, yeah, that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;um, yes, good, but &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A surprisingly sudden and unnatural change of topic.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response, however, Natsuno-san nodded cockily while blushing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although there is a hint of embarrassment on her face, there is no sense that she feels strange about sleeping together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the [Special Sleepover Ticket] worked properly this time as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouted pleasantries in my heart and continued to say, </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I&#8217;ll go to Natsuno-san&#8217;s house tonight. I&#8217;ll bring towels and toothpaste, so you don&#8217;t need to prepare anything in particular. I don&#8217;t even think I&#8217;ll need supper.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O,okay….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my words, Natsuno-san nods honestly without question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t think anything special when we are going to sleep together, so she seems to be able to have this kind of conversation normally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just to be sure, I&#8217;ll also nail her.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Also, please keep the fact that I&#8217;m staying at your house a secret from other people as much as possible. It would be troublesome if anyone hears strange rumours. Of course, don&#8217;t tell Akitsu-san either.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm, yes&#8230;.that&#8217;s right&#8230;..we don&#8217;t want to be misunderstood&#8230;right&#8230;..?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Natsuno-san nodded with a slightly hurt expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Perhaps the way she understood  『Troublesome if rumoured』 as『I don&#8217;t want to be seen as having that kind of relationship with Natsuno-san?』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for me, I didn&#8217;t mean it that way, but it seems that a girl in love can be damaged by such casual words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s lovely, but also a bit cumbersome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I dared to end the conversation without correcting the mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We&#8217;re going to have sex tonight anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I whispered something like [I love you], I could easily erase Natsuno-san&#8217;s uneasiness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then tonight. That&#8217;s a promise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un,uun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smile at the end and part ways with Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, it is confirmed that we will sleep together tonight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I just need to make good use of the [Supreme Erotic Book] and the [Lucky Band] and we should be able to get to the point of sex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“～～♪”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help humming a tune.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My head is completely pink and I fantasise about the lasciviousness of Natsuno-san that I will see tonight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve seen her breasts and secret places by using the [Nightmare Inducing Bell], but this time I can make love to her without worrying about the time restriction and I can enjoy Natsuno-san&#8217;s reaction too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just imagining it makes my crotch a little itchy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went back to the classroom and headed for the computer room with my luggage in a good mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Classes ended quickly and uneventfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately headed for the staff room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me. Um, Harumachi-sensei, are you there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!! Sa, Saino!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi sensei reacts with a jolt when I enter through the entrance and calls out to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a very obvious reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teachers who work with her are also looking at Harumachi sensei in a suspicious manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmmm&#8230;..maybe I shouldn&#8217;t come here too much after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei is always embarrassed, so there is a possibility that other teachers will soon find out about our relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to leave too much evidence, but should I use my smartphone to keep in touch with her in the future?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But since I’m here today, I’ll just tell her what I want to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approached Sensei and spoke to her in a quiet voice so that the others could not hear me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, you don&#8217;t have to come to my house today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Eeh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei looks surprised when she hears my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has stopped moving and her mouth is half open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;?　Sensei?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I received no response, so I called out to her again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Sensei does not move as it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if she had turned to stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But as I waited, I soon realised something was wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tear drops began to form at the edges of her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Sensei, I&#8217;m not going to explore today, which means you don&#8217;t have to come. It doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t want you anymore or anything. And I’m not mad or disappointed that Sensei left yesterday.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensing danger, I hurriedly made a follow up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Sensei thought she had been abandoned or something like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a negative and a naive thought, but&#8230; since it&#8217;s a Sensei who&#8217;s more of a maiden than a girl of her age, the possibility is high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san was the same, but Sensei also seems to be troublesome in these places.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it seems that the guess was right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my words, Sensei quickly wiped her eyes and looked up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“tha,that&#8217;s right. I don&#8217;t mind at all, either, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa……”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi sensei smiles awkwardly, a complete change from her earlier expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she wants to cover up the fact that she was about to cry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little taken aback but since I had finished talking about my business for the time being, I decided to leave the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today&#8217;s main dish is Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I need to get home as soon as possible and be prepared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, that&#8217;s the way it is, so I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O,Ouu. See you later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi sensei replies, unaware of my inner feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my back and left the staff room without any further problem, heading home at a brisk pace.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">PinPon…….</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">8 pm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The intercom at Natsuno-san&#8217;s house emits exactly the same electronic beeps as when I heard it before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sun has completely set and the area is completely dark.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, the gate light is not on, so the only light I can rely on is the street lamp on the road a little further away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that it is difficult for Akitsu-san to find me is good but the darkness instinctively makes me feel a little uneasy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m scared, but it&#8217;s kind of eerie.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;she’s not coming out easily…..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I waited for a response but after a minute or so no one answered the intercom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if her whole family had gone out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I certainly promised to her during the day that I would stay over and she must know I&#8217;m coming&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just as I was starting to think about contacting her on my smartphone, I heard a clunk on the intercom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, someone answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, um, this is Saino&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?? Um&#8230;..?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said my name, but the person on the intercom remained silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person on the other side should be able to hear me but there is no response.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. I&#8217;m Saino, Natsuno-san&#8217;s classmate. She promised to let me stay over tonight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking that perhaps Natsuno-san hadn&#8217;t told her family, I tried to tell them exactly what we agreed about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was still no response from the intercom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmmm&#8230;Is it possible that it was Natsuno-san who answered and she is unable to speak because of the preparation she did during the day?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, then I am right on target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she is in a heightened mood thanks to that thing, I can easily have sex with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;So, during the day, I not only gave Natsuno-san a [Special Sleepover Ticket], but I also planted other items on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That item is a [Supreme Erotic Book].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That book, which projects the desires of the reader, may have worked very well, judging from the way things are going.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened my mouth again, inwardly feeling sorry for myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, let&#8217;s say call out to her one more time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It, it&#8217;s unlocked.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a lovely voice returns from the intercom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice is a little trembling, but it is definitely Natsuno-san&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that my earlier prediction was right after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“..I see. Well then,pardon me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ojamashimasu]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied and put my hand on the door without hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not going to be shy about it, I&#8217;m going to go straight for the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“pardon me- &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While opening the front door, I call out once more towards the inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;There&#8217;s some kind of unnatural lack of human presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are no lights on at all and not a single voice can&#8217;t be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Natsuno-san&#8217;s parents are staying out today?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then, I heard footsteps thumping.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is this the sound of someone going up the&#8230;&#8230; stairs?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m guessing that Natsuno-san has gone upstairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I switched on the light and followed the footsteps up the stairs while calling out to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart naturally began to beat in anticipation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although she doesn&#8217;t show it, Natsuno-san is clearly more embarrassed than she was during the day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to the plan I set up, her attitude towards me has completely changed again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this feeling, there&#8217;s no need for any unnecessary games.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment we get into the futon together, I will be able to decide the game at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually I reached the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I observe the corridor and see a cute name plate saying 『Hiyori』 on the door right next to the staircase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san, I’m coming in….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knocked on the door and raised my voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;There was no reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite some hesitation, I put my hand on the doorknob and slowly opened the door.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..It&#8217;s dark. &#8230;..’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was pitch black in the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could barely make out what was going on inside with the light coming in from the corridor but Natsuno-san was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the bed had a small mountain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I close the door, put down the luggage I brought with me and then quietly approach the bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no light but there were no obstacles, so I just walked straight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked straight to the bed and slowly got under the covers myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I got completely under the covers and called her name, what replied me was a small jerk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I move my body even closer to her, enjoying the scent of soap that is wafting through the air densely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, I reached Natsuno-san&#8217;s petite body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I call her name once more and gently bring her body close to mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s body is surprisingly tiny.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is trembling slightly, perhaps from embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My erected pole is touching her body, but I couldn’t care any less.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she is aware of my desire, it will be easier to negotiate with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu……!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san moans, her body trembling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my mouth close to Natsuno-san&#8217;s ear and whispered to her, pretending not to understand anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong?　Are you that scared of sleeping with me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“uuu&#8230;&#8230;, because, that &#8230;&#8230;!Uuu&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, what is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu~!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I continue to pretend not to know, Natsuno-san rolls her body and makes an embarrassed noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I did not say anything and waited patiently for Natsuno-san&#8217;s words to continue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl writhing in shame is a bit of fun to watch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know the whole truth but I&#8217;ll let Natsuno-san tell it to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san continues to moan for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But eventually, as if gathering up her courage, she opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sa&#8230;..Saino, you like to forcefully assault girls, don&#8217;t you&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!! &#8230;..why did you think that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because&#8230;..I saw it&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You saw it?  Saw what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230; bo,book. It was in my bag&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E,Eeeehh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pretend to be surprised, but inwardly I exclaim with pleasure.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered what conclusion that she would come up with, 『forcibly assaulting a girl&#8230;&#8230;!』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Natsuno-san has an outrageous desire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following the&#8230;&#8230;[Special Sleepover Ticket], the second item I set up, the [Supreme Erotic Book].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its use was extremely simple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the break before fourth period, after I gave her a [Special Sleepover Ticket], I returned to the classroom and&#8230;&#8230;secretly put the [Supreme Erotic Book] into Natsuno-san&#8217;s bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s really all I did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, just by doing that, Natsuno-san&#8217;s attitude changed drastically and I was able to learn about her hidden proclivities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could have appealed to her that 『I have the same desire as Natsuno-san』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is probably the correct use of the 『supreme erotic book』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of reading the [Supreme Erotic Book] by myself, Ican make full use of that ability by having a girl read it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I can write my name on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;However, it is honestly very surprising that Natsuno-san had rape fantasies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although she&#8217;s a maiden in front of me, Natsuno-san is basically a strong type.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She hates being called『cute』 and won&#8217;t talk to anyone who says that word to her for a week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the boys in our class are afraid of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never imagined&#8230;&#8230;that such girl would want to be forcibly raped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S,sorry…Maybe a friend who lent it to me put it in Natsuno-san&#8217;s bag as a joke! I&#8217;m really sorry I showed you something weird!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I act upset and apologise flatly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Showing her a pornographic book is essentially the worst kind of sexual harassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be natural for her to dislike it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this is not the case when it comes to [Supreme Erotic Book].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What Natsuno-san saw was her own desire and as a result, she discovered that 『the person I love has the best match in terms of sexual desire』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her love for me, far from weakening, must have conversely strengthened.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san does not reply to my apology.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably doesn&#8217;t know how to reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she is not sure if she should be brave enough to say, [I like that kind of thing too].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But as far as I am concerned, she no longer needs to tell me that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I know she has a rape festish, I should be act like it from here on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she want to be forcibly raped, I will give her what she want.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..but Natsuno-san looks like the girl in that book. What can I say, I want to fuck her very&#8230;&#8230; roughly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san jumps up at my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, whispering something like this would make anyone react like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is certain that Natsuno-san has rape fantasies and her heart may be secretly fluttering at my current line.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I roughly fling off the duvet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I grabbed Natsuno-san by the shoulders, forced her to lie on her back and covered her up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sa,Saino…!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop fussing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My low voice threatens Natsuno-san who is perplexed by a sudden change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because it is pitch-dark, I can see nothing, but I understood by the sign of Natsuno-san gasping for air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up and let me fuck you. Don&#8217;t resist.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..! A….Aaa………!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san leaks out a frightened voice at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in her tone of voice, I also sense a somewhat ecstatic sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She may have understood that her desire is about to be fulfilled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I straddle Natsuno-san as if I&#8217;m riding a horse and roughly unbutton her pyjamas with my hands.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Natsuno-san still did not resist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, every time a button was unbuttoned, her body jumped with a jerk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tiny breasts, aren&#8217;t they?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N,nnnmmm!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While spitting words without kindness I rubbed her exposed breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No feeling of cloth. No bra.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she was expecting me to attack her and didn&#8217;t dare to wear one?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn!! Haaa….u!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I pinch her nipple and pull it hard, a sharp breath escapes from Natsuno-san&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What she is probably feeling is pain, not pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this kind of pain will give her the feeling of being 『violently raped』 .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I repeated the pull a few times, then I sat up and went to Natsuno&#8217;s feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is rape and there is no need to caress her carefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s try, touching her vagina appropriately to secrete the love juice and insert it immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forcefully pulled down her pyjama trousers and underwear as I pleased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san is stripped naked on the lower half of her body and her body trembles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did&#8230;..I just now take off her trousers strangely easily?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t see it because there was no light, but it seems that she lifted her waist to make it easier to take them off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, Natsuno-san seems to want this rape act in her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, nngh!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; And it&#8217;s flooding.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I touched her secret place, she was surprisingly wet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve had sex before with both Harumachi-sensei and Fuyushima-san, but I&#8217;ve never seen a girl be so covered in love juice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was probably wet with anticipation long before I came to visit her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or it could be that she was masturbating to the [Supreme Erotic Book].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren&#8217;t you ashamed to be so wet?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U!!,uuuu…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I verbally accuse her, Natsuno moans in embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the muffled sound of her voice, it seems that she has covered her face with her hands.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well,if she is like this…there’s no need for foreplay&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think so, and hastily remove my own trousers and underwear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I forced Natsuno-san&#8217;s legs open and sat in the space between them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My rod is in a state of warfare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was soaring hard to the maximum in order to take Natsuno-san&#8217;s virginity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa……”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san senses its presence and makes a huffing sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, she did not resist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, she seemed to be fidgeting with anticipation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little relieved by that state of mind and let my penis touch her secret place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was dark and I couldn&#8217;t see anything but I had experienced sex quite a few times, so I knew the entrance to the vagina by feel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I continue to move forward, the head and then the entire penis will fit inside.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;good.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Determined, I slowly pushed my hips in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this, Natsuno-san is mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We&#8217;re not just classmates, we&#8217;re going to have a special relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And once this line is crossed, the next time we have sex, it will be easier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Natsuno-san wouldn&#8217;t mind having that kind of relationship with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;However, contrary to this speculation, the insertion does not go very far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, my penis is poking at the vaginal entrance and I pushed my hips hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But a tremendous repulsive force pushes my penis back.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Khh, it&#8217;s too tight &#8230;&#8230;! What&#8217;s this narrowness &#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The entrance to her vagina can certainly be felt at the tip of my penis, but no matter how much&#8230;&#8230;force I put into it, I can&#8217;t penetrate inside properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The entrance to Natsuno-san&#8217;s vagina is clearly too small compared to my penis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s body is quite small, so it seems that this place is also made proportionally smaller.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Re,relax…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U,Un&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The actual rape act was unintentionally interrupted and I asked Natsuno-san to do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s kind of a bit pathetic but it can&#8217;t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san has also relaxed a bit and insertion should be easier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I aim my rod at her vulva, where the resistance has weakened slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I pushed my hips in with all my might, as I put my weight on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn,aaaaAAA!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling of my penis invading the tight, warm flesh, all at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san screams loudly and wriggles in pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our bodies are snugly together and I can feel Natsuno-san firmly, all the way to the root.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-720x1024.png"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a struggle, but insertion was complete.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘However&#8230; Natsuno-san&#8217;s vagina is too tight!!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling of Natsuno-san&#8217;s vagina is different from either of the two people I have had sex with so far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san’s vagina was also tight but Natsuno-san&#8217;s tightness far surpasses her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is the sensation similar to being held tightly by hand?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her vagina was so tight and the entrance so small that I am not sure if I could really move in and out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I cannot just sit still.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly started to make small movements so that her vagina could get used to my penis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mn,fuuu,Nnnnn…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san lets out an upwardly choked exhalation in time with my movements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tone of her voice gives the impression that she is in agony rather than in pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s only natural, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is natural to suffer when her vagina is forcibly spread open with a penis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It will probably take some time to get used to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaah, ah, nn, nn&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue to rock my hips slowly and unhurriedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, thanks to the strong tightness, even a slight movement gives a great deal of pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will never get bored of it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Although, somehow, it doesn&#8217;t feel like rape at all&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A gentle sex, with Natsuno-san in mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This kind of hip action, a rapist would never do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel a little uneasy about whether I can satisfy Natsuno-san&#8217;s rape desire with this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, judging from the tone of her voice, Natsuno-san is doing her best to endure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, for today, she doesn&#8217;t seem to want me to make it more intense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, uu, haa……! Hnnn,aah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Little by little, Natsuno-san&#8217;s voice became somehow sexier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed that my penis had also become much easier to move inside the vagina.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Has her vagina finally become familiar with my flesh?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me know if you&#8217;re in pain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N! Un…..! haa,aau,n…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a word of confirmation from Natsuno-san, I gradually increased the movement in and out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I carefully and deliberately spread the inside of her hole little by little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue to carefully move back and forth inside the vagina so that it becomes a comfortable hole for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“a, hmm &#8230;&#8230; hmm,nn, ah &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san leaks out a lusty voice while receiving my hip movement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tone of her voice suggests that perhaps the pleasure is gradually outweighing the pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seems to be getting accustomed to it and is steadily awakening to the female pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t see her face because of the darkness but her expression may be distorted in distress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;but I&#8217;m still working on getting her vagina used to the rod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m in no hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I persevere, I should be able to get Natsuno-san completely and exactly where I want her to be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would definitely feel better to ejaculate after achieving that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Maybe I&#8217;m becoming quite a bit more of a man myself&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While continuing to ejaculate, I recall the sexual acts I have experienced so far.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My lvl, which was zero at first, is now about to reach 18.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eighteen times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I do that much erotic stuff with girls, I would certainly increase the amount of courage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaah, ah, ah, nn, ah&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not knowing that I am so familiar with her secret place, Natsuno-san just continues to let out her charming voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her vagina is steadily getting better and I can feel it sucking on my pole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her tightness is still strong but she gradually adapted to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to carefully develop Natsuno-san&#8217;s vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after continuing to do so until I was satisfied, I finally decided to ejaculate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, ah, ah, ah, nn, ah&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san raises a confused gasp at the clearly more intense movement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she soon seems to realise my intentions, and while accepting the extraction, she only shouts a single word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ah, nn, hah! Today, it&#8217;s all right! Ah, ah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t even have to think about what&#8217;s okay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I move my hips furiously with the 『permission to cum inside』 that came out of Natsuno-san&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rushed through the long penetration, which made me feel like I was going to release a lot of semen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can pour all of it into Natsuno-san&#8217;s womb, so it&#8217;s impossible not to get excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ah, nnuu, ah, nn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my all-out movement, Natsuno-san also gradually raises the tone of her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if this is also thanks to the time I spent on her firmly&#8230;&#8230;.Apparently, even though this is the first time she has been inserted, she is on her way to climax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite her small size, Natsuno may have some sexual predispositions, such as a tendency to get wet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Already, I&#8217;m getting it out&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nngh, ah, ah, ah! Let it out! Aaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her I was at my limit, Natsuno-san responded to that while raising her voice in impatience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forgot my rationality at that response and pushed myself to the limit by repeatedly slamming my hips into her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uoooo!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Doku! Doku! Doku! Doku!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment my penis is pushed to its deepest point, it releases its semen with great force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An overwhelming pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s vagina, which climaxed at the same time, tightened even more and drank up all the semen into her womb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let it all out as it was, while letting my brain melt with the sensation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have experienced cumming inside many times before, but it still feels great to have my reproductive instincts satisfied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although there is a possibility of pregnancy, pouring semen into the womb is still very special.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;But at that moment, when the sporadic emissions had calmed down, I noticed something strange about Natsuno-san&#8217;s behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was kind of&#8230;&#8230;strangely quiet and her body seemed &#8230;&#8230; to have no strength in it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately pulled my penis out of her secret place and groped around to turn on the light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..Wao”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I finally see Natsuno-san, my voice leaks out unintentionally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san is lying on the bed with her pyjamas bare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body was twitching and her eyes were lightly white.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately check her heart rate and other parameters to make sure she is not in danger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My parents have already taught me how to do the diagnostic procedure in these situations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adventurers often don&#8217;t have a hospital nearby, so they have to diagnose abnormalities themselves&#8230;&#8230;or something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never thought that knowledge would come in handy in a situation like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the diagnosis took only a few minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No risk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san is merely slightly unconscious&#8230;..in other words, it is considered to be in a state of mild fainting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..Yes, in short, this is the thing.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It felt so good that you fainted&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken aback and let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought fainting during sex was an urban legend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never thought that would happen to Natsuno-san, a virgin&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a little doubtful that she was really a virgin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, both my penis and Natsuno-san&#8217;s secret place still have the reddish colour of blood from her broken hymen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s earlier experience was definitely her first.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘………Natsuno-san might be a more naughty child than I imagined…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has a desire to rape, climaxed on her first experience and also fainted because it felt so good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I just look at the results, I would say it&#8217;s quite something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She may look young but her sexual maturity may be tremendous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, what happens now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fainting is still fainting, albeit mildly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She will wake up in a little while but she will have put a lot of strain on her body, so it might be better not to have any more sex tonight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she will be open to intercourse at any time in the future and I should end it this time and let her rest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa…….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh and picked up a tissue from the bedside table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, I&#8217;ll wipe her blood mixed with semen vagina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe the stimulation will wake her up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approach Natsuno-san and carefully clean up after her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels strange to clean the secret place of a girl who has lost consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this is kind of fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The freedom to look and touch is not so bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I continued, the clean-up was over in a relatively short time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And a few seconds later──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s body jumps and her eyelids finally open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she has regained consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning, Natsuno-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, ah&#8230;&#8230;Saino&#8230;&#8230;! Oh, ah, uh&#8230;&#8230;uuuu&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san gets up with vigour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had cleaned her, so she was wearing her pyjamas and there were no traces of sex anywhere, except for the semen in her womb.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Natsuno-san seemed to remember the act well, and she blushed quickly and moaned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is covering her own crotch with both hands&#8230;&#8230;perhaps she is more embarrassed to be seen there than her face?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a very cute and innocent gesture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I can&#8217;t just sit and admire her forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I was able to get her virginity, the pillow talk will be the most important thing for now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to somehow bring the relationship to the point where we can have sex in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is your body alright? You fainted so suddenly, I panicked a little.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm, yeah&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m fine. My body is a little bit heavy&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Then, I&#8217;m relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, I have to show I am worried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is definitely better to show that I am a caring person in order to have an ongoing physical relationship with Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s best that she thinks of me as someone she can entrust her body to with peace of mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue, smiling and reaching out my hand to Natsuno-san&#8217;s head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, while gently stroking her, I made a sweet voice and whispered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry I went too hard even though it&#8217;s your first time. Natsuno-san was so cute, I couldn&#8217;t stop myself. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aau&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san just turns red in the face, unable to reply to my gentle words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mm, that&#8217;s the reaction I was aiming for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Au…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san blushes even more and looks at me with moist eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is she embarrassed to have her body touched, or has she become aware of her secret place, or both?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Either way, I am sure she is restless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s an opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I whispered in an even sweeter voice to push Natsuno-san over the edge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It felt so good, Natsuno-san. It&#8217;s probably the first time in my life that I&#8217;ve felt this good. Thank you so much for letting me do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th,that so…that’s…good…y,your welcome…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…..How was it for you, Natsuno-san? Did it feel good to be attacked like in that book?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;! Th,That&#8217;s&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to my question, Natsuno-san chokes on her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t need to hear the answer, but it is still important to get Natsuno-san to say it clearly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we tell each other how good it felt, the distance between us will shrink even further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san remained tight-lipped for a while, but eventually&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, too, felt good&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san answers honestly while still being reserved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nice, that&#8217;s a good attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the content of her words, there is little shyness, and there is a definite lust in her eyes when she looks at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled gently and lay down right next to Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. For now, let&#8217;s sleep for the day. You must be tired, Natsuno-san.”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A&#8230;&#8230; yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice escapes Natsuno-san&#8217;s mouth, as if she has noticed something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pillow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bed we are supposed to sleep on, only has one pillow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably because Natsuno-san lost her cool with the [Supreme Erotic Book], she probably forgot to prepare another pillow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To tell the truth, I had already noticed this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come here&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my head on the one and only pillow and stretched my arms out to the side, inviting Natsuno-san to come over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san immediately seemed to realise my intentions and her cheeks flushed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well &#8230;..excuse me&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Natsuno-san lies down next to me after bowing her head ritually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her head is slowly placed on my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the completion of a girl&#8217;s dream act, the arm pillow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“uwawa……”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right beside me, Natsuno-san is writhing in happiness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she has become quite excited by being arm-pillowed by the person she loves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I pulled her and held her even closer to my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san, calm down. I can&#8217;t sleep like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! tha,that&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my words, Natsuno-san nods while her cheeks are stained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can see it clearly because Natsuno is quite close to me and her heart is beating surprisingly fast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This might take some time to calm down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, this situation is very favourable for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she is so thrilled, Natsuno&#8217;s romantic feelings will be greatly satisfied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It also felt quite good to enjoy her pleasant body’s temperature and fragrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both remain silent for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s heart is still beating fast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she seems to have gradually found the time to enjoy the good mood, and her breathing has calmed down a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it is cute, like a small animal, she sometimes glances at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Um, Saino.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230;what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Natsuno-san spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her back, Natsuno-san looked a little hesitant, but asked me in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re already lovers, right&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnー&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A natural question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s natural for a girl to want to be sure of that, now that she&#8217;s had sex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially since Natsuno-san gave her virginity to me, it would be very important to know if I was her lover or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can’t nod my head easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we officially become lovers, my relationships with other girls will be ruined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi sensei would be so shocked that she would even stop teaching and Akitsu-san would never do anything erotic with her best friend&#8217;s boyfriend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuyushima-san wouldn&#8217;t care about her lover, but Natsuno-san might get jealous and pull me away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Going out with Natsuno-san would mean that I have to love only Natsuno-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, since we&#8217;re going out, it&#8217;s only natural.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.I don’t see us as lovers…but more as friends with benefits.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short silence, I give a very half-hearted answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had prepared this answer in advance, thinking that I would definitely be asked this question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had to put it into words, it would be 『more than friends, less than lovers』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, it&#8217;s a very convenient relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I don&#8217;t expect her to be satisfied with such an answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put more words in my previous statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, let&#8217;s go on a date sometime. If I get to know Natsuno-san better, I might like you more. At least I don&#8217;t want to end my relationship with Natsuno-san just for today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Yeah, I&#8217;m a little bit disgusted with myself for saying it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, although I use pretty words, I&#8217;m trying to continue my physical relationship with Natsuno-san, using the relationship of 『lover』 as bait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I might say [Let&#8217;s go on a date] but in reality I&#8217;m going to have sex with her and that&#8217;s not going to make us lovers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A half-hearted way of continuing a relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what this word really means.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Natsuno-san&#8217;s face lit up as if she had found hope.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems she has been successfully deceived by the worst lies spit out by man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m relieved&#8230;&#8230;Saino, I&#8217;ll do my best!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san declares with a sniffle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sight of her made my heart prickle for the first time in a long time, but&#8230;.. soon realised that I had no right to feel guilty and threw the feeling away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Up until now, I&#8217;ve become comfortable ignoring the girl&#8217;s will in exchange for the number Lv.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s not play the good guy now.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;at least, I have to make sure that our dates will be perfectly planned or I can call her as often as possible to avoid making her feel sad and lonely&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made a firm decision and steeled my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I may force myself to do erotic things to a girl but I don&#8217;t want her to be sad or unhappy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll show Natsuno-san a reasonably happy dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;After that, the night between me and Natsuno-san went on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our conversation also ceased at some point and both of us fell into a deep sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn……”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I woke up from the depths of my sleep, shook off my tiredness and opened my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;beside me and surprisingly close is Natsuno-san&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My body jumped involuntarily but Natsuno-san seemed unaware of this and continued to sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I carefully checked my watch so as not to wake her and found that it was six o&#8217;clock in the morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Natsuno-san, wake up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gently call out to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is still a lot of time to spare before the school day starts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But unlike me, a man, Natsuno-san might take a while to get ready and I decided it would be better to wake her up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I tried to wake her up, Natsuno-san just moved her eyelashes a little and did not try to wake up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it possible that she is weak in the morning?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san, it&#8217;s morning…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnn&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I call out in a slightly louder voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now her eyebrows were furrowed and she seemed to have regained a certain amount of consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I waited, her eyes eventually snapped open, as if she had noticed something different from when she was sleeping alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Natsuno-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“~~!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she recognised me, Natsuno-san&#8217;s face turned bright red at once, as if she had exploded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a very cute reaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a similar situation, Fuyushima-san once gabe me a wake-up blowjob without a care, so the difference between the two is very refreshing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, a girl of her age should be like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry for waking you up. It&#8217;s morning already, so let&#8217;s get ready for school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While telling her, I got out of bed and did some stretches.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s bed was also quite comfortable.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll probably come back to stay over again, but I&#8217;m looking forward to that day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.Natsuno-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She should be awake, but she doesn&#8217;t seem to be moving at all, so I give her a thump on the shoulder from under the duvet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Hmmm, she&#8217;s beautifully stiff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The face of the person she loves is right in front of her when she wakes up, which seems to be too much stimulation for a maiden in love.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Should I make breakfast and wait&#8230;..?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt that I would get nowhere if I kept waiting, so I left the room and headed downstairs alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s parents seem to be out of town and probably haven&#8217;t even prepared breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It might not be right to use the kitchen and ingredients without permission, but since I was invited to stay over, I thought I&#8217;d return the favour with a little cooking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked down the corridor on the first floor and opened a door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This room is the living room and at the back is the kitchen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s oddly tidy, but I wonder if Natsuno-san&#8217;s parents like to keep things clean.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, I go to the kitchen and check the cooking utensils and the contents of the fridge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There seems to be a good amount of food.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s make a simple, French toast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I go straight in and start cooking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mix the eggs and milk well and put the bread in it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After soaking it thoroughly, I cook it in a frying pan over low heat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“～～♪”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smell the good smells wafting through the air and hum a tune.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s my first time cooking at a girl&#8217;s house, but it&#8217;s not a bad feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope Natsuno-san will be happy with this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the French toast is cooked just right, I transfer it to a larger plate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sprinkle it with powdered sugar and it&#8217;s done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take the finished dish upstairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally we should be eating in the living room but Natsuno-san hasn&#8217;t come down yet and I can use this delicious smell to help her to recover from the shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san will come to her senses once the food is served.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san, I&#8217;m coming in”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After calling her, I went inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..Natsuno-san was still frozen in her futon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put a plate of food on the mini-table in the middle of the room and called her out once more,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then──.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ee&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;oh, ee&#8230;..? &#8230;&#8230;! Oh, you made me breakfast, &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it&#8217;s pretty simple. I&#8217;m sorry I used your things without permission.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no! Thank you, I&#8217;m very happy!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she came to realisation, Natsuno-san got up vigorously but her expression looked terrible.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It might be just my imagination but&#8230; isn’t she on the verge of crying?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I didn&#8217;t think she would be that pleased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, do you want to eat here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to my question, Natsuno-san nods energetically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seems to have forgotten all about her embarrassment, thanks to the food.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I don&#8217;t know what it is&#8230; well, I guess we won&#8217;t be late with this.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a bit baffled but I decided not to pay any particular attention to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is smiling, that&#8217;s all that matters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No harm done.I&#8217;ll simply be happy that she&#8217;s happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;As it was, Natsuno-san and  I both ate our French toast together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not so bad for me, but Natsuno-san was always excited about how tasty it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt good about it and cleaned up afterwards, while Natsuno-san got ready.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after that, the two of us left the house together&#8230;. but of course I went to school alone first, so that Akitsu-san wouldn&#8217;t find out about all of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told Natsuno firmly that it could be trouble and that we should keep our relationship a secret from everyone around us until our relationship is clearly decided, so it will probably be fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so the sleepover at Natsuno-san&#8217;s house came to an end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a sense of satisfaction that everything had gone well, I went to school on Tuesday.</span></p>
