 <h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Dungeon Dating, Spring</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today&#8217;s class also ended without any particular incident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei still seems to be sensitive to my presence and her attitude was quite strange but she is still a professional teacher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was able to give a good lesson and her explanations were clear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it was cute that she blushed whenever she saw my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went home straight away, ready to explore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..fuu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finish getting my gear ready and let out one sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this, my own preparations are over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All I have to do now is wait for Harumachi-sensei to arrive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s equipment has been properly prepared, so if she wears it,she will be fully prepared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And just then, the doorbell rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she was already here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! I&#8217;m coming!”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After shouting loudly, I headed for the front door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked through the peephole in the door and saw&#8230;It was Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However──</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..?　Sensei, what have you got in your hand&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at Sensei’s hand and a question mark appears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a long, brown stick that looked like wood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must be about one hundred and eighty centimetres long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is taller than Sensei&#8217;s height.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is about as thick as an iron bar and seems easy to grip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can&#8217;t keep her waiting forever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the door, wondering about the mysterious stick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino, I have come&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Come in for now. You don&#8217;t want to be seen by other people..” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,yeah, that&#8217;s right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei turned away from facing me and became fidgety.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I invited Sensei into the house and immediately closed the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei looked restless and kept rubbing the stick she was holding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even her ears are red and she can&#8217;t seem to stay still for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday she couldn&#8217;t even have a conversation with me, so now it’s a little bit better but she still can&#8217;t seem to erase her embarrassment towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, she is a maiden in love.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;..sensei’s what is that stick?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from her cute embarrassment, I asked her what was on my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei brought a mysterious long stick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has no particular decoration, so I don&#8217;t know what it is.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei then opened her mouth, although she was still embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is a Rokushakubo…it’s a weapon. I’m good in bo jutsu”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:Rokushakubo: A fighting style using a long stick/staff hence the word Bō]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bo jutsu?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, I have a fifth dan in Mutengi Shinryu. It&#8217;s not a well-known style and you wouldn&#8217;t know it if you were told&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mutengi Shinryu 5th dan in Bo jutsu&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is true that staff jutsu itself is minor and the name of the school has never been heard of at all, as Sensei says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are probably far fewer people who know of it.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, a fifth dan seems to be a pretty high rank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if Sensei might have been a reasonably fierce fighter in her own right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn’t have that many muscles and I don&#8217;t get the impression that she is a martial arts expert. </span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Well, let&#8217;s get ready anyway. I prepared my mother&#8217;s hand-me-downs, which she wore the other day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm….I understand.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei nodded honestly while still avoiding eye contact with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I showed her to my parents room and she got herself ready.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Incidentally, I took a peek at her change of clothes.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s underwear is hot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right, shall we go then?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The entrance to the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all the preparations, we finally decided to start our exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Sensei&#8217;s hand was that long staff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she intends to use this to fight monsters, after all.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a bit curious to see how well the Mutengi Shinryu </span><span style="font-weight: 400">5th dan will work in the dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Here’s the raw </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[無天技神流] </span><span style="font-weight: 400">,I only know if one of characters but in chinese. I google translate this since I’m unsure..]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just as we were about to enter the labyrinth, I offered Sensei something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei. Before you dive into the dungeon, please read this”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230;? What&#8217;s this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a sort of strategy book for this labyrinth. It also describes the monsters that appear, so I think it&#8217;ll be useful.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei takes the diary from my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks a bit strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the very fact that there is such a thing as a strategy book is suspiciously game-like, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Sensei continues to flip through the pages to check the contents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I observed the situation and prayed that the exploration would be successful.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I hope it’s good enough to fool Sensei&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The book I gave to the teacher was the diary that I picked up at the entrance to the labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s another book that I transcribed its contents from &#8230;..in summary,it’s like a codex.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I did completely transcribe it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In some parts, I secretly changed the descriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That part is, needless to say, the description of levels and items.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Levels are raised by combat experience for both humans and monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The item has no effect and the instructions are a boring joke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if you collect them all, you get a very valuable treasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those are some of the alterations I&#8217;ve made.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Levels increase with combat experience and can be found in the&#8230;&#8230;palms of your hands&#8230;&#8230;.?&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, come to think of it, how many lvls does Sensei have?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m pretty sure she&#8217;s had sex with me a total of six times so far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the first time I had sex with her, she wasn&#8217;t a virgin, so she must be at least lvl 7.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be shocking if it was lvl 100 or something like that, but I wonder how many she really is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I closed one eye and checked the teacher&#8217;s level, feeling a little uneasy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the number that came to mind was…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dumb voice leaked out of my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, no matter how many times I looked, the Sensei&#8217;s lvl was the same number.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;It was 6.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“H, how can this be&#8230;..? Why is it the same as the number of times she did it with me&#8230;..?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite my confusion, Sensei continued to read the book.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after a while, he finally closed it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, at least I know a bit about this place. It&#8217;s&#8230;..a strange place after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye, yeah, it is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded at Sensei’s statement while trying to keep my composure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei was successfully fooled, but the shock of the numbers I had just seen was too strong for me to comment anything about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m doing my best to hide my surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, we can&#8217;t stay here forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just said, [Shall we go then?] and turned my feet towards the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s lvl is inexplicable,so let&#8217;s just start exploring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We pass through the first floor using the direct passageway and soon arrive at the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Green walls, green floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere is clearly different from the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The taste of the air was also somewhat different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, today we will be looking for the two remaining items on this floor. The enemies are…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The [Electric Sheep], the [Mandragora], the [Laughing Pumpkin], and the [Thorny Bug]. And the lvls are 5 to 10&#8230;.wasn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..yes. I&#8217;m at level 8 and Sensei is at level 6, so it&#8217;s quite possible that the enemy is better than us. Let&#8217;s be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, I understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei nods at my words and grips the staff tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has a very dignified expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The embarrassment towards me that was there long ago is now a shadow of its former self.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is that how nervous she is?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The memory of the death struggle with the laughing pumpkin may have made her realise that dungeon exploration is quite dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Then let&#8217;s go. Follow me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then take my smartphone out of my trousers and launch the mapping app.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The map of the second floor is still completely blank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had explored the area before, but I didn&#8217;t have time to do any mapping.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, we might obtain the items before I complete the map.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We continued along the corridor to the left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last time we used the right hand method, so it should be more efficient to use the left hand method this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walk slowly but are somewhat silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not that we feel awkward but there is a strange sense of urgency when they don&#8217;t talk about anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Continuing the exploration at this rate is likely to be quite exhausting due to the tension.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if Sensei would be able to relax more moderately if we chatted about something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, we can never be too careful in a dungeon and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to have too much conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, I decided to ask him about a topic that Sensei seemed comfortable talking about&#8230;&#8230;Bo Jutsu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, let&#8217;s see&#8230;..Mutengi Shinryu, was it?　Why did Sensei learn such martial stick art?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm&#8230;.. ah, that’s an&#8230;&#8230;embarrassing story, but my father is the head of the Mutengi Shinryu dojo. So I was forced to be taught&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Harumachi Sensei&#8217;s dignified and tightened expression breaks down a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her cheeks are slightly tinted and she looks a bit embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything wrong with that but why does she look like that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to my questioning, Sensei continues to speak, sounding truly embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you know.My house is like that, I was brought up like a man. I wasn&#8217;t allowed to play make-believe and they never bought me skirts.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O,ooo…that’s unfortunate…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A spectacular past told by Sensei&#8217;s own mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s family is quite crazy, raising girls as men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have only seen such stories in comic books.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she is the head of a martial arts family, her father’s educational policy is probably overkill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I don&#8217;t really want to tell people that I&#8217;m a Mutengi Shinryu master. I feel like it would give away that I was educated that way&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei blushes when she says this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei’s past had made her have a complex about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s cute to see her embarrassed and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s weird for me, but she may be quite concerned about it herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that she was not brought up as a woman is certainly not without a negative image, such as 『lacking modesty』.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aree….?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then a strange thought suddenly flashed into my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei was brought up as a man and was not allowed to wear skirts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But since yesterday, she has been wearing long skirts to school.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Maybe that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, but I don&#8217;t think so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was impossible but I decided to just say the thought that popped into my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Sensei, was it just yesterday that you put on a skirt for the first time?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Se,sensei!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I ask, Harumachi-sensei cower in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hands are covering her face and I can hear her moaning in embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No way, this reaction&#8230;was my prediction correct?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously&#8230;.?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the teacher in disbelief, still crouched down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s no doubt about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei is….</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘F,for me, she wore a skirt for the first time in her life. &#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help but almost, 『You&#8217;re kidding me』coming out of my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What can I say &#8230;&#8230; I really can&#8217;t believe it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A woman who has only worn trousers all her life crossed that line for me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made Harumachi-sensei make such a big decision&#8230;..!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D,Don&#8217;t say anything!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart warms up and my mouth naturally calls out for Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Sensei interrupted my voice like a scream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she doesn&#8217;t want me to be the only one to mention it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I dared to continue speaking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If a woman has put up the courage for herself, as a man I have a duty to respond to that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, Sensei looked so beautiful when she was dressed up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want her to regret it after summoning up her courage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my heart into it and slowly let out my voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I really liked the way you looked in your skirt. Sensei looked like an adult woman and it was very nice. I was happy that you wore a skirt.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!&#8230;Is that true!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s true. I was so surprised to see such a beautiful person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“~~~!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s face turns red at my praise and she raises her voice inaudibly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She crouched down while stomping her feet and repeatedly hitting the floor with the end of the stick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does this mean that she is&#8230;..too happy to stay still?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it was soaring, as if she was about to start dancing.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Sensei looks like a normal girl  in this way&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s appearance as a naive girl makes me think about such things with deep emotion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She becomes fashionably aware of the eyes of the people she likes and likes them so much that she can&#8217;t even have a conversation with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is more pure and adolescent-like than my classmates&#8217; girls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it is said that she was brought up as a man, so her mental age as a woman may be very young.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her appearance is so mature and sexy that when she makes such gestures, it&#8217;s too unbalanced and destructive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha! Aah! Aa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei continues to hit the floor with a stick while in embarrassment indefinitely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My words seem to have a critical hit on  Sensei and she doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to return to her former dignified appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEEEEEEEEEE!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A distinctive bleating sound comes from the end of the passage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly turned my eyes in that direction and saw a large sheep a dozen metres away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike normal sheep, its wool is yellow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is slowly but surely approaching us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no doubt that it&#8217;s about to&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the [Electric Sheep], the monster on the second floor&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei banging around on the floor might have caused them to notice our presence by the sound and come charging at us.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei,incoming enemy!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rush to call out to Harumachi-sensei and start to remove the torch from the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep is characterised by the fact that it has a charge on its body, which means that we must be careful how we attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So it should be better to attack with a torch than with a knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei seems taken back and I have to take the initiative in dealing with the electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just as I took the torch off the wall…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuooooooooo!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a spirited cry can be heard from behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around in a panic, Harumachi-sensei was no longer there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh,Ehhhhhh?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei is running towards the electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The six-foot stick is being swung at such a high speed that it is impossible to follow its trajectory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, contrary to the length of the stick, the swing is very compact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has a much smaller range than holding out both hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it is, Sensei screams and comes to close quarters against the electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha! Ta! Oryaaaaaa!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEE, ME, MEEE!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thrusting, lashing and smashing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With what could be described as divine speed, Sensei’s stick attacks the electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep is shaken by the attack in an interesting way and can only scream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuaa! Haa! Taaah! Ha!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei uses the momentum of the attack to launch a series of follow-up strikes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a one-sided fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before the electric sheep can regain its position, Sensei&#8217;s next attack has already been launched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, the parts of the body that are attacked are critical points.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not the torso, but the head and legs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s attacks are concentrated in areas that are considered fatal to electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was pitiful to watch and so merciless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I was blinded in another way by such a merciless series of attacks.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Amazing &#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A flow of emotion floods in my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each time sensei attacks, it is terribly artistic and spectacular.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it is an actual battle, it feels like watching an enbu performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Enbu</span><span style="font-weight: 400">演武,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">performing martial arts in front of an audience]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Rokushakubo, which is supposed to be longer than her height, attacks the electric sheep sometimes compactly and sometimes dynamically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is as if the length is changing freely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is such brilliant stickwork that one wonders if he is hallucinating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei continues to attack unilaterally, and then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEE……”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep let out a faint scream and runs out of power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its body turns into a swarm of light particles and is sucked into the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s total number of attacks was probably about &#8230;twenty times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The attacks were so fast that I&#8217;m not sure I counted them properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei bows quietly on the spot, as is the custom in the martial arts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A 『Master』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The imposing appearance of Harumachi Sensei naturally reminded me of such a word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei is truly an expert in Bo Jutsu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, being a fifth dan in Mutengi Shinryu is even more amazing than I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei turned around and rushed towards me at a high speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei came straight up to me and then opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th,thanks!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Sensei thanked me and I had no idea what she was thankful about, so I put a question mark on my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Senseir then smiles while her cheeks are stained and says…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll keep dressing up from now on!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; I was unintentionally stunned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After such a brilliant fight, that&#8217;s what her first words were.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s as if the electric sheep was just a distraction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, It’s different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is precisely because she fought the electric sheep that she is able to think straight and thank me in this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, I don&#8217;t like to think about it too much because it&#8217;s terrifying, but Sensei is&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘She used the electric sheep as a tool to vent her emotions&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hits on the electric sheep sends a shiver down my spine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s smile is very cute, but it looks more than a little scary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I may have fallen in love with a rather dangerous person.</span></p
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..for now, let&#8217;s just be careful not to tease her too much.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bear this in mind and smile awkwardly at Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then opened my mouth in a deceptive way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, let&#8217;s resume our exploration.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei nods broadly with a smiling face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks very lively and healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the current battle has blown a lot of things out of the water and she doesn&#8217;t seem to be holding back her embarrassment towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that she was not even unnecessarily nervous.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; Well, if she feels like this, we should proceed with our exploration without being so tired.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With mixed feelings, I proceeded with my steps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, the electric sheep was a bit weak but Sensei&#8217;s current attitude is not bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I relaxed myself and properly alert our surroundings, so we will not be caught off guard in any strange way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the ideal attitude for an exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave the electric sheep to me. I don&#8217;t feel like losing against them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure&#8230;&#8230;..But we should deal with the other monsters together. Especially the laughing pumpkin, it&#8217;s definitely more advantageous for two people to attack it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, that’s true. About the spiny Thorny Bug&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While continuing the exploration, we also discuss our strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is better to have a plan beforehand than to think about how to deal with the monsters after or during our encounter.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It feels kind of refreshing&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was pondering about such things in the difference between this and previous explorations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until Sensei found out about the dungeon, I was the only one exploring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t have any conversations and I wasn&#8217;t aware of such a combination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels strange to be exploring the dungeon while talking like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We continued on our way through the labyrinth, mapping it as we went.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We discuss during our walk in the safe passages with good visibility and be silent and vigilant together around corners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The map was steadily filling in and the entire second floor was somewhat visible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, look at this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the map of the second floor so far. And this is the first floor. Which may be the same size as the first floor..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I show Harumachi-Sensei the screen of my smartphone and explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the shape of the passageways revealed so far, it seems that the second layer is also a 400 metres square, just like the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The passage is of course winding but the perimeter is very beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also told her that the entrance to the next floor was likely to be in the middle of it and explained the existence of a direct passageway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think Sensei will be exploring alone but it&#8217;s important to share information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei folds her arms impressively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put away my smartphone and continued to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I still don&#8217;t know the conditions about how the direct passageway appears. It may be item completion or defeating all types of monsters&#8230;I would like to verify this on this floor if possible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm&#8230;&#8230; that would be the right choice. I think it&#8217;s a good plan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei completely agrees with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The convenience of the direct passage seems to have been understood without explanation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the explanation, we resume our exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has already been 30 minutes since we entered the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although we haven&#8217;t found any small rooms with items, the map is steadily filling up and our pace is not too bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We only encountered a few electric sheep but that didn’t tire us out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And about ten minutes after I had explained the map.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About two thirds of the way around the perimeter of the second floor had been mapped, when finally&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino, could that be&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The now-familiar entrance at the end of the corridor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Sensei and I spotted it, we both tensed up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;definitely the small room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took us longer than usual to find it but we might finally get a new item.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, there is probably one monster inside. Let&#8217;s take a look inside first and decide what to do depending on its type.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooouu…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei nodded, her expression tightening.</span></
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We quietly approached the entrance to the small room and slowly peered inside.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Isn’t that a&#8230;&#8230;[Mandragora]?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the centre of the room, as expected, is a treasure chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And right next to it, a huge plant was growing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; No, growing is not quite the right word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks like a radish but its roots are completely out of the ground, in the shape of a person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks like a pure white doll with leaves growing out of its head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;re about as tall as me, which is pretty spooky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They seem to have their backs to us, so a surprise attack may be possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I close one eye and see that it is Lv 6.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Same Lv as Sensei and a lower Lv for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Sensei.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaa”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I make a short, small voice and communicate with Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We already decided the battle strategy against Mandragora.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All I have to do now is fight accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pull my knife out of its sheath and jump into the room in time with Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I approach the mandragora with my footsteps silent…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYA!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sneak attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large wound is inflicted on the white back of the monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mandragora jumps up and down, its body bounces and it sounds surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s a good response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its Lv is also high and it may have taken quite a bit of damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I didn&#8217;t give chase and immediately moved away from the mandragora and covered my ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei  did the same and put her hands over her ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she did so…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──────!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even with our ears covered, we can still hear bits of its screams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air trembles and the vibrations are felt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Yes, this is what mandragoras are known for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Screaming attacks.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mandragoras are not particularly good at fighting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, by performing this screaming attack. Enemies of the Mandragora will fall into a coma.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once unconscious, the opponent can no longer do anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how low the mandragora&#8217;s attack power is, it will be smashed to death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that sense, in a sense, it could be said to be an instant death attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it seems that even such a powerful screaming attack has restrictions on its use.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It can only be used once per battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the timing is also fixed, it only activates immediately after the first attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We already knew that, so it was easy to deal with.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; Okay!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel the air stop vibrating and stop covering my ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei beside me moved her hand away in the same way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAA!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slashed at it with my knife as I ran right past it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then turned around and faced the mandragora.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This completes our advantageous position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me in front of the mandragora, Harumachi-sensei behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei and I have successfully formed a formation to pincer the mandragora.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ta, ha!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYA, GYAA!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sora!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAAA!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei’s two blows knock the mandragora out of its stance and my knife runs through the gap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a perfect combination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s attack seems to be less powerful due to her Lv and weapon but I can use it as an advantage to do a lot of damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mandragora can do nothing but writhe in pain on the spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sei!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put all my strength into it and gave the mandragora another blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYA&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a small cry, the mandragora transformed into a swarm of light particles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was absorbed into the labyrinth and soon left no trace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We secured a win.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fue&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh and the teacher took a quiet bow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when we finished, we looked at each other and we both smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The battle now was very ideal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We received zero damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The strategy fitted in well and there is a kind of exhilaration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, it was also great that I was able to match with my own teacher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to use an analogy, it would be like the results of practising in tennis doubles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kind of wanted to exchange high-fives with Sensei and praise each other.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, whatever it is&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forcefully switch my consciousness from the afterglow of victory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t fight the mandragora because I wanted to fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had only one objective from the start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s see&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I squat in front of the treasure chest and put my hand on its lid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei says nothing and watches quietly next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It won&#8217;t be that much of a problem if she sees it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she believes the contents of my codex, they will think the instructions are a joke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly open the lid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..? A wristband?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei tilts her head curiously at the contents of the treasure chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she said, what was inside was apparently a wristband.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was pink in colour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s only one, so I can only wear it on one hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the instructions that came with it to find out what it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『The [Lucky Band] &#8211; when worn on the wrist, this wristband allows you to touch any woman&#8217;s body with your hand without being perceived. However, the people around you will notice it. It also has no effect if worn on a part of the body other than the arm. Usable number of times: ∞ times.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heee….”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put the manual back in the treasure box after reading it </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and immediately put the [lucky band] on my right hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then reached out to Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s breasts and gently squeezed them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230; nn&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s body jerks slightly, as if a pleasant sensation has been triggered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she did not show any resistance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She just looked at me strangely when our eyes met.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I think I understand how this works&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While enjoying the softness of the teacher&#8217;s breasts, I put my other hand on my chin and think about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, this [Lucky Band] does not have the effect of directly raising Lv.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it&#8217;s an item that I&#8217;m grateful for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be able to touch a girl&#8217;s body without her being aware of it would be a tool that a man could only dream of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m touching Sensei&#8217;s tits right now without permission, and my hands are very happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m so happy to be able to taste this anytime when we&#8217;re alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm, nn&#8230;&#8230; nn&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei, who tilts her head cutely while jerking her body at me, who has fallen silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took my hand off the teacher&#8217;s chest and suggested, in a casual manner, that we continue our search.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After defeating Mandragora and obtaining the Lucky Band.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei and I left the small room and resumed our exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Lucky Band is in my bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about sexually harassing Sensei throughout the passage, but that would be underestimating the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the presence of monsters, it was clearly dangerous to lose concentration.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Besides, if we were forced to transfer, the [lucky band] would return to the treasure chest&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recalling the rules of the labyrinth, I reconfirm the risks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I take too much damage and are sent back to the entrance, the items I’ve acquired in that exploration will go back to the treasure chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I don&#8217;t want to be caught off guard and get hit by a monster. In the first place, getting hit by a monster hurts a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Sensei, it would be easy to get the [Lucky Band] again, but it is not the same as forcing a transition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For efficient exploration, forced transitions should generally be avoided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, let&#8217;s go right here. From the shape of the map, it&#8217;s probably an immediate dead end but that doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t small rooms.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the umpteenth time, there’s a fork in the road.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I suggested this while looking at the screen of my smartphone, Harumachi-sensei nodded in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Sensei intends to leave most of the exploration decision to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she trusts me a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue to lead our exploration down the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The destination to the right is still a dead end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, there are no small rooms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We quickly turned around and took another route.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon afterwards, we came to…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oops&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.Mu”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment we turned the corner, we saw a yellow object about ten metres down the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It rubs itself against the wall constantly, as if its body is itching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That distinctive fur-coloured animal is, no doubt, an electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its face is turned towards us but it doesn&#8217;t notice us, perhaps preoccupied with scratching its body.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It’s Lv is&#8230;&#8230;9?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently it&#8217;s a higher Lv than me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Okay, Saino, wait here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is Sensei planning to fight it on your own, by any chance? From Lv wise, I&#8217;d say Sensei is a bit reckless&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. I’ve told you that I wouldn&#8217;t lose against any electric sheep. Leave it to me..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei grips her stick with great motivation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m worried, but I can&#8217;t stop her strongly enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, Sensei had won a crushing victory over Electric Sheep earlier as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t have time to check the Lv at that time but even for me, it seemed as if Sensei would win regardless of Lv.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not good to let one&#8217;s guard down, but I still felt a strange sense of security.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I couldn&#8217;t let a woman fight alone knowing that it would be dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remind Sensei, who was about to rush off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I understand. But I&#8217;ll stay nearby. If you’re in a pinch, I&#8217;ll help you right away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, okay. Then, I&#8217;ll go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nodding at my words, Harumachi-sensei runs towards the electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, Sensei is still running while swinging the stick compactly, but is that a kind of preparatory exercise?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or is she giving the tip of the stick more momentum by doing so?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Either way, I have to keep up with her with a moderate distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I removed the torch from the wall, held it and followed Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“HAH!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEEEEE!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s sharp thrust, delivered with the momentum of running.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep turned its head away to avoid the direct hit and conversely, leapt towards Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The surprise attack failed since it was facing our way after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Sensei didn’t panic and immediately rotated the Rokushakubo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then aimed at the electric sheep&#8217;s jaw from directly below, with the tip opposite to the one that had done the thrusting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEE&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep didn’t predict such an attack, loses its balance and lands on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep would not even have known what had happened to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s rokushakubo swung again, not missing the chance of the flinching electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, she rotated her entire body and delivered a large naginata blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blow was absorbed by the electric sheep&#8217;s body and the stick sucked into it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep&#8217;s body shook with shock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEEE&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However Sensei&#8217;s attack power is low but it still does some damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep grunts and shrinks a little on the spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei continues to thrust, aiming at the front legs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Rokushakubo ran at high speed, as if it could expand and contract at will.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve seen this before, a ghastly weak point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now the electric sheep will no longer be able to move properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEEE!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep makes a loud bleating sound and rushes at Sensei as if it is upset.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Her attack didn&#8217;t work!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei panicked and held the Rokushakubo to the side to catch it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku,uuuu&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to kill the momentum, Sensei was pushed back a few steps.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is bad!!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately ran out and tried to go around the side of Sensei and attack the electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;.. but I didn&#8217;t get there in time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Timing-wise, I was just in time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was one obstacle in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the Rokushakubo that was still held in her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite Sensei&#8217;s skill in Bo Jutsu, the length of the staff was still about 180 cm long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To fight up close, its length was a great hindrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei completely loses her balance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no choice but to hit the electric sheep on the head with my torch to stop its momentum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEE!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it a good hit, or did I catch it by surprise?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep stops charging and retreats, as if startled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, Harumachi-sensei fell on her buttocks and I threatened the electric sheep with a torch to protect him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, are you alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A,aaa….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the sound of my voice, Harumachi Sensei rushed to my feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I glanced at the electric sheep warily, Sensei did not appear to be hurt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, her expression clearly shows that she is in shock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn&#8217;t feel like she can continue the battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; leave the rest to me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s all I shouted and I rushed towards the electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep is bending over and straining to intercept me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be trying to evade my attack to the side and counterattack from there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I deliberately feinted by repositioning my torch several times, then attacked it sideways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEE, MEEE&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My attack hit the electric sheep in the head, while being somewhat deflected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the enemy did not flinch and bent down further to counterattack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems to be trying to hit me with its body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If such an attack were to be made on this thing, which has electricity flowing through its body, it would probably do quite a lot of damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; but that&#8217;s to be expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I threw down the torch I wielded and pulled the knife from its sheath with my right hand while guarding my body with my left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEEE!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep rushed in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grit my teeth and…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!!Y,youuu!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I blocked its rush, my vision flickered and pain shot through my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I gathered my strength and forced myself to swing the knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEEEE&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The numbness and pain that had been attacking my body disappears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep has moved away from us and there is a sharp cut across one of its eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the blow I had struck earlier had just hit the vital spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gathered up all the energy in my body and ran towards the electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With holding my knife upside down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was conscious since it was missing one eye and I approached it from its blind spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with all my might, I thrust my blade into the electric sheep&#8217;s brain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“TERYAAA!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ME, E&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it because the damage had accumulated, or was the brain indeed a weak point?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep stopped moving on the spot with the knife stuck in its head&#8230;.and slowly collapsed to the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at that moment, it turned into a particle of light and was sucked into the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, it seems, we&#8217;ve won.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I relaxed from my body and returned the knife that had fallen to the floor to its sheath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a tough fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I haven&#8217;t struggled like this since the Laughing Pumpkin battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was utterly gut-wrenching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;, but there are two things I&#8217;ve learned a lot this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first is that 『Lv difference cannot be ignored』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s two strikes to the front leg were perfectly well executed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the electric sheep withstood it and even fought back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cause of this would be none other than the amount of damage inflicted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Lv difference between Harumachi-sensei and the electric sheep from earlier is 3.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the same Lv difference as when I struggled with the laughing pumpkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking back, that monster didn&#8217;t flinch too much from my attacks that time either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, if we are 3 lvls apart, it means that we can&#8217;t kill them with a few attacks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s attacks are a flowing series of blows, so it might be tough if she’s been counterattacked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the second fact that turned out to be true was&#8230;. the poor combination between me and Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a pincer formation, we would never get in each other&#8217;s way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in close combat in the corridor, Sensei and I have to fight side by side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, Sensei&#8217;s Rokushakubo becomes a great hindrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stick is not a very useful weapon for fighting in a party in this labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, we both become silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei must also be thinking the same thing as me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was very awkward.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hmmm&#8230;&#8230;I have to do something about this&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was thinking about that in my head, I pretended I didn&#8217;t care about anything and asked Sensei if we should continue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess you don’t run into opponents like that often….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… right…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a close call with the electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me and Harumachi-sensei, who were continuing our exploration, both felt a subtle awkwardness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To use an analogy, we were a couple who made a weird mistake on our first date.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pretending not to mind or care for each other, but we in reality, we really do care. And not knowing how to fix the mistake between us and the other side knowing that I don’t know what to do.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankly, it&#8217;s a very bad atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Frankly, I have zero idea how to mend this problem….’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we continue to walk, I frantically think of a solution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei with her stick and me with a knife or torch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both can only engage in melee combat and we would get in each other&#8217;s way if there’s a fight in the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the space is somewhat open like the small room, we can adjust our positions and fight well but this is not the case in a passageway that is only three or four metres wide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be quite risky to slip past the enemy every time.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hmmm&#8230;&#8230;.I still think her weapon is&#8230;..But I don&#8217;t know if it would work if I let Sensei use a knife&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I simulate a battle in my head if Sensei uses a knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two people approach the enemy, attack the enemy without hurting each other and then the enemy will&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;. no good. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m still stronger fighting alone’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t format a good plan at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s strength is only due to her beautiful barrage of stick attacks and accurate rapid aim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t have the arm strength and even if I give her a knife, she won&#8217;t be able to attack effectively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, it is definitely not easy to swing a knife with two people side by side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was hard to think that we would be able to attack the monster while taking each other into consideration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei and I moved through the corridors, having fallen silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The map is steadily filling up, although I can&#8217;t think of any solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than half of the floor has already been mapped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We continue our exploration, and&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Sensei</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We call out to each other briefly, looking at the end of the passage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has been about ten minutes since the battle with the electric sheep earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At last, we found the last small room on this floor.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘A laughing pumpkin, lvl 7. It&#8217;s hard to make a surprise attack.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take a look inside quietly and identify the guardian of the treasure chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, there is a treasure chest in the centre of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And behind it, a laughing pumpkin sat with its face turned slightly to the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, as we discussed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, I know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Okay, let&#8217;s go then. I&#8217;ll leave the timing to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I pulled my knife out of its sheath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve already decided on a strategy when the Laughing Pumpkin is my opponent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a two-man distraction tactic, with my attack as the main focus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei grips the Rokushakubo, looks me in the eye and nods.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after taking a deep breath, we leapt into the small room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHA!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The giant pumpkin notices us and lets out an eerie laugh, just like its name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It spins slowly, trying to take aim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first target seems to be Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei shouts and runs to avoid being targeted.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Completely free, I rushed towards the laughing pumpkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Teiii!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYA&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A grunt escapes from the laughing pumpkin&#8217;s mouth at the full force of the blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can see a deep crack has formed on its surface.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that I was clearly able to inflict more damage than the Lv 10 monster I fought before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the difference in lvl really affects the amount of damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the matter! You&#8217;re not gonna shoot at me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYA&#8230;&#8230; GYAHAA!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha! You can&#8217;t hit me like that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s voice is heard from behind the pumpkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Followed by her voice was an impact sound, it was probably the sound of the laughing pumpkin seed hitting the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei seems to be playing the decoy role brilliantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oraaaaaa!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHAAA!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I strike it once more.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to Sensei’s diversion, I’m able to completely make my mark. I could attack with all my might without worry.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Creating another deep wound on the monster’s shell, while twisting in my blade.  Digging into it further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYA&#8230;&#8230;AA&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The laughing pumpkin stops moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“GYAHA&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a small grunt, the giant pumpkin turns into particles of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within seconds, it disappeared completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuu&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exhaling in relief, I sheath my blade.  It was a complete victory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were able to fight with a lot of time to spare because we were in the small room where it was easy to maximise our combinations, and the monster was not at a high level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only three attacks were needed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that I was able to inflict more damage with a single attack than the lvl 10 laughing pumpkin I had fought before.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘At any rate, I&#8217;m glad we won easily.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Harumachi Sensei bowing quietly, I feel a little relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the struggle with the electric sheep, her expression had been sour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this time, being able to fight properly together, she seems to have regained a little bit of her composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if she encounters the same monster in the passage again, she might regress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; for now, let&#8217;s open the treasure chest’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped observing Harumachi-sensei and headed for the centre of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I crouched down in front of the treasure box and slowly opened the lid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside of it was──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a slight gasp of air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The item in the treasure chest, it was what I needed at this moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The timing was too good to be true, but it’s fate that it appears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately read the instructions that came with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『[Romance Crossbow]　a high-strength crossbow with high attack power. Up to five arrows are automatically charged each time the user enters a dungeon. If the arrow pierces a person who has romantic feelings for the user, that person will not be wounded, but instead their romantic feelings for the user will be strengthened. Cannot be used outside the dungeon. Effective range: 30 metres. Usable number of times: ∞ times.』</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Nice! This is a long-range attack weapon that I need&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my hand inside the treasure chest and lifted the item.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Romance Crossbow].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks like a bowgun, like a gun with a bow attached.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a lever on the barrel, which is probably used to load arrows from the upper magazine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It weighs about two kilograms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a little hard to hold with one hand but with two hands it feels light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If properly held with both hands, even a non-strong person will be able to stabilise their aim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saino,that&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, and we can properly use it as a weapon…… Sensei, I need you to do hit-and-run attacks, and if possible, please keep it in my line of sight. Can you do it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!……. Of course I can!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to my words, Harumachi-sensei smiled broadly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seems a little excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems,Sensei also realised the great potential of this item.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei and I quickly left the small room and resumed our exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our goal was neither the treasure nor the entrance to the next floor, but the monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both wanted to know to what extent the presence of the [Romance Crossbow] affected the battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, ten minutes after leaving the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the map had been filled in and the path to the third level had become somewhat clear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“! Sensei&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, there it is&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around the corner, a long passage of about 20 metres.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle of it, there was a yellow-haired beast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was definitely an electric sheep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the third time we&#8217;ve encountered it during our exploration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has its back to us and does not seem to have noticed us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I checked the Lv and found that it was Lv 9, the same level as the one we struggled with earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;For now, I will take the lead and try to sneak attack it. And Sensei will──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. After that, I&#8217;ll rush in and catch its attention while waiting for Saino’s second attack. For now, I&#8217;ll fight with emphasis on defence, so Saino can give me instructions as you assess the situation”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a brief battle plan, Sensei holds up her stick and I hold up my Romance Crossbow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The romance crossbow is not equipped with a scope, but instead has a small round ring in front of it that could be used for aiming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This kind of thing is called an iron sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s a projection just at the tip of the crossbow and if I put both it and the monster in this circle,I&#8217;ll be able to get a good aim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here goes nothing&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say a word to Sensei and put my finger on the trigger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I took aim and pulled the trigger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BASH!!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEEEEEE!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An arrow was fired at high speed from the Romance Crossbow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It flew in a precise straight line and pierced the electric sheep&#8217;s buttocks with great force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, the electric sheep&#8217;s body jumps with the impact and a scream escapes from its mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From how it looks, I must have done a lot of damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going in&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei said and rushed towards the electric sheep as agreed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei then attacked the monster, who finally looked at us, with a sharp thrust with very few gaps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hu! Ha!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ME,MEEEEE!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A quick double thrust, so quick that I thought Sensei had reached the speed of sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of the thrust landed on its hand and the electric sheep shook its head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It shows that Sensei didn’t do much damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks like her attacks are only good for holding it back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I get a little closer to the electric sheep and Sensei, and pull the lever of the romance crossbow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Gachan </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">was heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked and saw that the arrow was properly loaded and ready to fire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Second shot, ready!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouu!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the sound of my voice, Harumachi-sensei gave the electric sheep another poke in the head then backed to my side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It allowed the line of fire to pass through, I took firm aim and pulled the trigger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEEEEEEEE&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good shot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second arrow also hit the target with flying colours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the place where it hit is also good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow was deeply embedded in the left eye of the electric sheep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEE…..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electric sheep gave a feeble bleating sound and slowly collapsed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the moment its torso hit the floor, it turned into a swarm of light particles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Victory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped holding the Romance Crossbow and approached Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei also walked up to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“……Sensei! We did it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa! With this fighting style, we can do it &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our faces lit up as we both discussed our response to this method of fighting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The combat with the Romance Crossbow was much better than we had imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The attack power was perfect and we were able to get the combination right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of us were able to play the vanguard and the rearguard perfectly and there is no better way to fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei and I have a big smile on our faces and we praise each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lvl 9 electric sheep that we had struggled with earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that we were able to defeat it perfectly, the bad atmosphere had just disappeared completely.</span></p>
