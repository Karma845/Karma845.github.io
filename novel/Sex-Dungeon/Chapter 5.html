<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Springs Offer, Bells and Summer </h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sa, Saino&#8230;&#8230;good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning~, Saino-kun♪”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Thursday morning, the day after my dungeon exploration with Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was greeted by two such voices when I went out the front door to go to school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m seeing two contrasting girls standing in front of my house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ones standing outside are Natsuno-san and Akitsu-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm&#8230;&#8230; what&#8217;s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W,well,that&#8230;&#8230;Maya suddenly started being selfish, saying that she wanted to go to school with Saino-kun&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe~♡.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san explains with a blush on her face and Akitsu-san gently smiles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, it&#8217;s not a coincidence that the two of them are here but are waiting for me to come out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What can I say, I&#8217;m quite happy to have two beautiful girls behaving like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If only I didn&#8217;t think about the fact that&#8230;.Akitsu-san was the one who suggested it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Himeyori  didn’t say no to it,right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Princess Hiyori but Maya add on the me]</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? M,Maya!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, Himeyori is scary~♪!”</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two began to fight cutely, despite my bad premonition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the looks of it, it seems true that Natsuno-san was keen to get on board.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the romantic feelings instilled by [Fate Intertwined Umbrella] are still firmly in Natsuno-san&#8217;s heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would have been perfect if Akitsu-san had fallen together with her, but&#8230;&#8230;it can&#8217;t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, Akitsu-san doesn&#8217;t seem to show that face in front of Natsuno-san, so let&#8217;s try to keep things as civil as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Anyway, let&#8217;s go to school, shall we?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh&#8230;&#8230;yeah.we should”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, right~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them stopped fighting at my words and nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We went straight to school in a good atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘…..I wonder how Sensei&#8217;s attitude has changed.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Morning classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a successful journey to school, I took my seat and glanced at my watch as I removed my pencil case and other items from my bag.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are only five minutes left until morning homeroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei will be entering this classroom soon.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I think the probability of my plan succeeding is pretty low&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a rather naive idea to solve the problem by simply having a dream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I’ve made many appeals during the time of the [Nightmare Inducing Bell], it was still just a dream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no guarantee that Harumachi-sensei will take it seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is also risky to say such a line without using the [Nightmare Inducing Bell].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei seems to have a very strong sense of ethics as a teacher, and if she is pressed too hard by me, she will most likely be stubborn in her attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be better to show in her own dream and make her think, [Maybe that&#8217;s what Saino really thinks&#8230;&#8230;.?] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if just showing her in a dream doesn&#8217;t work, next time I&#8217;ll try appealing to her while she&#8217;s still conscious.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Incidentally, Fuyushima-san, who sits next to me, is exactly the same as usual, standing quietly with her back straight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no sense that she is paying attention to me at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The effects of yesterday&#8217;s handjob and blowjob were nowhere to be seen.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hmmm, incredibly cool.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With so little change, I&#8217;m starting to suspect that all that pleasure and beautiful nudity was just a hallucination I had on my own.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kinkonkankon</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about it, the chime finally sounded in the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s time for the morning homeroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the classroom door does not open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei is always punctual&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The classroom begins to buzz slightly at Sensei&#8217;s absence and everyone looks at each other in unison.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every student has a worried look on their face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, Harumachi-sensei is much adored by the students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five minutes had probably passed since then.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, the classroom door rattled open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go, good morning, everyone&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The classroom became quiet and still.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who entered was Harumachi-sensei, whom everyone had been worried about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, everyone in the classroom realised that something was wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Se, sensei &#8230;&#8230;what&#8217;s wrong&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san, the chairperson of the committee, asked on behalf of the class.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The students watched with bated breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s clear to anyone that there was something wrong with Harumachi Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why aren&#8217;t you wearing a jersey today, &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s right, Harumachi-sensei was not wearing her usual jersey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing a cream blouse and a long burgundy skirt.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/7.png"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wears fashionable heels instead of the usual athletic shoes.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, she seems to be wearing a lot of make-up.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;beautiful.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I naturally felt this way when I saw her dressed up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was attractive enough in her jersey but her current appearance, properly groomed, has a different destructive power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is an elegant beauty and a mature sexuality in full flow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels like all the potential that Sensei originally had has been released.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A fan club could be launched today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you know&#8230;..I thought I should get my clothes and stuff right.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei glances at me as she says this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she’s quite concerned about how she looks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little lost but I didn&#8217;t speak out, only moved my mouth and said, [It&#8217;s gorgeous].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei hides behind the teaching table, her face turning red as if she had exploded.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A slight [Uuuu&#8230;&#8230;!] can be heard, but was that just a moan?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The students in the classroom all seem to be wondering at Sensei’s sudden strange behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Sensei doesn&#8217;t come out of the teaching table easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that what I did earlier had shaken Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s heart a lot.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The dream effect is more powerful than I thought. &#8230;..’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s obviously strange appearance gives me such conviction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly fashionable and this embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By all accounts, this is a maiden in love.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that saying [I like you] and [I love you] a lot has worked quite well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Sorry, I forgot to mention this on last chapter that during the sex, Saino used Sukidesu &amp; Aishitemasu]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had always seemed to like me but perhaps that faint feeling of love has become completely real because of the dream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, the main purpose was to get her to keep the labyrinth a secret.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, I&#8217;m glad the dream worked. By the looks of it, maybe she&#8217;ll listen to my request to keep the labyrinth a secret. &#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh in the buzzing classroom and felt a bit of relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, her attitude has changed dramatically and she won&#8217;t forbid me to explore as forcefully as she did yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, if I press her harder, it may be possible to raise my level further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Se,Sensei, are you okay&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu&#8230;..uuuu&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san is worried about Harumachi-sensei and goes to the teaching table to talk to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only thing that can be heard is an embarrassed moan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei continued to cower behind the teaching table for about five minutes, after which she finally gave a faltering morning call.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the classroom was buzzing throughout the morning with shocking events, classes went on without a hitch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing all classes for today.Like my classmates, I packed my bags and got out of my seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I intend to visit Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder how much change in her attitude on exploring the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to make sure I get it right and if possible, I want to make a promise of confidentiality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is something that should be done well for the future.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘….okay’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made up my mind and left the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this time of the day, Harumachi-sensei should be in the teacher&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I trudged down the corridor to the ground floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The school building is not that big, so it&#8217;s a short walk to the teachers&#8217; room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon I reached the front of the teachers&#8217; room.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Fuuu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a quick breath, I put my hand on the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I rattled it open with a slight nervousness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me. Um, is Harumachi-sensei here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I call out into the room, there is one teacher who blatantly jumps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course it is Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She unnaturally turns her face away from me but perhaps she is pretending not to notice?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But her ears are red and I can see she&#8217;s totally embarrassed by me visiting here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked up to Sensei and called out to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Sensei , I&#8217;d like to discuss something with you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.No.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, don’t worry, it&#8217;ll be over soon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei refuses my request with her face turned away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to persist, but Sensei&#8217;s attitude did not change and she never looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, Sensei&#8217;s hand moved quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ummmm…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei offered me a sheet of paper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A paper of an A4 in size.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a blank sheet of paper with nothing written on it. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;What does she want with this?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was still puzzled, Sensei finally said in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“p,please speak in writing”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.I understand.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let&#8217;s see, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">『Could you please reconsider that place?　I like that place.』</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;should I write something like this??’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Borrowing a pen from the desk, I wrote my question about the labyrinth on the paper, blurring it appropriately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then presented it to Sensei, who had previously kept her face averted and showed her the contents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei runs her pen just below my writing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her brushstrokes are free of hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she had thought of something beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The paper was immediately held out in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The written reply was──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;!!?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look up at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s answer, written just below my question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was unexpected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『You can go there, but take me with you.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Se,sensei, are you serious&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, Harumachi-sensei nodded with her face still turned away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She takes the paper away and adds a further sentence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It is the teacher&#8217;s duty to protect the safety of the students.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;haaaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I sighed, Sensei&#8217;s pen ran over the paper again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s tremendously fast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, a piece of paper was held out in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;ll definitely follow you. From now on, I&#8217;ll go to Saino&#8217;s house every day after school.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeeee&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help but let out a voice of bewilderment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s good that she will keep the labyrinth a secret but now, she will insist on accompanying me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s true that two people are more powerful than one, but&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s quite dangerous, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Because it&#8217;s dangerous,I&#8217;m going with you.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her sentence immediately came back to me and I could no longer do anything but to agree with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei had a point.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Seriously &#8230;&#8230; this Sensei is&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out another sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei&#8217;s demands can’t be denied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei’s maximum concession plan is probably this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.I. understand. But please start tomorrow. I have a lot to prepare.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei nodded silently at my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t see her face, but she looks somewhat happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she is looking forward to exploring with me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei seems so optimistic, even though a battle with a monster awaits her.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But how should I fool her about the items?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll have to think about that properly by tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, even if she’s in love with me, it&#8217;s not impossible that she could find out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, I&#8217;m leaving now. Pardon me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our conversation was settled for the time being, so I bowed and headed towards the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei, still turned her face away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the teacher&#8217;s office feeling indescribable at the sight of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I accepted her offer to accompany me, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s possible to explore with me when she can&#8217;t even see my face. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Well, shall I go back home?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After accepting Sensei&#8217;s offer to accompany me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went right home and stood at the entrance to the underground labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn&#8217;t wearing my usual gear, just my normal clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s also something I don&#8217;t wear very often.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I go straight into the stone corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My shoes are worn-out athletic shoes, so the scaffolding feels different from usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ease of movement is not bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, I see the stairs leading down to the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a slight hesitation, I step out and slowly take the steps one by one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m still nervous, sweat is oozing and my hands are shaking slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is no wonder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a suicide to enter a monster&#8217;s den without proper equipment and weapons.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not impossible to fight with a torch, but the danger is still several times greater than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I had to be sure of something&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomorrow, Harumachi-sensei will accompany me on my exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that has happened, there is one thing that needs to be done at the very least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arriving at the first floor, I took a deep breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, instead of taking the direct passage to the second floor, I walked to the passage on the right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could say that the second floor is fine, but if anything, the first floor is more suitable for verification.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pain may not be needlessly great.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Continuing to follow the right-hand method down the passage, I finally find what I&#8217;m looking for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About ten metres ahead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a huge, beautiful flower there that I had seen before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The [Blue Rose].</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Lv. &#8230;&#8230;4? My lvl is 8, so I guess I&#8217;m a reasonably good opponent’.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I checked my enemy and my Lvl and nodded to myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday&#8217;s sex with Sensei raised my Lvl by one from 7 to 8.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I fought normally, this blue rose would have no chance to win.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for now, victory is not the goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, I’m looking for an enemy who could do moderate damage to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“SHU!? SHUUUUUUUUUU!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blue rose notices me and squeals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems to be moving towards me, albeit quite slowly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked up to the blue rose, unprepared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“SHUUUUUUUUUU!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I get close, the blue rose tendrils hit me like a whip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s quite painful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is the shock of being hit, but at the same time the spikes on the vines seem to be cutting through my skin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can see some cuts on my arms and my clothes are a little torn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I keep going and continue to resist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This pain is what is needed for confirmation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“SHUUU! SHUUUU! SHUUUU!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blue rose mercilessly attacks me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kept receiving the one-sided attacks, while blocking my face only.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, it hurts alot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My clothes are falling apart so fast and I&#8217;m covered in blood all over my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m so glad I wore my lousy clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After about ten more minutes of being attacked, I still withstand the pain.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I wonder how much blood I&#8217;m leaking?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It might have flowed enough to get a blood test.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve got scratches all over the place and if anyone saw me they would scream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I kept holding out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be pointless if I stopped here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“SHUUUUUUUUUU!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A loud cry is heard from the blue rose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its vine strikes vigorously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily grit my teeth at the shock and pain, and then-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Ah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A stunned voice escapes from my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blue rose that should have been in front of me was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scenery has changed from before, and looking back, I can see the entrance to my basement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; Apparently, this is the entrance to the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;is this the forced transfer?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While muttering this, I checked my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are no wounds anywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, my clothes, which should have been in tatters, are back to normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It appears that I have completely returned to the appearance before I entered the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While checking for any abnormalities,I nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I wanted to make sure of was confirmed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The experiment was a success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;.That’s right, what I wanted to find out was the specifications of this forced transfer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The description of the forced transfer in the diary was ambiguous in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How much damage does it take to cause a forced transfer?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What will happen to the wounds sustained?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Will the wounds on the equipment remain?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And in the first place, does forced transfer really occur?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without resolving these questions, it is impossible to let Harumachi-sensei enter the dungeon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday I didn&#8217;t have time to verify it and I had no choice but to explore with her, but from tomorrow onwards I will accompany her every day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I needed to make sure it was safe.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..At any rate, it seems that the wounds don&#8217;t leave any scars. Come to think of it, the wounds I&#8217;ve received in the past have gone away before I knew it&#8230;&#8230;Maybe the dungeon has a mechanism to heal wounds&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still don&#8217;t know the principle behind it but it seems that safety is ensured in this labyrinth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this is the case, there should be no problem in exploring with Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuu&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to the living room, where I finally relaxed my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the forced transition was confirmed, it was a tough process.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than enough time was spent in constant pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like I was being tortured.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to praise myself for not running away halfway through.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Maybe I&#8217;ve grown quite fond of Sensei, too&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think about such things in a daze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, while I was being attacked by the blue rose, I kept thinking about Harumachi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All this pain was also for the safety of Harumachi-Sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was because I was thinking that way that I felt I was able to endure until the end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, how can I hate someone who thinks so much of me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down deeply on the sofa and let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I closed my eyes and relaxed my whole body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel terribly sleepy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it because I&#8217;m tired from the confirmation I just did or is the sleepiness coming at the cost of forced transfer?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Either way, I have no problem falling asleep like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went straight into a deep sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, Friday morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finished getting ready to go to the school and went out the front door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san and Akitsu-san are nowhere to be seen today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a bit sad, but it might be a bit easier and better to go to school without being wary around Akitsu-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went straight to the school by myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But during the journey to school, I witnessed something strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A little further on, behind a vending machine on the side of the road.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A small girl in school uniform was hiding there, looking in the direction of the school opposite to ours.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Isn’t that Natsuno-san&#8230;&#8230;? What is she doing&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That short height and ponytail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t see her face, but that is definitely Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what is she looking at by hiding herself?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed the direction of her gaze and tried to find out what Natsuno-san was looking at.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A main street where pupils walk sparsely on their way to school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is that&#8230;&#8230;Akitsu-san?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About 20 or 30 metres ahead of Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a back view of a girl in a school uniform, who at first glance could be recognised as glamorous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That overly fleshy body and softly gathered side-tail could only be Akitsu-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her buttocks are big and her legs are plump, so just the back view of her walking is erotic.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;But why is Natsuno-san following Akitsu-san?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They’re best friends and if there is something she wants to ask her, she can ask her frankly&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was unsure what to do so I crept up to Natsuno-san, treading my footsteps lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; good morning, Natsuno-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyah!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san bounces her body amusingly at my greeting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face turns to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sa, Saino&#8230;.!!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Correct. So, what are you doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Er,um,&#8230;..a, anyway, hide yourself too, Saino!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While looking at me as if in a panic, Natsuno-san dragged me into the shade of the vending machine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then quickly looked towards Akitsu-san and let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank goodness, it looks like she hasn&#8217;t found out&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Natsuno-san, why are you following Akitsu-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was also doing the same thing, observing Akitsu-san&#8217;s back and asking Natsuno-san about her reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san choked on her words for a moment in response to the question and explained in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..she&#8217;s been weird lately. She seems to be having a lot of fun or&#8230;..more lively or something&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you&#8217;re trying to find out what&#8217;s causing it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Yes, I have some idea&#8230;.of what&#8217;s going on but at the same time I don&#8217;t&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san glanced at me and blurted out her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing that, I somehow understood why she was following her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it&#8217;s a bit of a self-conscious guess, Natsuno-san probably suspects that Akitsu-san has also fallen in love with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it can be many things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s the one who suggested we share an umbrella and tried to go to school with me in the mornings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back, Akitsu-san&#8217;s behaviour certainly doesn&#8217;t look like an attack on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even more so she seems to be having fun with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;But in reality, she&#8217;s just curious about the secret I&#8217;m harbouring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve been using the [Fate Intertwined Umbrella] for ten minutes, so I can&#8217;t say that she’s not in love with me at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think you need to worry about it too much, don’t you think?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh, why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, sort of, but&#8230;..”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san looks at me as if she wants to say something, as I can&#8217;t clearly say why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An anxious look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently I&#8217;ve got more serious worries than I think I have.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..should I reassure her a bit about this? Well, I can&#8217;t say that much, but&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I like you, Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I tell her that, perhaps Natsuno-san&#8217;s anxiety will blow away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I intend to continue to do erotic things with other girls, so a confession is too risky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not like I seriously like Natsuno-san.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hmmm, then how should I say it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think of appropriate lines in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is difficult to come up with a good one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m not interested in Akitsu-san. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just as I was thinking about it, a plan popped into my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, that item is perfect for this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Natsuno-san, come with me for a minute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grab Natsuno&#8217;s arm and walk in the opposite direction of the school, towards my own home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san sounded confused, but for the time being she did not resist and followed me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t &#8230;&#8230; clearly say [I love you].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But with that item, I can say those words as much as I want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Nightmare Inducing Bell]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that item at home, I can show Natsuno-san a good dream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, um,&#8230;&#8230;this is Saino&#8217;s house, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I forgot something. I&#8217;m sorry I brought you here by force.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye,yeah&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Approximately five minutes after the chance encounter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We reached the front of my house, where I finally turned around and gave Natsuno-san an explanation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a terribly inadequate explanation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably has no idea why she was brought here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Natsuno-san just nodded her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face is bright red and she is apparently quite embarrassed by the fact that I kept holding her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She can barely reply, it feels like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since you&#8217;ve come all this way, why don&#8217;t we enter together? I would feel bad to make you wait outside…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh,Eeeeeeeh!? B,but….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s okay, it&#8217;s okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san looks up in surprise and panics but I forcibly pull her by the hand and lead her to the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is stuttering about something but this is probably because she is unable to say that she is not ready to go up to the house of the person she likes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, such a line is not something I could ever say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she can&#8217;t resist me, partly because of her weakness in love.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu&#8230;.. h,how did this happen&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san whispered shyly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pull Natsuno-san and bring her inside the house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s not much time before school starts and if I use the [Nightmare Inducing Bell], I might be a little late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Natsuno-san&#8217;s sake, it would be better to finish as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took Natsuno-san straight into the living room and sat her down on the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then wait for a moment, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U,Un&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my words, Natsuno-san nodded in a terribly nervous manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s like a small animal frightened of its natural enemy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sofa looks bigger than usual because she has shrunk even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left Natsuno-san and hurried to my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I took out the [Nightmare Inducing Bell] from the desk drawer and quickly turned back to the living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart rate is rising in anticipation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the first time I&#8217;m doing something erotic with Natsuno-san, so I&#8217;m excited in that sense too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a breath, prepared myself and stepped into the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, sorry to keep you waiting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ye,yea&#8230;&#8230;.what&#8217;s that?”</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san nodded her head vigorously, but immediately turned her head to look at what I was holding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I only replied appropriately, [Oh, don&#8217;t worry about it] and then-&#8230;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaーn &#8230;&#8230;.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a pair of scissors from the stationery stand, she struck the [Nightmare Inducing Bell].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, the light from Natsuno-san&#8217;s eyes suddenly disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no emotion in her expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s the same as the previous time, the state of unconsciousness has been successfully completed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bell that should have been in my hand has suddenly disappeared.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Did it disappear because the number of times it could be used had been used up?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a way to disappear, befitting the name of the item, as if its existence had been a dream.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, anyway&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put the scissors on the desk and approach the sofa on which Natsuno-san is sitting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now Natsuno-san is in a state of complete unconsciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will not be held accountable for any acts I’m gonna commit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I smack her on the head, she won&#8217;t say anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I would never do such a thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I brought my face close to Natsuno-san for the time being and made eye contact with her head-on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san. I like you, Natsuno-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Straight confession.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t mean to be completely lying but my heart aches a little at my irresponsibility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Natsuno-san still has an empty expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, she is unconscious, so there is no way she can react.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s as if I&#8217;ve confessed to a doll.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san, I like you. &#8230;&#8230; Nn&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I confess once more and kiss her gently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are soft and lush lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s lips were lovely but Natsuno&#8217;s were just a little less thick and wonderfully childish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a perfect description of a 『charming』 lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: The kanji used is kawairashi]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I still feel quite guilty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve never heard that she was dating anyone and this might be Natsuno-san&#8217;s first kiss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To take it away from her in an unconscious state is quite a sinful act.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san also likes me, so to some extent it may be forgivable. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well&#8230;&#8230;for now, Natsuno-san, this will give you some relief&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I breathe out a sigh in my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tonight, Natsuno-san will dream about this confession and kiss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she wakes up, she&#8217;ll think, [Did Saino really like me&#8230;&#8230;?] Or at least that&#8217;s what she&#8217;ll think.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least it won&#8217;t be negative thinking.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘After that&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I part my lips and glance at my watch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not even a minute has passed since I rang the [Nightmare Inducing Bell].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was plenty of time to do something else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my heart pounding and I went straight to Natsuno-san&#8217;s breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I gently rubbed that small bulge with both hands as if to wrap it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnn&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s nose lets out a slightly sexy breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in the same unconscious state, her reaction is better than Harumachi-sensei&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, it is not as big as Sensei but it seems to be more sensitive to compensate for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re so small and pretty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, nn&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue to whisper in her ear and rub her breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compliments are important.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially in Natsuno-san&#8217;s case, her best friend Akitsu-san has very fine ones so it is possible that she has a complex about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this gives her a bit of confidence, I&#8217;ll be happy too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also like small breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue to enjoy Natsuno-san&#8217;s modest breasts as much as I want.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have enough time so I have no need to rush it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, I had no intention of going as far as penetration here.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘As expected&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san has probably never had any male experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to deprive Natsuno-san of her first time and without her knowledge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san is completely in love with me, and it would be much better for both of us to have a lovey-dovey first experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I may have taken away her first kiss but virginity is indeed a different weight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And in fact, it seems quite hard to get the deed done with a virgin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no time for satisfactory foreplay and even penetration may be difficult due to lack of love juice.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..Still, I&#8217;m going to enjoy it as much as I can, though.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While inwardly sticking out my tongue, I unbutton Natsuno-san&#8217;s uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to see it and I want to rub them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This event will also appear in her dream and it should be okay to do something a little extreme.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And considering that I won’t insert it, I had plenty of time to do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to peel off her uniform,exposing her camisole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finished unbuttoning the buttons and rolled up the camisole without hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;it,it’s a cute bra.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I exclaimed unintentionally and quickly followed up in a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s bra came out from under her camisole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was clearly not something a girl of this age would wear.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I wonder if this is called a junior bra…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ジュニアブラ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are no cups, just a piece of cloth softly encasing the breast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it felt a bit strange when I touched her over her clothes,but I didn&#8217;t realise she was wearing a junior bra. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, crucially, its design.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s junior bra had a certain distinctive decoration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A space in the middle of the breast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Mi, Miffa-chan &#8230;&#8230;!?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: The real name is </span><span style="font-weight: 400">ミッフィーちゃん</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> but as reference,the author change it to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">ミッファーちゃん</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. It’s a rabbit and a children&#8217;s book.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shock naturally made my hand that was rolling up her camisole tremble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s no wonder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the centre of her junior bra, there was a huge print of that national character that is so popular with young girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such a bra is not something a girl of her age would wear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The age range targeted by the manufacturer is probably almost ten years younger than Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san hates being called 『cute』, but she is wearing childish cloth with adorable tastes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, you like Miffa-chan…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried smiling while pulling a face but Natsuno-san was still unresponsive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is natural because she is in a state of unconsciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Natsuno-san is going to see this in her dream tonight. I wonder if she will be alright.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is easy to imagine Natsuno-san rolling around in agony the moment she wakes up.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘let&#8217;s pretend I didn&#8217;t see this bra.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel a little uneasy but then I get myself together and roll up Miffa-chan&#8217;s bra.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What emerges from underneath is a lovely bulge and a well-fitting light pink tip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The size of her breasts is marginally larger but I wonder if they are larger than Fuyushima-san&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see Fuyushima-san&#8217;s breasts were hard to massage compared to Natsuno-san’s breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maturity of Fuyushima-san underwear is greatly outmatched but Natsuno-san&#8217;s physical growth seems to be winning.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But the smell of crime also wins this one by a landslide…..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gulp down my spit and mutter to myself in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The size itself is a close battle but the sense of immorality is Natsuno-san&#8217;s overwhelming victory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Above all, her body is small.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san looks no taller than one hundred and fifty centimetres and her body shape is completely childlike.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I&#8217;m looking at something I shouldn&#8217;t be looking at.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Miffa-chan bra also reinforced this impression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out my smartphone out of my trousers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno&#8217;s young breasts, which do not match her age.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/8.png"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The miraculous sight of this being exposed naturally gave rise to a desire to record it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“let me take some pictures.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s expression remained blank and she didn&#8217;t react to my outrageous words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remain in place, holding her camisole and bra in place with one hand and my smartphone with the other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasha&#8230;!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Small, audible shutter sound can be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately checked my smartphone and found that the scene in front of me was well preserved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face and tits are perfect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks&#8230;&#8230;I surely treasure this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aware of the fact that I am acting suspiciously due to excitement, I thanked Natsuno-san, who remains in a state of unconsciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve got a really outrageous picture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to waste a shot but I&#8217;d like to get one out while looking forward to this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m feeling a little sore because I&#8217;m putting too much pressure on my meat stick.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..Well’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While putting my smartphone away in my trousers, I checked my watch again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The effect time of the [Nightmare Inducing Bell] is about five minutes left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I think about putting her clothes back on, I can still afford to have a bit of fun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I swallowed my spit and looked down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I&#8217;ve enjoyed the upper half of her body a lot already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the next one is&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsuno-san&#8230;.let me see a little bit of this one too&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While mouthing that to my unconscious partner, I slowly picked up the skirt of her uniform with my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unexpectedly, I gulped and swallowed my spit again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I lift my hand like this, I will certainly see her underwear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most important part is exposed.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don’t tell me, it&#8217;s Miffa-chan down there too…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have a bad feeling in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m getting quite worried that the same thing will happen with the bra.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I don&#8217;t think I have a choice not to see it after coming this far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly, I lifted the hem of her skirt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What came out was…</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Thank goodness, it&#8217;s normal underwear!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The important part at the base of my thighs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cloth covering it was much more normal than I had expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well,technically, it is still childish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The colour is white and normal but the material is cotton or fuzzy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;re not the kind of shorts you&#8217;d show a man but they&#8217;re normal shorts, for a change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Open your legs a bit, please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While calling out to her, I forced Natsuno-san, who was sitting on the sofa, to open her legs wide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Erotic crab legs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Natsuno-san remains unconscious, so she never tries to close her legs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tied the hem of her skirt together at the waist, her underpants were also left visible.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Now&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s secret place is completely unprotected except for her shorts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s such a given what I&#8217;m going to do from now on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I whispered to Natsuno-san, who still had an empty expression on her face, as I surrendered to my excitement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m going to look at Natsuno-san&#8217;s vagina. Don&#8217;t worry. I won&#8217;t do anything strange.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who says that I won’t do strange things?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was tempted to make a tsukkomi for myself but Natsuno-san still showed no reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if the person she loves is about to look at her important parts, she still can&#8217;t seem to do anything about it in her unconscious state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bring my hand, which is trembling with excitement, closer to the base of Natsuno-san&#8217;s leg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Suji&#8230;&#8230;’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">スジ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The word [suji] unexpectedly came to my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:word that refers to something that is long and narrow and has several lines in a row.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s vagina is closed perfectly even though her legs are open and I can&#8217;t think of any other way to describe it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, it&#8217;s a completely young secret place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not dark in colour at all, so it doesn&#8217;t look disgusting at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Really, it just looks like a single stripe on the skin.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Uu~n&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While looking at Natsuno-san&#8217;s secret place, I pondered for a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t have much time and decided to just watch and enjoy it since it was too erotic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The situation is certainly very arousing but Natsuno-san&#8217;s secret place is not so disgusting that it cancels it out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I was a severe lolicon, I might have been excited&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;it can&#8217;t be helped.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think about this and bring my fingers closer to Natsuno-san&#8217;s secret place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just looking at it from the outside, it is just a slit and not exciting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if I look into the mucous membrane inside, I will indeed feel the eroticism.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My fingers opened Natsuno-san&#8217;s labia to the left and right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s flirtatious flesh exposed before my eyes  and took my breath away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I had imagined&#8230;&#8230;No, even more than I had imagined, my heartbeat increased all at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the outside, Natsuno&#8217;s secret place is purity itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flesh inside is a surprisingly bright pink colour and the mere sight of it makes a complete difference to the impression of the secret place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite its outward appearance, which is just a little shabby, the inside is complex and a little grotesque.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found out that she does indeed function as a woman, and I felt a 『female』 vibe coming on at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">メス</span><span style="font-weight: 400">] [TL: Has two meaning, surgical knife and the name ‘female’ but used for animals]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, I bring my face closer to her secret place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to see it more closely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such a desire came naturally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And because Natsuno-san was still in an unconscious state, there was no way I could stop myself from doing so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I brought my face right up to the front of her secret place.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Uwa&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The indescribable smell of Natsuno-san&#8217;s secret place wafts into my nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel my head spinning with it, while I stare at the aphrodisiac flesh in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is still a very lecherous sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The small, impressionable young Natsuno-san hid this kind of place.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Someday, I&#8217;ll have mine inside here&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I imagine the insertion of my cock into her secret place. I gulp and swallow my spit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s vagina must be very narrow and tight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think about how good it would feel to ejaculate while tasting it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly regained my senses and pulled my face away&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The effect time of the [Nightmare Inducing Bell] will soon be over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I need to end the fun early and put Natsuno-san&#8217;s clothes back on.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Fuuu………’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While exhaling a sigh in my mind, I neatly put back her shorts, which were still turned up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I closed her legs back up as well, and next I put my hand on her bra, which had slipped up.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;. junior bras are easy to fix at times like this.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just by pulling it downwards, the miffed little bra easily returned to its previous state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a bit of trouble with Harumachi-sensei but this time it was very easy and helpful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put the camisole back on and fastened all the buttons of the uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In no time at all, the original Natsuno-san was completed.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;one minute left?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I checked my watch, nine minutes had passed since I rang the [Nightmare Inducing Bell].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The effect time has been long enough, so the unconscious state should continue for another minute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there is no way to disturb her clothes now, and it seems that she has no choice but to spend one minute in vain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, should I tell Natsuno-san that I like her for the rest of the time?</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; No, that would be boring’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at Natsuno-san with an empty expression on her face, I changed my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I&#8217;ve used the [Nightmare Inducing Bell], I should make better use of my time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should do as much as we can to enjoy ourselves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I put my head to work, I soon found a way to do that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A way to have fun without disrupting Natsuno-san&#8217;s clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve seen Natsuno-san&#8217;s, so I&#8217;ll show you mine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, I pulled down the zipper of my trousers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then took out the still erect meat stick from inside and thrust it in front of Natsuno-san as if to show it off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Yes, it is not only erotic to play with Natsuno-san&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s also exciting to show the naive Natsuno-san my dick in this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san is going to see this in her dreams tonight and just thinking about it gave me a lot of mental pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the time is up, I can just put away my cock or hide it somehow, so it may be excellent in that sense as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san just looks at the meat stick in front of her with a vague expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, she would have screamed but in this unconscious state she had no reaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I won’t shy away, so that she&#8217;ll be able to see my erect cock properly in her dreams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I like Natsuno-san, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s getting so big.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, I uttered such excuses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I just show it to her, my reputation will go down but if I say such a line, I might be able to prevent that a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s a dream after all, I probably don&#8217;t need to think too much about it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.Okay, time is up.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I check my watch and put my cock back in my trousers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One minute is a very short time, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It passed quickly, partly because I was enjoying myself in my own way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I leave Natsuno-san for the moment and return to the entrance to the living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I did so──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Aree?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sorry. I&#8217;ve already picked up the things I forgot, so let&#8217;s go to school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, ah&#8230;&#8230;yea,yeah”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san regains consciousness and nods at my words, twisting her head a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She does not appear to be embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all,she doesn&#8217;t seem to remember what happened during the unconscious state.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;m kind of looking forward to the next time we meet. &#8230;&#8230;I wonder how her attitude will change’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although there is of course some anxiety, I feel a little excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san will dream about what happened earlier tonight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dreams of being confessed to, being seen in embarrassing places, being shown a man’s flesh. I don&#8217;t think I could ever be normal after seeing something like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very least, I&#8217;d probably be sprawled out on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But well, tomorrow is Saturday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The school will be closed, so the next time I see Natsuno-san is on Monday, three days from now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be a little disappointing not to see her immediate reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san and I head straight for the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at my watch and saw that if I didn&#8217;t hurry, I might be late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just when I was about to tell Natsuno-san that──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Natsuno-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Natsuno-san has the same vague expression as in the unconscious state she was in earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately noticed the change and called out to Natsuno-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san then looked as if she had come to her senses and huffed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Eh? Ah, ah, sorry. I felt like I was being called by someone&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san&#8217;s words made me feel nervous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I felt like someone was calling me]&#8230;&#8230;As I recall, Harumachi-sensei also said something like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The same phenomenon is almost certainly what struck Natsuno-san just now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cause is completely unknown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the dungeon seems to be equipped with some kind of mechanism.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s just your imagination. I don&#8217;t have anyone at home right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so&#8230;&#8230;? For sure, I heard someone call me&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe you’re just tired Natsuno-san….such thing can happen”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.hmm, I guess so&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san looks confused by my excuses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she didn&#8217;t bother to argue with me and went straight to the front door.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ah, that was close&#8230;&#8230;.What&#8217;s that? She said he heard a voice calling her&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wipe a cold sweat coming out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following Harumachi-sensei, she was about to find out about the dungeon again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what the phenomenon is but it is quite dangerous to invite a girl home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I did bring them up to my house, I would have to work extra to be next to them all the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;&#8230; sorry to bother you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san finishes putting on her shoes and bows her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finally left the house and headed to the school with Natsuno-san like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, haa&#8230;&#8230; okay, safe&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, hah, hah&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s good&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san and I, who had run all the way here, were breathing unevenly but we both had a look of relief on our faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time on my wristwatch points to 8:29&#8230;.one minute before the start of morning homeroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were not late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The morning encounter and the subsequent ten minutes with the [Nightmare Inducing Bell].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we left the house and ran to the school to be on time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san is quite fast despite her small stature and I ran alongside her, matching her pace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is how I managed to get to the classroom before the chime rang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Fufu… I feel like I haven&#8217;t done anything like this in ages.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san laughs funny and talks to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks very happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to the physical exercise, she seems to be able to forget her shame towards me for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded and smiled back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Running to the school with a girl is quite a rare experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m saying it myself but I think I might be feeling quite youthful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, actually, I think I&#8217;m doing more than just youth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t know it but just now I got a direct look at both her breasts and her secret place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Natsuno-san has a fresh smile on her face but with just a little memory search, I can easily recall both her breasts and her pussy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I even know that she&#8217;s wearing a Miffa-chan bra.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walk into the classroom laughing at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after waving to each other lightly, we split into our respective seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chime rang and Harumachi-sensei entered shortly afterwards.</span></p>
