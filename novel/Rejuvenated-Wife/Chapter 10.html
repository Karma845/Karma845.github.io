<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Couples (Despite Reluctantly)</h3>

<p>It turned out that our goals were the same and we entered the manga cafe while competing.</p>
<p>At the same time, the clerk greeted us who arrived at the counter with a smile.</p>
<p>"Is it for two people?" [The Clerk]</p>
<p>""No, I'm alone!"" [Yuzu &amp; Kurose]</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. It's busy now and there is only one seat available." [The Clerk]</p>
<p>"Then give it to me!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"No, me!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Yield to me!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"You should be the one to yield! You have a lot of manga at home right?!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"But I want to spend my time at the manga cafe today!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Me, too! I've been fantasizing about reading some of the manga I've wanted to read since this morning!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Then, I'll lend you the manga I have at my house! So give me that places!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"It's true that I want to read all the manga on your bookshelf, but I hate the thought of having to borrow it from you!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"How do you know about the contents of my bookshelf?!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I saw it that time when I was allowed to shelter in your house from the rain!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Then, I'll give you the key, so go back to my house now! My family is out till night!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Why should I spend my time alone in your house?!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Because I want to play in manga cafe alone without you!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Excuse me. If you two knew each other, would you like to play on the shared chairs?" [The Clerk]</p>
<p>"What is a shared chair?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"What kind of chair is that?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's a couple's seat" [The Clerk]</p>
<p>""We're not a couple!"" [Yuzu &amp; Kurose]</p>
<p>"But even though it's called a couple's seat, it doesn't mean it's limited to couples." [The Clerk]</p>
<p>The clerk say it with a troubling expression. He look uncomfortable now.</p>
<p>"What should we do?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"What do you mean what should we do? I can't keep bothering the clerk, so I can't help but choose a couple's seat." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Is there another option beside that? It's uncomfortable without a barrier though I don't mean to talk while reading manga." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Me too. I also want to read manga in peace. That's why I went to the manga cafe." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"So, how many hours do you want to stay?" [The Clerk]</p>
<p>""Unlimited "" [Yuzu &amp; Kurose]</p>
<p>After that, we headed to our room after paying.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I've been visiting this manga cafe for a long time, but this is the first time I'm sitting in a shared chair. When I entered, it was a bit cramped for two people.</p>
<p>......Damn, I'm late!</p>
<p>While sitting on the sofa, Yuzu put down her bag and left quickly.</p>
<p>Just in case, I kept waiting Yuzu until she came back and when she's back, it was my turn to go pick a manga. And when I came back with the manga gag in my hand, Yuzu was wearing glasses.</p>
<p>"This is the first time I've seen you wear glasses." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Yeah." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I think it suits you." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Don't mind it." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"But it's true, right?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"That's right. I have poor eyesight, so I should wear glasses." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I like it. It's not a shameful thing to spend time wearing glasses." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"You care about it too much. But no one really cares about my appearance." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It's a matter of feeling. I can't go to school wearing these resemble gloves anyway." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Don't talk about glasses and thimble gloves in the same dialog. Even though I say that wearing glasses was embarrassing, but I still needed it." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's right. I've shown it to you many times before. Isn't that a bit weird?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"You're very persistent, you said it suits you." [Yuzu]</p><p>[TL: They're talking about gloves.]</p>
<p>"I'm not saying that it suits me." [Kurose]</p>
<p>Yuzu turned her face away and interrupted my words without permission and she began to continue reading.</p>
<p>Besides Yuzuhana, I also started reading manga.</p>
<p>At first, I was worried about Yuzuhana, but gradually, I became immersed in the manga&#8212;</p>
<p>"Ha ha." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"What?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Nothing. I'm just laughing." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Really?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"..." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"..." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"....Why?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I'm curious. What are you reading?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"This..." [Kurose]</p>
<p>When I showed her the page that made me laugh, Yuzuhana burst out laughing too.</p>
<p>"Ah, that's right. When will the anime be released?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It will be made within 5 years. I think all the people who working on the anime really have good eyes." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Hey, I heard there was a lot of censorship at first, but the content is interesting, wasn't it?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's true. I thought it was weird for me to laugh while reading manga that wasn't popular at all. But I was relieved when I saw Yuzu laughing at too." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I wonder if my stomach will be curly by then." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"By the way, you often suddenly laugh when you're sleeping." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"That's because it was hard for me to laugh when I was in college." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Back then, you were so crazy about it and said, 'Pinch my hand so I don't laugh anymore.'" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"That's quite useful." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It's useless. The pinch even didn't work to you" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"That's because your pinch doesn't hurt, I can't feel it." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Then, what's the point of me pinching you?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Forget it. Just leave the manga after you finish reading it. I want to read it that too." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Hey, what are you reading?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"This.." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Ah. I like the authors." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Yes, Especially the third volume. I can't wait to read more of it since I skipped it in the past." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I'm also worried about the outcome of the popularity of the vote." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"It will be announced next month, but currently, it will be announced 12 years later. Well, Antony has been decided to be number one." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"What? Isn't that Anju?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"That's a shounen manga, right? The main character definitely decided to be number one." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"In some cases, the heroine will be number one. Anju is really cute." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"It's true that Anju is the strongest and cutest, but she will lose the votes to Chloe and drop to fourth place." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Ah. That's right. But, it was Anju when the popularity voting deadline was almost over. When I saw it, I voted for Anju." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Wow, an epic comeback! .....It's a bit hot here, please turn on the AC." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It's not hot." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"It's hot." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Not too hot. if you think it's hot, then you should take off your cardigan." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Ecchi!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Im not ecchi!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Hentai!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I'm not hentai!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Really?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Okay, okay. I'll turn it on, so please concentrate on reading your manga." [Kurose]</p>
<p>Then I turned on the air conditioner and continued reading.</p>
<p>Cold air clung to my body and my body trembled.</p>
<p>"It's cold....." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Did you say something?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"No." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"You said it was cold, don't you?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"If you could hear it, why are you pretending not to hear?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Because you looked ignorant when I asked you about it. The AC is really cold, isn't it?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"You just overheated, didn't you? Can I turn off the AC?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"No. But, since the sweat on your hands will stain the manga, so I can't hold it in anymore. Here, I'll lend you my cardigan." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Are you serious?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Yeah. I can't read quietly if the person next to me is freezing. So, hurry up and put it on before you catch a cold." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Don't complain if my scent seeps into your cardigan, okay?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I'm not going to complain about it." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Okay. If you're cold too, please tell me straight away. If the person next to me is freezing too, I won't be able to read at peace." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"If that happens, I'll take it off the cardigan from you." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Ecchi!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I'm not ecchi!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Hentai!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I'm not hentai! Stop it, don't say stupid things anymore, put them on quickly!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." [Kurose]</p>

<p>When I put on the cardigan, a sweet scent comes along with it.</p>
<p>I continued reading while being enveloped by Yuzuhana's scent.</p>
<p>By the time I finished reading, I was starving, and I decided to bought some fries and went back to the couch.</p>
<p>"The smell seems to stick to my clothes." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"But you like it, right? Because you always order it every time you go to a family restaurant." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"At that time, I was self driving, so I could eat it without etiquette. But now, I'm going to get on the train, the people next to me will definitely think, 'Oh, this guy just ate fries.'" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Because the one sitting next to you is me, so I don't mind it." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"But still, it's embarrassing to think that someone else smelled fries from me." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I don't think so, French fries doesn't smell like that." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>Suddenly, she bring her face closer to me.</p>
<p>She snored slightly and her cheeks starting to turn red.</p>
<p>"Can I eat this?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"If you want to, please take it yourself." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Thanks!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Don't eat it all, okay?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I'm not that evil. Ahn...." [Yuzu]</p><p>[TL: She ask to be fed.]</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll feed you." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"If I take it myself, my hands will get dirty." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"So selfish." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"You said selfish again, right?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"No." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Yes&#8212;!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>I'm forcefully stuffed the fries into her mouth to silence her.</p>
<p>"With ketchup, too." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"..." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"You must be thinking that I'm a selfish woman right now, right?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"No." [Kurose]</p>
<p>After slathering ketchup on the fries, I brought it close to her mouth&#8212;</p>
<p>The fries fell on her dress.</p>
<p>(Sh*t....)</p>
<p>"Sorry!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"It's okay. You're not very good at feeding people. Even when I had a fever, you also fed me porridge, and ended up spilling it on my futon." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"To be more precise, it's because you blew on it while coughing." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I don't remember that because I had a fever at the time." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It was a pleasant memory, you asked me to be feeding you an apple and then I put it in your mouth as much as I could. I thought the apple would stick to your throat." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I guess it was because I had no appetite, so I tried to force it to swallow ... I'll prove it to you that I'm better at feedings, so open your mouth." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>She put a lot of ketchup and brought it into my mouth. But, the fries fell on my pants.</p>
<p>"What the&#8212;!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Sorry." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"See? You're not even good at feeding food either." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"No, I just can't do it right now. Because it's cold here and my body is shaking." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah. You're really good at making excuses." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"That's not an excuse! In fact, we haven't even draw yet! This doesn't count!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Oh, we're having a match, huh?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Do you want to run away from me, huh?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Who's running away? I'm going to do it, so let me feed you." [Kurose]</p>
<p>We brought the fries into each other's mouths and ate them in no time.</p>
<p>Although the winner hasn't yet been determined, but our stomach are full. And we didn't have a second round either, but just read manga until the sun goes down and enjoyed our time at the manga cafe.</p>
