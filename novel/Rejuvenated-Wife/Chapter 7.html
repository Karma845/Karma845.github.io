<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; The Quarrels Never End</h3>

<p>The first day of school after the acceptance ceremony.</p><p>My mother looked at me when I woke up in the morning with a surprised face.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's not usual for Kohei woke up before Sana-chan.</p>
<p>"Well, I decided to get up early to start high school."</p>
<p>"Hee, that because you promised to go to school together with Koikawa-chan, right?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>I woke up early because I don't want to get involved with her.</p>
<p>I heard that cooking, washing and cleaning would take a lot of time, so when she finishes everything, it was almost too late. In other words, if I had gone to school earlier, then I wouldn't have ran into Yuzu at the school entrance.</p>
<p>I had a dream of playing a game with Yuzu in excitement, but if I try not to run into her as much as possible, then that dream shouldn't appear again.</p>
<p>While I was eating, Sana came rubbing her eyes.</p>
<p>"Good morning."</p>
<p>"Good morning."</p>
<p>"Suddenly, I was expecting to see Onii-chan here."</p>
<p>"I'm really here, okay?"</p>
<p>"Onii-chan doesn't usually wake up early. Did you make an appointment with Koikawa-san?"</p>
<p>"That's not the reason..."</p>
<p>It's just, if I doesn't go to school now, I feel that I'll run into her at the shoebox.</p>
<p>After having a quick meal and getting ready, I left the house earlier than I had planned.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Under the blue sky, the road leading to the school wasn't too crowded.</p>
<p>It was the first student's job to unlock the class. So, I went to the staff room thinking that I was the first to arrive, but there was no key to my class.</p>
<p>(Did someone has to come so early? I'm impressed.)</p>
<p>When I entered the classroom while thinking about that.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Eh?"</p>
<p>There is a female student in the class.</p>
<p>It was Yuzu.</p>
<p>"I think I'm hallucinating seeing you because last night I dreamed of you."</p>
<p>"Too bad ... I'm a real person."</p>
<p>"Why are you up so early? I think you're always come late."</p>
<p>"I'm not late. I just came last. Did you leave today without doing any homework?"</p>
<p>"It used to take a lot of time, but I'm used to it because someone has forced me to do my homework."</p>
<p>"You're the one pushing yourself! I always take the trash out myself!"</p>
<p>"That's because you said, 'Just leave it to me.' Don't be arrogant just because you taking out the trash."</p>
<p>"But you always kiss me and saying, 'I'll give you a present.'"</p>
<p>"Oh, when was it?! Isn't that you who said, 'I'm going to kiss you.' before you go take out the trash?!"</p>
<p>"Just admit it! Don't complain to me when you're the one who asks for it!"</p>
<p>"That's because if I don't kiss you, you'll kiss me by force!"</p>
<p>"I'm not forcing you!"</p>
<p>"You insist!"</p>
<p>"I'm not forcing you! I've never kissed you just because i take out the trash! So there's no reason for me to force you!"</p>
<p>"But you did it!"</p>
<p>"When?!"</p>
<p>"When I have a fever!"</p>
<p>"If you have a fever, then it's natural for me to take out the trash, and you can't say that I forced it just because you were being weakened by the flu! In other words, it doesn't count!"</p>
<p>"But you clean the whole house only on holidays!"</p>
<p>"That's because you said, 'since Kouhei left for work early, so leave the cleaning to me.' so I cleaned it seriously only on my days off, to keep it clean!"</p>
<p>"That's because you said, 'unest everything with a vacuum cleaner because you have a lot of days off!'"</p>
<p>"But no matter how clean you did, the carpet is still dirty! If you roll it up, you'll be able to find a lot of hair on the adhesive tape!"</p>
<p>"That's because your hair fell out!"</p>
<p>"But it's not just my hair!"</p>
<p>"But 90% of that is yours! You always use hair growth agents because your hair has been falling out lately!"</p>
<p>"Then why?! It's because I'm stressed because of you!"</p>
<p>"If your stress is getting worse, then don't get involved with me anymore!"</p>
<p>"But you the one who started talking to me!"</p>
<p>"That's because you didn't come late!"</p>
<p>"You're the only one who should be late!"</p>
<p>"I don't like it. If I'm late, you'll definitely misunderstood me for a yankee!"</p>
<p>"Then do something for your appearance! If you wear contact lenses, it will look even better!"</p>
<p>"But I hate it when I put it in my eyes. I'm scared!"</p>
<p>"It's not scary, okay? I've shown it before and proved it doesn't hurt. Did I look like I was in pain?"</p>
<p>"Not at all, but it's a different story between seen and done!"</p>
<p>"Then why did you take off your glasses?! Why don't you dye your hair black?!"</p>
<p>"If I suddenly changed my character, it means I failed in making my high school debut, so it's a shame."</p>
<p>"The point is, this route will fail. Have you thought of it?!"</p>
<p>"I went to school early because I've been pondering. I thought someone would talk to me if I went on a serious route."</p>
<p>"Then it's you who should take the initiative!"</p>
<p>"I don't want to. That's embarrassing."</p>
<p>"But you weren't embarrassed when you were a receptionist at a big company until I finally came!"</p>
<p>"I'm the type of person who thinks about work and personal life separately. Even when I talked to you at university, I was really nervous at that time."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"You went crazy back then."</p>
<p>"If a girl suddenly talks to me, of course I'll go crazy."</p>
<p>"Very unmotivated."</p>
<p>"Don't say unmotivated. I mean, it's a bit different from last time. I was studying fashion at that time."</p>
<p>"What? Who do you think taught you fashion?! If I wasn't there, you would definitely dress like you did when you were in middle school at university."</p>

<p>"You don't know me in middle school!"</p>
<p>"But I know it! What photos do you think your mother showed to me?"</p>
<p>"She told you?!"</p>
<p>"Where did you buy those these resemble gloves?"</p>
<p>"Don't ask me!"</p>
<p>"What?! Don't shout at me!"</p>
<p>"That's because you're humiliating me!"</p>
<p>"But I didn't laugh when I saw your photo of middle school!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I was purposely acting stupid because I thought it was funny."</p>
<p>"You admit it! Why are you just saying that now?!"</p>
<p>"I think I'll be laughed at if I compliment my old looks. In fact, when I recommend a black-haired character in the anime, you tell me, 'Do you like this one?'"</p>
<p>"Oh, well it can't be helped! Because I liked you back then! But now it's different! I hope you like the black haired character and the spectacled character!"</p>
<p>"It's too late to reply now! Because of you, I fell in love with an unsightly brunette character!"</p>
<p>"Don't force that responsibility on me!"</p>
<p>"It's a bad thing if you have brown hair and bad eyesight! You keep saying, 'a black hair character or a glasses character?'"</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>"But, why is it all limited to 2D?"</p>
<p>"Because I didn't think that you would be able to have a 3D girlfriend!"</p>
<p>"I don't want to have one before I can finally get it! Well, I might get along well with Hagakure-san."</p>
<p>"Do you mean the quiet Hagakure?"</p>
<p>"That's right. I was a member of the library committee with Hagakure-san when I was a freshman. I think I can get along well with her because Hagakure-san is a hidden bookworm."</p>
<p>"Do you want to approach a high school girl? You pedophile!"</p>
<p>"No! I'm in her age now, so it's not a problem!"</p>
<p>"But your soul is an Oji-san!"</p><p>[TL: Uncle.]</p>
<p>"27 is not an Oji-san! Then you are an Oba-san who is cosplaying as a high school girl!"</p><p>[TL: Auntie.]</p>
<p>"Don't say that! I know that my uniform doesn't suit me even if you don't say it!"</p>
<p>"I'm not saying that it doesn't look right on me! If you're shy, then do something about the length of the skirt! What if another guy sees your panties?"</p>
<p>"A long skirt won't look like a sukeban in this look. You should also do something about your uniform. The top and bottom don't expand. Why did you buy one that's too big for you?"</p>
<p>"Because I thought I would grow taller!"</p>
<p>"Sorry, but you won't be able to reach 170 cm."</p>
<p>"I will drink milk every day and escape the 169 cm curse!"</p>
<p>"Do your best, okay. And please don't be in the library committee. Because I'm thinking of becoming a library committee."</p>
<p>"Why did you join the library committee too! Just join the same committee you did in your freshman year!"</p>
<p>"I don't like the athletic committee anymore. Since I can't do it, what's more I have to be a cheerleader at the athletics festival. But I'm too shy to scream."</p>
<p>"Even so, I won't let go of the library committee!"</p>
<p>"If you don't want to get involved with me, then choose another committee!"</p>
<p>"If you don't want to get involved with me&#8212;"</p>
<p>*guruguruguru</p>
<p>Classmates started coming to class and we started to stop talking.</p>
<p>Hagakure-san is characterized as a braided girl and wears black-dried glasses.</p>
<p>Our voices seemed to have reached the corridor and Hagakure-san who came to this deserted classroom said,</p>
<p>"Oh? Is it just my hallucination?"</p>
<p>Then, she sat down with an expression like "is that a ghost voice that only I can hear?" and she looked around the walls and ceiling with his eyes, and started reading a book restlessly.</p>
<p>The homeroom ran without any conversation between myself and Yuzuhana and the first hour was spent deciding the committee. Since I didn't intend to give it to Yuzu, so I ran for the library committee.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Hagakure-san became a member of the beauty committee and Yuzuhana and I became a member of the library committee.</p>
