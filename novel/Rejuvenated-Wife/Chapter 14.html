<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; Overnight</h3>

<p>Evening.</p>
<p>I paid a visit to Yuzuhana's house.</p>
<p>It was an apartment with an automatic lock.&nbsp; Which was rented out for 2 years as a new year's gift for her.&nbsp; It was a luxury to live alone as a child, but it would be better if they were stricter than allowing a girl to live alone.&nbsp; It is the property that gives such glimpses of intimacy.</p>
<p>Yuzuhana's hometown was a village.&nbsp; There was no high school there, so she came here after graduating from middle school.&nbsp; From the outside, her father seems indifferent, but I think he is a good father because in the end, he supports his daughter's life.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;As my father-in-law, there is none as unpleasant as him.</p>
<p>"Is uncle here?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Nope." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Is it possible if there will be a surprise visit from him?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Even if he tries to surprise me, the auto-lock will definitely reject him." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Is it possible for him to keep an eye on you near here?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Nope." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Eavesdropping device--" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"No! What kind of person do you think my father is?!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"An uncle who loves his daughter too much?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"That's true ... but, no matter how much he loves me, he will never install something like that. Don't worry, he won't come until summer vacation. I'm sure of that." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Why did he visit you so long?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Good morning emails are sent every morning, and it doesn't matter if he sees the two of us together. Because Kohei isn't my boyfriend or husband, aka just a friend." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"But, your friend is a man." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"So, do you want to dress up like a woman?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I dress up like a woman ... can I trick him like that?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I'm quite surprised that you have such a cute face. Why don't you just let me do your makeup?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>It was clearly a joke...</p>
<p>When we talked about uncle, unpleasant memories were revived, so maybe she was trying to divert the topic with a joke.</p>
<p>I wanted to avoid remember it either, so I decided to stop the conversation here.</p>
<p>We took the elevator and got off on the 5th floor.</p>
<p>Yuzu's room was in room 503.</p>
<p>"Please come in." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Excuse me&#8230;&#8230;" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>I used to come to Yuzu's room when I was in college, but this was my first time visiting a high school girl's room.&nbsp; As soon as the door was closed, and we were literally alone, the tension started to build.</p>
<p>I walked towards the living room while pounding.</p>
<p>The Nyan Star I picked was sitting on the sofa, which was big enough for one person.</p>
<p>"It's stained." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"It was a coffee spill." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Hmm?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I was hugging him while drinking it when I was watching anime. Then, suddenly a scary scene appeared and I was shocked by it." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Okay, stop it. I don't care anyway. Let's just watch it now." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>When we came here, I had been informed of her purpose of inviting me.</p>
<p>And that is watching anime...</p>
<p>It seemed she wanted to re-watch Kimiuta, so we rented it on the way home.&nbsp; I was planning to have dinner at the convenience store near Yuzu's house, but it seemed impossible to me to watch till the end.</p>
<p>I want to go home at 21:00, so I'll probably leaving on the first half of the anime.</p>
<p>"I would like to take a bath first." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Great, you invite a man over to your house, and then take a shower..." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Don't get me wrong! I just don't want to sweat!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I know, but you should be a little careful. Well, I don't misunderstand you, but if I were another man, then that person probably wouldn't be like me." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"You worry too much. I don't want to hang out with another man besides you. You can do whatever you want while you wait for me, but don't start watching it without my permission, okay? Because we'll be watching it together." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I know." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>Yuzu went to her room to get clothes and disappeared into the bathroom.</p>
<p>She asked me to do anything, but &#8230; I couldn't move around in a high school girl's room as I pleased, so I decided to watch the evening news program.</p>
<p>"Sorry to keep you waiting." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>Yuzuhana came out while letting out some energy.</p>
<p>She was wearing a jersey, but her flashy skin looked sexy.</p>
<p>She sat next to me and the scent of the shampoo that clung to her body spread.</p>
<p>It's too small for two people to sit on, so I moved to another place, and left her alone.</p>
<p>I took the juice and candy from the convenience store bag.</p>
<p>"...Hey, all the snacks you bought are sake snacks." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I buy it because of my old habits. You like it too, don't you? Cheese and jerky?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's true." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Then, that means it doesn't matter, right?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Because the snacks are like this, it make me want to drink beer..." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Yeah, I can't wait to grow up again." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Let's have a beer at a yakiniku restaurant." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Sure. I'm eagerly waiting five years from now!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's right! Let me take care of you, so you can drink in peace." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"What? I'm the one who should take care of you!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It's me!!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Well, at that time, we went out for drinks to celebrate the completion of my graduation thesis, didn't we? Do you remember that time?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Ah ... I don't remember anything after the third glass." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"At that time, you got drunk and started falling out in public!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Well, did I do that? Me?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I have to carry you all the time because you're drunk! "Oh, Yuzuhana, you are a beautiful woman!", "You really are my type!!", "Marriage is inevitable!", and so on!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"You didn't carry me, right?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I felt so embarrassed when I was cursed by you while screaming!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"If you say that, then you've done the same thing!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Huh?! I never did it, okay?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"You did it! When you were looking at the cherry blossoms when we were in our fourth year of college!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I-I don't remember." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It was a really hard times! Because you were so drunk that time &#8220;I won't move until Kohei kisses me.&#8221;, "Look at me, not the flower!&#8221;, &#8220;I want to get a permanent job at Kohei's office!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Hey, don't make it up! What a liar!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I'm not making up! How many times do you think I should kiss you then?!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"How many?!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"More than 50 times!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"No wonder my lips were tingling on the next day! So, it was you?!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It's your fault! Then, when are we going to start watching the anime if we keep fighting like this?!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"That's because you say wanted to drink beer! I would have started tuning in earlier if you hadn't started that topic!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>Yuzuhana started organizing DVDs.</p>
<p>She sat next to me and watched the anime that started playing.</p>
<p>I couldn't concentrate at first because of the quarrel just now, but &#8230; I was gradually getting immersed in Kimiuta's world.</p>
<p>The live scene ends, and the serious period continues. The serious period ends, and the slice of life begins.</p>
<p>Since it's a good time to stop, so I think I should go home now&#8213;&#8213;</p>
<p>*dug</p>
<p>Yuzu leaned on my shoulder.</p>
<p>She fell asleep comfortably.</p>
<p>Maybe I should move her to the bed...</p>
<p>I switched the anime to a news program and turned down the volume.</p>
<p>Relaxing time passed and I was also getting sleepy.</p>
<p>"...I'm sorry, Kohei ... sorry..." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>When I was almost sleepy, Yuzuhana muttered in a small voice.</p>
<p>Since we just argued before, is she dreaming about our quarrel?</p>
<p>Yuzu, who said an apology, had a very painful face.</p>
<p>"...It's okay. I'm sorry too." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>I whispered back to her with gently voice.</p>
<p>Then, Yuzu smiled happily.</p>
<p>I can't wake up from here if you show such a happy sleeping face.</p>

<p>Because I didn't know when she would wake up, so I called my mom and saying, "Maybe, I'll be home late today."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"&#8230;&#8230;Hmm." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"...Are you awake?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Sorry, I fell asleep ... what time is it?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"The date just changed." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Well, did I sleep for so long? You should have woken me..." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I couldn't wake you up because you slept too well." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Then, you should just head straight home." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I don't have the key. I can't leave the door open." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"That's not a problem. It's an automatic lock." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That doesn't guarantee your safety, okay? Since you live alone as a girl, you should be more careful." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Are you worried about me?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I should have worried about you. Because I am your friend. Since you're awake, so I'm going home." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>When I stood up, she grabbed my clothes.</p>
<p>She looked at me, who was confused, with lonely eyes.</p>
<p>"...Don't leave." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Don't leave? Are you afraid of sleeping alone?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Hmm, hmm...! If you go out in the middle of the night, you must be accompanied!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"...Oh, that's right." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>I'm a high school student now.</p>
<p>"But ... is it okay if I stay over?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Yeah, because we're friends." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Thank you. Then, allow me to stay here." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Okay, you can take a shower over there. I don't have any men's underwear, but I can lend you a t-shirt. You haven't changed much in size, have you?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Y-Yes..." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>One day, my dream of becoming 170 cm will definitely come true!</p>
<p>Then, Yuzu gave me a jersey.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll take a shower first." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Yeah ... and you can come to my room when you're done showering." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Your room ... are we going to sleep in the same bed?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Yes, because sleeping on the couch seems to hurt your joints. Since you've already done what I wanted to do today, so take it as a thanks." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"...Okay. I'll go to your room when I'm done showering." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>I received a towel and jersey from Yuzu and went to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I took a quick shower and went to her room when I was refreshed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, my heart screamed. I gently opened the door ... because the room was dark.</p>
<p>"...Are you still awake?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"...I'm still awake. Come in." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Oh, I see ... good night." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Yeah, goodnight." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>Of course, I can't sleep...</p>

<p>I was only able to sleep after the sunlight entered the window.</p>
