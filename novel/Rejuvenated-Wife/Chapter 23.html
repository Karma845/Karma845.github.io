<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; It's Boring Without You</h3>

<p>A week has passed since Golden Week ended.</p>
<p>Today is Friday. I thought it was going to be the same day as usual, with no events, but...</p>
<p>"......Huh?"</p>
<p>When I entered the classroom, I couldn't find Yuzu.</p>
<p>I waited for a while, but there was no sign of her coming back from the bathroom.</p>
<p>Yesterday after school, we enjoyed a racing game at Yuzu's house. We left around 9:00 p.m. after a meal break, and when ...... I was about to leave, she said, "It's not fair to win and run away!&#12288;Stay the night!" and maybe I overslept because I was so frustrated and practiced late.</p>
<p>Finally, when the chime rang, she didn't show up, and Sawashiro-sensei came over.</p>
<p>She tells us, "Koikawa-san is absent because of a cold."</p>
<p>I try not to talk to her in school, but there is a big difference between having her around ...... and not.</p>
<p>The day without Yuzu is very boring and I can't concentrate on my classes because I'm worried about her.</p>
<p>I don't know if Yuzu feels the same way as I do ..... but we've been spending a lot of time together lately. It must be boring to be alone. I might go visit her.</p>
<p>So after school ... I sent a text message to Yuzu, with my classmates packing their textbooks in their bags by my side.</p>
<p>[Hey there, how are you feeling?]</p>
<p>Normally I would get a reply right away, but after waiting five minutes, I haven't heard from her.</p>
<p>As I got up from my seat to wait for a call as I left, my phone finally vibrated.</p>
<p>[Tight.]</p>
<p>That's a very simple reply......</p>
<p>Even from the shortness of the text, I could tell that she was feeling lazy.</p>
<p>[Shall I go visit?]</p>
<p>[You don't have to come. You might catch a cold too.]</p>
<p>[It's all right. You know what they say, stupid people don't catch colds, right?]</p>
<p>[Indeed.]</p>
<p>You honestly admit it, huh......?</p>
<p>Well, it's okay.</p>
<p>[Can I get you anything?]</p>
<p>[I want some fruit.]</p>
<p>[Ryokai!]</p>
<p>I put my cell phone in my pocket and leave the school in a hurry.</p>
<p>I stop by the supermarket and buy a can of peaches, a banana, yogurt, and a sports drink. Instead of stopping at home, I go straight to Yuzu's apartment.</p>
<p>At the entrance, I enter the room number and press the chime. "I'll leave the door unlocked." a nasal voice said.</p>
<p>I get on the elevator and go to Yuzu's room.</p>
<p>"Sorry to bother you. ......Yuzu~?"</p>

<p>"......This way."</p>
<p>I heard a small voice.</p>
<p>I entered the living room and found Yuzu sitting on the sofa.</p>
<p>She was wearing a jersey. Her face was flushed, and her hair was a mess, as if she had been sleeping a while ago.</p>
<p>Seeing her tight figure makes my heart ache.</p>
<p>"How are you feeling?"</p>
<p>"Still tight. .......Are you sure you won't catch a cold?"</p>
<p>"I'm fine. I'm an idiot."</p>
<p>"That's not a superstition."</p>
<p>"Then why did you agree on e-mail?"</p>
<p>"Because ...... I was lonely. ......"</p>
<p>"Then I was right to come. Did you eat lunch?"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't ....... I've been asleep since this morning."</p>
<p>"Sorry. My text woke you up."</p>
<p>"No need to apologize. I'm glad you came. What did you get me?"</p>
<p>"Canned peaches, bananas, yogurt, and a sports drink."</p>
<p>"Thanks. I'll pay for it."</p>
<p>"No, thanks. I'll use your kitchen."</p>
<p>"Sure. The can opener's on the first shelf in the cupboard."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>I transfer the peaches and bananas to a plate, pour yogurt over them, fill a glass with a sports drink, and take them to the table.</p>
<p>Noticing that Yuzu has moved to the end of the couch, I sits down in the little space available.</p>
<p>"......Can you feed me like you used to?"</p>
<p>"Of course. Here, open your mouth."</p>
<p>"Mmm. It's ...... delicious."</p>
<p>"That's good."</p>
<p>She looks rather sluggish, but she seems to have an appetite, which is a relief.</p>
<p>She eats everything, albeit at a slow pace, then puts away the dishes and returns to the couch.</p>
<p>"How high the fever?"</p>
<p>"My fever is ...... but this morning it was 37.6 degrees Celsius."</p>
<p>"I think it's a little higher. Where is the thermometer?"</p>
<p>"It's on the bed ...... by my bedside."</p>
<p>"It's under your pillow."</p>
<p>"I'm sweating, so don't smell it too much, okay?"</p>
<p>"I'm not going to do that."</p>
<p>I go to the bedroom to get the thermometer and hand it to Yuzu.</p>
<p>Yuzu then took off her jersey. Her collarbone and cleavage were moist and sweaty, and the shape of her breasts were clearly visible in her underwear, as if she was wearing no bra.</p>
<p>Pang-pang!</p>
<p>I slapped my cheeks as hard as I could to drive away my worries.</p>
<p>"Why are you slapping your face?"</p>
<p>"I'm praying for Yuzu's cold to heal quickly!"</p>
<p>"If you don't clap your hands and beg ...... you'll turn red, right?"</p>
<p>"Not as red as Yuzu."</p>
<p>Crackle.</p>

<p>"Why are you clapping your hands?"</p>
<p>"I prayed that Kohei's face would get better soon."</p>
<p>"That way you make it sound like I'm ugly......."</p>
<p>"I like your face, Kohei."</p>
<p>I'm not sure about that. I hope so ...... anyway, let's take her temperature quickly.</p>
<p>I put the thermometer under her arm and waited for a while.</p>
<p>The thermometer beeps.</p>
<p>When I asked it to show me, it was 38.2 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>"That's high. .......If you want to go to the hospital, I'll call you a cab."</p>
<p>"No. I'll stay at home."</p>
<p>"Then go back to sleep."</p>
<p>"......Will you stay by my side until I fall asleep?"</p>
<p>Yuzu has become a pampered child, perhaps because she is weak from a cold.</p>
<p>I was happy to be asked to do something for her, so I readily agreed.</p>
<p>I tuck Yuzu into bed and sit down on a chair. She beckons me to come closer, and I sit down beside her on the bed.</p>

<p>I'm in full pampering mode today.</p>
<p>"Since we're here, shall I sing you a lullaby?"</p>
<p>"No, I'll give you a 59."</p>
<p>I was joking, but he hit me with a strong, straight punch.</p>
<p>The second song would have been a 62 ......</p>
<p>"Sleep well today, and get over your cold as soon as possible. My life so boring without Yuzu."</p>

<p>"Yeah. I'm also bored if I don't see Kohei either. Thanks for coming over today."</p>
<p>"No problem. I'm sure we'll have fun after you get over your cold. Is there some place you want to go?"</p>
<p>Yuzu looked up at the ceiling with a blank stare and seemed to be thinking about where she wanted to go.</p>
<p>Then, as if an idea came to her, she blurted out, "I want to go to a bar."</p>
<p>"A bar? ......We're high school students. I mean, Yuzu, were you interested in bars or something?"</p>
<p>"Because Kohei took me there......."</p>

<p>"Oh~......Well, I went once."</p>
<p>I decided to grow up and consume my first alcoholic beverage at a bar to commemorate my coming of age.</p>
<p>I couldn't get used to the stylish atmosphere, and that was the only time I went to a bar.</p>
<p>But I was so happy to celebrate my anniversary with Yuzu.</p>
<p>"Shall we try again when you come of age?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm looking forward to turning 20."</p>

<p>"Me too. So, where else do you want to go?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'd like to go to ...... park."</p>
<p>"Park?"</p>
<p>A bar, then a park ... that's quite a swing.</p>
<p>I don't mind. There are plenty of parks to choose from.</p>
<p>Well, just don't go to the park right in front of my house. If I spend time with Yuzu there, my family will see us.</p>
<p>"Alright. Let's go to the park after I get over my cold."</p>
<p>"Yeah. After that, I want to go boating, watch a movie, go bowling, go shopping, and eat cake."</p>
<p>"I don't see any unity in where we're going......."</p>
<p>"But it was fun. Soooo, soooo......"</p>
<p>Yuzu smiles happily, her cheeks relaxed.</p>
<p>"Did you have fun?"</p>
<p>"Because Kohei took me along......."</p>
<p>"......Oh, I see."</p>
<p>I remember.</p>
<p>A walk in the park, rowing a boat, watching a movie, bowling, shopping, eating cake and going home - that was my first date with Yuzu.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do on our first date, so I just packed in everything I thought Yuzu would enjoy, and it ended up taking all day.</p>
<p>After that, I tried to keep the date simple, but the fact that Yuzu wanted to go to the same place as the previous date meant that she was enjoying herself.</p>
<p>"If we're going to the same place as last time, you can't make a day trip out of it."</p>
<p>"Right, I'm just saying ...... don't worry about it."</p>

<p>"Don't be so quick to judge. I can't go to the exact same place, but I'll see if I can find a place nearby that meets your requirements."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. So go to bed and get well soon. I'll be there for you."</p>
<p>"......How long will you stay by my side?"</p>
<p>"Until Yuzu is satisfied."</p>
<p>"......Thank you."</p>
<p>Yuzuhana meditated as if she was relieved and began to breathe happily in her sleep.</p>
