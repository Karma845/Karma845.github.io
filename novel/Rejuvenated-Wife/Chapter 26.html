<h3>Chapter 26 &#8211; The Two Of Us Getting Along Well Hand In Hand</h3>

<p>The next morning.</p>
<p>"Oh my God!&#12288;My brother came in doing the robot dance!"</p>
<p>Sana greets me in the dining room with a funny analogy.</p>
<p>After pouring miso soup lazily, serving white rice lazily, and slowly sitting back in my chair, I told her.</p>
<p>"I ain't doing robot dance or anything."</p>
<p>"You did!&#12288;Are you going to do a robot dance at the school festival?"</p>
<p>"No way I'm doing that."</p>
<p>"But you've been looking stylish lately."</p>
<p>I'm not going to suddenly start dancing at the school festival just because I dressed up</p>
<p>"I'm sure Kohei's muscles are sore."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see!&#12288;That's your mother's brilliant guess!</p>
<p>"Dad, I was just about to say that too."</p>
<p>"That was close, Dad!"</p>
<p>In fact, my muscles were sore.</p>
<p>The only exercise I did was rowing a boat, but I had been on a date for 14 hours straight.......</p>
<p>My hip joints were throbbing from walking quite a distance.</p>
<p>"You were home late yesterday. I was worried when I didn't hear some news from you."</p>
<p>"I guess that's how much fun you had. If your body aches, I can give you a ride to school, okay?"</p>
<p>"No, thanks. I'll walk."</p>
<p>I promised Yuzu that I would meet her at the park and we would go to school together. If I went by car, I would be breaking my promise.</p>
<p>I'm sure Yuzu's muscles will be sore too, and if we both get in the car, we won't be breaking our promise, but if we ...... get in the car together, people will think we're in a relationship. We are actually dating, but I am embarrassed to introduce her as my girlfriend to my family.</p>
<p>I washed my face after finishing breakfast and headed to my room without telling Sana, who wondered why her usual brother would choose the easy way out.</p>
<p>I had just finished changing into my school uniform when I heard the intercom ring.</p>
<p>Sana's voice rang out, "Yes, yes!" and then I heard her huffing and puffing, footsteps approached, the door was opened, and then...</p>
<p>"Brother, brother!&#12288;Koikawa-san is here!"</p>
<p>......What?&#12288;She came to my house!&#12288;Why?!</p>
<p>I grabbed my schoolbag and rushed down the stairs.</p>
<p>Yuzuhana was at the entrance.</p>
<p>Mom complimented Yuzu on her beauty today, and Dad greeted her by saying, "I'm Kohei's father." and Yuzu had a smiling face.</p>
<p>I'm the only one who confused in this space.</p>
<p>"Hey, why did you come?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't wait to see you."</p>
<p>"You said you couldn't wait ...... it's only 5 minutes to the appointed time!"</p>
<p>We were supposed to meet up at the park, and now she's coming to my house!</p>
<p>I'm glad you were looking forward to going to school with me so much that you couldn't wait just five minutes, though.</p>
<p>"Oh my gosh, you promised to come to school with her, huh?"</p>
<p>"No wonder you didn't want to ride in your dad's car."</p>
<p>"You two are such good friends."</p>
<p>Well, it's a huge embarrassment to my family that they know about it!</p>
<p>I was going to introduce her as my girlfriend someday, but the day after we started dating is too soon. I'm not prepared for that.......</p>
<p>Yuzuhana bowed her head to Sana and the others who seemed to be smiling.</p>
<p>"Once again, I'm going out with Kohei-kun. My name is Yuzuhana Koikawa.'</p>
<p>"Once again, I am Kohei's father. I'm an office worker.</p>
<p>"Hello, I'm Kohei's mother. I am a librarian."</p>
<p>"I'm Kohei's younger sister. I'm a basketball player. Nice to see you too."</p>

<p>"......I'm Kohei Kurose. I'm Yuzu's boyfriend."</p>
<p>Who is this introduction for?&#12288;Isn't it just me being embarrassed?</p>
<p>"I knew you were dating!&#12288;It's terrible to hide something from your cute little sister!"</p>
<p>"I wasn't hiding anything. I was going to introduce her to you someday. And we only started dating yesterday. I'll introduce her again sometime, so I'm going to school for today. Let's go, Yuzu."</p>
<p>"I'll come say hello again later."</p>
<p>We left the house, seeing the smiling faces of our family members.</p>
<p>As we moved away from the house and passed a park, I spoke to Yuzu behind me.</p>
<p>"You didn't tell me you were coming to my house."</p>
<p>"That's fine. It's easier to show my face quickly and not have to hide things from your family than to put off introductions for a long time, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"That's true, but I have to be prepared ....... I'm rather surprised you could show your face so openly."</p>
<p>"There's no reason to be freaked out. I knew I would be welcomed by Kohei's family."</p>
<p>My family had no part in causing the couple's relationship to cool down.</p>
<p>It makes me feel proud to know that they've wholeheartedly blessed us.</p>
<p>I know I'm ahead of schedule, but I have to properly introduce Yuzu to them.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I continue onward.</p>
<p>"You're walking very slowly, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"My muscles are sore from all the walking I did yesterday. Sana said I was dancing like a robot."</p>
<p>"You have a good sense of humor."</p>
<p>Yuzu giggles, and I feel a warm glow.</p>
<p>"Doesn't it hurt Yuzu too?"</p>
<p>"Not so much for me. I used to walk quite a distance in my hometown."</p>
<p>"I see. If you keep up my pace, you might be late, so you can go ahead of me."</p>
<p>"No, I don't want to. I want to enjoy our date to school in a relaxed manner. You don't want to?"</p>
<p>"I want to walk with Yuzu. Let's have a school date every day from now on."</p>
<p>"Yeah. ...... so you don't want to connect?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do."</p>
<p>We hold hands and walk down the street to school.</p>
<p>I've seen this path so many times before, but walking with my girlfriend makes it look different. Even though we are just walking, happiness overflows ....... It has become so much fun that I wish I didn't have to arrive at school forever.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of other fun things to do besides school dates.</p>
<p>"Hey, what are you going to do after school?&#12288;Is today the day for a study group?"</p>
<p>"I'm in the mood for a game today."</p>
<p>"With midterms coming up?"</p>
<p>"I'll try my best tomorrow."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you'll say the same thing tomorrow."</p>
<p>"I'm going to study hard. Yuzu is going to teach me, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I'll make sure to teach you. So, what are you going to do after the exam?"</p>
<p>"I want to have fun at karaoke."</p>
<p>"Sure. I'll show you the difference in power."</p>
<p>"Then let's go bowling too. I'll show you the difference in power."</p>
<p>"The score won't be that different."</p>
<p>"A win is a win."</p>
<p>Yesterday, our relationship changed.</p>
<p>We went from friends to lovers, but we still do the same things as we always do.</p>
<p>We play games.</p>
<p>We read manga.</p>
<p>Karaoke.</p>
<p>Bowling.</p>
<p>The only difference is that the word "date" is added at the end.</p>
<p>Whatever it is--</p>
<p>"......Speaking of which, have you done your math homework?"</p>
<p>"Oh, shit. I forgot!&#12288;What about Yuzu?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot too. ......I guess we're both in for a sermon."</p>
<p>"I guess so. ......Well, that sounds like a lot of fun."</p>
<p>"......Are you a masochist?"</p>
<p>"That's not what I meant. It's because Yuzu is with me."</p>
<p>Unlike the last time I was lonely and gray, this time high school life is going to be a lot of fun.</p>
