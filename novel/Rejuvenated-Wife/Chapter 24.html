<h3>Chapter 24 &#8211; First Date (Reenactment)</h3>

<p>A week has passed since Yuzu recovered from a cold.</p>
<p>Sunday morning.</p>
<p>I'm checking my outfit in the mirror in the changing room when Sana comes in with sleepy eyes. She looked at me in the mirror and her eyes widened with a snap.</p>
<p>"My brother is getting fashionable!&#12288;You're a fresh high school boy!"</p>
<p>"I'm always fresh, aren't I?"</p>
<p>"You're usually much more boorish!&#12288;What's wrong with your clothes?"</p>
<p>"I bought it the other day."</p>
<p>"Did Koikawa-san pick it out for you?"</p>
<p>"I bought it by myself."</p>
<p>"You bought the clothes by yourself, my brother.......?"</p>
<p>"How old do you think I am......? I can at least buy clothes by myself."</p>
<p>"You usually buy your clothes by mail order. You don't like to talk to people at the store."</p>
<p>"This time i bought by myself. Can I try on the clothes?"</p>
<p>"My brother is growing up without my knowledge .....Wait a minute!"</p>
<p>She ran up the stairs, footsteps echoing, and returned with her cell phone in hand.</p>
<p>I take a quick snapshot.</p>

<p>"What are you doing taking so many pictures?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to record my growing brother!&#12288;And also to show my friends."</p>
<p>"Don't show it to them ...... I be embarrassed."</p>

<p>"Why not?&#12288;They're all smiling at it."</p>
<p>"That's just Sana's brazenly cute!"</p>
<p>"No~ even so, I can't believe that my brother has woken up to fashion. I guess falling in love changes you like this."</p>
<p>"I'm not falling in love!"</p>
<p>I'm just on the verge of falling in love!</p>
<p>That's why we hold hands when we are alone to build a friendship that transcends the boundaries between the sexes!</p>
<p>The good night phone calls we've started recently, and the fact that we've made each other's pictures our phone's standby screen, are all part of the shock therapy!</p>
<p>"So what do you think?"</p>
<p>"I think you look great together!"</p>
<p>"No, I mean the clothes. Do they look good on me?"</p>
<p>"Yes!&#12288;It's a date outfit."</p>

<p>"It's not a date!"</p>
<p>"But you're dating Koikawa-san, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but ...... I'm not dressing up because I want to look cool. The other day Yuzu translated my English shirt and made fun of me, so I just wore something different."</p>
<p>Yuzu will be astonished when she sees this outfit.</p>
<p>Did you pick out that outfit all by yourself?&#12288;You're good. --I bet she'll look at me like that.</p>
<p>"Did you read something strange?"</p>
<p>"I was told to translate it into Japanese by myself."</p>
<p>"What did it say?"</p>
<p>"My English isn't good enough. Sana, do you understand?"</p>
<p>"If my brother can't understand it, there's no way I can understand it."</p>
<p>As expected of Sana. Her English is not that good, just like me.</p>
<p>By the way, what time is your date?</p>
<p>"I'm just going out. And it's not a date. I'm going out then."</p>
<p>"Yeah!&#12288;Good luck!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, good luck! Good luck with your club activities too."</p>
<p>My parents and Sana, who were waiting at the entrance with a grin on their faces, saw me off as I left the house.</p>
<p>It's a sunny day. A perfect day for a date (reenactment). I buy a drink at a convenience store on the way and arrive at the station.</p>
<p>Yuzu, who was sitting on a bench, stands up to greet me.</p>
<p>She is wearing a pink blouse, a denim jacket, and a white mini-skirt.</p>
<p>I didn't expect her to come in a mini-skirt, and I was taken aback.</p>
<p>"Yo, yo. Did you wait for me?"</p>
<p>"I just came in a while ago. ......Kohei, did you have clothes like that?"</p>
<p>"I bought it the other day."</p>
<p>"Mail order?"</p>
<p>"No, at the mall."</p>
<p>"You should have asked me out. Did you ask me if you could try it on?"</p>
<p>"How old do you think I am? .......I said I could. The proof is, you see, it fits perfectly, doesn't it?&#12288;I mean, what did you do with that dress, Yuzu?"</p>
<p>"I bought it from a mail order company. ......Is it weird?"</p>
<p>"It's not weird. The only thing is that it's rare to see Yuzu in a miniskirt. I'm sure I've heard you say that you embarrassed to wear a miniskirt outside of school uniform, right?"</p>
<p>"Well, that's embarrassing, but ...... I was also wearing a miniskirt on our first date......."</p>
<p>So you recreated the date back then.</p>
<p>I understood what she was trying to do and it made sense, but ...... it was starting to make me nervous. I didn't intend to go on a date, but I was made to feel like one.</p>
<p>I got myself together, went into the station, and bought a ticket.</p>
<p>"You're going quite far, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"It's the only place in the neighborhood that could meet the requirements. I had a hard time finding it."</p>
<p>"Thanks for trying to find it for me."</p>
<p>"You're welcome."</p>
<p>The train arrives and we sit down in the two seats.</p>
<p>We talked about anime, games, and the upcoming midterm exams, and arrived at our destination station.</p>
<p>We headed for the park, basking in the brilliant sunshine.</p>
<p>It was a park with a large pond, and colorful tulips were blooming along the walking path.</p>
<p>"Nice place, isn't it!"</p>
<p>"Right?&#12288;I hear they have sunflowers in bloom in the summer. There's a cafe over there where you can enjoy a light meal while looking at the flowers."</p>
<p>"Do you eat lunch there too?"</p>
<p>"That was my plan, but if ...... you have a preference, I'm open to it."</p>
<p>"Not really a wish, I made lunch for you. I made it on our first date, remember?"</p>
<p>"I remember. It was so windy that it almost blew my leisure sheet away."</p>
<p>"Right. We couldn't eat calmly then, but we can relax this time."</p>
<p>"Right. I guess we'll eat after the boat."</p>
<p>"That's fine, but why don't we eat first?&#12288;We are going to row the boat afterwards. You'll be exhausted if you don't get stronger."</p>
<p>"You're assuming I'm going to row the boat. That's pretty tiring."</p>
<p>"It's a reenactment. You did it last time. I'll cheer you on like I did last time."</p>
<p>"I don't have a choice. I'll do my best this time too."</p>
<p>Yuzu heads to a bench overlooking the pond and pulls out her bento box.</p>
<p>Inside is a sandwich.</p>
<p>"How is it?"</p>
<p>"It's delicious."</p>
<p>"Thanks. Don't leave any leftovers, okay?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>We ate our sandwiches while gazing at the pond with the blue sky reflecting on it, and when we had enough energy, we headed for the boat ramp.</p>
<p>On our first date, we had gone on a swan boat, but this time we were going on a rowboat.</p>
<p>We pay the man and get on the boat.</p>
<p>"Whoa!"</p>
<p>"Are you okay?"</p>
<p>"It's pretty bumpy. .......Be careful on the boat, okay?"</p>
<p>I reached out her hand and squeezed it. The moment she got on the boat with trepidation, it shook and fell on my chest.</p>
<p>Gong, a headbutt to the jaw!</p>
<p>"Nggg!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry!&#12288;Are you okay?"</p>
<p>"Heh, I'm fine."</p>
<p>"But you're blushing.......'</p>
<p>"I'm fine. It's nothing compared to the punch I got in a fight with my husband."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry......."</p>
<p>"It's okay. I'm the one who should be sorry."</p>
<p>"......Which time?"</p>
<p>"All of them. I said some pretty harsh things to you......"</p>
<p>I'm not going to say anything more. Let's just forget about it and let bygones be bygones.</p>
<p>After apologizing for the past, making up with each other again, and feeling better about ourselves, we rowed the boat.</p>
<p>The boat made a lively "squeak-squeak" sound, but it did not go as fast as I had hoped.</p>
<p>As we struggled, Yuzu called out to us with concern.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?&#12288;It looks like you're having a hard time......."</p>
<p>"I'm fine. I'll do the heavy lifting and you can enjoy the scenery. I'm sure you liked this kind of scenery, right?"</p>
<p>"I can't enjoy it unless I'm with Kohei."</p>
<p>If she said this, I had no choice but to enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>I stopped rowing and decided to look at the pond from the slightly swaying boat. ......I somehow wondered what kind of expression Yuzu had on her face, and I turned around and glanced at her--!</p>
<p>"--?!"</p>
<p>An underwear from her miniskirt!&#12288;Spring-inspired cherry-red underwear!</p>
<p>Oh no!&#12288;Look away!&#12288;Don't stare!&#12288;</p>
<p>I know this in my head, but my eyes are drawn to it.</p>
<p>Then, fortunately or unfortunately, her legs closed.</p>
<p>I slowly look up and see Yuzu's reddened face.</p>
<p>Her cheeks are flushed, her gaze still.</p>

<p>"Ecchi."</p>
<p>"No!&#12288;It's a misunderstanding!"</p>
<p>"What misunderstanding? You were staring at my underwear. I told you to enjoy the view, but you were enjoying the inside of my skirt......."</p>
<p>"Well, you make it sound like I'm some kind of pervert! I mean, it was Yuzu who showed me your underwear!"</p>
<p>"What? I didn't show you my pants!"</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Y2mG0xT/7Jzlc1P.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p>"Even if you didn't do it on purpose, it was Yuzu who did the pantywaist. You're wearing a mini-skirt, so watch out!"</p>
<p>"It's just the two of us, so I get relaxed. I mean, you didn't choose the rowboat because you wanted to see my underwear, did you?"</p>
<p>"I don't have to go through all that trouble just for that!"</p>
<p>"So you were going to ask me to show it to you straight.......?"</p>
<p>"No, of course not!&#12288;I'm not going to ask you that! If you're embarrassed about people seeing your underwear, don't ask me to pick up your laundry!"</p>
<p>That's when I nursed her back to health.</p>
<p>Yuzu woke up in the middle of the night and asked me to collect it, so I put the laundry away and put the clothes in the wardrobe so they wouldn't wrinkle.</p>
<p>"Because ...... I had no choice. I had a fever. I'm sorry I bothered you."</p>
<p>"It's okay. I'm glad you asked me for help......."</p>
<p>"......Yes. You were really reliable then, Kohei. Thanks for taking care of me."</p>
<p>"You're welcome."</p>
<p>With the underwear completely forgotten and the rapport made up, we resumed rowing. We wobble that way and that way, but enjoy the boat and return to the landing.</p>
<p>"I feel like I'm still rocking......"</p>
<p>"Yeah ....... did you enjoy the boat?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I'd love to come back."</p>
<p>"Me too."</p>
<p>I'm exhausted from using muscles I don't normally use.</p>
<p>But seeing Yuzu's happy face, my exhaustion is gone.</p>
<p>"Next is the movie. Let's get going."</p>
<p>"Are you sure you don't need to rest?"</p>
<p>"I'm fine. When I'm with Kohei, all the tiredness just disappears."</p>
<p>I was surprised to hear her say that with a bright smile.</p>
<p>"Well, let's go then. Let's go to the cinema."</p>
<p>"Yes. What are you going to see?"</p>
<p>"I'll decide after I go."</p>
<p>"Okay. Then make sure it's not a horror movie."</p>
<p>"It's okay, but ...... didn't you used to brag that you overcame your weakness?"</p>
<p>"I was fine because Kohei was by my side. If I watch a horror movie now, I'll be so ...... scared I won't be able to sleep alone. ...... or will you stay with me until morning?"</p>
<p>"Well, there's no way I can do that."</p>
<p>"You slept with me last month."</p>
<p>"That's one thing, that's another."</p>
<p>At that time, I hadn't developed a liking for her yet.</p>
<p>I liked her as a friend and had no romantic feelings.</p>
<p>Now it's different.</p>
<p>I'm totally aware of Yuzu, and I have romantic feelings for her.</p>
<p>It's not that I'm starting to like Yuzu, but I'm completely in love with her.</p>
<p>It's a feeling that I should never reveal. That's why I've been holding hands with her and have Yuzuhana as my standby screen ...... to suppress my feelings of affection.</p>
<p>But to be honest, it also has the opposite effect.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be shock therapy, but common sense would tell you. If you hold hands with a girl you're interested in, you'll like her even more.</p>
<p>And yet--</p>
<p>"Hey, why don't we hold hands?&#12288;Let's intertwine our fingers like we used to......"</p>
<p>Perhaps the shock therapy is going well, or maybe Yuzu suggests holding hands with her lover.</p>
<p>I'm not going to like Yuzu any more than I already do, so I suggest it to her as well.</p>
<p>"Before we make the lover's connection, can you do me a favor?"</p>
<p>"What kind of favor?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to say something weird, but ...... I want you to make a funny face for me."</p>
<p>I told her seriously, and she looked at me blankly.</p>
<p>"What about ......?&#12288;What did you say?"</p>
<p>"I want you to make a funny face. For example, I'd appreciate it if you'd make a double peace face with your eyes peeled back like this."</p>
<p>"Hey, hey!&#12288;I look like an idiot, so don't do the double peace with the white eyes!</p>
<p>"Don't tell me I look stupid!&#12288;I'm just trying to show you a clear example!&#12288;I've just shown you how to do it!"</p>
<p>"I don't want to!&#12288;Why do I have to do a double peace with my white eyes on a date?"</p>
<p>"It's not a date, it's a reenactment of a date!"</p>
<p>"No, why do I have to do the double white-eye pose on our date?&#12288;You didn't do the double peace with blank eyes thing last time!"</p>
<p>"Of course I didn't!&#12288;Where else in the world would a guy do a double peace with blank eyes on the first date?&#12288;I was really embarrassed when I showed you the example earlier!"</p>
<p>"If so, don't make me do something embarrassing like that!"</p>
<p>"I don't want to make you do it either!&#12288;You're not supposed to be cute!"</p>
<p>"What?&#12288;You're an idiot!&#12288;Don't call me cute out loud!"</p>
<p>"I can't help it!&#12288;You're seriously cute!&#12288;That's why I'm trying to reset you with a funny face!&#12288;I want you to show me a funny face that will make my 100-year love go cold so I can get rid of the throbbing!"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Please!&#12288;Please, it doesn't have to be a double peace with blank eyes!&#12288;Just show me a really weird face!&#12288;Then I'll be able to calm down!&#12288;I'm so excited I'm going crazy!"</p>
<p>"You're already going crazy!&#12288;If I wasn't, I wouldn't have asked you to do a double peace with your white eyes during our date!"</p>
<p>"Right?&#12288;You're so convincing!&#12288;So please!!!&#12288;Make a funny face!&#12288;Help me keep our friendship between the sexes......!"</p>
<p>Yuzu sighed with a disgusted look on her face as she asked sincerely.</p>
<p>"I'll only ...... give you once, okay?"</p>
<p>"Thanks!&#12288;That's seriously helpful!"</p>
<p>Yuzu's cheeks were tinted with shame, and she moved her face closer to mine so I could get a better look.</p>
<p>I was so excited.</p>
<p>Yuzu made a kissy face.</p>
<p>"Why the kiss face?"</p>
<p>"That's why you have a taco mouth!&#12288;You said the same thing the other day!&#12288;I made a funny face when I kissed you!"</p>
<p>"You wasn't making a funny face to begin with!&#12288;You're making a funny face like a female announcer who can't let go of her shame!"</p>
<p>"I don't get the metaphor!"</p>
<p>"Look at the variety!&#12288;That's how you make a taco face!"</p>
<p>"You're not making a kissing face either!"</p>
<p>"I used to make this face when I kissed you!"</p>
<p>"You used to make that face when you were drunk and wanted to kiss me!"</p>
<p>"I don't remember."</p>
<p>"Of course you don't!&#12288;You were drunk and stoned!"</p>
<p>Yuzu screamed with a bright red face and turned her head away.</p>
<p>Then she glanced at me and extended her hand.</p>
<p>"You're going to hold my hand like you promised, right?"</p>
<p>"The next funny face is......."</p>

<p>"You promised me one time. Here, hand."</p>
<p>"Wow, okay......."</p>
<p>The kissy face she showed me and the lover's hold made me like her even more.</p>
<p>Holding hands with a girl you like-- It should be a happy thing, but it makes me feel hard.</p>
<p>But I have to be patient.</p>
<p>I have to suppress my feelings of love and continue to endure them for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I can't erase my feelings of love, and it's hard not to be rewarded for these feelings, but ...... it's a punishment. It's my punishment for making the foolish choice to divorce that day.</p>
<p>As long as we don't become lovers - as long as we don't become husband and wife, we can stay friends forever. Just being able to spend time with Yuzu on good terms is happiness enough, isn't it?</p>

<p>I told myself that and continued the date (reenactment).</p>
