<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211; The Writer Of My Dreams</h3>

<p>The day after her birthday.</p>
<p>After school that day.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do today?"</p>
<p>Yuzu chases after me as usual as I exit the school gate.</p>
<p>Just hearing her voice makes me so nervous that I can't make proper eye contact.</p>
<p>If I spoke to her, she would act suspicious. On the other hand, if I continue to ignore her, Yuzu will be in a bad mood.......</p>
<p>"Hey!&#12288;I'm not ignoring you."</p>
<p>"I'm not ignoring you!"</p>
<p>"I tried to talk to you, but you didn't talk to me!"</p>
<p>"I wasn't ignoring you, I was just thinking."</p>
<p>"I wish that were the case, but ...... where are you looking at when you talk?"</p>
<p>"I'm doing my neck exercises."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"For my health."</p>
<p>"It's good that you care about your health, but you're going to hurt your neck muscles that way. You have to move it in a balanced way, up and down, side to side."</p>
<p>"I know, I know. I'll turn around in the next five minutes or so - you don't have to turn around!"</p>
<p>"You don't have to yell at me!&#12288;I'm just trying to make it easier for you to talk to me."</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to yell at you. I was just so surprised that my voice got really loud."</p>
<p>"Well, that's fine, but ...... why are your eyes white?"</p>
<p>"I'm practicing my ...... funny face."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"I'm trying to send Sana a picture of my face."</p>
<p>"You should practice in your room, because passersby will think you're an idiot."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay. ...... this will do."</p>
<p>"......Why are your eyes swimming?"</p>
<p>"I'm doing eye exercises."</p>
<p>"......Why is your voice backwards?"</p>
<p>"I'm practicing my back voice."</p>
<p>"......Is weird. You're hiding something from me."</p>
<p>"I'm not hiding anything from you!"</p>
<p>Of course I'm hiding it.</p>
<p>Because of the cute smile she showed me at her birthday party yesterday, I have developed romantic feelings for Yuzu again.</p>
<p>I can't let her know that I have feelings for her again. If she finds out, our friendship will collapse.</p>
<p>Our friendship is eternal!&#12288;To remain friends, I must erase these feelings!</p>
<p>"Well, okay. I'm free today, aren't I?"</p>
<p>I want to reduce the amount of time we spend together in order to erase my romantic feelings, but Yuzu is still willing to play with me.</p>
<p>I have to somehow refuse her in a way that won't hurt Yuzu's feelings.......</p>
<p>"No, I'm busy......"</p>
<p>"What do you have to do?"</p>
<p>"It's not that I have something to do ...... it's just that I'm not feeling well."</p>
<p>"Physical condition?"</p>
<p>Yuzu looked into my face.</p>
<p>Her cute face is so close to me that my body is slowly getting hot.</p>
<p>"......Your face is indeed red. Is it a cold?"</p>
<p>"I don't know if it's a cold or not ...... but I'm going to take it easy for the rest of the day anyway."</p>
<p>"You'd better do that. Get a good night's sleep and get yourself well soon. Otherwise, you will have to spend a boring Golden Week."</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the start of Golden Week.</p>
<p>I was hoping to have a lot of fun with Yuzu during this long vacation.</p>
<p>But......</p>
<p>I'm so nervous when I'm with her that I want to spend it alone until I can get my mind in order.</p>
<p>Well, even so, the way home is the same, so I'll be spending time with Yuzuhana until we get to the park. I'm relieved that I was able to keep my poker face on until I got home, even though I was nervous about Yuzu happily talking about the Kimiuta art book.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"......Sh1t."</p>
<p>I realized I had forgotten something when I got home and was quenching my thirst with a glass of milk.</p>
<p>If it was a textbook, I would have let it pass, but I had to take my gym clothes home with me. Otherwise, they would get moldy in the worst case scenario.</p>
<p>It's a hassle, but I should turn back.</p>
<p>I decided to do so and headed back to school under the clear sky.</p>
<p>"Oh, Kurose-kun, isn't it? Did you forget something?"</p>
<p>I ran into Akabane-senpai at the school gate.</p>
<p>"I forgot my gym uniform. ....... Ah, yes, I read your manga. It's a club magazine that we published at last year's festival. To be honest, it was really interesting. I don't mean to flatter you or anything, but really."</p>
<p>Akabane-senpai smiled happily when I told her what I thought.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you liked it. There's also the club magazine we published the year before last, would you like to read it?"</p>
<p>"I'd love to read it!"</p>
<p>I went to the club room with my senpai and was allowed to read the manga.</p>

<p>Just like the manga I had read before, it was an action manga.</p>
<p>The drawing ability was not as good as last year's, but the powerful composition was a natural quality of the artist. Although the pages are short, there are ups and downs, and in the last few pages I forgot to breathe as I read.</p>
<p>She is a god writer.......</p>
<p>"Do Senpai actually make your professional debut.....?"</p>
<p>"No way. I'm just an ordinary high school girl that you can find anywhere."</p>
<p>"You're not ordinary!&#12288;You can draw really interesting manga!&#12288;Don't you bring in your own work?"</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, I'm planning to bring it in during the summer vacation."</p>
<p>"Bringing it in!&#12288;That's amazing!&#12288;I'm so proud to see a professional artist come out of our school!"</p>
<p>"You're overreacting. I haven't even been assigned a writer yet."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you will!&#12288;It's really interesting!&#12288;It's going to be my debut for sure!&#12288;You'd better think of a pen name or something while you're at it!"</p>
<p>"I'm thinking of shortening my real name, Chizuru Akabane, to 'Akatsuru' as a pen name."</p>
<p>"...... Eh?&#12288;Akatsuru?"</p>
<p>"Is that strange?"</p>
<p>I was suddenly puzzled, and Senpai looked a little uneasy.</p>
<p>Akatsuru as in Chizuru Akabane. It's not weird, but ......</p>
<p>"Akatsuru!&#12288;Are you really Akatsuru?"</p>
<p>"Why are you so surprised?"</p>
<p>"No, no, I just thought it was a cool pen name!"</p>
<p>It's cool, no doubt, but there's another reason I was surprised.</p>
<p>I know Akatsuru-sensei.</p>
<p>I read her manga during the entrance exam season and loved it so much that I read it over and over and over again, putting my studies aside and almost becoming a ronin.</p>
<p>Naturally, after Yuzu and I became friends, I was the first to recommend her to her, and she was also hooked on Akatsuru's world. She asked me if there were any other manga I could recommend, and as I introduced them one after the other, she became an otaku, and our friendship rapidly deepened. In other words, Akatsuru-sensei was the cupid of love for me and Yuzu.</p>
<p>I wondered why she looked so much like me. Because I imitated her design.</p>
<p>I had no idea that Akatsuru-sensei was a graduate of the same high school......</p>
<p>If I didn't have knowledge of the future, I might have cried with emotion.</p>
<p>But I'm from the future.</p>
<p>I knew what was going to happen to Akatsuru-sensei, so I couldn't rejoice.</p>
<p>"Why do you look so gloomy?"</p>
<p>"Wait, I'm a little hungry!"</p>
<p>Too poor an excuse.</p>
<p>I can't get my thoughts in order.</p>
<p>Akatsuru-sensei would die suddenly in ten years.</p>
<p>"Want to go purchasing?&#12288;I'll treat you to some bread to thank you for praising my manga."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, that......."</p>
<p>What shall I do?</p>
<p>Should I tell her what I know?&#12288;</p>
<p>Would that save her from certain death?</p>
<p>But she won't believe me if I say, "You're going to die suddenly in 10 years." It will only make she feel bad.</p>
<p>Then I should go to ...... and say.</p>
<p>"Are you planning to go away soon, by any chance?"</p>
<p>"You know it very well. It's a tradition of the manga club to have a training camp during the Golden Week holidays. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the camp alone, but I don't want to break the tradition."</p>
<p>Akatsuru's cause of death was announced as anaphylactic shock from a wasp sting.</p>

<p>And when I looked through past interviews, I asked, "The characters in your work have been in danger many times, but what was the most terrifying experience for Akatsuru-sensei?" She answered, "When I was a junior in high school, I was stung by a wasp at a training camp and almost died."</p>
<p>I am not familiar with anaphylactic shock, but you didn't die at the first time.</p>
<p>If I protect her against wasps during camp, the first time will be 10 years from now.</p>
<p>We may be dying, but we can avert our own mortality!</p>
<p>"I want to follow you too!"</p>
<p>I'm the only one who knows about this.</p>
<p>I must protect my favorite writer--Akabane-senpai, who has become my cupid in love--from the wasps!</p>
<p>"Then you should invite Koikawa-san, too."</p>
<p>"Why are you inviting Yuzuhana......?"</p>
<p>The training camp will be an overnight stay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's true that it's not safe for a man and a woman to be alone at a training camp.</p>
<p>I don't want to take Yuzuhana to a dangerous place, but if I keep her in a ...... safe place, it won't be a problem.</p>
<p>"I'll make some calls."</p>
<p>I left the club room so that my senpai wouldn't hear me, and called Yuzu. I was nervous before, but now my senpai's life or death is at stake. I'm not interested in that right now.</p>
<p>|| "Hello?&#12288;What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"I have something important to tell Yuzu."</p>
<p>|| "What's the matter? What do you want to talk about?"</p>
<p>I told her the truth.</p>
<p>I had returned to school because I had forgotten something.</p>
<p>I had run into Akabane-senpai and found out that he was Akatsuru-sensei.</p>
<p>That I wanted to protect her from wasps in order to avoid the fate of death.</p>
<p>|| "I'm coming too!&#12288;I don't want Akatsuru-sensei to die!"</p>
<p>As one would expect from a die-hard fan. Yuzu had no hesitation at all.</p>
<p>But--</p>
<p>"I'll take care of the wasps, Yuzu, go hide somewhere safe."</p>
<p>|| "No."</p>
<p>"Do something about that, please. Please, don't do anything dangerous. I don't want anything to happen to Yuzu......"</p>
<p>|| "I wouldn't want anything to happen to Kohei either. I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get a hold of her. You can't just stand there and watch out for each other's backs and protect Akatsuru-sensei!"</p>
<p>Yuzu shouts strongly.</p>
<p>This is not going to persuade her.</p>
<p>I don't want to expose Yuzu to the bees, but I'm sure it will be easier to protect her if the two of us ...... work together.</p>

<p>I hung up the phone and went back to the clubroom. I told Akahane that Yuzu was coming too, and she gave me her address, saying that she would contact me later with more details.</p>
