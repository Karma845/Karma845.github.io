<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; Birthday At The Maid Cafe</h3>

<p>It's the day of her birthday.</p>
<p>When I first time-slipped, I used to try to get to school early so I wouldn't have to run into Yuzu, but that's no longer necessary.</p>
<p>Lately, I've been getting up later and later each day, and by the time I get to school, most of my classmates are already there.</p>
<p>Yuzu is also in her seat.</p>
<p>But they don't talk to each other. It's an unspoken agreement that when they are at school, they spend time together as classmates, not friends.</p>
<p>"(You're late.)"</p>
<p>"(You're just too early.)"</p>
<p>"(You're really going to be late at that rate, aren't you?)"</p>
<p>"(If it's really bad, Sana will wake me up, no problem)"</p>
<p>"(I can give you a wake-up call if you want.)"</p>
<p>"(You don't have to. I'm sure you're busy with housework every morning.")</p>
<p>So we exchanged glances as usual, and I took my seat.</p>
<p>I fiddled with my cell phone and sent a text message to Yuzu.</p>
<p>[Are you free after school today?]</p>
<p>[I'm extremely free today!]</p>
<p>[Let's go to a maid cafe!]</p>
<p>"Maid cafe!"</p>
<p>Yuzu suddenly stood up and shouted.</p>
<p>I was surprised.......</p>
<p>It seems I wasn't the only one surprised, and the classroom was quiet.</p>
<p>Yuzu's face almost catches fire from the attention of her classmates. She turns her red face down and sits down, looking embarrassed.</p>
<p>She turns to face the front of the room and waits. My cell phone vibrated.</p>
<p>[You made me look like a weirdo!]</p>
<p>[It wasn't my fault.]</p>
<p>[It's because you said you wanted to go to a maid cafe!]</p>
<p>I didn't expect to get angry. This is not the first time I've invited Yuzu to a maid cafe.</p>
<p>I was too shy to go to a maid café by myself, so when I was a university student, I invited Yuzu to go to a maid café and we both made our debut together.</p>
<p>Yuzu seemed to be having a good time at that time, so I chose it as the place for her birthday party.</p>
<p>I made sure to reserve a table for her and also told her that since it was my friend's birthday, I'd like to have a birthday cake made to her specifications.</p>
<p>I thought Yuzuhana would agree with my two words, but......</p>
<p>[You don't like maid cafes?"]</p>
<p>[I love them!&#12288;Maid cafes and maid uniforms!]</p>
<p>[Well, we went shopping for maid outfits together. I remember you being very selfish, saying you didn't want cheap cosplay costumes and that you wanted long skirts.]</p>
<p>[I wasn't being selfish!&#12288;I just didn't want to compromise!&#12288;You said you would go out with me until Yuzu was satisfied.]</p>
<p>[I didn't think we'd end up going to a maid uniform store outside of the prefecture.]</p>
<p>[I'm sorry. I'm sorry I made you go out with me.]</p>
<p>[It's okay. It was fun, like a trip.]</p>
<p>[Really?&#12288;You're not mad?]</p>
<p>[I'm not mad. Let's go buy some more sometime!]</p>
<p>[You want to see me in a maid's uniform that badly?]</p>
<p>[It looked good on you. You liked it too, didn't you?&#12288;I was doing housework in a maid's outfit for a while.]</p>
<p>[I get a lot of housework done in that.]</p>
<p>[I remember you only wore the cat ears I gave you once.]</p>
<p>[It was indeed embarrassing. But I did let you take a picture of me, didn't I?"]</p>
<p>[Actually, I had them as a standby on my phone for a while.]</p>
<p>[How embarrassing. ......!&#12288;You didn't let anyone you know see it, did you?]</p>
<p>[No problem. I've curbed my desire to brag about it.]</p>
<p>[How did you want to brag?]</p>
<p>[I forgot]</p>
<p>[Really?]</p>
<p>[I forgot!&#12288;I mean, what about the maid cafe?]</p>
<p>[I'll go, but why today of all days......?]</p>
<p>......Oh, so that's how it is.</p>
<p>Today is Yuzu's birthday. I'm sure she's expecting me to celebrate her birthday, though she hasn't urged me to do anything.</p>
<p>But because I wanted to see the maid, I became grumpy.</p>
<p>[Today is Yuzu's birthday, right? That's why I wanted to celebrate it in a special place.]</p>
<p>The present is a surprise, but celebrating a birthday doesn't have to be a secret.</p>
<p>It would be more effective to keep it a secret until right before the event, but it's not like you have to make Yuzuhana anxious to do it.</p>
<p>[You should say it first!&#12288;I was worried that you forgot my birthday!]</p>
<p>[Sorry, sorry. I'll give you advance notice next year.]</p>
<p>[Will you celebrate next year, too?]</p>
<p>[Of course I will. We're friends.]</p>
<p>[Thanks!&#12288;But is there a maid cafe nearby?]</p>
<p>[There's one three stops away.]</p>
<p>[What kind of place?]</p>
<p>[From what I can tell, it has the same system as the maid café I went to on a date once.]</p>
<p>[You've never been there?]</p>
<p>[I was too embarrassed to go alone back then, and by the time Yuzu and I got to know each other, it was already closed.]</p>
<p>[Then I'll have to contribute to the sales! (&#8807;&#9661;&#8806;]</p>
<p>Thank goodness. It looks like she's getting on board.</p>
<p>I was relieved to know that Yuzu was happy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After school.</p>
<p>We came to the maid cafe.</p>
<p>"Welcome home, master, miss."</p>
<p>We were greeted by an Akiba-style maid and shown to our seats.</p>
<p>We were the only customers, probably because it was halfway through the day on a weekday.</p>
<p>It was as if we had the place to ourselves. We could celebrate Yuzu's birthday without any worries.</p>
<p>"When you have decided on your order, please ring the bell."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"Yes, can I help you?"</p>
<p>"I'm Kurose, from ...... and I'm not sure if this is the right place, so can I come over there for a minute?"</p>
<p>I told her my business in a roundabout way so that Yuzu wouldn't get the hint, but she seemed to have understood. She smiled at me and took me to the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, did you get my message about the cake?"</p>
<p>"Of course. I'm so glad you chose us for your big day."</p>
<p>Good. It seems that the birthday story is getting through.</p>
<p>Then I don't have to worry about the cake.</p>
<p>"Can you serve the cake after the meal?"</p>
<p>"Sure, sir. Also, if you don't mind, I can help you make your girlfriend happy."</p>
<p>"I'm not her--- ...... cooperation?"</p>
<p>"I'll help you win at rock-paper-scissors time, master."</p>
<p>If I win three in a row against the maid in rock-paper-scissors, I'll get my picture taken and a special drink served, right?</p>
<p>The photo is a great souvenir and the special drink is free.</p>
<p>But ......</p>
<p>"I want to win on merit, not on 800. I don't want to feel like I'm cheating my friends."</p>
<p>"I see. I'm sorry to suggest this, but I think it's better that way too. Well then, please enjoy your dinner with your girlfriend."</p>
<p>"Thank you. She's not my girlfriend, though."</p>
<p>I returned to my seat, and Yuzu greeted me with a sullen look on her face.</p>
<p>"Welcome back. What were you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about that you can't tell me?&#12288;You're not hitting on me, are you?"</p>
<p>I would never pick up a girl on Yuzu's birthday.</p>
<p>"If it wasn't my birthday, you'd be hitting on me?&#12288;Maybe you didn't come here today to preview that, did you?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm not. I came here to celebrate Yuzu's birthday. Do you think I'm capable of picking up girls?"</p>
<p>"I don't think you can, but ...... the maid you just met was cute, and it's worth it if you have the courage to pick her up."</p>
<p>Yuzu is persistent.</p>
<p>If it were me as usual, I'd say, "It doesn't matter who I go out with!" I would have retorted, but today I'm holding back.</p>
<p>Because it's Yuzu's birthday.</p>
<p>I have to put her in a good mood to make her birthday plan a success.</p>
<p>"I don't have that kind of courage!&#12288;The first time I talked to Yuzu, you were the one who talked to me, right?"</p>
<p>"That wasn't like picking up girls. I was about to be alone in college, so I noticed a former classmate sitting next to me at ...... so I spent the rest of the lecture worrying about it, and then I talked to you."</p>
<p>"At that time, Yuzu, you were speaking in a very thick accent, weren't you?"</p>
<p>"I was nervous. How many times have I told you that?&#12288;I'm so embarrassed, please forget about it."</p>
<p>"How could I forget? I can't forget about it, it's a precious memory of the first time I talked to Yuzu. I was really happy that you talked to me back then. I was worried that I was going to be a loner. Thanks to you, I was able to enjoy my college life. Thanks, Yuzu."</p>
<p>"No, it's fine, I don't want to thank you. I had a good time with you too. ...... I'm starving. I'm sure you'll be able to find a good deal on a good deal on a good deal."</p>
<p>Yuzu hid her face with the menu list in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Thank goodness she was in a better mood. It seems she is in a better mood now.</p>
<p>I patted my chest in relief and checked the menu.</p>
<p>"It's my treat today, so you can order whatever you like."</p>
<p>"Thanks. I'll do that. I think I'll have the ...... omelette."</p>
<p>"I think I'll have the same."</p>
<p>I ring the bell and tell the maid what I want to order. Then, as I ask her what she thinks of the love kano I recommended the other day, the omelette arrives. I pick up the ketchup and the maid asks, "Do you have any requests?" She asks.</p>
<p>I ask her to write "Kohei" and "Yuzu" on my omelette, and I immediately eat it.</p>
<p>"Yes. It's delicious."</p>
<p>Yuzu's cheeks relaxed, and I scrunched up my face.</p>
<p>I have a gift for Yuzu in my school bag. I'm confident she'll like it, but I think I may have put a little too much thought into it.......</p>
<p>If we were lovers, I wouldn't be so sure, but me and Yuzu are friends.</p>
<p>You can't just take your friend to a maid cafe, prepare a birthday cake, and give her a gift that costs 5,000 yen.</p>
<p>If it were the other way around, I'd be mistaken for having a crush on her.</p>
<p>On the other hand, "I don't like you!&#12288;Don't get me wrong!" I don't think it's the same thing to say.</p>
<p>Or rather, if you say that to Yuzu, an otaku, she might misunderstand you as a tsundere.</p>
<p>"......Yuzu, what do you think about tsundere?"</p>
<p>"What is it all of a sudden?"</p>
<p>"No, I was just wondering."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well ....... I think it's cute. The main character who takes it at face value is irritating, by the way. I'm not really sure I'd take it at face value if I were you. ......But I'd usually take it at face value."</p>
<p>No!&#12288;The "don't get me wrong" strategy doesn't work!</p>
<p>I guess I'll just have to go along with the plan and not be so uptight about it.......</p>
<p>"It's challenge time!"</p>
<p>After finishing my meal and having my empty plate collected, the maid came over with a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>She explained the challenge time and I came forward to be the challenger.</p>
<p>The result was three wins in a row!&#12288;A complete victory without a single cheat!</p>
<p>"Isn't that great!"</p>
<p>I have a talent for rock-paper-scissors-scissors!</p>
<p>I'll just leave it at that for today!</p>
<p>The three of us took a commemorative photo with the maid in between us. Yuzuka is in a very good mood after having "Happy Birthday, Yuzu-chan" written on her photo.</p>
<p>"I have a special drink for you, how would you like it at......?"</p>
<p>The maid looks over at me. She asked if she could bring the cake with us.</p>
<p>I nod, and she retreats to the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Happy birthday, Miss Yuzu!"</p>
<p>"What, a cake?&#12288;I didn't order it, but......"</p>
<p>I asked for it when I made the reservation.</p>
<p>"Did you do that on purpose?"</p>
<p>"Of course not. It's the birthday of the most important person in my life. Happy birthday!"</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vZZLBqC/bxPKzSm.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p>Yuzu was applauded by me and the maids, and she was left with a blank stare.</p>
<p>I blow out the fire for the time being, but she doesn't show her joy on her face, as if she can't swallow the situation well.</p>
<p>I took out a thick book from my bag.</p>
<p>"Ta-da!&#12288;It's a present!"</p>
<p>"This is Kimiuta's art book......."</p>
<p>"That's right. See, you used to want it."</p>
<p>Yuzu would not be hooked on Kimiuta until several years later. At the time, the art book was so rare that I couldn't get it.</p>
<p>I would have given it to her if I had it, but unfortunately, I didn't have it either. I didn't have the money to buy it at the time.</p>
<p>I like anime, and I had just watched Kimiuta the other day. Yuzu would be overjoyed with this one!</p>
<p>That's what I thought.......</p>
<p>Yuzu did not smile. Her eyebrows were lowered, her eyes were moistened, and she had a complicated expression on her face, as if she was troubled, worried, or even happy ...... not knowing what she was thinking.</p>
<p>"......Didn't you like it?"</p>
<p>"No, no. It's not like that. It's just that I didn't expect you to celebrate so much ...... and I couldn't get my mind in order ...... and I didn't know what to do."</p>
<p>"You should be happy!"</p>
<p>"Of course I'm happy!&#12288;Of course I'm happy, but I'm not ...... happy."</p>
<p>I'm happy, but what the hell? Don't stop where you're concerned. You're making me nervous.</p>
<p>As I waited for her to continue, Yuzu looked up.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if she's sorted out her feelings or not, but compared to earlier, her face is filled with joy.</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed and she smiled happily.</p>
<p>"Thanks. I'm really happy."</p>
<p>"--"</p>
<p>The quiet words she said made my heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>My heart slowly heated up in my chest, and it was rising up to my face.</p>
<p>I turned my head to hide my burning face, but my heartbeat only accelerated.</p>
<p>"......What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. I'm going to the bathroom!"</p>
<p>I get up from my seat and run to the bathroom.</p>
<p>When I looked in the mirror, I saw that ...... I was blushing so much.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'm smiling or embarrassed, but it's a mystery. I can't tell if I grinning or in trouble, I have mysterious look on my face.</p>
<p>I slap my cheek, take a deep breath, calm down, and return to my seat.</p>
<p>We talked about anime, ate cake, drank drinks, and by the time we left the restaurant, our hearts were no longer pounding in our chests.......</p>
<p>"Hey, what's wrong?&#12288;You've been looking at me funny for a while now."</p>
<p>"No, I didn't. Yuzu is the one who made a strange face earlier."</p>
<p>I'm sorry, that's rude. I didn't make a funny face.</p>
<p>The way she turned her head away from me was also cute.</p>
<p>Her voice, her tone of voice, her body language, her hand gestures, and everything about her made me love her.</p>
<p>Even after I left Yuzu in front of the park, I could not get rid of the feelings that had reawakened in me.</p>

<p>Of course, I cannot admit to these feelings.</p>
