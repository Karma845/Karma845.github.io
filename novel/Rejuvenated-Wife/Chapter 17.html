<h3>Chapter 17 &#8211; Making Memories At The Zoo</h3>

<p>Yuzuhana was still a little sleepy when she got off the train, but when the zoo came into view, her tension shot up.</p>
<p>With her eyes glowing brightly, she pointed to the entrance gate and said,</p>
<p>"Kohei!&#12288;Take a picture of that!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. Okay, okay. Next time, I'll take a picture of you and the gate, so please stand in front of me."</p>
<p>"Thanks. I'll ask you to do it!"</p>
<p>After taking a picture of Yuzuhana posing in front of the gate, I hand the admission ticket to the attendant.</p>
<p>After receiving a pamphlet and stamp rally form, Yuzu passes through the gate and is greeted by a lion sculpture.</p>
<p>Yuzu runs toward it, and then asks for it with a peace sign.</p>
<p>"Kohei!&#12288;Take my picture!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. Okay, okay."</p>
<p>"Did you get a good shot?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I got it."</p>
<p>Next, take a picture of her scared face.</p>
<p>Yuzu looks like she is being attacked by a lion.</p>
<p>She's really excited......</p>
<p>I'm used to seeing this, but if the guys at school saw Yuzu now, they'd think she was someone else.</p>
<p>I'm the only one who knows this Yuzu version. I feel superior when I think about it.</p>
<p>".......I'm tired of this expression."</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry."</p>
<p>As I took the picture, Yuzu ran up to me.</p>
<p>She came close to me and begged me to show her the picture.</p>
<p>I show her the photo I just took, with the sweet smell of her scent lingering in the air.</p>
<p>If I hadn't smelled the scent on the train, I would have been very upset. ......I'm glad I built up my tolerance there.</p>
<p>"You're good at taking pictures. Why don't you be the photographer this time?"</p>
<p>"I'm not that good, and I don't know how to be a photographer."</p>
<p>"I don't know either, but ...... you know, I got a calendar from a travel agency once, right?"</p>
<p>"The one that used to hang in the bathroom?"</p>
<p>"That's one. The photos in the calendar were chosen from a public contest. If you were selected, it would be an achievement, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"All the photos I take are of figurines, right? I don't have any fashionable photos that would appear in a calendar."</p>
<p>"Why don't you just send me the pictures you just took? If you want to be a photographer, I'll give you special permission."</p>
<p>"That's fine. I'm not sure I can make a living as a photographer. I've decided that this time I'm not going to spend my life worrying about work."</p>
<p>Besides, I don't want Yuzu's picture to be seen by a lot of people if I'm chosen for the calendar.</p>
<p>We're here together, so I want it to be a memory of just the two of us.</p>
<p>"Well, that's okay. It was just an idea. I'll take the next one for you."</p>
<p>"It's boring to see a picture with only me in it, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"It's not boring. Come on, give me your digital camera."</p>
<p>"No, thanks. I'm not very photogenic."</p>
<p>"Do you care about your pictures?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do. I was almost half-lidded in the pictures taken on the school trip. Do you know how I felt when the girls were whispering, "Kurose-kun, you look like a Tibetan sand fox.""</p>
<p>"It's cute, Tibetan sand fox. Unlike the pictures from the school trip, I'm the only one who sees the pictures here, so it shouldn't be a problem."</p>
<p>"Even if only Yuzu who sees them, I don't want to be a Tibetan sand fox. I want to be photographed in a cooler way."</p>
<p>"Then why don't you do some processing?"</p>
<p>"I don't want my memories altered."</p>
<p>"You're so selfish......."</p>
<p>"Did you just call me selfish?"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't."</p>
<p>"You did, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did. If you don't like half eyes so much, I'll stop by Purikura on the way home and you can make your eyes as big as you want."</p>
<p>"If you make your eyes bigger, you'll look cute. But I want to look cool."</p>
<p>"That's an extravagant problem. It's better to be pretty.&#12288;Do you know what it's like to be scared of a pretty face?</p>
<p>"I don't know how you feel, but I think you look cool, like an eagle's eye. It's better than a Tibetan fox."</p>
<p>"Of course you're better. You've always cared too much. You have such nice eyes, but you're so extravagant."</p>
<p>"You're the only one who compliments my eyes."</p>
<p>"I don't mind that you don't have good eyes. I like the way you look at me because I have confidence in my own sense of taste."</p>
<p>"I have confidence in my own sense of taste to think a Tibetan sand fox is cute, too. What are you talking about......?"</p>
<p>"I'm talking about not wanting to be in the picture."</p>
<p>"You dismissed that. I want to keep your picture, too."</p>
<p>"Then let's take a picture of the two of us together. It's a good opportunity for us."</p>
<p>"That's right. Let's take a picture together. Then lend me your digital camera."</p>
<p>I handed her my digital camera, and Yuzu grabbed me by the sleeve.</p>
<p>She took me to an object and suddenly pulled her face close to mine...I mean, so close!</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>"Did I get a good shot?"</p>
<p>"Well, wait!&#12288;I'll check it out first!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Because I was staring at you.</p>
<p>If she saw me looking at her like that, clearly conscious of her, it would have made things awkward.</p>
<p>I was just surprised to see her, but I wasn't conscious of her or anything.</p>
<p>"I want to see for myself if it looks bad in the picture. And if it's bad, I'll erase it."</p>
<p>"No, you can't. That's just a memory."</p>
<p>"Don't leave my embarrassing memories for posterity."</p>
<p>"There's nothing to be ashamed of now. Do you know how many times I've seen Kohei's face?</p>
<p>Yuzu checks the screen of the digital camera.</p>
<p>She saw.......</p>
<p>"......That's no good. It's blurry."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>I looked at the digital camera screen and saw that it was really blurry.</p>
<p>Thank goodness Yuzu is not good at taking pictures.</p>
<p>"Next time we take a picture together, let's ask someone nearby."</p>
<p>"I guess it's better to do that."</p>
<p>Well... We were a bit nervous when we arrived, but we got ourselves together and started to enjoy the zoo.</p>
<p>As I unfolded the pamphlet, Yuzu peeked at me from the side.</p>
<p>She has been so close to me since a while ago.......</p>
<p>Well, compared to when we were dating, we're further apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What did you do with yours?"</p>
<p>"I put it in my bag. One brochure is all you need."</p>
<p>"Well, that's okay. So, where do we start?"</p>
<p>"Anywhere is fine, but I'd like to feed them. I want to feed the giraffes and take pictures of the ringlets."</p>
<p>"Well, let's go see the giraffes."</p>
<p>"Well, how did you know it was a giraffe?"</p>
<p>"Well, I've read all the fan books."</p>
<p>"What's your favorite giraffe, by the way?"</p>
<p>"Sunakichi."</p>
<p>Yuzu giggles.</p>
<p>"You like Tibetan sand fox too, don't you?"</p>
<p>"That's fine. I've got a habit of making that all-but-enlightened look on my face."</p>
<p>"You know what I mean. Your face is addictive, too. I never get tired of looking at it. I should enlarge the picture and hang it on my wall."</p>
<p>"Don't do that. I'll be embarrassed when I go to your house......."</p>
<p>"Then why don't you hang my picture in your room?"</p>
<p>"It would be embarrassing if Sana saw it ...... so let's go see it soon, Linlin-chan."</p>
<p>"Sure!"</p>
<p>We walked through the park, which was crowded with children, and spotted a giraffe.</p>
<p>He sticks his long neck out of his cage and eats a carrot offered by the children.</p>
<p>Hmmm, the feed booth is at.......</p>
<p>As I was looking around with a furtive glance, Yuzu shook me by the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Kohei!&#12288;Kohei!&#12288;I found the panel!&#12288;It's Linlin-chan!"</p>
<p>"Oh. She's more magnificent than I thought she'd be."</p>
<p>Linlin-chan is a bipedal giraffe wearing a sailor suit.</p>
<p>She is described as a gal-girl style, and her spots are made up of ganguro make-up.</p>
<p>If I were a chemist, I would be excited by the design, but unfortunately, I can only moe up to the animal ears.</p>
<p>"Look Kohei!&#12288;Look at her eyelashes!&#12288;They're so long and beautiful!"</p>
<p>"Yes, they are!"</p>
<p>"Her legs are so slender and beautiful!"</p>
<p>"I love that you wear a scarf all year round."</p>
<p>"I have a complex about my long neck, so I hide it. I also have a complex about my eyes, so I understand how you feel......."</p>
<p>"That's why I told you not to worry about it. I like the way you look at me."</p>
<p>"Yeah, thanks. I wish Linlin-chan had someone like Kohei to tell her that."</p>
<p>"I have high hopes for Sunakichi. I'm sure you'll be able to find someone like Kohei. I don't think they've ever spoken to each other in the book."</p>
<p>"Sunakichi is so shy that he just appears in the corner and doesn't say a single word. So, as Sunakichi's deputy, you should comfort Linlin-chan."</p>
<p>"Me?&#12288;I'm usually embarrassed. .......Your neck isn't as long as you think it is."</p>
<p>"No, you can't. That doesn't convey how I feel. You should praise her more sincerely, like you did for me. Like this - I love your neck!"</p>
<p>The children stare at Yuzu as she loudly praises the panel.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm so embarrassed. I've learned a lot about Anipara, but it's hard to get excited with the same fervor as the fans.......</p>
<p>Not that I don't enjoy it, of course.</p>
<p>Watching Yuzu get excited is enjoyable in itself.</p>
<p>"Look Kohei!&#12288;Linlin-chan just smiled!"</p>
<p>"She was smiling from the beginning!"</p>
<p>"She's smiling more than before in my eyes!&#12288;Let's take a picture while we're at it!"</p>
<p>"With you?"</p>
<p>"Come on!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes."</p>
<p>I asked one of the people nearby, and he gladly took my picture.</p>
<p>I thanked him and we both checked out the photos.</p>
<p>......Okay, I'm looking straight ahead.</p>
<p>"Well... Let's feed them."</p>
<p>We find a vending machine and buy some carrot sticks.</p>
<p>Yuzu hesitantly approaches the carrot, and the giraffe sticks out its tongue.</p>
<p>Using its long tongue skillfully, it puts the carrot in its mouth.</p>
<p>"Look, look!&#12288;He's eating it like it's delicious!&#12288;Why don't you learn from him a little bit, Kohei?"</p>
<p>"What do you want me to learn from him?"</p>
<p>"You didn't like carrots. You always ate them like they were bitter."</p>
<p>"Actually, they were bitter. But I never left them out."</p>
<p>"No, but you never said they tasted good either. Not only the carrots, but my cooking in general."</p>
<p>"I complimented you on your cooking. Did you forget my reaction the first time I ate your home-cooked food?"</p>
<p>"How could I forget? You were so happy, you said, 'This is the first time in my life I've ever tasted such delicious food.' right?&#12288;You praised me, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"But it wasn't just the beginning. I thought maybe your tastes had changed, so I tried to season it in various ways.</p>
<p>"That's ...... what I thought you'd understand without telling me."</p>
<p>"You won't know if I don't tell you. Have you reflected on......?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did. Reflecting."</p>
<p>"So please don't whine about it."</p>
<p>I don't want to fight with Yuzu anymore.</p>
<p>"Right. Then......."</p>
<p>Yuzu fidgets and rubs her thighs together.</p>
<p>And then, shyly lifting up her bag, she said.</p>
<p>"Do you want to eat ...... my home-cooked food?"</p>
<p>"......You made me a bento?"</p>
<p>"It's a holiday, and I thought the restaurant might be crowded. ......You can go to a restaurant if you don't want to......."</p>
<p>"No, I don't mind!"</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah, that's right! Okay, then!"</p>
<p>We looked at the pamphlet and headed for the plaza.</p>
<p>On the way, we spotted a pony. Apparently, you can try horseback riding.</p>
<p>"Why don't we do it later?"</p>
<p>"If we're going to ride, let's do it first. It's pretty bumpy and I might throw up."</p>
<p>"It won't be that bumpy."</p>
<p>"But I fell off from my horse.'</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's happened to you. Why don't you get revenge?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't want to. I made a vow that day. Even if we go back in time to the Warring States period, I'm still going to be a foot soldier."</p>
<p>Yuzu giggles, perhaps remembering that time.</p>
<p>"You said something like that. I didn't think you'd actually go back in time."</p>
<p>"I guess so. Anyway, if you're interested, come on board. I'll stay here and film it for you."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll do you a favor."</p>
<p>I moved to the fence, set up my camera, and took pictures of Yuzu astride the pony. The pony seemed to be swaying quite a bit, so she gripped the reins tightly to keep from being swept off, and kept her eyes fixed on the front of the pony.</p>
<p>Halfway around the course, she seemed to have gotten used to it, and when I let go of the reins, she started waving at me.</p>
<p>I quickly snapped a photo. Satisfied with that one shot, Yuzu grips the reins again.</p>
<p>"......"</p>
<p>I found myself clutching my cell phone.</p>
<p>As soon as I took the picture with my phone, Yuzu turned around to look at me.</p>
<p>From that position, She might not have been able to see the cell phone, but I can't be ...... sure. She might ask why I was taking pictures with my cell phone.</p>
<p>I just wanted to save it on my phone when I saw Yuzu happily riding her horse.</p>
<p>I don't have any guilty thoughts at all, but I don't feel comfortable explaining that to Yuzu......</p>
<p>And then Yuzu came back.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/RQycHrj/3cuYb5p.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p>"Did your digital camera run out of charge?"</p>
<p>"Eh, why?"</p>
<p>"You were taking pictures with your cell phone. ......Oh?&#12288;It's not out of charge, is it?"</p>
<p>"Well, yeah. But you see, that's it. ...... Yeah, that's right. I got an allowance from my mom for a grand."</p>
<p>"You got that much?"</p>
<p>She told me to go to the zoo and have fun. I wanted to make sure I had proof that I went to the zoo.</p>
<p>"I don't think they'll suspect me if I don't have proof. ...... I wanted to pose for the picture anyway. Did I make a funny face or something?"</p>
<p>"I took the picture from a distance, so you can't see my face clearly."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's fine. That's okay. Let's go to the square."</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>I managed to make it through.</p>
<p>I sat down on a bench in the plaza, feeling relieved.</p>
<p>Then, I quickly bit into Yuzu's homemade bento - a sandwich.</p>
<p>"......What do you think?"</p>
<p>"It's delicious."</p>
<p>"How good?"</p>

<p>"......So good that I don't think I've ever had food this good before."</p>
<p>"What else?"</p>
<p>"What else?&#12288;...... I can't wait to try it again."</p>
<p>"How often?"</p>
<p>"How often is ...... every day?"</p>
<p>"Not every day, unless you live with me."</p>
<p>"I know, you don't have to tell me. I just wanted to tell you that it's so good that I want to eat it every day."</p>
<p>"......Do you ever get tired of eating it every day?"</p>
<p>"I never get tired of it."</p>
<p>Every time I say a compliment, Yuzu's cheeks relax as if she's in a good mood.</p>
<p>She looks a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Well, of course it's delicious. I used the best seasonings for you."</p>
<p>"Seasonings?&#12288;......It doesn't taste particularly unusual, but what did you use?"</p>
<p>"It's a secret."</p>
<p>What kind of seasoning is a secret?</p>
<p>I'm curious, but ...... it's okay. It's just plain delicious.</p>
<p>"Where do you want to go when you're done?"</p>
<p>"I don't care where we go. We'll go all the way around in the end."</p>
<p>"That's going to take forever."</p>
<p>"You don't like it?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't mind. It's fun."</p>
<p>Going to the zoo with Yuzu and eating a homemade bento without worrying about the time. I was really enjoying this date, which I hadn't been able to do since I got busy with work.</p>
<p>......No, it wasn't a date.</p>
