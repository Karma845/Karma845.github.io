<h3>Afterword</h3>

 &#12305;&#12305;&#12305;&#12305;</p>

<p>Kohei and Yuzu's life as lovers (married couple) is still going on.</p>
<p>However, the purpose of the story, which was to bring them back together, has been successfully fulfilled, so I will end the story now.</p>
<p>So, I will put an end to this story.</p>
<p>I have not written many stories about Ken couples before, but if I am not careful, most of the stories are about lovers.</p>
<p>I had so much fun writing this story that if I wasn't careful, most of the story would be filled with lovers' quarrels.</p>
<p>I hope readers enjoyed it as much as I did.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for reading to the end.</p>
