<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Exchange Of Address For The Second Time</h3>

<p>On Saturday afternoon. Right after lunch, I left my house.</p>
<p>My destination is a manga cafe in a shopping district. After work, I usually went there just for sleep, but this time, I'm going to enjoy reading manga and watching anime. That's why I'm currently heading to the station in a warm and cheerful mood---</p>
<p>"Why are you here?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's my line!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>On the station platform, I met up with Yuzuhana. She is wearing a cardigan. If I look at her clothes, she's cute, but those eyes that are looking at me, aren't cute. I glared at her with a gaze that looked like my eyeballs were about to pop out.</p>
<p>"You must be stalking me, right?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Wow, you must be good at mind reading games, huh." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I don't have any special abilities like that. Well, but I'm sure you must be thinking, 'I don't look well in this outfit.'" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I thought you definitely are good at reading other people's minds." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"So, is my answer correct?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Wrong." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Then, what do you think of my outfit?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I think your clothes are cute. Your clothes, okay, not you." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"But I don't like it when you compliment me when you are unfashionable and ignorant." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Then what was the correct answer?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"The correct answer is please leave this station." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, I don't want to leave this station." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Then please change your train car." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I have no obligation to obey you." [Kurose]</p>
<p>Yuzu and I shot sparks at each other. Then, Yuzu suddenly remembered.</p>
<p>"By the way, I used to give you chocolate every year on Valentine's Day. Give me back the time I spend on you now." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"But I gave you back on White Day, so we're even." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"What? Was that handmade chocolate made with love?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It's a gift I spent a lot of time choosing. Especially that time you insisted on a date in the middle of the night, so return the grace you took for that drive date." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"But I've massaged you as my thanks, we're break even. By the way, you said, 'Girls in white dresses and straw hats only exist in anime.', right?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Did I really say that?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Then I went to the sunflower field for you, so you owed me." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That was you who took the initiative yourself, but I also rewarded you with a sunflower necklace that I gave you. And you've been addicted to latte art for quite some time, haven't you?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"That's because someone introduced it on SMS." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Then I took you to the cafe where you can drink latte art, and you practice latte art until you can drink latte art whenever you want. And the result, you can brew it well. You owe me one." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Now it's my turn. You said, 'I want to do Kabedon,' so I gave you Kabedon. So, we're even." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That was just once..." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"But you liked it so much!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's a different story! You owe me two." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"What? Why?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Because I gave you two, I took you to a latte shop and trained you, doesn't that count as two?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"One!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"HAHA, no! I won't be able to win over you if I don't count it as two." [Kurose]</p><p>"You are a stingy bastard! Well, it doesn't matter. I still have a lot of memories of it." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's my line! 100 or 200 isn't even enough to please you!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"That's my line! It's not enough to please you even with 300 or 400!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>Yuzu and I continued to fight using our memories as weapons. The train arrived before the argument was over, so we raced to be the first one onto the train.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Since it's a holiday, it's quite crowded inside. There was one empty seat for two, so I went there as fast as I could. When I sat by the window, Yuzuhana sat next to me.</p>
<p>"Why are you sitting next to me?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Because there are no other seats available." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Well, the that seat over is still empty." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"I'm nervous about standing next to someone I don't know. It's cramped. Move a little bit." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"What a selfish woman." [Kurose]</p>
<p>I spoke quietly, glaring.</p>
<p>"You just said 'selfish', didn't you?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I haven't said it yet." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"You already said that!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I haven't said it yet! Don't talk to me while we are on the train. That's annoying!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Then, lend me your phone." [Yuzu]</p><p>"For what?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Just lend it to me." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Don't ruin it, okay?" [Kurose]</p>
<p>When I handed her the phone, she quickly used it then gave it back to me. Then Yuzuhana typed a message on her cell phone-</p>
<p>[Did you just call me selfish?] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>I received an email from an address that I didn't recognize. The sender was Yuzuhana. Since I didn't want to talk in the carriage, so she asked about it via email.</p>
<p>I replied while struggling with this phone feature for the first time in a long time</p>
<p>*As this is done via SMS, I decided to leave brackets for texting*</p>
<p>[Who are you?] [Kurose]</p>
<p>[It's me!] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>[Please stop spamming me! Do you want me to report you?] [Kurose]</p>
<p>The next moment, she pinched my thigh.</p>
<p>[Why must you answer me with violence?!] [Kurose]</p>
<p>[I didn't hear you clearly! But you just said that I am selfish, right?] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>She is very persistent. To change the topic, I decided to send a cute photo. Yuzu looked at the screen with apprehension.</p>
<p>[It's a scary photo, isn't it?] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>[How evil is that mouth of yours? Just open it, it's nothing.] [Kurose]</p>
<p>[Promised me, okay?] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>Then, Yuzuhana laughed before she pinched my thigh again.</p>
<p>[Don't make me laugh, people around me will definitely think I'm weird now.] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>[If you hold grudges, make me laugh too!] [Kurose]</p>
<p>[In that case, look over there.] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>When I looked out the window, I heard the sound of the camera snapping. Then I immediately received an email. When I opened the photo, it was a photo of Yuzu's face.</p>
<p>[Ha ha ha.] [Kurose]</p>
<p>[Nothing worth laughing at. This is your face when you kissed me, you know?] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>[You have an octopus mouth! When I kissed you, did I really have a face like this?!] [Kurose]</p>
<p>[...That's a secret.] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>[Say it! I won't be angry if you say it!] [Kurose]</p>
<p>[Nah, you'll definitely get angry.] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>[I already told you that I won't get angry!] [Kurose]</p>
<p>[See, you're angry." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>[I am not angry. (* ^ _ ^ *)] [Kurose]</p>
<p>[See? You're angry (T_T)] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>She shot me a glare. So, I sent her various pictures of Sana to change the topic which worked quite well.</p>
<p>[How many photos do you have of her?] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>[There are many.] [Kurose]</p>
<p>[You love Sana so much.] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>[She's the one who sent it to me without me asking.] [Kurose]</p>
<p>[Send me some, I want to be healed by her photos when I'm frustrated.] [Yuzu]</p>
<p>After carefully selecting and sending several, I finally arrived at my station. When I tried to stand up, Yuzu also stood up. The station was near were malls and shopping districts which were both remarkably close to this station, so it was natural that she would also get off here. We left the station without exchanging words. I walked with bigger strides, but Yuzuhana was able to catch up to me quickly.</p>
<p>As a result, we were almost next to each other.</p>
<p>"Don't follow me!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Are you talking to me?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if we talk outside." [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Even though you promised not to get involved with me from the beginning?" [Yuzu]</p>

<p>"I really don't want to get involved with you. And if you don't want to get involved either, stay away from me!" [Kurose]</p>
<p>"Why do I always have to see you even on my holidays?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>While arguing and walking non-stop, we finally arrived at the shopping district. Then we stopped almost at the same time.</p>
<p>""You want to go to the manga cafe too?!"" [Yuzu &amp; Kurose]</p>

<p>We even screamed at the same time too...</p>
