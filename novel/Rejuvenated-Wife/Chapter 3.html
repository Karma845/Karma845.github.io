<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; For Some Reason, My Ex-wife Came To Me</h3>

<p>By the time the acceptance ceremony was over, my heart was still making a roaring sound. It's very uncomfortable for me to think that the person behind me isn't Yuzu when I was in high school back then, but who I've fought with many times when I was married.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yuzu didn't know that I had returned to the past. So as long as I don't make mistakes like Yuzu, then I'll be able to get through all of this without getting caught.</p>
<p>However, when I thought about what would happen if I got caught, I immediately felt depressed when I thought that I would be living a tumultuous school life with my ex-wife in this small classroom.</p>
<p>Because of that, I have to maintain my behavior to be the same as what I did in my previous timeline!</p>
<p>Yuzu started to get involved with me after graduation, so even though it didn't go exactly the same way as it used to, I wouldn't be caught right away, but I had to be careful not to stray significantly.</p>
<p>"Please pay attention to everything."</p>
<p>Sawashiro-sensei caught the attention of the students by applauding.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the classroom was relaxed, perhaps because the tension had subsided after the acceptance ceremony, or because I was relieved to be able to chat with my classmates.</p>
<p>With a cheerful smile that encouraged the leeway, Sawashiro-sensei continued his words.</p>
<p>"I'll be handing out the sheets, so please take a seat. Here the schedule is for the month, so please read it carefully."</p>
<p>The schedule for this month will be postponed soon .I have to check it properly to remember my school days.</p>
<p>When I see Yuzu's face, I might get annoyed, so I tried to hand over the print I received from Kikuchi-san without looking back.</p>
<p>"Tsun--?!"</p>
<p>Our fingers touched each other and my whole body shook.</p>
<p>Oh, calm down on me! Yuzu is my ex-wife! Don't get aroused just by accidentally touching his finger!</p>
<p>She should'nt have noticed, right? Since that's the typical reaction of a high schooler who never came into contact with a girl, I shouldn't be suspected by Yuzu.</p>
<p>I immediately left the classroom without being stopped by her when the school bell rang.</p>
<p>I jumped out of the school gate and sighed.</p>
<p>"Phew."</p>
<p>I'm safe now. School life with ex-wife will start seriously later, but for now, it's still a relief.</p>
<p>There's still plenty of time, should I enjoy my life by playing games for the first time so I can regain my spirit?</p>
<p>I decided to do it, so I went straight home early.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"Oh no, this is a featured phone."</p>
<p>Even though there are smartphones in this era, they only debuted when we entered high school. So I had to wait a few years first when the smartphone gaming market was on the rise.</p>
<p>I won't be able to play it even if I buy the newest model now. Because playing mobile games is on hold now.</p>
<p>So, I turned on the game console two generations ago and played the games I used to play.</p>
<p>Manufacturing military commanders and slashing soldiers as if they were insects.</p>
<p>Back then, I was really impressed because it looked like a live-action movie, but when I look at it now, the negative is harsher.</p>
<p>If I use a special move, it will strengthen my stress. I got bored in just about 10 minutes and tried taking turns playing other nostalgic games, but I didn't like it.</p>
<p>I searched for games that looked interesting on the internet, and also watched games online.</p>
<p>In the past, I avoided games within games that seemed to steal my time because there were too many games I wanted to play, but since now it is the second round of my life, so it seemed like it would be fun to play a game I never played before.</p>
<p>But the problem is with money. According to what I remember, there were a lot of new games this spring and by then, I should have used up my savings.</p>
<p>My monthly allowance is 6 thousand yen. Half of them will go towards the phone bill, so the game purchases will be made earlier next month.</p>
<p>"Should I go to the bookstore?"</p>
<p>Let's spend my free time buying light novels.</p>
<p>When I changed my uniform into my daily clothes and almost leave the room, I suddenly remembered something.</p>
<p>"Today is the day when my PC died, right"</p>
<p>That's right. I didn't see it in person, but someone (probably Sana) said that thunder was hitting a nearby park. Because of that, my computer crashed and I had to give up on the newest games for a while.</p>
<p>"I think I can handle it."</p>
<p>After unplugging the outlet and taking some precautions to prevent a lightning strike, I went outside with my umbrella.</p>
<p>It takes about 30 minutes on foot to get to the nearest bookstore.</p>
<p>It's an ideal shop for kids, as there are comics, light novels, games, and CD's there.</p>
<p>"How nostalgic."</p>
<p>In the winter of my sophomore year of high school, the store went bankrupt due to sluggish sales.</p>
<p>At that time, I was really shocked. Because this place is a storehouse of memories that I have always visited since I was a kid.</p>
<p>If my PC doesn't crash and I use the money to buy books there, then it will add a little to their income. A little difference should have prevented this shop from going bankrupt.</p>
<p>While thinking that, I entered a nostalgic bookstore.</p>
<p>"What?!"</p>
<p>There's Yuzuhana around the manga corner.</p>
<p>What the hell is this? She said she used to always buy books at the mall when she didn't know me! I was the one who told Yuzu about this bookstore. But this shop was already closed when I told her. So did she purposely come here to see what kind of shop this place was?</p><p>No, I don't know why she came to the shop I told her about. Because Yuzu hates me. Then this shop should be a disgusting place for Yuzu.</p>
<p>Well, this bookstore is innocent after all. Since there's nothing to buy other than books, plus this shop is the closest, so I always feel comfortable when I come here.</p>
<p>So let's just skip it. I have to pretend I don't see her the way I used to be.</p>
<p>Even though I decided to, I was too lazy to pass Yuzu, so I decided to go through the game corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then&#8212;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>Yuzuhana came over for me.</p>
<p>She saw my face and said "Ah!"</p>
<p>If it's been a few days since the entrance ceremony, then it would be unnatural for you to be without a reaction when you see me, but today is the first day of high school. So it's not natural that you can remember the faces of your classmates!</p>
<p>"Kurose-kun, right?"</p>
<p>Why are you talking to me?!</p>
<p>It's over! Besides, what the hell "Kurose-kun, right?"</p>
<p>It's not a name that you can't forget even if you wanted to!</p>
<p>"Well, Who?"</p>
<p>"I was sitting in the back seat. You know, I said something weird when I was introducing myself."</p>
<p>"Sorry, I was playing games all night yesterday, so I was sleeping in the middle of class when you introduced yourself."</p>
<p>"You're right. This was Kurose-kun typical."</p>
<p>"What the hell with Kurose-kun? Today should be our first meeting."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. My words just now. Please forgive me."</p>
<p>Seriously? I almost got caught by Yuzu if I missed that by just now.</p>
<p>"What kind of game is the Kurose playing?"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I also like playing games, so please let me know if you have any recommended games."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait, why are you asking me this?!bWhy didn't you get involved with me?! Even though we have different timelines, I'm still me!nI'm Kohei Kurose, the one you hated back then!bWhy are you trying to get involved with me even though I've been repeating my life?!</p>
<p>Without knowing what she meant, I gave her some of the games I recommended.</p>
<p>Then&#8212;</p>
<p>"I like it too!"</p>
<p>Yuzu laughed suddenly. That smile made me wonder. It's been a long time since I last saw Yuzu's smiles.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I thought that she was cute.</p>
<p>Oi, remember my vow that it is better to live with a cockroach than to live with her! Be calm, my beating heart!</p>
<p>"I like hunting games, especially Musou, which I've been playing for over 100 hours. I reached max stats for all my warlords and I know where and what items are on the map."</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, that's right. Koikawa-san, you play too many games."</p>
<p>But my playing hours are more than 300 hours long.</p>
<p>"Surprising. huh?"</p>
<p>"Well, that's surprising."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Why do you look like a Yankee? I'm not afraid of you at all."</p>
<p>No, I'm actually scared.</p>
<p>She wasn't scary if her eyes were normal, though she was weak in real combat. But if her eyes are sharp, her beauty will increase up to 50%</p>
<p>"I'm not glaring at you. The reason why my eyes are like this is because I have poor eyesight."</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>I know it. Yuzu comes from the countryside and she now lives alone, away from his parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was originally a clumsy girl with black hair and glasses, but because she wanted to enter high school, where she didn't want to be bullied, so she dyed her hair and took off her glasses.</p>
<p>I never had any contact with her at school before then.bIt was because I was afraid of being seen as a foreign object in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Why aren't you wearing glasses?"</p>
<p>"I will only wear glasses while studying."</p>
<p>"But you have bad eyesight, don't you?"</p>
<p>"I can see clearly if I bring my face closer like this."</p>
<p>Wow! Don't suddenly bring your face close to me! Because my heart can't hold it.</p>
<p>"Kurose-kun's face looks young, doesn't it?"</p>
<p>"Well, that's because I just started high school."</p>
<p>Don't talk at such a close range!</p>
<p>Her breathing is sweet. I thought I'd be able to touch those big breasts a little more!</p>
<p>"By the way, is Kurose-kun the only child?"</p>
<p>"I have a younger sister."</p>
<p>"You have a younger sisters?!"</p>
<p>Yuzu's face lit up.</p>
<p>Are you serious? Maybe the reason she got involved with me now, the person she hated, was to hang out with Sana. The two are quite close.</p>
<p>"What's her name?"</p>
<p>"Sana."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sana-chan? That's a cute name. What kind of girls? Is there a photo of her?"</p>
<p>"Nah."</p>
<p>"Oh, I want to see it~"</p>
<p>If I had a thirst for women, I would have immediately invited her over to my house to get closer to Yuzu, but we just got divorced yesterday.</p>
<p>In the first place, I had no intention of getting involved with Yuzuhana.&nbsp; So it's a ridiculous thing if I invite you to my house!</p>
