<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; Don't Repeat The Same Mistake</h3>

<p>After school on Friday.</p><p>Yuzu and I were visiting a nearby family restaurant.</p>
<p>I plan to spend my time until dinner comes by snacking on french fries...</p>
<p>"&#8230;&#8230;What a fool."</p>
<p>Yuzuhana said so with a sigh and looked at me with an astonished expression.</p>
<p>"Don't call me fool, idiot."</p>
<p>"I said it to you purposely, you know why?"</p>
<p>"Because of the quiz?"</p>
<p>"Huh? You know if that's not what I mean, right? Or is it a question that you don't even know the answer to? I'll ask you again, you know why?"</p>
<p>"M-My ability..."</p>
<p>"How many point if Kohei's ability is measured?"</p>
<p>"2 points..."</p>
<p>"That's right. By the way, this is what I'm capable of."</p>
<p>With pride, she took out the quiz paper from her bag.</p>
<p>It's 10 points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"&#8230;&#8230;Stupid."</p>
<p>"What do you mean? Do you think a perfect score is 100?"</p>
<p>"I said it because I felt disappointed when I was shown a perfect score."</p>
<p>"What a stupid kid..."</p>
<p>"So what if I'm a kid? In fact, a 15-year-old is still a kid. After all, I'm stupid, and in the future, Yuzu will also go to the same university as me. Doesn't that mean we're on the same level?"</p>
<p>"Shut up! That's because I had to because I was thrown from my first choice university! Basically, my grades are much better than yours. Come on, worship me."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. You're so genius."</p>
<p>"So, you admit that you're stupid, right?"</p>
<p>"Not yet."</p>
<p>"Just admit it. You became stupid because you like to do baby talk, so let's stop it."</p>
<p>"Isn't that you who likes baby talk?"</p>
<p>"What? I didn't."</p>
<p>"Yes. You told me, 'Nice work!' when I just got home from overtime."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't want admit it!"</p>
<p>"After that, while stroking my head, you said, 'baby, today you will be taken care of by Yuzu Mama.'"</p>
<p>"I don't want admit that either! Usually, if I said that, you would reply, "Relax, I'm right here!'"</p>
<p>"Well, back then, I was just trying to calm you down because you were afraid of thunder!"</p>
<p>"What kind of person would feel comfortable after being given baby talk?!"</p>
<p>"It's you! Trust me! I mean, please don't talk about this in a family restaurant!"</p>
<p>"That's my line! You just trying to divert the topic! You know who the problem is, right?"</p>
<p>"Well ... a math quiz."</p>
<p>This time, it's a quiz, so I don't have to blame anyone, but if I make the same mistake in the midterms at the end of next month, then I'll have to stay at school to study again.</p><p>[TL: Remedial.]</p>
<p>Then, if I made a mistake on the final exam at the end of June, then the results would be returned during summer vacation.</p>
<p>To share the summer with that strict teacher &#8230;&nbsp; I can't stand it even though I've been groomed by my boss so many times.</p>
<p>"Sigh ... I came to the family restaurant intending to enjoying a chat, but you stepped on a mine instead." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It's not good to talk about it."</p>
<p>"I thought you would bragging around."</p>
<p>"No, I'm proud of that."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"That's a pleasant memory. It doesn't matter if I enjoy or give up on my summer vacation, it has nothing to do with Yuzu."</p>
<p>"Uhm ... if you stay, then you won't have any friends to play with."</p>
<p>"You don't have to worry about it. I was able to avoid it last time."</p>
<p>"But, that doesn't mean you can dodge it again this time too, right? Generally speaking, if you get a result like that, then you won't be able to invite me to play with confidence."</p>
<p>That's why, while clapping, Yuzu made a loud sound.</p>
<p>"You can study with me so you can play in peace later. Our first goal is to get a perfect score on the next quiz. Is it okay?"</p>
<p>"Study..."</p>
<p>"I know I'm not good teacher. But, I'll give you a good lesson."</p>
<p>Yuzuhana said that with a smile.</p>
<p>I wonder if she will taught me well or not. But, if I lose grades, then I have to spend more money.&nbsp; I was already planning to play with Yuzu during summer vacation.&nbsp; It's very inconvenient to cut my pocket money.</p>
<p>"By the way, what should I do for you in return?"</p>
<p>"No need, but &#8230; how about treat me today?&#8221;</p>
<p>"Just a cheap one, okay?"</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll order a cake, it should be cheap."</p>
<p>"Well, please order me as well. I need to go to the restroom first."</p>
<p>"Which cake?"</p>
<p>"Anything is fine."</p>
<p>"You always say anything is fine ... well, it's okay. I'll order what you like the most."</p>
<p>"Nice to know you."</p>
<p>Yuzu sent me off as I left my seat.</p>
<p>When I finished my business and tried to return to my seat, I witnessed an unknown guy who was talking to Yuzuhana.</p>
<p>He sat on the chair that I just sat in a while ago and talked to her happily.</p>
<p>He was a boy that wearing the same uniform as me.&nbsp; There's another handsome guy who came here too apparently!</p>
<p>"That's my seat."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. Then, Koikawa-san, see you at school again. I hope for a good answer."</p>
<p>With a refreshing smile, he left my seat and joined the people in the same uniform as him.</p>
<p>"...Do you know that guy?"</p>
<p>"Yamada-kun. From the soccer club."</p>
<p>"Yamada ... ah, Yamada who will be my classmate next year."</p>
<p>I remember that he received chocolates not only from his classmates, but also from his juniors on Valentine's Day.&nbsp; Being my classmate means being in the same class as Yuzu...</p>
<p>"Are you close to him?"</p>
<p>"You know I don't have any friends, right? I just talked to Yamada for the first time recently. When I was about to go home, a ball flew out of nowhere and Yamada appeared and said, 'Are you hurt?'"</p>
<p>"I see. Then, what were you two talking about just now?"</p>
<p>"If I haven't decided to join a club, why don't I just become their club manager?"</p>
<p>"So, you were invited to be the manager...?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's true. He wasn't afraid when he looked into my eyes. Instead, he looked at it. The one who wasn't afraid of me, I thought it was just Kohei."</p>
<p>Yuzu felt proud of it.</p>
<p>She was happy to talk to, but also a little annoyed.</p>
<p>"...Then, we can't play after school?"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Don't you want to be the manager of a soccer club?"</p>
<p>"Maybe ... are you frustrated, Kohei?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm not."</p>
<p>"Hmm? You're jealous because I complimented Yamada-kun, aren't you? Hey, that's so cute."</p>
<p>Yuzu narrowed her eyes and smirked.</p>
<p>My embarrassment and annoyance were mixed, but I managed to reply with a firm tone.</p>
<p>"I shouldn't be jealous of that. Unlike Yuzu, I'm the type of person who doesn't restrain his partner. I don't care about who Yuzu hangs out with."</p>
<p>"...What? What does that mean? Can you stop talking about it?"</p>
<p>"I'm not done yet."</p>
<p>"But I have. Your heart is really narrow."</p>
<p>"It's no good if you let another guy sit in my chair. Don't talk to other men when you're with me."</p>
<p>"It was just a coincidence! Didn't you just restrain me when you didn't like seeing me talking to other men?!"</p>
<p>With her rugged appearance, Yuzu stood up with a bag in her hand.</p>
<p>She left the restaurant without even glancing at me.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because they overheard our conversation just now, so she noticed that the soccer club was looking this way, and that made her angry.</p>
<p>Well, let's go home now.</p>
<p>When I tried to stand up, the waiter said, "Sorry to keep you waiting." and two plates of cake arrived.&nbsp; It's my favorite cheesecake and shortcake.</p>
<p>The thought of Yuzu's appearance, while choosing the cake, made my chest hurt.</p>
<p>***</p><p>"I am home&#8230;&#8230;"</p>
<p>"Oh! Welcome back, Onii-chan!"</p>
<p>When I arrived at home, Sana jumped out from the dining room.</p>
<p>The temperature difference between me and her was too contrasting.</p>

<p>"I have a gift for Onii-chan today!"</p>
<p>"A gift?"</p>
<p>"Yes, a gift!</p>
<p>Sana showed a paper that hidden behind her.</p>
<p>It was a zoo entry ticket with pictures of giraffes and elephants.</p>
<p>"My mom given to me! She got it from someone at work!"</p>
<p>"Ah..."</p>
<p>No, this scene...</p>
<p>It happened 12 years ago, but I don't really remember it what happened that day.</p>
<p>However, I'm sure I never going to the zoo.&nbsp; Well ... I couldn't find a partner to go with, and I also didn't want to go alone, and I thought the expiration date had passed.</p>
<p>"Do you want to go with me?"</p>
<p>"If I don't have errands, I'd like to. But, I have club activities, so I'll skip it!"</p>
<p>"It looks like it's almost a month before the expiration date, but can't you take a day off?"</p>
<p>"I am the famous ace candidate as the next manager of the basketball club! I will play basketball every day and grow taller and earn the nickname "Mount Fuji"!"</p>
<p>Currently, she is neither a manager nor an ace nor Mount Fuji, but I knew that her motivation has been acknowledged, and she will be appointed as a manager.</p>
<p>Sana's excitement that day burns in my memory, so I can't force her to go to the zoo.</p>
<p>"I'm not interested in going to the zoo either, so I'll skip that too. Just give it to your friends."</p>
<p>"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Look closely, Onii-chan! There are two tickets here, okay?"</p>
<p>"I'm not interested, and I don't want to go there twice, either."</p>
<p>"Then, you should go with your girlfriend!"</p>
<p>"Girlfriend ... Yuzu is just my friend."</p>
<p>"Jiahaha! You guys call each other by first names! What a beautiful youth!"</p>
<p>"Don't tease your brother. Since we're friends, it's natural to call each other by name."</p>
<p>"By the way, if you guys are on good terms, you should have invited her! That's why, take it! The expired is near, so invite her early!"</p>
<p>"She probably has something she has to do."</p>
<p>"You'll never know if you don't invite her. As your relationship lasts longer, please say "That's was Sana who brought us together" in your marriage!"</p>
<p>"I will not marry her!"</p>
<p>"Don't be shy, Onii-chan!"</p>
<p>I was chased away by Sana with a grinning face and headed to my room.</p>
<p>I decided to read the manga until dinner time, but I was distressed about the tickets.</p>
<p>Should I invite her?</p>
<p>I turned on my computer and checked it online.</p>
<p>"...Hey, are they collaborating with Anipara?"</p>
<p>They collaborated with the children's anime "Animal Paradise", which is celebrating its first birthday this spring.</p>
<p>A panel for the photo shoot was placed in the park, and a stamp rally was also held.&nbsp; It looks like we can get a tin badge when we finish stamping all the animals that are there.</p>
<p>In the morning, I only watch it occasionally, and I'm not that addicted to it, but Yuzu sees it as a healing anime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8230;&#8230;What should I do?</p>
<p>I just had a fight with Yuzuhana.&nbsp; It was awkward to invite her.&nbsp; As usual, I will wait for our relationship to be restored naturally...</p>
<p>"But ... that's not good."</p>
<p>I'm the worst.</p>
<p>Instead of expecting time to fix it, I should fixing the relationship myself.</p>
<p>Otherwise, even if it seems to have been peaceful on the surface, a cloud will remain in the heart, and discontent will explode over trivial matters, and it may not be able to change.</p>
<p>The last time, we decided to get a divorce.&nbsp; I want avoid remarrying, but I also don't want to repeat the same mistake again.</p>
<p>After making my decision, I made a phone call.</p>
<p>Immediately, a reply came in a stiff voice.</p>
<p>||&nbsp; "What?"</p>
<p>Well, she was angry with me anyway.</p>
<p>"That's ... do you have time tomorrow?"</p>
<p>||&nbsp; "For what?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if it's tomorrow or the day after, but I'm thinking of going to the zoo ... it's because my mom gave me a ticket..."</p>
<p>||&nbsp"Do you want to go there with me?"</p>
<p>"There's no one else I can invite, and I think going out with Yuzu would be more fun than being alone..."</p>
<p>||&nbsp; "Hmm. I see. Do you really want to go to the zoo?"</p>
<p>||&nbsp"Yeah. I really want to go there with Yuzu ... can you come with me there?"</p>
<p>||&nbsp; "Okay, I'll come with you."</p>
<p>Even though I was looking at the ceiling, but I really felt happy when I heard that bright voice.</p>
<p>Alright.&nbsp; It seemed she was already in a good mood.</p>
<p>"Is it okay to meet at the station tomorrow afternoon?"</p>
<p>||&nbsp; "We should go in the morning if possible."</p>
<p>"Okay, but are you really planning to go there since morning?"</p>
<p>||&nbsp; "Not really. It's because we'll be able to enjoy it longer if we go early, right? Does Kohei have any business in the morning?"</p>
<p>"No. Then, we'll meet in front of the station at 9:00. I'll check the train departure time and sent you an e-mail later..."</p>
<p> "About Yamada-kun. I hate Yamada-kun, okay?"</p>
<p>"...Are you thinking of me?"</p>
<p>I can only think so.</p>
<p>Because ... Yamada-kun is a handsome guy.</p><p>He have high communicative competence, and I think he will get along well with the shy Yuzuhana.</p><p>||&nbsp; "It's not like that. Yamada-kun, he got divorced last summer. So, in the future, he will get divorced because of infidelity."</p><p>"...Is that true?"</p><p>||&nbsp; "Yeah. That's what I heard at the reunion last year."</p><p>By the way, the alumni didn't invite me that time.</p><p>Yuzuhana invited me and said, "They just forgot to call you. Let's go together."&nbsp; but I slipped away and reject it, "I wasn't invited, okay."</p><p>||&nbsp; "By the way, it's impossible for me to have such a relationship with Yamada-kun, so you can rest assured ... since we had a fight today, so is it okay if I make up for it?"</p><p>"No, no. I should be the one apologizing. Yuzu didn't do anything wrong."</p><p>||&nbsp; "Okay. Let's forget it. I mean, it's really unusual for Kohei to apologize. I wonder if it will snow tomorrow."</p><p>The tone of the joke naturally spilled over to my smile.</p><p>"I already apologized, so don't make fun of me. Don't worry, tomorrow will be fine."</p><p>||&nbsp; "I hope so. I'm looking forward to it. See you tomorrow, bye."</p><p>"See you."</p><p>Yeah, I was finally able to make up smoothly, and I hung up the phone with a cheerful mood.</p>
