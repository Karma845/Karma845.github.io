<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Forged Friendship Between Man And Woman</h3>

<p>Today's the day for the welcome excursion for new students. That's why we, 1st graders, were visiting the amusement park.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"With this, you will have a lot of free time. So please enjoy yourself and return to the gathering place at noon. That's all, disperse!" [Teacher]</p>
<p>We disbanded, and my classmates left their respective friends. I decided to spend my free time the same way as the last time I came here, so I headed to the souvenir corner.</p><p>"Why are you here too?!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I thought you'd come here too." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>I met Yuzuhana.</p><p>"Buying a souvenir right away when you have some free time. The souvenir will annoy you when you go out later." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I didn't come here for go out! It wouldn't be fun if I was touring an amusement park alone as a teenager." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Ha-ha, sorry. I don't have any friends either, that's why I wanted to spend my time in the souvenir corner." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>Yuzu was momentarily stunned when I laughed at her.</p><p>[Dani: This is why you two got a divorce in the future....]</p>
<p>"Are you gonna see your friends in a bit? Please introduce me to them too!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Why should I do that?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I feel lonely..." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Oh, weren't you used to being lonely?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I'm used to being lonely because I'm too used to hanging out with you! If you and I get along well, I'm sure I can get along well with your friends too! I won't let you have fun alone!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>Yuzu heated up. I really hate it. I guess I shouldn't have gone this far. With a heavy heart, I tell the truth.</p>
<p>"I have no friends, I came here to buy some souvenirs at Sana's request." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah. I guess that's true." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>Yuzu signed up as if she felt relieved. She was very worried that I was going to hand out with my friends. Well, I guess I will feel the same way about it too. I can hardly imagine Yuzu having fun with her friends. Well, it's a bit different from the so-called 'restless'. If I had to give a name to this feeling, would it be closer to the word 'jealousy'? But, why should I feel jealous? It really doesn't matter to me for who Yuzuhana hangs out with. In fact, it was rather pleasant to think that she would make a lot of friends and not be interested in me.</p>
<p>But, it feels good to hang out with Yuzu, and ... is it possible that somewhere in my heart I still want to be with Yuzu? Even if that's true, I still can't say it. Yuzuhana just didn't want to be alone. And she doesn't really want to hang out with me.</p>
<p>"If you want to buy a souvenir for Sana-chan, I will help you. I know about Sana-chan's tastes much better than you. Let me guess, you are planning to buy her a mechanical pencil, right?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Oh, how did you know that?!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>Compared to me who had a hard time figuring out what others like, Yuzu was actually good at this kind of thing.</p>
<p>"How long do you think we've been together? I can even see what you're thinking." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"But it's not that bad, you know? A mechanical pencil is a very versatile tool" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, a pencil like this doesn't match with the price." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's just your judgment." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>(Don't say that when there are people around you! I could even see that they were looking at me with strange looks!)</p>
<p>"That's not just my judgment. It's an impression that comes from experience." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Impression, huh? Then, why do you keep using the same mechanical pencil that you bought at the amusement park when you were a college student?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Well, that's ... I think it's a waste if I don't use it. I'm also frustrated that my pencil breaks during the test." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>She coughed again. Yep, she sucks at changing the subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's just a mechanical pencil anyway, and it doesn't matter because the person she likes has already bought her what she normally uses, so you should buy her something else." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Don't tell me that Sana hates me..." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>That's a normal reaction.</p>
<p>"I didn't say that." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"But you said something similar like that!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"What I'm trying to say is that she will like it in a romantic way, which is far from hating it, Sana is a hidden brocon. Even when we have a tea together, she says it herself." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"At that age, I wonder if being a brocon really is the problem." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Don't say that. Wouldn't it be great if you were liked by your sister?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's not true. Please forgive her for telling you about that." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Nah, I don't want to talk about it anymore." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>Yuzu awkwardly coughed as if to clear her throat.</p>
<p>"If you want to buy her something, then buy something other than daily necessities. If you search for it carefully, then you will be able to find something extraordinary." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"I didn't really mean to buy her that type of pencil, I still have plenty of time. Since you've said that much, I'll buy her something else." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>After that, we browsed the souvenir corner.</p>
<p>"By the way, Sana-chan, how is she?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"She's too energetic. She always does her best at playing basketball until night every day." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Well, it's good that she works hard at her club activities, but what about her studies?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"My sister can't do that." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Why are you just keeping quiet? If she continues like that, I think you siblings will have a hard time taking the university entrance exams. Do you want to go to the same university this time around too?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Actually, I was a bit confused. I was in college because I wanted to get a bachelor's degree so I can get a job." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"So, you're saying that you won't be able to get a job if you don't continue your education in college?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Actually, there are other ways to earn money besides getting a job. Do you remember when you got addicted to horse racing comics when you were in your third year of college?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Yeah, we loved going to the racetrack. I was surprised because I was able to relax back then. Can we really make money from horse races?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"We won't be learning from it forever, but I remember that there are 10 thousand betting tickets issued every day that are all about the race. I'm thinking of buying them with the money I earn, and becoming rich!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Isn't that sneaky?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's true, but I don't want to live the life I had before." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>Working to survive was what I should have done, but at that moment I felt that I was only living to work. Because of that, I got frustrated and treat Yuzu harshly ... I don't want to be like that anymore.</p>
<p>"That's why I wanted to do it. And I will live a happy life." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I don't think living a happy life is the same as having a lot of money. But it's better than getting a job at a company that treats you well. You really looked tortured back then.&nbsp; But ... if you want to be rich, then you should find a reliable friend now." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Why?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Even if you have money, but if you feel lonely, then your life will be boring. But if your friend suddenly becomes a millionaire and you are in trouble, then he will be the one you can ask for help. That's why..." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>Then, Yuzuhana looked at me with a serious look.</p>
<p>"I'll watch over you as a friend." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Friend..." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>The unexpected statement made me do a double take. She wants to be friends with me ... is she feeling alright?</p>
<p>"Do you really want to hang out with me?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I can't lie at the time like this. Since the reason we got divorced was because our relationship started going in the wrong direction, wasn't our relationship very well until then?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"It's ... It's no exaggeration for me to say that it was the happiest time in my life." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I think so too. Kouhei is my best friend, but not my best husband." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"That's...." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>I don't want to admit it. Our married life, was not entirely filled with unpleasant memories. I had lots of fun and exciting memories with her. But, I couldn't deny it because it did end with the worst ending possible.</p>
<p>But even now...</p>
<p>I can't deny that Yuzu and I are the best of friends.</p>
<p>"That's right, because the source of problem is you ... the one who started to fall in love with me." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"What?! It was you! It was Kouhei who fell in love with me!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"No! The first person who fell in love was you, Yuzuhana!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"But it was Kouhei who confessed and proposed to me!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"But you gave me the answer right away! Even if I was the one confessing to you, we never knew which one has feelings first!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"In other words, ... wait?! Did you not want to be friends with me?!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Well, I didn't say that. But if Yuzu swear that she was the first one who fell in love with me, then I'll be your friend!" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"That's my line! If you swear that you liked me first, then I'll be your friend!" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>While shooting sparks, Yuzu and I became friends again. Since this has already happened, then I hope I don't repeat the same mistake again. I heard that friendship between a man and a woman can't be established, but since we've failed once, then we should be able to stay friends like this, right?</p>
<p>"I was going to ask you since we're already friends, but are you free after this?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Why?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"If you have free time, why don't we watch a movie?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Kimiuta, huh?" [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"Yup. You like Kimiuta too, right?" [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Yes, I love it, but I've watched it so many times." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I want to watch it at the cinema. I felt disappointed when someone said "I saw Kimiuta at the cinema and it was amazing." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Don't bring anyone else here." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I also felt satisfied with the bonus film." [Yuzu]</p>
<p>"Oh, that's right ... it really is a good tier movie ... then, I'll watch it again and brag about it." [Kouhei]</p>
<p>"I'll get better than you and make you regret it!" [Yuzu]</p><p>[TL: The souvenir from the movie maybe.]</p>
<p>After that, we choose souvenirs for Sana until afternoon, and after hearing the speech from the vice principal at the gathering place, we left the amusement park.</p>
