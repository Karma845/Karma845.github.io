<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; Hunting the Adventurer Killer ⑤</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito's
attitude drastic change really irritated me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">That's
why I couldn't help but ask.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Why
don't you fight back?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Eh?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Even
though you were very confident and call yourself a hero, but why don't you
fight back? Erio, who is just a novice adventurer, dares to fight you to
protect his sister. Why can't you stand up like a hero!??"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Why
am I so irritated by his attitude?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
couldn't help but feel angry knowing that Miya, Erio and the others had been
hurt by this selfish and weak-minded person.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Grrr."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
gritted my teeth unconsciously.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hiii,
for, forgive me..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
leaks a small scream under my feet.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
move my feet away from him, turn my back and start walking.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
walk over to Nemumu to pick up the treasured sword, Grandius.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nemumu,
the sword."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes,
excuse me."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
hold the Grandius's grip with her handkerchief.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
soon as she realized that I want to take it, she carefully wiped it and put the
handkerchief away. She kneels down on the spot and holds out the sword with
both hands.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
take the "Grandius" and leave the "SSR, the Clown Mask" in Nemumu's
hands instead.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
return to Kaito and thrust the "Grandius" into the ground in front of
him, who has sat up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
expose my face and look into his eyes.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Let's
fight again. If you win, I'll let you go."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
take off my eyes from Kaito and looks at Mei and the others to affirm.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"If
he wins, no matter what happens, don't touch him and release him back to the
surface world. I won't forgive anyone who dares to touch him. Is that
clear?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
and the others bowed deeply to my words, showing their understanding.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
nodded in satisfaction at their response and looks down at Kaito again.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
stage is ready for you, the future hero. Overcome this desperate crisis and win
with your own strength. Show me your power. Pick up your sword and stand
up!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"This,
this, this isn't fair, right? You're intimidating me with numbers......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
my words, Kaito looks away and mumbles an excuse.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
girls respond to his words and tell him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"My
Lord promised that we won't interfere. Then we will never interfere. Rest
assured."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"If
there is a person who wants to interfere, I will protect you. You can take that
sword without worry."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No
one will break my Lord's promise. If that happens, no matter who is the person,
I will kill her."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
after hearing Mei, Elly, and Aoyuki's words, Kaito refused to take his sword.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I'll tell you, I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything I know. ...... If the
information is still not enough, I can guide you to the Elf Queen Country.
So..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"My
Lord wants you to fight, so fight. Are you scared? Dumbass."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Nazuna's
straightforward comment makes Kaito upset.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What,
what's wrong with being scared? Being surrounded and threatened by strangers
like you! How can I not be scared? Besides, I'm 200 years old! How old are you
people? Don't you humans know how to respect older people!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He finally
brought up and shouts about his age, the only thing he can win.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
couldn't help but sigh at how pathetic he is.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"We're
not talking about age now, right? Don't bring up unrelated things....... First
of all, why should I respect you just because you're old? Are you saying that
if someone is old enough, he can do anything he wants! If someone older than
you is going to kill you, would you willingly give up your head?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Guu,
gaa...!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
couldn't reply to those words.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Still,
Kaito didn't give up and shouts.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'll
also give you the Fantasy Class Treasure Sword Grandius! I also said I'll give
you all the information you want! That should be more than enough for you to
forgive me! It's a national treasure of the Elf Queen Country!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
Fantasy-class? To be honest, I already have too many of those kinds of weapon.
Look."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
show Kaito my Item box. Many Fantasy-class weapons are stored inside it, big
swords, swords, katana, short swords, spears, halberds, hatchets, etc.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though it was only a glance, he realized that they are fantasy class weapons.
Some of them even give a different atmosphere.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
he's seeing that fact, Kaito's eyes widened.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Then
I dropped a bigger bomb on him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"By
the way, my staff "Gungnir" is a Genesis class weapon."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
no way!? That's impossible! Even mythology class weapons existence are
doubtful, let alone creation class which are Gods' weapons!! "</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
immediately refuses to believe it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
a fact is a fact.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
a genesis level, "EX, Gungnir".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I've
been pulling "Infinity Gacha" every day for about three years, and
the only EX (highest grade) I got is this one, Gungnir.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
looks like a plain staff, but in reality, it is a spear.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">That's
because it has been sealed with multiple seals to suppress its power as much as
possible.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
only people who know about Gungnir's powers are me, Mei, Elly and Aoyuki.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Although
I have appraised it, I can't fully understand its ability because of many
garbled characters. As an example</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">『神</span><span class="calibre13">■■</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">り</span><span class="calibre13">■</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">へ</span><span class="calibre13">■■■</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">し槍』</span><span class="calibre13">(<span>God ■■ ■ to ■■■ spear). I can feel clearly that this weapon is
very dangerous.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">Even
when a level 9999 like me appraise it and many characters in the description
are garbled! Therefore, I never tell anyone else except Mei, Elly, and Aoyuki.
I do not allow other people to appraise it, to hide its power.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">It
has been sealed with multiple seals, so it cannot function properly in its
current form. But it is sturdy and easy to handle, so I use it as my staff.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">By
the way, it has a convenient function that allows it to return to its owner
when the owner gets a certain distance away from it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">So
even if it is stolen, it will come back to me in an instant, and I don't have
to worry about it being stolen.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Impossible,
impossible, impossible, impossible... it's impossible for a human to have Genesis
class .... Isn't that like a human being become a "God" ...? That'
right, it's a dream... This is a dream! My treasure sword "Grandius"
is the best sword in this world! It must be a dream!!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">My
ability to transfer in an instant. Mei and the others who are overwhelmingly
stronger than him. My fighting ability surpassed him. I'm a magician, but I can
beat Kaito, a level 1500 specialist in close combat. All of this destroyed Kaito's
common sense.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
is why deep down, he knows it's true that I have a Genesis-class weapon, but he
can't accept it and crouches down, repeatedly muttering, "This is a
dream".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
continue my words again.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I've
heard that Miya's brother Erio stood up for his sister in a similar desperate
situation and challenged you. So if you're a future hero, you can pick up your
sword and fight without a problem, right?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
repeat what I said.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'll
say it one more time. The stage is ready for you, the future hero. Overcome
this desperate crisis and win with your own strength. Show me your power. Pick
up your sword and stand up!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu,
who had been watching the whole scene, speaks up.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"If
you are a hero, this level of hardship will not count as a challenge. Then,
stand up."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
also speaks up.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"If
you call yourself a hero, now is the time to pick up your sword. Now stand
up."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
these two people as a trigger, everyone else also continues to encourage him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Stand
up, please."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hurry
up and stand up."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Rise.
Stand up on your feet."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Stand
up. Come on, stand up."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Before
I knew it, the other members and fairy maids had heard the commotion and had
gathered in the training area.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
pointed at Kaito, who is still sitting there, giggling and repeatedly saying
words to encourage him to fight.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Stand
up."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hey,
why don't you get up?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hurry
up, get up."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Don't
make my Lord wait for you. Stand up now."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Stand
up." "stand up." "stand up." </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Stand
up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand
up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand
up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hiii,
aaahhhh, aaahhhh!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Being
agitated, Kaito runs away without taking the "Grandius" that was stabbed
in the ground in front of him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
quickly runs to the entrance where there are no fairy maids, but...</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"SSR,
Solar-Ray, release."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Gyaaaaaaa
!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
took out my "Infinite Gacha" card and shot Kaito in the leg.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
light flashed for a moment, and a moment later, his leg was pierced.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
is in extreme pain and rolls down on the rocky ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
is a hole in his leg where he can see the other side easily, but not even a
drop of blood flows out because the wound was burned too.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Who
told you to run away? I told you to stand up, and fight likes a hero."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Don't,
don't come! Don't come! Don't come! I'm a future hero, a hero that is chosen by
the Goddess! I can't die in such a gloomy place... "</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Dang!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
stab "Grandius" into the ground between his legs, just a few
millimetres away from his crotch.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Some
of Kaito's bangs were cut off and fall down.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Then
fight, fight like a hero!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"――――"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
falls backwards.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
back of his head hits the floor, but there is no reaction.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
eyes turn white, foam comes out of his mouth, and he loses consciousness.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As I
look down at Kaito, I feel nothing but disgust because of his pathetic
behaviour. Then I spit on him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
Miya-chan said, you are not a hero. You are just a loser running away from
reality."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
stared at Kaito for the last time, then turn my back on him and walk over to
Mei and the others.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"He's
an unpleasant being, but he's a valuable information source who knows about the
Master. Use any means necessary to make him spit out all the information, and
then kill him."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
you wish, in the name of my maid way."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
Mei replied, I went back to my room.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
are many bad things happening tonight.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
need to calm down a bit before I can go back up to the surface world.</span></p></div>
