<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; Finally, we have become stronger in the underground dungeon! Evil Dragon Subjugation! ④ </h3>

<p>Repeated strikes.</p>
<p>Repeated strikes.</p>
<p>More repeated strikes.</p>
<p>The poisoned nails kept dripping, as the gothic loli’s attacks cut air.</p>
<p>“I feel like yawning.”</p>
<p>I respond to her attacks while saying those words at the same time.</p>
<p>My body blow connected to Amanta’s solar plexus.</p>
<p>A mix of gastric juices and mucus was spat out of Amanta’s mouth. An obvious result.</p>
<p>As her body was bent into the &gt; shape, Amanta crumbled to her knees where she stood.</p>
<p>“Guh… Guuue…”</p>
<p>As soon as she started puking, my roundhouse kick connected cleanly with her face.</p>
<p>Well, instead of a roundhouse kick, was it closer to a volley shot in soccer? Well, that was fine.</p>
<p>Amanta was blown away with great momentum.</p>
<p>Rather, no matter how abnormal a loli-baba she was, getting beaten to a pulp like this, was not good for my mental health.</p>
<p>Then, I drew the longsword from my back.</p>
<p>“Let’s end it here, Evil Dragon?”</p>
<p>Behind me Cordelia took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Overwhelming a calamity class monster… a creature that dangerous being treated like a child… You’ve really become a monstrous existence.”</p>
<p>At this point, I smiled and said.</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid, aren’t I a useless villager? One that can’t use anything other than elementary magic? Well, if there’s anything ridiculous, it’s that my status is a bit strange.”</p>
<p>Hearing those words, the corners of Amanta’s mouth curled into a grin.</p>
<p>“Can’t use magic? Since I heard you were the next Dragon King, I completely thought you were an overwhelming all-rounder. But I see, I see you’re just a muscle-brain!”</p>
<p>Amanta stood up, laughing happily.</p>
<p>My attack had caused abrasions all over her face, her nose and mouth were letting out streams of blood, even so she had a beautiful smile filled with madness.</p>
<p>Then, she grabbed her gothic loli skirt with both her hands and raised it.</p>
<p>“&#8230;?”</p>
<p>Soft white skin came into view.</p>
<p>Thighs, buttocks, and purple colored shorts.</p>
<p>Then, she kept her skirt raised with one hand and slid her shorts down with the other.</p>
<p>And then, I was taken aback.</p>
<p>Under the shorts, where the genitals ought to be… Were several eyeballs jammed together.</p>
<p>Hyakume (hundred eyed). I remembered a Japanese monster with such a name. But anyway, her skin was filled with eyeballs about a centimeter in size each.</p>
<p>Each of those eyes turned to me and glowed with a suspicious purple light.</p>
<p>“Magical eyes! In such a perverted place…”</p>
<p>“Ehehe? Ehehe? Surprised? Surprised? This is my true power, you know? A person who can withstand my mesmerize skill after being subjected to magic eyes doesn’t exist, y’know? Doesn’t exist, y’know?”</p>
<p>Damn… I held my head.</p>
<p>Then while sweating, I put on an expression of agony.</p>
<p>“Hehe? No special magic resistance…? Hey, hey, maybe… You don’t possess resistance items? Even though you’re a muscle-brain… no measures against abnormal statuses? Idiot, idiot… Great idiot~! Kyaha~! Kyaha~! Hey, hey, big brother? Big brother? What happened to the power up until now? What happened? For Mr. muscle-brain, this might be a bit too harsh, right? Right? Ehehe? Ehehe? You know, Mine? My magic power is over 4000, you know? This is almost the same as the Dragon King himself. Almost the same.”</p>
<p>I fell to the ground, and took on a hollow expression.</p>
<p>“Looks like it worked, right? Looks so, right? And then and then! This magic eye is… The reason why I’m an abnormality &#8211; The number of people who know this aren’t too many, though. And when I activate my mesmerization skill… It has three times the magic power! It has!”</p>
<p>“Magic… Enhancement… Skills. Those are… Really… Rare.”</p>
<p>Usually, people magical professions aren’t affected by mesmerization or petification based skills.</p>
<p>This is because, one needs to have the massive gap of three times the amount of magic as the opponent, for it to take effect.</p>
<p>A close quarters combatant is a sitting duck for abnormal statuses.</p>
<p>Of course, even if you have a status resistance item or skill, if there’s a massive difference in magic power of around three times, there will still be a high probability of falling into an abnormal status.</p>
<p>That is why, adventurers often divide their roles and form a well rounded party.</p>
<p>It is necessary for muscle-brains to have a priest assisting them in increasing their status resistance… It’s something like that.</p>
<p>As I thought of such things with an out-of-focus expression, Amanta said, with a prim face.</p>
<p>“In other words, if you don’t have an item, to compete with my mesmerization skill. Your magic power has to be at least 4000! It’s impossible to resist for a single class! You’d have to have an ally of a similar class, or wouldn’t this be a bit difficult? Wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>Amanta laughs bewitchingly.</p>
<p>Then she gleefully fluttered her finger.</p>
<p>“Now, strong big brother… Why don’t you become my manservant? In various ways I’ll… Trea-sure you! Kyahaha! Kyahahaha! In torturous ways too… and erotic ways too… I’ll treasure you, so! Kyaha! Kyahahahaha! It looks like you didn’t know I was an expert at abnormal status infliction, right!? You’re an idiot, right? You’re such an idiot, right?”</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It was because she specialized in inflicting abnormal statuses on men… That even the 15 year old Cordelia was able to take her down.</p>
<p>Even for a calamity-class monster, her power type, and the berserk battle style she had… were all bad match-ups for the 15 year old hero.</p>
<p>I grinned.</p>
<p>That said, I was getting tired of playing along with the lolibaba.</p>
<p>I got up without any problems, and shook my head.</p>
<p>“&#8230; Heh?”</p>
<p>Amanta let out a firm expression.</p>
<p>I said, half amused.</p>
<p>“I wanted to show you a good dream.”</p>
<p>“&#8230; Eh? Till just now… That fluffy feeling… was… Eh?”</p>
<p>“Just an act. If I was just overwhelming from the beginning to the end, it would feel kind of boring.”</p>
<p>“&#8230; Eh?”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you trying to get the woman behind me raped by orcs?”</p>
<p>It seems she finally began to understand the situation.</p>
<p>As she watched, the blood drained from Amanta’s face.</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“That’s why, I thought it would be fun to make you highly confident, all in order to knock you down further.”</p>
<p>“&#8230; In other words?”</p>
<p>“My MP is over 25000. And my magic power is close to 7000, so there’s no one who can inflict abnormal statuses on me, even if they used various skills. And even if they could inflict one, I can deal with it. I’m an all-rounder.”</p>
<p>Kneeling in place, Amanta held her head.</p>
<p>“Damn! Damn! Why is it? Why is there such a monstrous human? Right now the human heroes shouldn’t even have grown up yet… So why? Why why? How, why?”</p>
<p>“Just give up it up, consider it bad luck.”</p>
<p>Amanta suddenly shot up, and jumped seven meters to the side.</p>
<p>Cordelia who was standing behind me and Amanta &#8211; their eyes met.</p>
<p>“However-! Too sad☆ Even if I can’t use mesmerize, if it’s this big sister-”</p>
<p>Hah… I sighed.</p>
<p>Cordelia specialized in abnormal statuses.</p>
<p>If the magic power was a bit over 1000… A fatal status like petrification can be resisted.</p>
<p>I don’t know how high Cordelia’s magic power is, but she also possessed a national level resistance item, so such big spells wouldn’t work on her.</p>
<p>If that’s the case.</p>
<p>“&#8230; Poison, huh?”</p>
<p>“Kyahaha!? Kyahaha!? I’ll die here, but… But, you see? But, you see? I can still… Hit big sister with a single strike, you see? I can, you see?”</p>
<p>Amanta opened her mouth wide.</p>
<p>Finally, her real appearance as a monster was revealed, her jaws broke free, she gained an appearance resembling a frog and spat out a mud colored liquid.</p>
<p>“Well, it could easily be cleaned using a disinfectant, though.”</p>
<p>In fact, she’s only trying to harass us… It wouldn’t easily inflict any status effect.</p>
<p>Amanta was cornered to the point where she could only harass us.</p>
<p>That said, why should I let Cordelia endure that poison?</p>
<p>I shrug my shoulders and call-</p>
<p>“-Lilith?”</p>
<p>An alternative that didn’t require me to move a finger.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Understood.”</p>
<p>A girl with aqua colored hair answered my call.</p>
<p>Lilith stood between Amanta and Cordelia and extended her palm.</p>
<p>A barrier of light is formed, glowing silver while the dragon’s mud colored poison mixed in, hitting the barrier.</p>
<p>The earth colored liquid shot out by Amanta was then purified.</p>
<p>“This is?”</p>
<p>Lilith answered Cordelia’s question, without even turning back.</p>
<p>“Skill: Dragon God’s Guardian Deity. In my absolute territory, any form of negative status will be purified. And in these past few years, although normally he’s immune to negative statuses and an exception from common sense, it is also the skill I’ve used to protect Lute Macklen to this point.”</p>
