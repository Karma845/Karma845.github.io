<h2>Stage 2: A Secret Step Towards the "Saint"</h2>
<p>Sweat trickled down my cheeks and dropped onto the floor with a soft plop as I performed one-handed push-ups in a handstand position. I exhaled deeply, applying more force to my right fingertips.</p>
<p>“99…………100…………!”</p>
<p>I switched to the other arm, doing another set of 100 reps with the same intensity. This concluded my morning routine workout.</p>
<p>“Lord Ouga, would you like to add more weight?” asked Alice.</p>
<p>“Not today, let’s keep it as it is,” I replied.</p>
<p>Alice gently put down the weights, equivalent to about 10 kilograms, which she had been carrying. Currently, each of my legs had 50 kilograms of weight attached, making it a total of 100 kilograms.</p>
<p>I credited my unusually robust physique to the blessings of the world, which aimed to maintain balance. Being a noble but unable to use magic in this world was a considerable disadvantage, but in compensation, I was granted an exceptionally strong and resilient body.</p>
<p>In my opinion, many historically renowned magicians were either weak in physical activities or died young. Even the first Grand Commander of the Holy Knights, born of noble lineage, was known for not using magic but rather mastering countless monsters with just a sword, according to historical records.</p>
<p>“Is there something on my face?” Alice asked.</p>
<p>“No, I was just pondering how strange it is that you don’t have any noble blood,” I replied, realizing that her parents were commoners. “I apologize if it sounded intrusive.”</p>
<p>“No need to apologize. Every phenomenon has its exceptions,” Alice said.</p>
<p>As I continued my thoughts, I reached my target number of repetitions without realizing it. Alice, who was also counting, removed the weights for me.</p>
<p>I landed softly on my lighter feet and stood up, taking the towel she offered.</p>
<p>“Allow me to wipe your sweat,” she said.</p>
<p>Though I could do it myself, I didn’t want to deprive her of her duties as a maid. Besides, having a beautiful woman wipe my sweat was quite a pleasurable experience. If she was willing to do it, I’d gladly indulge myself. Such enjoyment was possible because of my noble status.</p>
<p>“How do you feel?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. I’ve made progress,” I replied.</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to Lord Ouga,” Alice said gratefully.</p>
<p>When Alice first started her duties, she was clumsy and had trouble with control. Without this body, I wouldn’t have been able to endure. Only I had experienced the sensation of sweat making my back squeak during a wipe down.</p>
<p>As she occasionally exhaled, ticklishness crept up on me, but I stayed focused as she moved from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Now, my upper body was bare, yet I didn’t feel embarrassed. Perhaps it was because I had sculpted my physique or maybe because I didn’t sense any lecherousness from Alice’s gaze.</p>
<p>“Well then, let me check on you today,” Alice said, as she began to touch my body.</p>
<p>This was Alice’s muscle inspection. She wanted to ensure there was no imbalance and no excessive strain. As a seasoned Holy Knight with extensive battlefield experience, I trusted her expertise.</p>
<p>“I don’t see any issues. Everything seems to be going well,” she concluded.</p>
<p>“Good to hear. Thank you for your hard work,” I replied.</p>
<p>“I’m honored to be of service to Lord Ouga,” she said.</p>
<p>I then informed her that I had to see the Academy’s headmaster. It seemed the headmaster wanted to talk to me privately, and while I trusted Alice, I decided not to bring her along.</p>
<p>“Please go ahead to the classroom and serve as Leiche’s escort,” I instructed her.</p>
<p>“Understood. I’ll go ahead,” she replied.</p>
<p>Since the incident became known among my classmates, especially the first-years, I didn’t know how things might change. Even with me as her backing, I couldn’t predict the students’ actions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was another reason for not bringing Alice along.</p>
<p>“The headmaster wishes to speak with me personally. Sometimes, it’s good to listen to the requests of our seniors,” I said.</p>
<p>“Please take care, Lord Ouga,” Alice said with concern.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I won’t let any mishaps occur,” I reassured her with a cynical smile before heading to the shower room.</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>The Rishburg Magic Academy comprised four main buildings, including the student dormitory: the main school building housing the classrooms, the old building used mainly for storing equipment, the practical training building for magic exercises and demonstrations, and finally, the faculty building.</p>
<p>The faculty building was relatively smaller since it served specific purposes. Each teacher had their individual rooms, and on the top floor was the office of the Academy’s top authority, the headmaster.</p>
<p>And so, I, who had been summoned by a letter delivered to the dorm, took a seat on the couch in the headmaster’s office.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming so early in the morning, Mr. Vellett,” said the elderly woman with wrinkles on her face.</p>
<p>Sitting across from me was Florene Milfonti, a name known to everyone as the “Florene of Lightning,” a hero with numerous achievements that justified the title.</p>
<p>Although she had retired from the front lines due to the passage of time, it was clear that she hadn’t lost any of her strength.</p>
<p>I could feel the pressure emanating from her entire body.</p>




<p>“May I ask why you’ve gone to the trouble of calling me, especially after the Luark incident has been settled?” I inquired.</p>
<p>It had been a month since those troublemakers were expelled. Since then, no one except for Mashiro had approached me, so naturally, there were no problems.</p>
<p>“Hehe, today, I called you for a personal matter. I wanted to have a conversation with you,” she said.</p>
<p>Headmaster Milfonti handed me a cup of tea. As I took a sip, my tense muscles seemed to relax.</p>
<p>“It seems like your nervousness has eased,” she remarked.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible for any student not to be nervous when facing a hero like you,” I replied.</p>
<p>After all, my goal was to become a corrupt lord. I didn’t want to draw the attention of someone like her, who currently stood on the side of justice.</p>
<p>It seemed my feelings had come across too strongly.</p>
<p>“Well, well, you did well. But even so, I couldn’t save her,” she said.</p>
<p>“Her…?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m referring to Mashiro Leiche. Today, I wanted to express my gratitude for what you did,” she explained.</p>
<p>After placing her tea cup on the table, she wore a gentle smile.</p>
<p>“Thank you. It’s all thanks to you that her valuable talent was not lost,” she said.</p>
<p>“I just did what I thought was right,” I replied.</p>
<p>And indeed, giving in to my desires had been the right decision.</p>
<p>Originally, Mashiro must have had a bright personality. Perhaps she had been withdrawn due to the foreign environment of having only nobles around her.</p>
<p>As we spent time together daily at the Academy, she gradually became more relaxed, and physical contact between us increased.</p>
<p>She would jump with joy whenever something made her happy, and sometimes she would even cling to me.</p>
<p>Hooray for breasts! Academy life is the best!</p>
<p>“Each person is unique. It’s said that every noble must have some magical aptitude, but it may have been difficult for you, who lacked such aptitude. So, I was undecided whether to approve your admission… but it seems my choice back then was not wrong,” Headmaster Milfonti said with a happy smile.</p>
<p>She was completely mistaken.</p>
<p>Mashiro is already in my hands.</p>
<p>Her future, where I can do as I please with her, is already determined…!</p>
<p>Of course, I won’t show my true feelings.</p>
<p>“However, it’s quite the opposite for Mashiro Leiche, who possesses the exact opposite of you.</p>
<p>“……What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“She excelled in practical magic and was allowed to enroll. You, being the son of the Vellett family, probably knew that already,” she said.</p>
<p>“…No comment,” I replied.</p>
<p>I overlooked that!</p>
<p>I judged her solely based on her three sizes and full-body photo!</p>
<p>We haven’t even had any magic practice yet. Come to think of it, I still don’t know her true abilities…</p>
<p>“In this world, everyone is given one main aptitude as a fundamental rule, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s common knowledge,”</p>
<p>“However, sometimes a child is born with multiple aptitudes. And Leiche has wind and ice affinities. This is a fantastic talent. Thanks to you, her budding talent was not crushed. Allow me to thank you again on behalf of the Academy,” she said.</p>
<p>She lowered her head once more, but I stopped her with my hand.</p>
<p>“I already received your gratitude once. Your feelings have been conveyed,” I said.</p>
<p>I hadn’t intended for any of this, so being praised by someone else made me feel awkward…</p>
<p>After all, it wasn’t a good deed, so I didn’t want to be stimulated by a strange sense of guilt.</p>
<p>“Well then, class is about to start, so I shall take my leave,” I said.</p>
<p>When I return to the classroom, I’ll ask Mashiro to show me her magic.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, I left the headmaster’s office.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s Ouga Vellett.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who, in the magic academy entrance exam, was the first in history to get a perfect score on the [written exam] and pass with a 0 on the [practical exam].</p>
<p>He would have been failed if not for seeking outstanding talent.</p>
<p>I called him out because I wanted to confirm with my own eyes&#8230;I see, he&#8217;s an interesting character.</p>
<p>That guy&#8230;at first, was wary of me. Of me, called the hero &#8220;Florine the Lightning.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be normal for a regular student to be nervous, but he is of the Vellett family.</p>
<p>Stealth. Intelligence gathering. A family well-versed in information warfare.</p>
<p>He may have caught wind of some unsavory rumors about me somewhere.</p>
<p>I must be even more careful not to leave any traces from here on out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even so, she entered the protection of a troublesome place, seriously&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>To think Mashiro Leiche, who I planned to use as an experimental tool, would be stolen away.</p>
<p>This is all that idiot from the Bourbon family&#8217;s fault.</p>
<p>No matter how nobles are above commoners, would an idiot cause problems right after enrolling?</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmph. Well, whatever. There was an unexpected harvest too.&#8221;</p>
<p>One line stated by that Bourbon idiot during questioning.</p>
<p>[My magic was erased! It&#8217;s true! He&#8217;s lying about not being able to use magic!]</p>
<p>Magic that erases magic?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t joke around.</p>
<p>The reason nobles can be nobles,</p>
<p>Is whether they have magical aptitude or not.</p>
<p>Sometimes even commoners are born with magical aptitude due to mutation, but the number is overwhelmingly small.</p>
<p>Thus, commoners do not revolt against nobles. No, they cannot.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not like nobles just live off tax revenue, they also subjugate magical creatures and in turn provide peace.</p>
<p>But dissatisfaction accumulates.</p>
<p>If a means to invalidate magic spreads, the world&#8217;s order would be disrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Velletts unanimously say they can&#8217;t use magic. But if this is true&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the enrollment paperwork, his confidant is of common birth.</p>
<p>That maid is also suspicious. I can&#8217;t make definitive claims since I&#8217;ve only seen her in photographs, but she looks familiar.</p>
<p>I should look into what became of her after she was exiled.</p>
<p>But what if my guess is correct?</p>
<p>On one hand a monster who rose to be the Holy Knights Leader with sword skill alone.</p>
<p>On the other, one of the rare people in the world who can use multiple magical attributes.</p>
<p>It would mean outrageous power has gathered under Ouga Vellett.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man who, lacking magical aptitude, can correctly understand the suffering of commoners in noble society&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>What is he scheming?</p>
<p>Is he trying to become a hero of the masses? Or maybe he just wants to be surrounded by women, the foolish&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh&#8230;that&#8217;s not it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His objective is unclear, but he has the potential to become an obstacle to my dream I&#8217;ve chased for years.</p>
<p>In that case, he must be eliminated.</p>
<p>&#8220;──Reina.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Headmaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I call her name, a girl with light pink hair waiting on standby in a separate room connected to the headmaster&#8217;s office comes out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave his monitoring up to you. Let&#8217;s have him recommended to the student council as well. It would make things easier for you as student council president.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohoho, I&#8217;m happy for your consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her expression is still an unchanging smile with lifeless eyes.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s kept up the same facade all day long.</p>
<p>Even though she&#8217;s my disciple, she&#8217;s a creepy kid. If not for her talent, I wouldn&#8217;t have picked her up back then.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he makes any suspicious movements&#8230;you understand, correct?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will stake the name Reina Milfondy on it ── and end his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>The magic academy&#8217;s classrooms are spacious, with desks for two students placed at generous intervals front to back.</p>
<p>In the very back was space for attendants like myself to wait on standby during class without getting in the way.</p>
<p>The ticking of the second hand could be heard clearly even amidst the clamor.</p>
<p>Each second felt long.</p>
<p>As the start of class approached, I awaited the return of my esteemed master.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouga kun?, did something happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>The one speaking to me was the girl my master saved, Miss Mashiro Leiche.</p>
<p>She was also the talent my master wanted most at this academy.</p>
<p>Among the many children of prestigious families gathered here, some may wonder why her.</p>
<p>However, if they knew she was a [Dual Magical Aptitude User], everyone would understand.</p>
<p>Having grasped information through the Vellett family&#8217;s investigations, my master had eyes only for her and seduced her.</p>





<p>With this, another excellent talent has gathered under my master, bringing him one step closer to realizing his justice.</p>
<p>As expected of my master.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems my master has no idea either. Unfortunately, we can only wait until he returns to find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course that&#8217;s a lie.</p>
<p>There are two reasons I can guess he was called out.</p>
<p>One, Florine Milfondy noticed my true identity.</p>
<p>She has wide connections.</p>
<p>As one of the heroes of mankind, she also focuses on training successors, and frequently makes appearances around various places.</p>
<p>Naturally, she visits the Holy Knights often as well, and I&#8217;ve exchanged words with her several times too.</p>
<p>The other is troublesome &#8211; she picked up on something about my master&#8217;s [Magic Burial Rites].</p>
<p>We match our stories and hide the [Magic Burial Rites].</p>
<p>However, that worm from the Bourbon family makes things difficult.</p>
<p>If the opponent was just a magic user, they&#8217;d dismiss that Bourbon brat&#8217;s ramblings&#8230;</p>
<p>But Florine might probe my master as a precaution.</p>
<p>After all, [Magic Burial Rites] is a technique that can overturn the world.</p>
<p>Conflict between nobles and commoners could break out again, even though territorial disputes with magical creatures have settled down in recent years.</p>
<p>It would be natural for Florine, who continued standing on the battlefield, to move in order to not let a new war spark.</p>
<p>And these are things even someone often called muscle-brained like myself can think of.</p>
<p>My master likely foresaw everything and worried about Miss Leiche&#8217;s feelings.</p>
<p>So she doesn&#8217;t blame herself for using [Magic Burial Rites] to save her.</p>
<p>As expected of my master.</p>
<p>&#8220;Class is about to start soon&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem like Headmistress Milfondy is the type to make students late for class&#8230;right, Miss Leiche?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Ouga kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment Miss Leiche called his name, the classroom abruptly fell silent.</p>
<p>My master stands out, for better or worse.</p>
<p>Since enrollment, he was made a fool of for having no magical aptitude, getting in by connections ─ of course it became clear that&#8217;s impossible ─ being the son of a wicked feudal lord.</p>
<p>However, after saving Miss Leiche from bullying, the winds began to change.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re at the point where they feel guilty for ridiculing someone whose good deed they now know about.</p>
<p>If my master continues being himself, eventually there will be none who mock him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Master.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Ouga kun. What were you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, just small talk. More importantly, there&#8217;s something I want to do now.&#8221;</p>
<p>After saying that, my master takes his school bag in hand and tries to head out just like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;O-Ouga kun? Isn&#8217;t class starting now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipping. Mashiro&#8217;s coming too, of course. Follow me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ehhh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to the practical skills building. There&#8217;s something I wanted to see after realizing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-Wait up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite her surprise, there was no hesitation in Leiche&#8217;s actions. She packed up the teaching materials spread on her desk into her bag and lined up next to Ouga.</p>
<p>Hehe, her loyalty is considerable.</p>
<p>Now then, I should follow them&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, let the teacher know we&#8217;re absent due to illness and then come join us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211;I cried.</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>&#8220;H-Hey, wait up, Ouga kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>Our hurried footsteps echoed in the hallway.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know Mashiro had multiple magical aptitudes.</p>
<p>Since I only decided based on her photos at first glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why the sudden need to go to the practical skills building?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m curious what it feels like to face two types of magic simultaneously.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wanted to grasp her level of skill that warranted Florine Milfondy&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>Could she handle different attribute magics at the same time?</p>
<p>Would the magic consumption change?</p>
<p>What kind of image does she invoke to activate her magic?</p>
<p>Originally, to make up for my handicap of having no magical aptitude, I pounded in various knowledge.</p>
<p>Seeing Mashiro&#8217;s magic, I might come up with some new techniques.</p>
<p>Plus I wanted to try skipping class once.</p>
<p>It was the perfect excuse, so there was no reason not to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? So Ouga didn&#8217;t know about my magical aptitudes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, why? Is that bad?&#8221;</p>
<p>N-No way! Rather, this way she won&#8217;t realize I already investigated her!</p>
<p>Things are going according to my plan, right?</p>
<p>Nonsensical excuses she didn&#8217;t know who they were aimed at kept popping up.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, this is great!&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled ear to ear and clung to my arm.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t really understand, but boobs are the best so I didn&#8217;t think too deeply about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow. It&#8217;s pretty big up close.&#8221;</p>
<p>After walking for a bit, we arrived at the practical skills building entrance.</p>
<p>While the main school building was plenty large, the practical skills building was many times that size.</p>
<p>Since actual magic would be used, a small enclosed space could cause accidents and great harm.</p>
<p>To ensure student safety, ample space was secured, composed of six areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, shall we go in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! I&#8217;ll show you my cool side!&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as we tried entering spiritedly, the door didn&#8217;t budge at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? Why isn&#8217;t it&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.It&#8217;s locked with magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ever since I was young, I trained my body and had confidence in my strength.</p>
<p>After getting Alice, I underwent even harder training.</p>
<p>While the door did look thick, it shouldn&#8217;t be completely unmoving.</p>
<p>In other words, it was likely intentionally made unable to open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hnnnngh&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mashiro beside me turned bright red as she strained herself, but it was futile.</p>

<p>Unauthorized magic use on school grounds was prohibited.</p>



<p>Practical curriculum wouldn&#8217;t start for over a month.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no way we&#8217;d get away with this.</p>



<p>Was there no other way we could sneak in?</p>



<p>I was even considering the reckless idea of climbing the outer wall.</p>



<p>Then, as if to interrupt my thoughts, a transparent voice reached my ears.</p>



<p>&#8220;First years are prohibited from entering the practical skills building alone, you two.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I turned around, there was one figure with waist-length, light pink swaying hair.</p>



<p>The girl wrapped in a white uniform unlike ours looked like an angel with her elegant behavior.</p>



<p>A beauty that would captivate ten out of ten people.</p>



<p>I also ended up gazing at her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Pleased to meet you. I am Reina Milfondy. I serve as student council president of the esteemed Leesburg Magic Academy.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, it wasn&#8217;t her beauty that attracted me.</p>



<p>Her deep yellow eyes were like my pre-reincarnation self&#8217;s, seeming devoid of liveliness.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope we can get along well, Vellett, Leiche.&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt a sense of discomfort from how her expression and conveyed emotions didn&#8217;t match.</p>



<p>Reina Milfondy.</p>



<p>The top disciple of Florine the Lightning, and the hope serving as the magic academy&#8217;s student council president since year one.</p>



<p>Expectations from the public were also great for her as the youth who would lead the next generation.</p>



<p>Her epithet from her lovely appearance and exceptional talent was [Child Loved by God]&#8230;huh.</p>



<p>Seeing her in person made the impression quite different from the photographs.</p>



<p>Lacking magical aptitude, I also put effort into physical training.</p>



<p>Skeleton. How to use each part of the body. Connecting muscles.</p>



<p>I also accumulated knowledge to always exhibit at least maximum ability.</p>



<p>So I understood, but somehow her breasts were unnaturally large for her build&#8211;.</p>



<p>&#8220;─It&#8217;s embarrassing to be stared at like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ngh!&#8221;</p>



<p>In the instant my gaze lowered, she closed the distance up to right before my eyes.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t even see her start to move&#8230;!?</p>



<p>Even though she was in my field of vision&#8230;!</p>



<p>I somehow maintained my composure to avoid looking lame and returned words.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was just involuntarily mesmerized. Don&#8217;t mind it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh my&#8230;fufu, well done. I can understand why Miss Leiche was seduced.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, she continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I wanted you to say that while smiling more. You&#8217;re tense. A smile is best.&#8221;</p>



<p>Milfondy lifted my cheek with a prod.</p>



<p>&#8230;Hmph, easy for you to say.</p>



<p>Who&#8217;s the one not smiling here?</p>



<p>I wonder what kind of reaction I&#8217;d get if I flicked her finger.</p>



<p>&#8220;I appreciate the teaching.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I like obedient student.&#8221;</p>




<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/useruploads/display/8c7eed9c-12c5-4988-a42f-9cd20214a0f5_00021.jpeg" alt=""/></figure>





<p>&#8220;We get along well. Same for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Our gazes crossed and sparks scattered.</p>



<p>The one who broke the heavy silence was Mashiro, left behind.</p>



<p>&#8220;U-Um&#8230;fighting is no good!&#8221;</p>



<p>Mashiro pulled my arm and separated me from the student council president.</p>



<p>Thanks to being pressed against her breasts, I regained my calm.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right. There&#8217;s no meaning to quarreling here.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m supposed to leisurely enjoy my otherworldly life.</p>



<p>Since she started talking to us, this is a perfect chance to build rapport, isn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>If I plant a good impression now, even if I do evil deeds later, she&#8217;ll be less likely to suspect me.</p>



<p>In the far future, when I&#8217;m doing immoral acts as an evil feudal lord.</p>



<p>Hehe&#8230;I&#8217;m so evil!</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mashiro. I&#8217;ve calmed down now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;President Milfondy, I apologize for my many discourtesies.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t mind it. As president of the magic academy, I&#8217;m happy to interact with our promising new students like you two.&#8221;</p>



<p>She forgives me with a beaming smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;However, it is also true I must scold you. Why are you two here? Shouldn&#8217;t you be in class right now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, well, that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought we should use our time more meaningfully than boring classes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-Ouga kun!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Since she said she likes obedient children, I&#8217;ll be blunt.</p>



<p>The magic theory cramming since childhood was boring to me, that&#8217;s the truth.</p>






<p>&#8220;Ahaha. I suppose it could be agonizing for Vellett.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the President feel the same way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a secret. But&#8230;how about this? A practical lesson from me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;F-From the president!?&#8221;</p>
<p>A lecture from herself, the number one disciple of Florine the Lightning.</p>
<p>There was likely techniques honed over years I couldn&#8217;t even imagine.</p>
<p>An opportunity I couldn&#8217;t get even if I offered a large sum of money suddenly came falling into my lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;You came to the practical skills building to practice magic, right? For cute juniors, I don&#8217;t particularly mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>She clasped her hands together and tilted her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell the truth, I&#8217;ve been wanting to talk with you two for a while, so this is perfect timing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The student council president gripped our hands.</p>
<p>Her small hands were more powerful than I thought, and hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;The timing is a bit early, but&#8230;I was already planning to contact you two before long. Vellett, with the most knowledge among the new students, and Leiche, a dual magical aptitude user.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;I see.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to recruit you two to the student council.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what she was after.</p>
<p>Realizing her objective, my excitement quickly faded away.</p>
<p>Hehe&#8230;that was dangerous. I almost got carried away by my magic otaku blood and lost the ability to judge properly.</p>
<p>In short, she&#8217;s dangerous.</p>
<p>&#8230;Even though I&#8217;m this evil genius!</p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>I clearly conveyed my intent to decline.</p>
<p>The student council president&#8217;s true aim was to tie me down where she could keep an eye on me.</p>
<p>She likely became wary after I brought Mashiro to my side, and came to nip things in the bud.</p>
<p>After all, at this rate, an excellent talent would be abused under me, the future wicked feudal lord.</p>
<p>She approached to prevent that, I assume, but that won&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>Pretending to be kind as she got close then striking once my guard was down.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re quite the savage carnivore, Madam President.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;May I ask your reason?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to devote my power to things I want to do now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you join the student council, Vellett&#8217;s reputation will do a reversal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about that in the slightest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see. That&#8217;s unfortunate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing my resolve was firm, the student council president backed down.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll always be waiting for you two. If you change your minds, feel free to let me know.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gently released our hands and walked towards the practical skills building door just like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, please go ahead. I can accompany you inside since I&#8217;m the president.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was also a proposal to test my ability.</p>
<p>Of course, I couldn&#8217;t accept.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I cannot impose to that extent after declining. We will give up and return to the classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-Yeah. Sorry, President. To think we&#8217;d refuse your kindness&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to hold back&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Ouga! I have returned!&#8221;</p>
<p>Right on time, I heard Alice&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;My companion is calling, so please excuse us around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>I turn my back on the student council president and leave the area.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t hear her footsteps following.</p>
<p>It was regrettable I couldn&#8217;t see Mashiro&#8217;s skill, but&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master? You aren&#8217;t going to the practical skills building?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, actually&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I explained the circumstances as we walked.</p>
<p>Then, Alice clapped her hands together.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case, Master. I happen to have good news.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good news&#8230;? Would you tell me about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An acquaintance of mine runs an orphanage, and it seems some guys are after their land. Lately the harassment has been intense&#8230;I was thinking of just going with Master, but wouldn&#8217;t it be good for Miss Leiche&#8217;s combat experience if she participated too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230;that&#8217;s not bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>We could use magic freely outside the academy.</p>
<p>If I also had Mashiro cooperate from a safe spot, I could grasp her ability.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like how she counted me in without asking, but I would&#8217;ve ended up going anyway.</p>
<p>After all, if left to Alice alone, she&#8217;d kill all the villains before using them.</p>
<p>As someone who wants to secure various income sources in the future, I have to stop her.</p>
<p>This kills two birds with one stone, but there was another benefit.</p>
<p>That we could build goodwill with the orphanage.</p>
<p>There were probably lots of children without families there.</p>
<p>In other words, securing labor.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a request from me, their benefactor who saved them from the villains, they&#8217;d likely believe unconditionally.</p>
<p>I could have them sign contracts without telling Alice, and then they&#8217;d be mine.</p>
<p>Hehe&#8230;sorry, unknown children.</p>
<p>Become nourishment for my bright future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mashiro. Will you be alright?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-Yeah&#8230;! I thought such a day would come someday&#8230;I want to help Ouga kun too!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was willing herself. Then our plans were settled.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll act on the weekend holiday. Let the other side know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! For Lord Ouga&#8217;s future, let&#8217;s slaughter the villains together!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mashiro shrank back a little from Alice&#8217;s beaming smile as she said that.</p>
<p>Get used to it.</p>
<p>This girl is like this.</p>

<p>A pitch-black room.</p>
<p>The student council room with curtains tightly shut and not a ray of light entering from outside.</p>
<p>Alone in a space where no one else enters, I gazed at the photo stand.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was an interesting boy, wasn&#8217;t he, Vellett.&#8221;</p>
<p>The figure of the boy I exchanged words with the other day floats clearly into view.</p>
<p>Recalling our encounter as I look at him in the displayed photograph.</p>
<p>I put in more padding than usual to make a good first impression, yet he saw through it right away.</p>
<p>I thought it would work on him since he likes big breasted girls but&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;it&#8217;s not like mine are small, but certainly not.</p>
<p>When I lower my gaze, a slight bulge enters my vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmph&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I flicked the photo stand with my finger, annoyed at the stated fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you properly hid it after all&#8230;the rumored Magic Cancel.&#8221;</p>
<p>I definitely created a natural flow.</p>
<p>I had been observing, skipping class the whole time, so I could grasp most of the circumstances.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I caused any discomfort.</p>
<p>Even though I was aiming for his special technique, there&#8217;s no way he could have figured that out&#8230;</p>
<p>Could he have anticipated the possibility of Teacher keeping an eye on him ever since he resolved that incident?</p>
<p>But if so, his oddly aggressive attitude at the start also makes sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect you to refuse student council recruitment as well&#8230;do you plan to thoroughly conceal it?&#8221;</p>
<p>If so, then why did you use it against that idiot from the Bourbon family?</p>
<p>The reason I can infer is that he wanted to save Miss Leiche with Magic Cancel.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s to plant loyalty in her, who has rare value.</p>
<p>To make her his yes man&#8230;probably.</p>
<p>No matter how much he likes huge breasts, there&#8217;s no way he&#8217;s an idiot who would reveal his trump card just because Miss Leiche has large breasts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dancing in the palm of your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>That maid coming by at such timely coincidence must have been staged as well.</p>
<p>Since his attendant Alice normally sticks close to him, I hear.</p>
<p>However, for him to have read that I would probe through using her&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;A natural born genius, huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Completely different from me.</p>
<p>If allowed to grow freely like this, he would surely become a magician who etches his name in history.</p>
<p>He might even become a hero rivaling Florine the Lightning someday.</p>
<p>He demonstrated that much potential in just a few minutes of conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;But sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>I release my finger from the photo stand I had grabbed.</p>
<p>It fell with a clatter, and I stomped it underfoot.</p>
<p>&#8220;My purpose is to be Reina Milfondy&#8217;s reason for existing, as teacher&#8217;s substitute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ahh, what kind of report should I give when Teacher returns from her business trip?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna be yelled at.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though I&#8217;m used to it already&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Being shouted at. Being beaten. Being toyed with.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what he&#8217;s doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>I pick up the single sheet of paper I processed earlier.</p>
<p>The overnight leave request form necessary for students to exit the academy grounds.</p>
<p>Three names recently written on the form stating their purpose is volunteer work.</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Ouga. How are you feeling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. I&#8217;m used to this much rocking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I might feel sick&#8230;urp&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey now&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I gently stroke Mashiro&#8217;s back as she clearly looks unwell.</p>
<p>She was lively and frolicking when we first got in the carriage, but the repeated rocking was becoming too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;You rarely get chances to ride in carriages. I suffered the same way in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>While reminiscing about her Holy Knight days, Alice wraps a bag in cloth to make a simple pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cramped, but please lie down here. It should be slightly better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230;thank you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mashiro, who was sitting beside me, slowly stands up and tries to switch seats with Alice.</p>
<p>While watching her out the corner of my eye, I looked at the scenery passing by outside the window.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re headed to Invent.</p>
<p>A nondescript, ordinary small town on the outskirts of the capital.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like every part of the capital is prosperous.</p>
<p>The farther you get from the center, the more rural it becomes.</p>
<p>In other words, unmaintained roads increase.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah-&#8220;</p>
<p>The carriage sways intensely up and down.</p>
<p>Mashiro, who was standing, staggers and falls towards me.</p>
<p>Losing her balance, she smacks her head right into my stomach.</p>
<p>That triggered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Urp&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eek! Lord Ouga&#8217;s clothes&#8230;!&#8221;</p>






<p>The sounds of a classmate emptying what she shouldn&#8217;t and the maid&#8217;s shriek echoed in the carriage.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How many times do I have to say it? It&#8217;s okay. Actually, if you shake me that vigorously&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ugh&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;You should puke over there.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230; I&#8217;m so sorry&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Who likes to see vomit first thing in the morning?</p>



<p>After arriving at the event, we followed Alice&#8217;s guidance and walked through the city.</p>



<p>The streets were deserted, lacking any liveliness, making one doubt if anyone actually lived there.</p>



<p>&#8220;Miss Leiche, please climb on my back&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>With that exchange, Alice, now considerate, carried Mashiro on her back.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s true that there have been many harassments, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was one of the consultations I&#8217;ve received. They&#8217;re not people who hesitate to lie to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>



<p>I guess if I made false accusations against Alice, she would cut me down without hesitation.</p>



<p>But what is their aim? To be honest, it doesn&#8217;t seem like there&#8217;s much to gain.</p>



<p>The value of this tired city&#8217;s land is almost non-existent.</p>



<p>Feeling an unpleasant uneasiness, we continued our way.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you turn right at the next corner, you&#8217;ll arrive at the orphanage.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You remember it quite clearly. Even without looking at a map.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here several times. Look, I&#8217;m sure everyone will greet us—&#8221;</p>



<p>Her words were interrupted.</p>



<p>Because what we encountered was a scene of five men pushing aside a woman with orange hair.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;It seems we&#8217;re needed right away.&#8221;</p>



<p>Without hesitation, I dashed forward and struck the men with a flying kick.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gaah!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Caught off guard by the unexpected attack, the men fell like dominos.</p>



<p>Alice made sure her friend, the woman, was safe.</p>



<p>&#8220;What the&#8230;! You guys!&#8221;</p>



<p>The thugs quickly switched to combat mode.</p>



<p>In response, I also prepared myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve come to crush you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, jokes are only allowed for babies, you little brat.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you off this time. Go home and suck on your mommy&#8217;s breasts.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to lick those girls&#8217; over there!&#8221;</p>



<p>They laughed with crude voices.</p>



<p>Annoying guys.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s shut them up right here and now.</p>



<p>However, before my fist could do it, Alice&#8217;s powerful voice silenced them.</p>



<p>&#8220;You lot! Do you know who this person is?&#8221;</p>



<p>She stood in front of me, kneeling down and producing a shower of confetti from nowhere.</p>



<p>The fluttering confetti colored the area pink.</p>



<p>A-Alice?</p>



<p>&#8220;I really wish you&#8217;d stop. It&#8217;s embarrassing&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In the name of dispelling all the darkness in this world and delivering light! In the name of condemning all evil and living under the banner of justice, he is the【Saint】!&#8221;</p>



<p>The lines flowed smoothly as if it was a usual exchange for him.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Ouga-Vellett-sama!!&#8221;</p>



<p>And loudly, he declared my name.</p>



<p>Alice.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Oh, please stop! This silence is so unbearable!</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t look at me as if you&#8217;re seeing some dangerous guy!</p>



<p>And the people behind you too!</p>



<p>Hey, you&#8217;re on my side too!</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The atmosphere became eerily silent, all because of Alice.</p>





<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/useruploads/display/ebdd8b64-944a-4a0e-8890-875175e0d356_00028.jpeg" alt=""/></figure>


<p>The only one who seemed satisfied was Alice, smirking.</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh, trembling in fear of the great Lord Ouga, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Definitely not.</p>



<p>Even if it&#8217;s fear, it&#8217;s in a different way.</p>



<p>What they feel is the fear of encountering a dangerous guy they can&#8217;t understand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Lord Ouga.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alice turned her expectant gaze toward me.</p>



<p>Huh? You&#8217;re not telling me to say something here, right?</p>



<p>Are you kidding me? You&#8217;re something else.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Kukuku.&#8221;</p>



<p>I could tell all their attention was focused on me.</p>



<p>Think, Ouga-Vellett.</p>



<p>Remember your purpose.</p>



<p>You came here pretending to be a good person, getting close to the orphanage, and securing the orphans here as labor.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re here to gain their favor.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s no way I, who is fundamentally evil to the core, can become a good person.</p>



<p>Even if I half-heartedly act, the lies will be exposed.</p>



<p>Then, there&#8217;s only one thing to do!</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, I am the Saint who will save all the world&#8217;s evil.&#8221;</p>



<p>I must become that dangerous man, fully immersed in playing the role of a righteous hero!</p>



<p>&#8220;I will forgive all your past actions and save you in my name.&#8221;</p>



<p>Crossing my chest, I began.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is where your evil meets its end.&#8221;</p>



<p>H-How is it&#8230;?</p>



<p>I stole a glance behind me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone, meet the Saint&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t work&#8230;!</p>



<p>Oh no, even the women are backing away&#8230;</p>



<p>Isn&#8217;t that strange? I&#8217;m the one saving them, right?</p>



<p>Ugh&#8230;! I was trying to be smooth and cool while rescuing them, but&#8230;!</p>



<p>My first impression is a total failure—</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so lovely&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, no! It&#8217;s not like that! This guy is dangerous too!&#8221;</p>



<p>As I turned around, she had a blissful smile and was trembling while holding her own shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter what sins you commit, no matter how tainted your soul becomes, you extend your hand&#8230; Ah, what a wonderful love it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it? By passing judgment, Lord Ouga gives those who have lived without being judged a chance at redemption.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; a kind-hearted person. Truly worthy of serving you, noble-sama.&#8221;</p>
<p>Birds of a feather flock together.</p>
<p>If I think about it, the Alice, who kills absolute evil, and the person who can befriend her wouldn&#8217;t be normal.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way someone like that would be normal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tch, what do you think this is, a child&#8217;s play?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah, you&#8217;re amazing, amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pick a fight with adults, okay~?&#8221;</p>
<p>Their attitudes clearly show that they&#8217;re making fun of me.</p>
<p>Hold it in, hold it in&#8230;</p>
<p>I am the【Saint】&#8230; a compassionate man&#8230;</p>
<p>For my goal, I can endure any insult.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmph, then how about this?&#8221;</p>
<p>The guy I kicked earlier drew a knife.</p>
<p>He licked the blade and pointed it towards me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please save us too,【Saint】-sama!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</p>
<p>I dashed out with force.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me too! Please save me too,【Saint】-sama!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll deal with you later!</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to hit, do it properly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you hit, it will hurt!&#8221;</p>
<p>A knife thrust straight at me.</p>
<p>It seemed that he predicted I&#8217;d be scared and stopped moving, but unfortunately for him, I&#8217;m already used to real combat.</p>
<p>During the combat training I had with Alice before enrolling, she used a real sword to attack me, although the blade was dulled, it was essential for me who can&#8217;t use magic and needs to be able to handle hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, I have almost no fear of weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!?&#8221;</p>
<p>I parried the straight hit from the inside.</p>
<p>The knife, which had gone off its trajectory, naturally didn&#8217;t hit, and the guy was left in an exposed position.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should reflect on your actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>I buried a left body blow into his side, and then a right straight hit his sunken face, knocking him out.</p>
<p>When the man fell, the others each took out their weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surround him!&#8221;</p>
<p>With the one person taken down, they stopped underestimating me and coordinated their attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Die!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tear him to pieces!&#8221;</p>
<p>Weapons swung toward my head and abdomen.</p>
<p>But, it&#8217;s too naive. If you aim, it should be at my legs, not my stomach.</p>
<p>&#8220;The area below is a safe zone.&#8221;</p>
<p>I crouched down to dodge.</p>
<p>With my hands on the ground, I flipped my body up and kicked the faces of the guys as they approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oof!?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two remained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn, what the hell are you guys!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to hear that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gyahhh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heyy!?&#8221;</p>
<p>They interrupted my words with their death cries.</p>
<p>As the man who was trying to escape was taken down, Alice gave him an iron claw.</p>
<p>I could hear the sickening sound of bones breaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230; Ahh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who was caught was foaming at the mouth, his eyes rolled back.</p>
<p>He was thrown on top of the guys I stretched out.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You, do you want to run too?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice&#8217;s lips curled up in a smile.</p>
<p>&#8230;Now that I think about it, she suits being a villain more than a hero.</p>
<p>In that sense, it might be fate for her to become my subordinate.</p>
<p>&#8220;And may【Saint】&#8217;s judgment be upon you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, the dangerous woman fell to her knees in front of the fallen men and began to pray.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell is going on with you guys!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guaah!?&#8221;</p>
<p>With determination, I struck him across the right cheek.</p>
<p>He was too flustered to make a proper judgment and couldn&#8217;t avoid it, so he fell down weakly.</p>
<p>These guys are obviously just underlings.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;ll be useful, but I should tie them up to extract information if needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice tore off the men&#8217;s clothes and used them as makeshift restraints for their hands and feet.</p>
<p>&#8230;I just noticed, but Mashiro is unconscious on my back&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Ah, it must have been when I ran to cut in between her friend and the thugs.</p>
<p>In a way, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t witness this scene.</p>
<p>It would have been the most painful thing to see others getting hurt trying to help me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s reassuring to have someone follow up and take care of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vélett-sama, that was an admirable【Judgment】.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop using weird words.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not that kind of character&#8230;!</p>
<p>Alice just spoke of her ideal version of me on her own.</p>
<p>Even though I&#8217;m just going along with the awkward atmosphere and acting&#8230;</p>
<p>Why did it end up like this&#8230;?</p>





<p>However, she seemed unfazed and started introducing herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Mio. I never thought a noble-sama would actually come&#8230; As Alice said, you truly are a person full of love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saying that, she tightly held my hand with hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may not be able to offer much hospitality, but our orphanage welcomes you, Vellett-sama.&#8221;</p>
<p>I came here just for the labor force, but..I had a feeling I was stepping into tricky waters.</p>
<p>That was the scene when we first met.</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>&#8220;Please come in, though it&#8217;s not a very grand building for a noble guest.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was being modest, but it was certainly a good size for one woman to own. Looking up, I could see it was three stories high.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense. It&#8217;s bigger than most commoners could afford.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An elderly couple leaving town kindly gave it to us. Before this, it was much smaller and cramped for the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>I entered when invited and passed through the door.</p>
<p>There was a table where the kids could gather for meals, with toys and books scattered around. Some children had huddled together in a corner.</p>
<p>When they saw Mio, they cried &#8220;Sister!&#8221; and &#8220;Mio-neechan!&#8221; then rushed to cling to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;There there, everything&#8217;s alright now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;It was a normal scene, yet seemed odd after her earlier behavior.</p>
<p>Noticing me while clinging to her, the children turned my way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chri&#8211;&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice coughed deliberately and the children covered their mouths, realizing something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh right&#8230;! Sorry, Sis Alice!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You came to play?!&#8221;</p>
<p>So the kids knew Alice already, huh. She patted their heads as they came up to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Been a month, has it? You staying out of trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! Been practicing swordfighting lots!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so, is that so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Sis Alice beat up the bad guys?!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No no, this time my master here helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attention shifted my way as Alice passed the torch.</p>
<p>Ten kids total, a good number for one woman running an orphanage. In the future they&#8217;d work hard as my subordinates, that was for sure.</p>
<p>Now, first impressions were key. I&#8217;d establish my status and superiority here.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Ouga Vellett, firstborn of the Vellett family. Heeding my sword Alice&#8217;s wish, I&#8217;ve come to protect you. You&#8217;re mine now. As of today, this orphanage is under my name&#8217;s safety. Be grateful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice and Mio clapped enthusiastically. They&#8217;d praise anything I did. I ignored them.</p>
<p>Now, how would the children react?</p>
<p>Hmph, I was a noble after all. I wore fine clothes and had an air of high status &#8211; something they&#8217;d never seen. They&#8217;d look on with respect for sure.</p>
<p>Fine, I&#8217;d permit even rude language from them.</p>
<p>Go on kids, shower me with grateful words!</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks weak~&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sis Alice is way cooler~&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really a noble? Just a kid like us~&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey you brats!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But but~&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobles are all weaklings right? That&#8217;s what Sis Alice said~&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was before meeting Lord Ouga&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re stronger since Sis Alice taught us swords!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah yeah~&#8221;</p>
<p>The cheeky brats chattered insults about me.</p>
<p>Mio hurried over, bowing profusely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, Vellett sama! I&#8217;ll scold them right away&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s fine. Good they have so much energy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patience, patience.</p>
<p>Losing my temper would prove I was on their childish level.</p>
<p>I was an adult. I&#8217;d only let girls&#8217; teasing get to me.</p>
<p>The boys were the main offenders.</p>
<p>Yes, so I wouldn&#8217;t get mad if they pulled my clothes or slapped my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, fight me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Calm down, Ouga-Vellett.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to pay attention to what those immature kids are saying.</p>
<p>See, everything&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Put on that smile like a proper adult and handle this calmly&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, forget it. You&#8217;re just a clumsy noble after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine, I&#8217;ll show you what I can do!&#8221;</p>
<p>I need to discipline these brats properly!</p>
<p>I take off my coat and toss it to Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, I&#8217;ll take care of these guys. You go and handle what you need to do in the meantime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;! Understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a discreet whisper, Alice takes Mio and quickly heads to another room.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, I need to make sure Mashiro, who&#8217;s been down on your back, is put to rest.</p>
<p>And if I make eye contact with Alice, I won&#8217;t be able to get serious against these guys.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show them the fear of an adult&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, the battle with the children began.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&#8220;Big brother Ouga, that was amazing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next, me! Let me do it too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, unfair! I want to try that flying one too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuhahaha! I&#8217;ll do as much as you want! And praise me even more!&#8221;</p>
<p>Laughter from the children and Vellett-sama echoes through the living room.</p>
<p>Vellett-sama lifts the children and tosses them up, and they catch him before hitting the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heheh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>When was the last time I saw the children having so much fun?</p>
<p>Ever since this orphanage&#8217;s land became a target, it&#8217;s been days filled with fear from angry voices.</p>
<p>With my powerless self, everything could be taken away from me.</p>
<p>So, I took a chance and contacted an old friend, and I&#8217;m so glad I did.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Vellett-sama.&#8221;</p>
<p>The【Saint】who will save us all&#8230;</p>
<p>Alice&#8217;s words were right.</p>
<p>He showers the children with so much love.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phew&#8230; It&#8217;s been a while since I had to hold back like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome back. Here&#8217;s a towel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hand the towel to Alice, who has just returned from another room.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t ask what she was doing.</p>
<p>But there was blood on her cheek, so I can guess to some extent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got the necessary information, so we can strike the main force tomorrow. You can relax.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>A sigh of relief escapes me.</p>
<p>The children&#8217;s daily lives won&#8217;t be threatened anymore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, I&#8217;ll definitely repay you for this. I&#8217;ll have money ready, so please wait a little longer for your payment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course. But I don&#8217;t think Lord Ouga would ever demand money,&#8221; she said, watching Vellett-sama play with the children with lively eyes.</p>
<p>Until a few months ago, Alice used to express hatred and resentment towards nobles. But now, she acknowledges the noble Vellett-sama. Please forgive me, Alice. I thought there was no such person. For nobles, commoners are easily replaceable beings. My mother was also one of the victims. So the fact that a noble would reach out to us, commoners who can&#8217;t even expect any rewards, is unusual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, Lord Ouga will decide everything. Let&#8217;s discuss it after the children have gone to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You&#8217;re right. Dinner is ready too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I smelled something good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vé, Vellett-sama&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vellett-sama comes over with the children. They seem to have grown attached to him, as some of the little ones are holding his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while. We were having so much fun,&#8221; he says, but surely He was buying time for Alice to finish her work. Occasionally, I caught him glancing in their direction, probably trying to keep the children away from there.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what&#8217;s for dinner today?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since everyone is here, I thought I&#8217;d make my best curry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yay!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sister&#8217;s food is really delicious!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the food Mio-nee-chan makes too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so, is that so,&#8221;</p>
<p>Vellett-sama pats the excited children&#8217;s heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haha. You guys are lucky to eat Mio&#8217;s delicious food every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
<p>My food is delicious→I want to eat it every day→I want to be with her every day→marriage.</p>
<p>In other words&#8230; a proposal!?</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never experienced love, so I don&#8217;t know how to respond.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>As I look at Vellett-sama, my cheeks start to feel warm.</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, he might fill this emptiness in my heart by judging my sins.</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what is it that you wanted to tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>While Mio puts the children to sleep, Alice was called to the guest room by Vellett-sama for a private conversation.</p>
<p>They both sit down on a slightly old-fashioned sofa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I followed Lord Ouga&#8217;s instructions and tortured them to extract information. It&#8217;s about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I never gave such instructions&#8230;</p>
<p>How did she interpret it as torture?</p>
<p>I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You didn&#8217;t kill them, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. They have a role to play in leading us to their main base.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not you I&#8217;m worried about&#8230;</p>
<p>We need manpower to start anything. I can&#8217;t just cut them down easily like mowing grass. I wanted to incorporate them and resolve this peacefully&#8230;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s done is done.</p>
<p>At least Alice acted with me in mind.</p>
<p>Actually, she made progress by not killing everyone in a surprise attack on enemy territory.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, I look up. Sinking into the backrest, I ask her.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what did you find out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re after this place because they want to build an underground arena in Inivent, it seems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the Washua one Alice was in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Or rather, it&#8217;s more accurate to say they&#8217;re remnants from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you dispose of them all? Did some get away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s impossible. Those without a place simply get time off. The lucky ones who had that day free are causing trouble now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, isn&#8217;t this our fault?</p>
<p>Shutting down the Washua underground arena left these guys unemployed, so they set their sights on Inivent.</p>
<p>Washua and Inivent are neighboring districts. With no royal knights patrolling, it was perfect for restarting.</p>
<p>&#8220;To begin with, as Washua&#8217;s public order declined, more people had been leaving to Inivent. It was convenient for their evil deeds&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Noticing my pondering, she trailed off.</p>





<p>&#8220;No, just thinking about some things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yup, a complete whack-a-mole situation!</p>
<p>And I went and ate the dinner made by the people suffering because of us&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh no, my stomach suddenly started hurting&#8230;</p>
<p>What I aim for is not this kind of stomach-aching wickedness!</p>
<p>Even evil has its aesthetics.</p>
<p>For instance, I will do any evil deeds that benefit me personally, but I won&#8217;t involve myself in anything else.</p>
<p>Create a cute harem, enjoy delicious food.</p>
<p>Live freely and comfortably using tax money from my subjects.</p>
<p>Having principles and goals, pushing through meaningful actions is what makes one look cool.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to be involved in random and unpredictable situations like this time.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;ve made up my mind. I&#8217;ll take responsibility and see this through to the end.</p>
<p>As long as I&#8217;m alive, I&#8217;ll ensure the safety of the orphanage, no, the safety of Inevent.</p>
<p>For that, I need to start planning in my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, about this attack. Absolutely no one is to be killed. Not even half-dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? Can you explain? Don&#8217;t show that dissatisfaction aura.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your presence alone can make ordinary people panic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to use them. For the execution of my evil plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. You have a plan in mind, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. What do you think of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Saint who will save everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>This girl really adores me, huh?</p>
<p>As I pondered this suspicion, there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me. It&#8217;s Mio. May I come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice sought permission with her eyes, and I nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. Were you busy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mio, who finished putting the children to sleep, lowered her head.</p>
<p>In her hand was a white package.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just settled on a plan. How are the kids doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t seem frightened at all. Maybe they calmed down quickly because of your playfulness, Vellett-sama.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hahaha&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt a bit embarrassed; after all, it was just me acting silly.</p>
<p>But it was still a meaningful time.</p>
<p>I also learned about the children&#8217;s feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, what brings you here at this hour? Worried and couldn&#8217;t sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not that&#8230; it&#8217;s for you, Vellett-sama.&#8221;</p>
<p>She handed me the white package that had been on her mind.</p>
<p>When I opened it, I found ten silver coins inside.</p>
<p>One silver coin could cover the children&#8217;s food expenses for half a month.</p>
<p>For her, it was a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a reward for the noble, especially a duke like Vellett-sama, I understand that it&#8217;s not much. But this&#8230; um&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She fidgeted, blushing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything to make up for the insufficient amount. Please&#8230; Please, protect us!&#8221;</p>
<p>I see. For me, these ten silver coins are, to be honest, just loose change.</p>
<p>Anything, huh?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Alice, do you remember what we wrote on the permit application when we came here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It clearly stated &#8216;volunteer&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, right. Then it&#8217;s strange to accept money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mio, who had been looking down, raised her head.</p>
<p>After all, it was Alice who asked for this, and I had no intention of accepting any reward from the beginning.</p>
<p>Moreover, what I want is not the instant money, but future labor force.</p>
<p>Also, it would be devilish to add more suffering to those already affected by our actions.</p>
<p>I may be wicked, but I&#8217;m not an evil person.</p>
<p>Besides, my purpose is almost fulfilled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why. I&#8217;ll return this. I don&#8217;t need any reward.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took Mio&#8217;s hand and gave the package back.</p>
<p>She stared at it for a moment and started shedding tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you&#8230; so much!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See? I told you, didn&#8217;t I? Vellett-sama doesn&#8217;t ask for money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice moved closer to her and gently patted her back.</p>
<p>You&#8230; did you just say that on your own?</p>
<p>Please stop planting bombs without my knowledge.</p>
<p>That was a close call.</p>
<p>If I had chosen to ask for more money here, both Alice and Mio&#8217;s opinion of me would have dropped&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, as soon as the date changes, we&#8217;ll launch the attack. I&#8217;ll rest for a bit, so be prepared in case anything happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until then, we have a lot to talk about. Take your time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, uh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have many vacant rooms here. Feel free to use any available room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, then I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I bid farewell and left the room.</p>
<p>As I walked down the corridor, I could hear the children&#8217;s sleeping breaths.</p>
<p>I entered a random room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, is this okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>After crushing the remnants of the rebels&#8217; base, this incident will be over.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll finish up the few personal things I&#8217;ve left and go to sleep.</p>
<p>Six hours later&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vellett-sama&#8230; Although I don&#8217;t have any charms, please feel free to use my body.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mio attempted to sneak into my bed at night.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t I say I didn&#8217;t need any rewards?</p>
<p>Why does it always end up like this around me?</p>
<p>I heard the sound of cloth rubbing against cloth.</p>
<p>Despite seeing Mio starting to undress in front of me, surprisingly, my head remained calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop. I&#8217;ll call Alice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice is standing guard outside. She won&#8217;t hear us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t underestimate her. If I call seriously, she&#8217;ll come running from the other side of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even so&#8230;I have reasons I cannot stop&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mio began recounting her past circumstances at length. However, I was focused on figuring out how to get out of this situation while half-listening.</p>
<p>For starters, I could shake her off by force. But she likely wouldn&#8217;t give up without being convinced.</p>
<p>I wanted to avoid that.</p>
<p>&#8230;Come to think, I heard that being kind after violence overwhelms their emotions so they stop thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah, this could work. I&#8217;d brush it off ambiguously after that and push through.</p>
<p>&#8220;So please&#8230;grant me fleeting love, carve it into me just once&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reason for refusing? There&#8217;s only one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m─a boobs man. Specifically the big ones</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>[You should never have been born]</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what my mother threw at me most.</p>
<p>She was a noble&#8217;s mistress. She lived a pampered, luxurious life.</p>
<p>But after conceiving me, she was cast off as used goods.</p>
<p>Of course she could no longer live as before.</p>
<p>She resented me.</p>
<p>Continually abused by my mother for costing her an easy life and her loved one.</p>
<p>Ah, I should never have been born.</p>
<p>Having never known another&#8217;s love, I spent each day like that.</p>
<p>Then one day after nearly ten years of that life, my mother quietly passed away.</p>
<p>She who had beaten me with such vigor.</p>
<p>After that I was raised in the church&#8217;s orphanage and came to be here.</p>
<p>I could have stayed and served as a nun. But I had the desire to help children suffering similarly, that was undoubtedly part of the reason.</p>
<p>However, the biggest reason was my inability to comprehend love.</p>
<p>Without ever receiving love, how could I empathize with others&#8217; worries?</p>
<p>I learned how to raise and interact with children from books.</p>
<p>Learned because it was necessary.</p>
<p>But that was all surface level.</p>
<p>I fear I have not loved those children. The anxiety gnaws at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;So please&#8230;grant me fleeting love, carve it into me just once&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I am a wretched woman.</p>
<p>Due to my upbringing, my style can hardly be called attractive.</p>
<p>If I explain my circumstances, kind Vellett sama would surely accept me.</p>
<p>Knowing that, I shamefully tried to seduce him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mio&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Vellett sama called my name and reached for my cheek─</p>
<p>&#8220;No thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>And slapped me, firmly rejecting me.</p>
<p>Memories of my childhood revived.</p>
<p>My stinging cheek felt that nostalgic heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here it comes again&#8230;and again&#8230; I&#8217;ll endure until she&#8217;s satisfied, like back then.</p>
<p>Squeezing my eyes shut, I braced for the fear.</p>
<p>&#8230;Yet no violence came, no matter how long I shook.</p>
<p>Timidly opening my eyes.</p>
<p>Vellett sama was gently embracing me.</p>
<p>Huh? Wha!? Why&#8230;!?</p>
<p>&#8220;L-Vellett sama!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry. But for overwriting everything that tormented you, it was a necessary act.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I finally realized the meaning behind his actions.</p>
<p>To rid me of my past, Vellett sama intentionally slapped me.</p>
<p>Unlike my mother, he used that same violence yet gave me kindness.</p>
<p>This heat will free me from my shackles to the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Looks like it worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patting my back, Vellett sama stood up.</p>
<p>The disappearing warmth made my heart lonely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not time yet to give you the answer you seek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I understand. I shall pray for your safe return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our victory is assured. That&#8217;s what it means.&#8221;</p>
<p>A declaration of certain victory from an absolute superior.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more reassuring.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, Mio should sleep without worries. When you wake, it will be over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was Vellett sama being kind until the very moment he left the room?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>However, I am no foolish woman who merely receives your kindness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be sure to greet your return at the entrance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave no response to my words.</p>
<p>Merely smiling, Vellett sama left the room.</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>





<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ahh, I hope Mio would just stay asleep&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I wanted to avoid answering her questions about her feelings for me and just go home.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a Saint. I don&#8217;t have the experience to answer such heavy questions.</p>
<p>So, I told her to sleep and wait for me, but&#8230; judging from her behavior, she&#8217;s definitely awake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouga-kun? Is something wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shake my head.</p>
<p>No, I can&#8217;t do this. We&#8217;re about to jump into a battlefield.</p>
<p>Having unnecessary thoughts might cost us our lives.</p>
<p>Even against weaker opponents, true top-class evil never lets its guard down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, are we in the right place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;! &#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>The guide, whose mouth was covered with cloth to prevent him from making a sound, nods repeatedly.</p>
<p>According to the information Alice extracted, this place used to be Inevent&#8217;s only bar, and it seems the boss is waiting for their reports while drinking there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mashiro, are you fully awake now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! I slept a lot, so I&#8217;m full of energy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. Don&#8217;t be too nervous. I&#8217;ll take care of the boss, and you can deal with the small fries around.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, I have one condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not kill anyone. There&#8217;s no need for you to get your hands dirty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Murder takes an enormous toll on one&#8217;s psyche. Even promising young men aspiring to become holy knights end up giving up their dreams after experiencing such trauma.</p>
<p>I have no intention of burdening her with such a sin.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the one promise you must keep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I got it. I&#8217;ll definitely live up to your expectations, Ouga-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mashiro also pumps herself up with a loud snort, showing a determined look.</p>
<p>Her excitement is causing her breasts to distort between her arms.</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s perfect. I want Mashiro to remain my stress-reliever for life.</p>
<p>I give my instructions to my restless sword, as staring at it would give away my intentions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, don&#8217;t get involved this time. Just assess Mashiro&#8217;s abilities. Don&#8217;t lose sight of our original purpose,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood,&#8221; she replies, bowing her head since she has the thugs tied up with her arms.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s quite strong, honestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it&#8230;! Aren&#8217;t they back yet!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A-Aliban-sama, please calm down!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a waste of good booze!&#8221;</p>
<p>A loud, gravelly voice and the sound of breaking glass come from inside the bar.</p>
<p>Looks like the targets are in there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>I raise my leg and kick forward, blowing the door away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ughhh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>The chaotic screams and the sudden sound of destruction draw everyone&#8217;s attention towards us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the hell are you guys!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve come to bring you nightmares.&#8221;</p>
<p>I smirk defiantly as I point to the bulky man who seems to be Aliban, veins popping on his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where your evil ends.&#8221;</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>What&#8230; what&#8217;s happening&#8230;</p>
<p>Chaos and screams fill the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m frozen!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no! My hands are too slippery to hold my weapon!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it&#8230;! My legs won&#8217;t move&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>A white mist surrounds them.</p>
<p>The rapidly dropping temperature in the mist robs them of their freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;─【Frozen Winds】. Don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t kill anyone,&#8221; I explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ice!? A rare attribute!?&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the six basic attributes of fire, water, wind, earth, lightning, and light, there are rare magic attributes called derivatives. The ice magic used by the woman is one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But using it in an enclosed space like this will affect you guys too─&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no. We won&#8217;t be affected. We use wind magic to control the air currents,&#8221; one of them explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using two types of magic&#8230; a dual-magic caster!? Are you kidding me&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t joke around&#8230; hiring such reinforcements would cost a fortune.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way those poor orphans could afford that!</p>
<p>&#8220;I never expected that Mashiro would need attention too. The power is stronger than I thought&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy that I can be useful to you, Ouga-kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m impressed and almost moved by how reliable you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even this brat, who&#8217;s engaging me with dry laughter, is dangerous.</p>
<p>No matter how much I try to strike him, he nullifies my initial attacks with ease and lightly evades them.</p>
<p>His downward strikes seamlessly flow into sweeps, and he releases the force from upward attacks as if bouncing it off from the inside.</p>
<p>Chatting away, looking elsewhere, he effortlessly handles everything. This is bad.</p>
<p>If you can hire mercenaries of such high level, it means they&#8217;re not just orphans&#8230;!</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you lead them here, Chris-Lagnica!? You&#8217;re just like us, fallen, aren&#8217;t you!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You&#8217;ve got the wrong person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell!? It&#8217;s clearly Chris-Lagnica!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, do you have time to be distracted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gah!&#8221;</p>
<p>The kid&#8217;s kick stabs into my abdomen.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s heavy&#8230;!</p>
<p>A grating sound echoes from my body to my brain.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m floating&#8230;!?</p>
<p>&#8220;Guwaaaaah!?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sent flying and hit the wall, my back aching.</p>
<p>Where is this power coming from in that body&#8230;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you done? I want to talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wish&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>I struggle to catch my breath, but the pain from my broken bones won&#8217;t let me.</p>
<p>My forehead is covered in cold sweat.</p>
<p>Damn it, damn it, damn it!</p>
<p>This lord of mine&#8230; losing to a kid&#8230;? Unthinkable!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been the best when it comes to power.</p>
<p>Even in the arena, I was confident I&#8217;d win if the organizers didn&#8217;t pair me with Lagnica.</p>
<p>With this fist and body, I won&#8217;t lose anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>So, I will build my own arena again.</p>
<p>To make my name resound throughout the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t be the end! I still have a trump card!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is&#8230;!?!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the 【Enhancing Elixir】 circulating in the black market&#8230; huff!&#8221;</p>
<p>I break the mouth of the bottle and down it in one go.</p>
<p>Instantly, my muscles begin to tremble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uooohhh&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>My body swells as if about to burst.</p>
<p>With a bang, I punch the wall, creating a hole and cracks.</p>
<p>Wow&#8230; this is incredible&#8230;! Right now, I&#8217;m filled with a feeling of invincibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heheh, what&#8217;s wrong? Too scared to speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p>The kid puts his hand on his neck and undoes a button or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look too pathetic to be surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you how a true strongman behaves. Bring it on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t underestimate me&#8230;! Even if you regret it, I won&#8217;t care!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tremendous power destroys everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of your moves can stand against overwhelming violence! Take this!&#8221;</p>
<p>I land a right straight on his contemptible face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kyaa!?&#8221;</p>
<p>The force of my punch creates a gust of wind, knocking down the wizard behind me.</p>
<p>Such power.</p>
<p>If they were to take a direct hit from the front, there&#8217;s no doubt they&#8217;d turn into a pile of flesh. &#8230;Or so it should be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. So, I decided to deal with violence using violence,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>My full-force punch was easily stopped.</p>
<p>With just one hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see? To be evil means to bring despair to your opponent,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoaa!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Huh? Did I just scream?</p>
<p>Not only that, I instinctively took a step back.</p>
<p>My survival instinct sensed the danger to my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve always been overwhelming and defeated those weaker than you,&#8221; he continues.</p>
<p>My fist is pushed back.</p>
<p>No matter how much weight I put into it, he easily twists it, and my posture deteriorates rapidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why you rely on drugs. Your power doesn&#8217;t stand a chance against well-honed skills and beliefs,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;m brought down to my knees.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by his tremendous power.</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; I see it now&#8230;</p>
<p>I was just a king of a tiny, insignificant country&#8230; and&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;To even claim to be evil is beyond you, a third-rate,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>This man is the true king, the one with the qualities of a real ruler&#8230;!</p>
<p>A shock runs through my cheeks.</p>
<p>The first knockout of my life is strangely satisfying.</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>The scene is now a complete mess, hardly recognizable as a bar.</p>
<p>Aliban has fainted, but the other guys are still conscious.</p>
<p>As instructed, Mashiro seems to have held back, only partially freezing some of them without taking their lives.</p>
<p>It looks like Alice has supported Mashiro, allowing her to showcase her true abilities.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been carefully watching as she occasionally repelled the thieves who tried to counterattack.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, Ouga-kun, how was my magic?&#8221; Mashiro asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was beyond my expectations. You&#8217;re quite skilled at controlling magic. I was worried about what would happen when you cast such a large-scale spell, but&#8230; you kept your promise well,&#8221; I say, patting her head, and Mashiro narrows her eyes, looking embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; ehehe&#8230; I&#8217;ll work even harder to receive more praise from Ouga-kun,&#8221; she says.</p>





<p>Mashiro is a clever girl. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll keep growing as she says.</p>
<p>Her appearance is superb, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ll tolerate laziness among my subordinates.</p>
<p>I need talented individuals who will work diligently for me, even if they become members of my harem&#8230;!</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a good reason for going on this expedition,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>Now we know Mashiro&#8217;s strength, one of our initial objectives.</p>
<p>She may be part of my harem of beauties, but she can also be counted as a valuable asset in terms of combat power.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good job, Lord Ouga,&#8221; Alice, who didn&#8217;t participate in the fight this time, brings a towel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t much of a workout,&#8221; I reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering Lord Ouga&#8217;s abilities, that&#8217;s only natural. So, Lord Ouga, should I cut this guy&#8217;s head off?&#8221; Alice asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sword, about to be swung down toward the fallen Aliban, comes to a stop.</p>
<p>Geez! Why is she executing him without asking for permission first?</p>
<p>The &#8220;don&#8217;t get involved&#8221; rule wasn&#8217;t limited to just combat!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ruin my business opportunities for the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are still many things I want to ask him and have him do,&#8221; I explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things to ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>I pick up a small vial that had fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;He mentioned this, the 【Enhancing Elixir】. Due to his weak natural abilities, he lost to me, but there was indeed an enhancement in his strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can feel its effects, as I was the one who received his attacks.</p>
<p>Alice, who understands this, gazes intently at the vial of liquid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering his tone, we can assume that it&#8217;s traded in the underworld. It seems that it&#8217;s already circulating in the world,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the future, more and more people will misuse it. &#8230;No, there&#8217;s a possibility it&#8217;s already being used,&#8221; Alice responds.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. This guy could become a valuable source of information,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>Once we find out who his supplier is and where it&#8217;s manufactured, there will be a great opportunity to make a killing in profit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s undoubtedly a failed experiment when attempting to create something else.</p>
<p>However, the effect is there, which means that with my genius brain, I can improve it and potentially sell it as a type of medicine for use in battles against the demons.</p>
<p>For the sake of that bright future, I must definitely keep this guy close to me.</p>
<p>Also, I wanted one more chess piece who could move freely outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always believed in giving people a chance at redemption. That&#8217;s the essence of my 【Salvation】,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>Even though saying it like that is so embarrassing!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely going down as a black history, but I know that Alice will understand if I put it that way.</p>
<p>See, she&#8217;s smiling with delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;As expected of Lord Ouga. It&#8217;s an honor to serve you,&#8221; Alice says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, make it your lifelong boast. I, too, shall be a master you can be proud of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow&#8230;! You both look so cool!&#8221;</p>
<p>Impressed by the theatrical exchange, Mashiro&#8217;s enthusiastic applause echoes through the battered bar.</p>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s no reason to linger here any longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on! Don&#8217;t leave us behind!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so rude!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Don&#8217;t worry. Didn&#8217;t I say I have plenty of business to attend to? Just wait here for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the voices of the thieves don&#8217;t cease. Some are even crying.</p>
<p>The howling of losers is always annoying.</p>
<p>If you guys don&#8217;t cut it out soon, you&#8217;ll face consequences later, courtesy of Alice.</p>
<p>Naturally, I can&#8217;t really threaten them like that, so I&#8217;m pondering how to handle the situation, when an unexpected person steps in to resolve it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, shut up, you guys!&#8221;</p>
<p>A thunderous roar that shakes my eardrums. The air falls silent in an instant, and the owner of the voice, who had been lying down, slowly stands up.</p>
<p>Damn, I guess the effects of the doping weren&#8217;t enough to completely knock him out&#8230;?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Aliban doesn&#8217;t say a word, just stares at me intently.</p>
<p>I catch Alice interrupting Mashiro and glance at her with a provocative smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Still not satisfied with our little game?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because he&#8217;s looking down, I can&#8217;t read his expression.</p>
<p>I wonder what kind of reaction Aliban is having&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8211;Brother! Please let me work under you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Folding his knees, Aliban slams his hands and forehead forcefully onto the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The two of us exchange glances. It&#8217;s not just us.</p>
<p>Even his subordinates seem unable to keep up with the situation.</p>
<p>If I didn&#8217;t mishear, he just said he wants to work under me&#8230;?</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your intention?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-No, it&#8217;s not like that! I&#8217;m just fascinated by your power!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;&#8230; Hou? &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fought and understood&#8230; that you are the man worthy of standing above everyone else!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seems to understand quite well, this guy.</p>
<p>Yes, I am the suitable man to rule over the commoners as a corrupt lord and enjoy an easy life among the upper class.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, you will obey my orders, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! I will dedicate my life to you, Brother! You can even make me your slave if you want!&#8221;</p>
<p>Judging by his demeanor, he truly seems to admire me.</p>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;s no need for any further education.</p>
<p>I briefly check with Alice through a glance to make sure he&#8217;s not lying, and she agrees with me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, I see. Alright, Aliban. I&#8217;ll give you a task right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Thank you very much!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aliban, you are to&#8230; go around different areas and discipline those delinquents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I explain the job I had in mind for Aliban.</p>
<p>In summary, he would go to the trouble spots, beat up the wrongdoers, and gather them under my command.</p>
<p>No one would find it strange if those troublemakers suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>And then, I plan to reopen the underground arena with the people he gathers.</p>
<p>With this, I can become the backer and make a killing.</p>
<p>If the fighters are in my employ, I can rig the fights as I please!</p>
<p>Since the building wasn&#8217;t destroyed, there&#8217;s hardly any need for additional investment.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;ll keep the underground arena a secret from Alice, but we should talk privately sometime.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ll ask about the origin of the 【Enhancing Elixir】 then.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can bring along other guys too. The more, the merrier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouga-kun, are you sure about this? Trusting him so easily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I have confidence in my ability to judge people.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are people who have the same look in their eyes as Aliban&#8217;s among my own people.</p>
<p>Like Alice. Will she betray me? That&#8217;s what it comes down to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood. So, we should deal with the bad guys, just like you did, Brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Just follow my lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will fulfill the duty entrusted to me by Brother&#8230; without fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, yes, it&#8217;s good to see that he&#8217;s motivated.</p>
<p>For now, we&#8217;ve completed everything we needed to do here.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come back to pick you up later. I&#8217;ll heal your wounds too, so just be patient until then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! I&#8217;m grateful for your kindness!&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing off the big man as he prostrates himself, I leave the bar with Alice and Mashiro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Manipulating the minds and bodies of the organization&#8217;s leaders, converting them to justice without causing any casualties&#8230; A splendid strategy, Lord Ouga.&#8221;</p>
<p>As planned, Alice completely misunderstands the situation.</p>
<p>Kukuku, this was the only chance to stop her, and yet&#8230; Now I have a solid foundation to do whatever I want in the future.</p>
<p>With money, you can get away with anything in this world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, really! Ouga-kun, you were so cool. I can&#8217;t move as quickly as you. Like this, shushushu.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mashiro imitates the punch I threw at Aliban.</p>
<p>&#8230;Despite being blessed with talent as a mage, her physical coordination is still hopeless.</p>
<p>Her weak cat punches were cuter than I expected. I wonder if she&#8217;d wear cat ears if I bought her a pair&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouga kun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8230; When we reach the orphanage, don&#8217;t make any noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;d be mean to wake them up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not just that, Lady Mashiro. Lord Ouga intends to leave without taking money from Mio.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right&#8230; We&#8217;ll head out after getting our stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Completely wrong. I just want to hurry back since I haven&#8217;t prepared an answer for the question Mio asked before we left.</p>
<p>If she&#8217;s calling me the Saint, she should do as I say and be asleep.</p>
<p>I was clinging to the hope that was possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it? Quietly, don&#8217;t wake them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those two nodded firmly at my warning.</p>
<p>Our mission to secure the orphanage&#8217;s safety was accomplished.</p>
<p>So, betting she wouldn&#8217;t be awake, I wanted to sneak out quickly!</p>
<p>With high hopes, I carefully opened the front door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome home, Vellett sama.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was awake after all&#8230;</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>The time I spent praying alone was shorter than I expected.</p>
<p>Of course I didn&#8217;t doubt everyone&#8217;s victory, but to return this quickly&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;The threat to the orphanage is gone. Don&#8217;t worry. No more people will threaten your daily life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice&#8217;s report let me breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you all so much&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eheh&#8230; Feels kinda embarrassing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My thanks aren&#8217;t needed. Pass them to Lord Ouga for hearing my request.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-Yes&#8230; Vellett sama&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>When I called to him, Vellett sama&#8217;s shoulders behind the girls shook.</p>
<p>He must have hidden himself so as not to worry me, but there&#8217;s no need for that. You did save us after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly, thank you. I don&#8217;t know how to express my gratitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I keep saying don&#8217;t mind it. I did this because I wanted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;If the whole world had Vellett sama&#8217;s kindness, how wonderful that would be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes&#8230; If my parents had been as equally loving as Vellett sama&#8230; Might I have lived without worries too?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help thinking that way.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, about what we discussed before leaving Mio&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, you&#8217;re giving me the answer.</p>
<p>I will accept it no matter what.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s love granted by someone as noble as you.</p>
<p>&#8220;My answer is that&#8211;&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Big Bro Ouga!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>As Vellett sama opened his mouth, the children who should have been asleep came into the room, cutting him off.</p>
<p>They surrounded Vellett sama at once, each yelling loudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big bro! We&#8217;ll work for the payment so don&#8217;t take money from Sis!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we promised!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take money from Sis Mio!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your promise!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;What is this about?</p>
<p>Unable to follow the conversation, I glanced at Vellett sama.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heheh&#8230; Nice timing you guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vellett sama laughed for a bit, then put his arms around the children&#8217;s shoulders, facing me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright you guys, what request did you come to me with before I slept?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We said we&#8217;d work so don&#8217;t take payment from Sis!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We said we&#8217;d properly pay so please hire us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Labor&#8217;s tough y&#8217;know. You sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! &#8216;Cause we really love Sis Mio!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Vellett sama grinned at their reaction.</p>





<p>&#8220;This is the only way we can repay you&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want Sis to be happier!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, I see. So you wanna work hard for Mio?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!!&#8221;</p>
<p>The children responded with full smiles.</p>
<p>Tears spilled from my eyes.</p>
<p>As my blurring vision, Vellett sama approached.</p>
<p>He patted my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only you didn&#8217;t notice, Mio. You&#8217;re plenty loved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; Ah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Joy welled up from the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; I was able to properly love the children.</p>
<p>And these children gave me love.</p>
<p>I see&#8230; This feeling&#8230; This is love&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sis Mio!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll work hard!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s stay together!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-Yes&#8230; Yes&#8230;! Thank you&#8230; I will too&#8230; Together always&#8230; With you all&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I embraced the children running my way.</p>
<p>Feeling the warmth in my arms, the love.</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>Heheh, that was quite the moving scene.</p>
<p>&#8230;No, it made my heart race like crazy on the inside.</p>
<p>I have to praise these guys for their excellent timing.</p>
<p>And my quick thinking to instantly process the situation mentally too.</p>
<p>Truth is, the kids had come to me beforehand.</p>
<p>Despite their age, they must have been worried.</p>
<p>I never dreamed they&#8217;d volunteer themselves like that. Nothing could be more convenient for me.</p>
<p>Of course I agreed in an instant.</p>
<p>That let Mio become aware of her own love. Those kids get to be with their beloved Mio.</p>
<p>I obtained compliant labor.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s happy, a perfect ending.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey hey, how long are you gonna cry? Get your stuff packed.&#8221;</p>
<p>After they calmed down a bit, I hit them with those first words from hell.</p>
<p>Everyone was staring blankly my way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vellett sama&#8230;? What do you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it obvious? You&#8217;ll be relocated to my homeland, the Vellett Territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Th-The Vellett Territory?!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;ll prepare housing here. Just bring your stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t trust mere lip service.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll move them to my land where they can&#8217;t run away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll also assign tutors since you&#8217;ll be studying seriously from now on, not playing. Stupid people can&#8217;t produce results.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>They seemed unable to close their gaping mouths at my fearsome declaration.</p>
<p>Being forced to study and work for me instead of playtime must be miserable for kids their age, right?</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s already decided.</p>
<p>I knew they lacked proper education with all their playtime.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t become capable like this.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll whip them into shape.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the tutors will report any escape attempts to me.</p>
<p>Mio and the rest are completely under my control now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, did I say anything strange? These are natural demands, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe it&#8217;s a wonderful judgement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heheh, seems Alice doesn&#8217;t intend to defy me this time either.</p>
<p>I helped Mio and the others this time at Alice&#8217;s request.</p>
<p>So in essence, it builds up a debt to Alice as well.</p>
<p>Things have gone precisely as planned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll arrange a carriage for pickup immediately. This is final.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;P-Please wait, Vellett sama!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm? What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just&#8230; What should I do now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, you can come along and care for the kids but&#8230; Anyway, this is a good chance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll borrow a line from my crappy boss in my past life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Figure it out yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Myself&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. Think about what you can do for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I can do for Vellett sama&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I don&#8217;t think she can argue against this but it&#8217;d be annoying to deal with if she did.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still have much to learn myself. Lessons start tomorrow too. Let&#8217;s go, Alice, Mashiro.&#8221;</p>
<p>I finished saying my piece and left the orphanage.</p>
<p>I thought I heard Mio mumbling something as I left but I pretended not to notice.</p>
<p>No use regretting asking me now.</p>
<p>In the end, defeating evil takes an even greater evil.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you do now, Ouga kun? We have time before the pickup carriage arrives right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh, right. Let&#8217;s find a cart to transport Alliban and the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how elated I feel right now.</p>
<p>Gauging Mashiro&#8217;s strength. Gaining Alliban&#8217;s and the children&#8217;s labor force.</p>
<p>I achieved both of my initial goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heheheh. Even the sun smiles upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sunlight of dawn illuminated us, as if glimpsing our brilliant future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Follow, Alice, Mashiro! My path of conquest has only just begun!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so our expedition to Inivent closed with the best possible outcome for me.</p>
<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p>Ouga doesn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Alliban! Sent by Lord Ouga Vellett&#8217;s command. Now, tell me where the punks troubling you are. I&#8217;ll take care of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t know of the future where Alliban rounds up villains from all over, improving public order, and boasts as Lord Ouga Vellett&#8217;s subordinate, rapidly raising his reputation among the commoners.</p>
<p>Ouga doesn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now everyone, let us offer prayer. To the Saint who brought us righteous judgement &#8211; Lord Ouga Vellett. We give thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Sister Mio.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pondering what she should do, fervent Mio created the Ougaism religion &#8211; Ouga meaning &#8220;fitting for a king&#8221; &#8211; along with the children to preach his nobility.</p>
<p>And the future of it spreading among the commoners in Vellett Territory. And beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heheheh! Feels great after finishing work, doesn&#8217;t it Alice, Mashiro!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly brilliant work, Lord Ouga.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really! Ouga kun&#8217;s so amazing. I&#8217;ll try my best to follow your example.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laughing loudly in the carriage, he still doesn&#8217;t known&#8217;t know&#8230;.now..</p>
