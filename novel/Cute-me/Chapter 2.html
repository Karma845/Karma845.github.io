<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; It’s Rather A Reward for You to Pamper A Girl As Cute As Me<
</h3>

<p>A night passed after my Christmas date plan started to take shape.</p><p>The school was ready in preparation for the upcoming final exam for the second term</p>. However, compared to that, I faced an even bigger problem.</p><p>“What do I do…?”</p><p>Inside the literature clubroom after school, I had my stationeries lined up on the desk, yet I didn’t even grip a pen; my hands were holding my head in worry.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Of all things, I accidentally made myself go for a confession route… This is almost the same as already confessing!</em></p><p>“What should I do to clear this misunderstanding up…”</p><p>No matter how I racked my brain, I couldn&#8217;t think of a good idea.&nbsp;</p><p>While I languished like that, my meeting with Yuzu couldn’t be delayed. The clubroom door opened, and Yuzu returned from buying drinks at the vending machine.</p><p>“Sorry for the wait, I bought coffee. Here, for you, Yamato-kun.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-88303627"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1885466471"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>“Th-Thank you.”</p><p>I awkwardly accepted the coffee and she sat opposite me, sandwiching the table between us.</p><p>“Fufu, it’ll be troublesome if we get failing marks, so let’s study properly, okay, Yamato-kun?”</p><p><em>W-whoa, she’s so hyped up.</em></p><p>As I saw Yuzu arranging her stationeries on the table while whistling cheerfully, my heart beat only sped up.</p><p>Just how could I break the truth to her in this kind of mood?</p><p>“Alright, so we’re going to study for the exam, do you have questions to ask me? This cute and smart Yuzu-chan is going to teach you. Feel free to ask me anything.”</p><p>Ugh… At this rate, I didn’t think I could even study at all. I knew for things like this, it would only be more awkward as time passed; I just had to take the plunge and speak up.</p><p>“Heyyy, Yamato-kunnn?” Yuzu leaned forward and peeked at my face, curious as to why I was keeping silent.</p><p>“Hm… Ah, sorry.”&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-902071730"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1013780160"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>I finally broke from my reverie and made an awkward smile at her.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Yuzu asked me curiously.</p><p><em>Isn’t this the chance for me to tell her the truth?</em></p><p>“Um, it’s just…there’s this problem that I have to solve no matter what.”</p><p><em>There’s no use wavering. It’s now or never!</em></p><p>“Problem? Okay. Just like I said just now, I’ll listen to all.”</p><p>“That’s… I reviewed it so many times, but I mistakenly remembered the wrong contents.”</p><p>I even bought a magazine and researched a lot about the event; but at the last moment, I ended up making such a silly mistake.</p><p>Yuzu’s face was serious as I resolutely told her my problem.</p><p>“Huh? By mistake… how much?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2017980921"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1040328706"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>“Almost all of the crucial parts.”</p><p>I never thought I had missed the part that said it was a confession event.</p><p>“All?! You mistook the whole scope?!”&nbsp;</p><p>I lowered my head at the wide-eyed Yuzu.</p><p>“Really, I’m sorry. At this rate, on the big day, the plan will only be a blank sheet<span id='easy-footnote-2-91177' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-91177' title='This is kinda a direct translation which he meant to use as an idiom that means here there’s nothing planned (for Christmas eve), but it carries on to the next line where the misunderstanding by Yuzu continues.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>.</p><p>“Blank sheet, you say…? No, why are you so resigned to getting zero marks even before the actual day!”</p><p>Certainly, I’d get zero marks as a boyfriend like this, so I said, “That’s right, so I want to fill it up somehow.”</p><p>Filling up the plan for Christmas Eve.&nbsp;</p><p>“Anyway, you can’t give up. There must be something you can do even now.”</p><p>In this situation, it was not weird even if she got mad, yet she confronted my mistake by thinking about what to do alongside me seriously.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-375933672"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-60308635"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>“Yuzu… Sorry, you even go so far just for my sake. Then, what do you think I should do?”</p><p>I decided to ask what Yuzu wanted so I could redo the plan for Christmas Eve.</p><p>“First of all, I guess it’s studying the five core subjects.”</p><p>“Studying? Of all things, studying?!”</p><p>I was so surprised at the idea of studying on Christmas Eve.</p><p>“Aside from this time, when else will you study?! Just what did you intend to do in the first place, Yamato-kun?”</p><p>“I honestly thought it would be about having fun the whole day.”</p><p>“Why?! Having fun here is ridiculous!”</p><p>“Re-Really…?”</p><p>I was only interested in Christmas game sales so far, I didn’t know nowadays it was mainstream for high schoolers to study on Christmas Eve. Was that the case…?</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-933467534"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-621238067"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“Anyway, there’s still time, we’re going to continue studying – day in, day out. You gotta have that strong mindset that insists on doing it now. The most important is <em>Shinnen</em><span id='easy-footnote-3-91177' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-91177' title='Shinnen here means Faith.

Are we going at it for that long?!”</p><p>“Of course! If you don’t have such strong determination, how can you make up for your mistake in time!”</p><p><em>Did I make that much of a mistake?</em></p><p>“No, isn’t it enough to make a plan just for a day?”</p><p>When I thought about it calmly, I was sure that I only needed to make the plan for the day of Christmas Eve.</p><p>“How can that be?! It’s crucial to accumulate your efforts in studying!”</p><p>I was certainly at fault in this matter, but I’d like to spare myself from studying all day on Christmas Eve. I needed to convince Yuzu otherwise.</p><p>“B-But, the studying we do at school will never be useful to us for this! The school will never teach us about things like this!”</p><p>“This is the exact culmination of all the studying we’ve done at school! The teachers also have been saying that in class, haven&#8217;t they?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2077790331"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-295379374"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“Huh?! If that’s the case, just what exactly they’ve been teaching up till now?!”</p><p>Those teachers must be eccentric to be bringing up the Christmas event during this important period before the exam.</p><p>“First of all, can this be fixed by studying?!” I expressed my doubt again.</p><p>“Of course! If not studying, then what?”</p><p>When Yuzu asked me, I mulled over a little and replied, “&#8230;By giving presents?”</p><p>“That’s bribery! That’s totally off limits!”</p><p>“That’ll be considered a bribe?”</p><p>It was my first time hearing that giving Christmas presents to your girlfriend equalled bribery.</p><p>“It will! In general, it&#8217;s not a wise move to try to curry favour with people with things. You have to do something with your ability.”&nbsp;</p><p>I flinched in fright when Yuzu pointed a finger at me.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-866161829"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1990985245"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“Ugk… Th-that may be right. I was wrong.”</p><p>I was thinking maybe I could make up for making her into a bad mood after clearing the misunderstanding by giving her a present, but this could be a petty way of doing it without any sincerity.</p><p>“It’s good if you could get that in your head. In cases like this, you just have to face it head-on. After all, you’d risk losing your Christmas if you get failing marks and get sent to remedial classes.</p><p>“Huh?? Haven’t we been talking about Christmas all along?” I was confused by Yuzu, who abruptly overturned the conversation we have had up to now.</p><p>“I didn’t! It’s not like we’re final year students preparing for major exams, where in the world would you find a couple studying all day long during Christmas?!”</p><p>“Yeah, right? I thought so too!”</p><p>Yuzu puffed her cheeks at my complete assent.</p><p>“Geez. Don’t talk any more nonsense, just hurry up and study. Yamato-kun, your attempts are almost as bad as not studying at all, and now you’re only wasting more time as we go on like this.”</p><p>“Nuh-uh, I&#8217;m doing well in my studies.”</p><p>“Really? Then what was all that talk just now?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1622895643"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-533335535"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“I want to ask you exactly that!”</p><p>In the end, neither of us knew what the other was talking about, and the day&#8217;s study session proceeded in confusion.</p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
<p>A few days later.</p><p>I was able to reflect on my failure during the study session and, at the same time, the school ushered in the examination period.</p><p>“Good morning, Yamato-kun!”</p><p>Yuzu walked to me, as I lingered by our usual waiting spot in the morning.</p><p>“Yo!” I lightly waved my hand in greeting and we walked together side by side.</p><p>The reason I failed to make the clarification the other day was that I started the conversation out of the blue and it ended up drifting off. So this time, I&#8217;d better get the timing right before I start the conversation.</p><p>“Ta-da! Look at this, I made this yesterday!” Yuzu took out palm-sized cards bound together by a ring. With English words on the front and Japanese translations on the back, they were a standard test-preparation item.</p><p>“Flashcards? Why? Are you not confident with English?”</p><p>The fact that she deliberately took extra measures means that she was aware that this was her weak point.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1498416880"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-260717821"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>“Just a bit. How about you, Yamato-kun?”</p><p>“Hmm… I’m not that good at it, I guess. It might be a good idea to memorise vocabulary before the exam.”</p><p>When you see people taking these kinds of measures more than you do, it can make you a bit uneasy.</p><p>Yuzu might’ve gleaned my uneasiness when she tapped my shoulder to make me relax and said, “Well, well, it’s enough for you to remember the words <strong>I love you</strong>, okay?”</p><p>“Those are words that have zero practical use for me!”</p><p>“I don’t think so. You can just say them to me anytime.”</p><p>“Okay. From now on, when I wanna bring up the topic of playing games, I’ll say ‘<strong>I love you</strong>.<strong>’</strong>”</p><p>“That’s the worst way to use it! Isn’t that how jerks are? Using the words ‘I love you’ to deceive their partners to whom they are indifferent?!”</p><p>“That’s not true,” I furtively averted my gaze.</p><p>“How suspicious…” Yuzu stared at me, but she seemed to be reminded of something as she thumped her fist on her other palm.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-443829833"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2117771693"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“Oh, right. Rather than that, after we are finished with the exams, why don’t we go somewhere and have a blast?”</p><p>“Hm? That low-key sounds like a death flag.</p><p>When I looked at her sceptically, Yuzu simply gave me a grin.</p><p>“Don’t you remember promising me to go buy a muffler together?&nbsp; We can go for that too.”</p><p>Oh, I kinda remember having made such a promise. It might raise my motivation if I anticipate something fun in the future, so there’s no reason to object.</p><p>“Well, I don’t mind… When should we go?”</p><p>“The day after the exam?</p><p>I hesitated at her suggestion.</p><p>“Mn… On that day, I plan to go buy games.”</p><p>This was my reward for surviving the exam. This, I couldn’t compromise on.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-707082254"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-684541894"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“You can buy that anytime. You also have them in your room.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu was irritated by my attitude.</p><p>“Can’t you somehow allow that? Please, Yuzu. <strong>I love you.</strong>”</p><p>“That’s the worst way to use that phrase! What are you doing, putting it into practice as soon as you can?!”</p><p><em>Tsk…</em> That didn’t work.</p><p>There was no choice. I’ll just have to put up with borrowing some games I like from the clubroom.</p><p>“Alright. I’ve promised you after all.”</p><p>When I agreed, Yuzu’s face lit up at once.</p><p>“Yay! Okay, so it’s decided. We have to work hard on our tests to ensure we have a good time celebrating later.”</p><p>“That’s right. For that, I’d like to sort out some concerns beforehand.”&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-14617672"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1402854926"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p><em>Alright, it’s now! I’ll speak out here and now!</em></p><p>“Listen here, Yuzu. Actually—”</p><p>“Um, this word…”</p><p>But a beat too late, it seemed. Yuzu had already returned her gaze to her flash cards. Apparently, thanks to the post-examination plan she had made, she was explosively motivated to study.</p><p>“Yay, I got it right. But, I want to remember it more perfectly…” Yuzu mumbled as she stared into the flash cards.</p><p>“&#8230;Hey.”</p><p>I tugged her arm and plopped her into my chest.</p><p>“Kyah! What are you doing so suddenly? You want to cuddle? If that’s the case, I’m sorry for being so cute,” Yuzu’s eyes widened as she said that while not forgetting her spirit of narcissism.</p><p>Speechless as I was, I only pointed to the electric pole right in front of her.</p><p>“It’s good to be passionate about studying, but look in front. Ninomiya Kinjiro is no longer in fashion in this era.</p><p>A prominent 19th-century Japanese agricultural leader, philosopher, moralist and economist. A symbol of self-education, his statues are usually erected at schools, depicted to be reading while hauling a load of firewood. If I’m not mistaken, there have been some voices who found the statue as a bad example to kids who might not be aware of their surroundings when walking, like all the reminders not to look at smartphones while walking. So, in recent years, there are some statues that show him reading while sitting down instead.</p>
<p>If I hadn’t stopped her, she would have hit the pole head-on.</p><p>Yuzu seemed to realise her mistake, so her face went sullen as she said, “Whoa, that was dangerous. It’ll be a loss to the world if my face were to be injured. So close!”</p><p>“No doubt the world will suffer no loss in any way, but be careful!”</p><p>When I scolded her with an unflinching gaze, she turned away, looking embarrassed.</p><p>“Sorry. You see, raising test scores is also an important part of maintaining my image. That was unintentional.”</p><p>When it was only the two of us, I almost forgot that this girl wore the facade of an honours student. Apparently, she was putting in more effort to excel in this exam than I had imagined.</p><p>“I know that, but if you get an injury because of this, that’s so lame.”</p><p>As I answered that, a subtle hesitation sprouted up inside me. If I were to bring up the Christmas matter right at this time to Yuzu, she would undoubtedly get upset. Following that, her performance during the exam might be affected.</p><p><em>That’s… not good. I’ll be so sorry.</em></p><p>“Oh, yes. Let’s do it like this!”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-798492682"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-884866566"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>While I was wallowing in my thoughts, I was interrupted by Yuzu who crossed her arms with mine.</p><p>“Why so sudden?!” I exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>From close proximity, Yuzu showed me her smug face as she explained, “Like this, even when I focus on my flashcards, Yamato-kun will automatically lead me away from obstacles. As expected of me, what a perfect strategy!”</p><p>“Don’t I look like a caregiver this way?”</p><p>I was somewhat embarrassed while in this pose, but I was finally resolved in my heart. For the time being, I’d wait for the exams to be over before bringing up that matter to Yuzu.&nbsp;</p><p>It somehow felt like the longer I put it off, the more this was going to be a quagmire, but I had no other choice. So, I held back my agitation and amended my course of action.</p><p>“By the way, how about you, Yamato-kun? You’re confident in this exam?”</p><p>“Um, just normal? Maybe, I’ll score just like usual.”</p><p>My grades were basically somewhere in the middle to the upper-middle range. Since I started going out with Yuzu, my grades improved a bit because I studied more with her, but even then I was a guy who didn&#8217;t have anything outstanding.</p><p>“Is that so? Just be careful not to get failing grades. If you have to attend remedial classes… the much looked forward to Christmas will come to nought.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-691479858"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1245048227"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>Her usual cheerful appearance was nowhere to be seen, Yuzu&#8217;s face flushed red, and she warned me so with a downcast look.</p><p>Sure enough, she totally believed she was going to get a love confession, right?</p><p>“Ow…Okay… I’ll do my best.”</p><p><em>Oh no! What a complicated feeling! I feel like I&#8217;m being crushed by some strange guilt! I feel like I need to take back my resolve and clear up this misunderstanding right now!</em></p><p>However, if that resulted in jeopardising Yuzu’s grades… <em>Ugh.</em></p><p>“Alright. I’m looking forward to Christmas. I’ll do my best at studying too!” Yuzu displayed her motivation with a refreshing smile.</p><p><em>Seriously… someone, helppp!</em></p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
<p>After we arrived at school, we had no time to cool down before we sat for our final exam. The morning exam papers were not exactly difficult or easy; just like usual, I’d say.</p><p>“Phew, we somehow made it past the morning papers. Yamato-kun, do you think you can score well?”</p><p>It was lunch break in the literature clubroom. Yuzu let out a relaxed sigh with her lunchbox spread open on the desk in front of her.</p><p>“Thankfully there were no killer subjects. But I can’t be careless, there’s still more in the afternoon.”</p><p>I sat facing Yuzu and also ate my lunch.</p><p>“That’s right. We’re still midway.”</p><p>“Yeah. Let’s quickly eat lunch. I’ll be anxious if I don’t study for the afternoon exam papers.”</p><p>I ate at a faster pace than usual, yet Yuzu was even faster than me; she had already closed her lunchbox.</p><p>“Thanks for the meal!” Yuzu had finished her meal.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-873969622"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1127609082">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“You’re done eating? I did say we gotta eat quickly, but did you wolf down your food?”</p><p>Yuzu pouted when I asked, astonished.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s so rude. It’s just that I only prepared a little lunch. That way, I won’t be sleepy during the afternoon exams.”</p><p>“I see, that makes sense,” I agreed and finished my lunch as usual. An empty stomach wouldn’t do for going to battle.</p><p>After both of us were done with lunch, I stored my lunchbox in my bag and took out a textbook instead.</p><p>“Well then, shall we study for the afternoon exam papers?” I suggested.</p><p>“Mn… I think I’ll pass.”&nbsp;</p><p>In response to me spreading out a textbook, Yuzu shook her head as she sipped her tea.</p><p>“Wow, so chill? In the morning, you even pressed me so hard to study.” I was stunned.</p><p>“No-no. Taking a break is also part of the studying process. Having exerted myself all morning, it’s easy to get tired in the afternoon. If I cram hard during the lunch break too, I&#8217;d lose my concentration in the middle of the day.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-483915887"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1123609809"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>I agreed, “I see, so it’s vital to take breaks when needed.”</p><p>After all, when it came to studying and exams, this disguised honours student Yuzu seemed to have the upper hand, and from earlier on I had been able to hear some rather helpful opinions.</p><p>“That’s correct. Therefore, I&#8217;m taking my break properly.”</p><p>As soon as she said it, Yuzu stood up and shifted next to me, taking a chair with her.</p><p>“With that said, please pamper me so that I can be soothed,” Yuzu abruptly made that request as she took a seat beside me.</p><p>“I want to be soothed as well…” I lamented.</p><p>“That’s why you can soothe yourself by pampering me. It’s a win-win.”</p><p>“Where is that win-win?”</p><p>I cut my eyes at Yuzu, who clapped her hands as if what she had said was a nice idea.</p><p>“In general, what do you want me to do when you say pamper you?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1894551223"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1972449768"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>When asked, Yuzu growled a little, and then struck her hand with a plop.</p><p>“Hmm… Then, please talk sweetly right next to my ear.”</p><p>“Leave it to me! Sugar, honey, granulated sugar, Wasanbon sugar—”</p><p>“Not that kind of sweet! What&#8217;s with that old-fashion joke? So tacky!”</p><p>“Sweets sure are tacky.”<span id='easy-footnote-1-91184' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-91184' title='The word pun here is べた=cliche and べたべた=tacky as in sticky'><sup>1</sup></a></span>”</p><p>“Ridiculous! Don’t think you just came up with a smooth line.”</p><p>Despite having responded to Yuzu&#8217;s request with sincerity, for some reason she was still upset. It was a mystery.</p><p>“Geez… I’ve pampered you so much, yet why are you treating me so harshly?” Yuzu complained in agitation.</p><p>There, I stopped her, “Wait a moment, I never remember being pampered by you at all?”</p><p>“I did, a lot. I gave you my lap pillow in the clubroom… And then I even picked your ear while you lay on my lap.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-269392760"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-39911970"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“Only that lap pillow? But wait, neither of those things can really be considered pampering me, can they??”</p><p>I did not even request any of that, they were random turns of events.</p><p>“Ah, right. Then, how about you give me a lap pillow?”</p><p>Where did that ‘then’ come from? Yuzu came up with nonsense yet again.</p><p>“Ehhhh…” I sounded my protest.</p><p>“Come on, hurry up! The precious lunch break is about to be over!” When I showed my reluctance, Yuzu urged me, using the remaining time as a bargaining chip.</p><p>I certainly didn&#8217;t want to lose time by continuing with this argument. I let out a sigh and pulled back my chair to make room for my thighs.</p><p>“What do I do with you… Come here.”</p><p>“YAY!”</p><p>I wondered what was so good about having a man’s lap as a pillow, but Yuzu laid there happily.</p><
<p>Um… Something about this tickled me physically and mentally.</p><p>“Geez… Didn&#8217;t you say at first that you&#8217;re a tough lady and that you don&#8217;t want any close contact with me?”</p><p>I quoted Yuzu&#8217;s words from the past<span id='easy-footnote-2-91184' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-91184' title='Honestly I forgot how I translated this part back then.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>, but she turned her head to look up at me with a blank face.</p><p>“Even now, I&#8217;m still a tough lady. It&#8217;s just that Yamato-kun&#8217;s attacking power broke through my defences.”</p><p>“I don&#8217;t remember attacking you though…”</p><p>I was a pacifist who doesn&#8217;t have any means of aggression against the opposite sex as far as I knew.</p><p>“You have no awareness, yet you broke down my walls? Ah, I know, this is something like when they say ‘Eh, did I do something?’”</p><p>“Where did you even learn that? Your defences are only paper-thin, you know?”</p><p>Yuzu pouted when I stared at her, dumbfounded as I was.</p><p>“What did you say? I’m so popular, you know. I’m just an invulnerable woman who rejects such advances.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1505996315"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2117315422"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>“Your taste in men is just bad.”</p><p>“What&#8217;s with that twisted self-deprecation? Well, instead of having no defence, I have high striking power. Thanks to that, Yamato-kun is in love with me.”</p><p>“Hey, listen—”</p><p><em>Who’s head over heels for… </em>That was what I was going to retort as usual, but my words stopped before they could be voiced out.</p><p>I knew we were simply having an idle chat, but it was quite a sensitive period, and there was also that Christmas matter.</p><p>&nbsp;A slight pause was created when I was concerned over whether objecting to Yuzu right now would make her upset or something. Obviously, Yuzu didn’t miss this pause.</p><p>“Eh? So, you don’t object? I see, hehe… Well, of course. No need to say already.”</p><p>I thought she would tease me back, but contrary to my expectation, Yuzu averted her gaze and her face flushed red.</p><p><em>Hey! Doesn’t this just make the misunderstanding even deeper? It’s better if she teases me instead!</em></p><p>“No, I don’t mean that…”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1846389747"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1675987754">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>I was reeling from the fact that the situation had worsened at an unexpected time, and my teeth clenched. My state only further convinced Yuzu that she was right and she too became thoughtfully silent in some way.</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><p><em>What to do? So awkward.</em></p><p>“Listen to me, Yamato-kun.”</p><p>“Oh, yes.”&nbsp;</p><p>When Yuzu broke the silence, I unconsciously corrected my posture and responded.</p><p>“&#8230;If Aki’s confession turns out well during Christmas eve, our fake couple also comes to an end, right?”</p><p>“Well, I guess so.”</p><p>I had completely forgotten, but that was how it was supposed to be.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2091124781"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1037386963"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“In that case… Will you pamper me again like this afterwards?”</p><p>Yuzu&#8217;s somewhat fiery eyes shot through me. I was almost sucked in by that, but still I nodded mechanically.</p><p>“Oh, okay. Well, it’s the same as when we broke up before.”</p><p>I tried to muddle things up, yet Yuzu didn’t allow me to escape the issue. She grabbed my clothes tightly and tried to pull me closer.</p><p>“Not like before… But more, and ever after.”</p><p>Suddenly I got scared.</p><p>If I cleared the misunderstanding in our current situation… We could no longer be able to go back to the way things were before.</p><p>“Yeah…” I naturally nodded.</p><p>I wondered how it’d be if the misunderstanding was cleared.</p><p><em>Hm, is there even a meaning to clear it now we’ve got this far—</em></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-942677948"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-261438614"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>“Right! Well, it’s rather a reward for you to pamper a girl as cute as me! Aww, Yamato, you are a truly blessed man!”</p><p>“Don’t get carried away, narcissist!”</p><p><em>Sure enough, the misunderstanding must be cleared. Totally. Without a doubt.</em></p><p>During that lunch break, my resolve hardened once again.</p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
<p>And then, school ended for the day.</p><p>Worn out by the double punch of the test and the unresolved misunderstanding, I went to get a sweet café au lait from a vending machine near the cafeteria before heading to the literature club room.</p><p>“Oh no, at this rate, I’ll develop a stomach ulcer from stress…”</p><p>My situation had produced a sort of Zen-like state, in which feelings of wanting to say something but not being able to say it was mixed with a state of needing to say it but not having the courage to say it. In fact, it definitely would become more awkward as time went on, so it was imperative for me to come up with some kind of plan.</p><p>“Oh, Yamato?” As I was brooding by myself, someone unexpectedly called my name.</p><p>I looked up and there she was, Hina in a jersey.</p><p>“Yo, Hina! Are you heading to a self-practice session?” I lightly waved to respond and she trotted over to me.</p><p>“Yep. I forgot my sports drink, so I’m about to go buy it. How about you?”</p><p>“I’m mulling over something here…” I answered with a faint sigh.</p><p>Hina looked concerned and peeked into my face, “By any chance, is this about Christmas?”</p><p>Hina, who had known me for a long time, could easily see through the dilemma inside my heart.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1337387359"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-182415269"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p>“Well…”</p><p>“What? You still haven’t addressed that matter?” Perhaps astonished at how slow I was, Hina snorted.</p><p>That was understandable, but I had my own reason which I preferred not to speak aloud.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, Yuzu took a liking to that event. I can&#8217;t bring myself to say the truth.”</p><p>“I see, that’s a problem. It’d be pitiful to make her disappointed.” Hina nodded and displayed her sympathy towards my dilemma.</p><p>“So, it’s like that. But I&#8217;d like to clear up the misunderstanding somehow. Is there any good way to do that?” I asked Hina for advice, extremely desperate.</p><p>“Just count on me, I have a nice idea.”</p><p>“Really? Tell me in detail,” I instantly caught her bait as I was so encouraged by the strangely confident Hina.</p><p>“In a time like this, ‘By other&#8217;s faults, wise men correct their own’.”</p><p>“What do you mean by that?” My head tilted in puzzlement. I couldn’t comprehend her words.</p><p>“It’s a simple tactic. First, you should bring up a story of someone who suffered due to an uncleared misunderstanding. When Nanamine-san hears that, what will she think?”</p><p>“Well, obviously she’ll say it’s that person’s fault for leaving the misunderstanding unaddressed… Oh, so you mean it like that.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-812912095"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1607634771"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_4/home_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22210777382"></div></div></div><p>I got the gist while I was in the middle of answering Hina, and she nodded at me with a smile.</p><p>“Yes. Let her think that it’s bad to leave a misunderstanding unaddressed and make her feel positive about this action. That’s the important thing.”</p><p>“What a good tactic. By the way, what kind of story will work?”</p><p>It was weird to ask for guidance from someone who used to be a complete introvert, but well, too late to say that now.</p><p>“Hmm, if it were me, I’d speak about how I had always misunderstood Yamato as an unfriendly and boring person, but it turns out you are somewhat fun to be with. What a loss! Something like that?”</p><p>“Did any misunderstanding get cleared there?! Compared to the wound I received, so little of my honour is restored!”</p><p>She was in no way convincing. As I thought, an introvert&#8217;s thinking was a bit far afield.</p><p>“If we talk about something like this, Nanamine would also take away the idea that it is important to clear up misunderstandings, wouldn&#8217;t she?”</p><p>“There’s nothing to take away in that story at all!”</p><p>To my protests, Hina chuckled and placated me, “Calm down. You’re going to have to suck it up a bit as you wade into the problem. You see, just take it like paying tax.”</p><p>&nbsp;“This tax is so heavy it could incite a revolution!”</p><p>And the return for the price I paid would be so low!</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-238479480"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2126580640"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p>Perhaps sensing that her own theory was not resonating with me at all, Hina put her hand on her jaw as if to reconsider again.</p><p>“Then, how about: ‘I thought Yamato was normally a bright and good person, but actually he’s unsociable and not friendly. What a misunderstanding!’”</p><p>“That would paint me in such a negative light! After clearing that misunderstanding, that story would only lead to despair!”</p><p>“Eh? In my case, I thought it painted you in a positive light.” ”</p><p>“You are a super rare case! Ah, don’t you have a more normal example?”</p><p>Hina was stumped while I was at my wit’s end.&nbsp;</p><p>But then her expression brightened as she suggested, “Ah, if speaking from your experience, how about telling her how you had a misunderstanding about your classmate who always hide her face with her bangs, but it turned out that she actually has a cute face once the bangs&nbsp; were put up in a hairclip?”</p><p>That was indeed my real experience and very easy to understand.</p><p>“&#8230;” Hina stood silent for quite a while.</p><p>​​While I was excited by the long-awaited decent example, Hina had a complicated expression for some reason.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>When asked, she gently covered her face with her palms.</p>

<p>“It’s embarrassing to say it so by myself…”</p><p>“You self-destructed<span id='easy-footnote-1-91189' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-91189' title='I don’t know, this word kinda doesn’t make sense in English.

Why did you even tell me that?!”</p><p>“I was waiting for you to retort…”</p><p>“Ah, sorry! My circumstances made me get used to narcissists!”</p><p>Yes, if you think about it, this was a normal human reaction!</p><p>I felt so bad to have let Hina, who had the courage to try to lighten the situation, die in embarrassment.</p><p>“Hah… Don’t think too hard, just find a time when she’s in a good mood and just keep apologizing.”</p><p>“So thoughtless! I’m sorry I made you so dispirited!”</p><p>When I saw Hina’s face again, it was flushed red. It’d be cruel to continue this conversation.</p><p>“An-Anyway… You gave me many references. I&#8217;ll try this and that.”</p><p>“Okay… Then, I’ll go first.”</p><p>As I wrapped up the conversation, Hina bought a sports drink and headed to the gymnasium, looking utterly drained.&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2036076748"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1091729848"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p><em>She&#8217;s about to have a self-practice, but can she handle being that worn out?</em></p><p>“I’m in no position to worry about someone else, I have to do something about my own affairs.”</p><p>After tossing the can of café au lait I had finished drinking into the bin, I decided to buy a can of coffee for Yuzu and headed to the literature club room.</p>
 
  <p><br /></p>
  
<p>Despite the damage done to Hina&#8217;s spirit in many ways, putting Yuzu in a positive frame of mind about clearing up the misunderstanding was certainly a good idea. Furthermore, there was also the additional trick of finding the time when she was in a good mood.&nbsp;</p><p>Did I say I’d hold off on addressing this matter until after the exam? I lied. My resolve may have wavered now and then, but I’d try giving it a shot in any way I could.</p><p>I snuck through the corridor of the club building and opened the lock of the literature club room.</p><p>“Yo! Sorry for keeping you waiting!” I smiled as much as I could and greeted Yuzu, who had started studying inside.</p><p>“&#8230;I didn’t wait for you,” she answered, but she only took a glance at me and immediately returned her eyes to her notebook.</p><p>Her mood was so bad that I could tell from her short reply; the plan given to me by Hina was half-crushed within five seconds of entering the room.</p><p>“Um… Yuzu-san? Did something happen?”&nbsp;</p><p>I unknowingly applied the polite suffix when calling her, and she raised her face towards me.</p><p>She then took out her smartphone and silently showed me the display. On it was a photo of Hina and me talking in front of a vending machine—</p><p>“TH-This is…?!”&nbsp;</p><p>I was flustered and Yuzu’s stare sharpened on me.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-37923211"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-756523578"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p>“My friend coincidentally saw this and sent it to me, you know! I’d wondered where you’ve gone, not coming to the clubroom. And there you were, having a secret rendezvous!”</p><p>Oh no, I’d underestimated her connections!</p><p>“So, care to explain?!”</p><p>“It-It’s a misunderstanding! Honestly, nothing like that happened!”</p><p>What a mess! I had thought of clearing a misunderstanding only to create another!&nbsp;</p><p>Wait a moment! The present me could use that principle of ‘By other&#8217;s faults, wise men correct their own’! By putting this to use, wouldn’t both misunderstandings get cleared in one go?!</p><p>“Anyway, calm down, Yuzu. Please listen to me.”</p><p>“Heh… So you’re going to make excuses. Alright, I’ll listen.” Yuzu was miffed when I tried to justify myself, but she toned down her anger a little.</p><p>Alright, here was my chance to pop out some good analogies and teach her the magnificence of clearing misunderstandings.</p><p>“Look, it&#8217;s very damaging to keep a misunderstanding unaddressed. I once knew a girl in my class who was hiding her face with her bangs, so I gave her a hairpin. When I saw her face, which was surprisingly cute, it made a big difference to my impression of her. It&#8217;s important to clear up misunderstandings like this.”</p><p>“Isn’t that Hiiragi-san?! You’re telling me that lovey-dovey story right now? You have no intention of clearing any misunderstanding, do you?!”</p><p>“Huh? Could it be that I made a mistake in choosing an analogy?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1927926309"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1490355552"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_4/home_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22210777382"></div></div></div><p>“BIG MISTAKE!”</p><p>O-oh, this happened on the spur of the moment, so I went straight for the best analogy I&#8217;d heard earlier, but it seemed to backfire on me.</p><p>“Isn’t this enough to identify you as cheating?! Yamato, you cheater! Idiot!”</p><p>“Wait a minute! Seriously!” Having completely dug my grave, I hurriedly continued my defence.</p><p>In the end, that day I was so desperate to clear up the newly created misunderstanding that I didn&#8217;t mention the Christmas misunderstanding at all.</p><p>===</p><p>I was standing in front of the station on a weekday afternoon wearing casual clothes.</p><p>“&#8230;I really should do something about it soon.”</p><p>With deep determination, I waited for Yuzu in front of the station.</p><p>Starting today, it was our exam holiday.&nbsp;</p><p>Those long exams were finally over and it should’ve been okay even if I didn’t consider making her upset or whatnot. Also, the abominable cheating scandal was dispelled and there were no other worries.</p><p>“&#8230;It&#8217;s finally time to settle the issue,” I gritted my teeth as I said this, urging myself to be fully ready.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-665064458"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1689171248"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_5/home_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777379"></div></div></div><p>Today was the day we got back our exam papers, so school was only a half day.&nbsp;</p><p>And we were going on a date to fulfil my promise to Yuzu to go shopping for a muffler. Also my last and best chance to clear up the misunderstanding.</p><p>“Though I said that… Quite a while has passed and now it’s even more difficult to bring up this matter.”</p><p>Above all, along with the passing of time, some doubts had also been born; did Yuzu really understand the meaning behind the ‘Christmas Fulfilment’ event or not?</p><p>“It&#8217;s also possible that she doesn&#8217;t know the original meaning as I did before…”</p><p>In that case, my action of clearing up the misunderstanding itself would just be me ineffectually spinning my wheels. Thus, I must first ascertain Yuzu&#8217;s true intentions for this event.</p><p>“Ah, Yamato-kun! Sorry I made you wait~”</p><p>At the same time as I decided once again what I was going to do, Yuzu came running. She was dressed in a white knee-length dress, a grey coat, and black stockings.</p><p>“Oh, ay.” I was strangely nervous and I greeted her awkwardly.</p><p>“Anything wrong, Yamato-kun?”</p><p>My nervousness seemed to be something that Yuzu—an expert in attentiveness—could easily see through, and she peeked at me suspiciously.</p><p>“Mm, no-nothing.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-725666281"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1063792821"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p>“It doesn’t look like there’s nothing, though?” Yuzu closely scrutinised my face.</p><p>F-for the time being, let’s just gloss things over. I’d like to tell her myself on my own terms rather than the misunderstanding be unknowingly exposed.</p><p>“I-I’m okay. It’s just my standing-in-front-of-the-station allergy that flared up.”</p><p>“My first time hearing of that illness.”&nbsp;</p><p>That was a super illogical excuse! I took a deep breath and calmed myself down.</p><p>“Phew… Sorry, really, it’s nothing. I was just bothered by my performance in the exam.”</p><p>When I used an excuse that was just right for our situation, Yuzu nodded her head in agreement.</p><p>“Oh, so that’s it. I thought you&#8217;d overdosed on my cuteness and gone mental.”</p><p>“That worry is ridiculous, though.” That was a dangerous fear that only a narcissist could have.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, we would go nowhere if we only stood still here.</p><p>“So, let’s go buy the muffler?” I brought up the purpose of our date, yet Yuzu showed a slightly thinking face.</p><p>“Mmmn… That’s okay too, but this is also to celebrate the end of our exams, so I’d like to go around to other places before that. It has been quite a while since I last came here, and I bet you also want to stroll around to show off your cute girlfriend.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1220093943"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-579071767"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_3/home_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777376"></div></div></div><p>“Thanks for your consideration but you totally got that wrong. But well, I also agree to randomly go somewhere else first.”</p><p>It might be easier to broach the subject while strolling rather than when she’s focused on choosing mufflers.</p><p>“So, it’s set. Let’s go!”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Like that, we walked side by side.</p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
<p>And then, school ended for the day.</p><p>Worn out by the double punch of the test and the unresolved misunderstanding, I went to get a sweet café au lait from a vending machine near the cafeteria before heading to the literature club room.</p><p>“Oh no, at this rate, I’ll develop a stomach ulcer from stress…”</p><p>My situation had produced a sort of Zen-like state, in which feelings of wanting to say something but not being able to say it was mixed with a state of needing to say it but not having the courage to say it.

Tell me in detail,” I instantly caught her bait as I was so encouraged by the strangely confident Hina.</p><p>“In a time like this, ‘By other&#8217;s faults, wise men correct their own’.”</p><p>“What do you mean by that?” My head tilted in puzzlement. I couldn’t comprehend her words.</p><p>“It’s a simple tactic. First, you should bring up a story of someone who suffered due to an uncleared misunderstanding. When Nanamine-san hears that, what will she think?”</p><p>“Well, obviously she’ll say it’s that person’s fault for leaving the misunderstanding unaddressed… Oh, so you mean it like that.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-812912095"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1607634771"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_4/home_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22210777382"></div></div></div><p>I got the gist while I was in the middle of answering Hina, and she nodded at me with a smile.</p><p>“Yes. Let her think that it’s bad to leave a misunderstanding unaddressed and make her feel positive about this action. That’s the important thing.”</p><p>“What a good tactic. By the way, what kind of story will work?”</p><p>It was weird to ask for guidance from someone who used to be a complete introvert, but well, too late to say that now.</p><p>“Hmm, if it were me, I’d speak about how I had always misunderstood Yamato as an unfriendly and boring person, but it turns out you are somewhat fun to be with. What a loss! Something like that?”</p><p>“Did any misunderstanding get cleared there?! Compared to the wound I received, so little of my honour is restored!”</p><p>She was in no way convincing. As I thought, an introvert&#8217;s thinking was a bit far afield.</p><p>“If we talk about something like this, Nanamine would also take away the idea that it is important to clear up misunderstandings, wouldn&#8217;t she?”</p><p>“There’s nothing to take away in that story at all!”</p><p>To my protests, Hina chuckled and placated me, “Calm down. You’re going to have to suck it up a bit as you wade into the problem. You see, just take it like paying tax.”</p><p>&nbsp;“This tax is so heavy it could incite a revolution!”</p><p>And the return for the price I paid would be so low!</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-238479480"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2126580640"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p>Perhaps sensing that her own theory was not resonating with me at all, Hina put her hand on her jaw as if to reconsider again.</p><p>“Then, how about: ‘I thought Yamato was normally a bright and good person, but actually he’s unsociable and not friendly. What a misunderstanding!’”</p><p>“That would paint me in such a negative light! After clearing that misunderstanding, that story would only lead to despair!”</p><p>“Eh? In my case, I thought it painted you in a positive light.” ”</p><p>“You are a super rare case! Ah, don’t you have a more normal example?”</p><p>Hina was stumped while I was at my wit’s end.&nbsp;</p><p>But then her expression brightened as she suggested, “Ah, if speaking from your experience, how about telling her how you had a misunderstanding about your classmate who always hide her face with her bangs, but it turned out that she actually has a cute face once the bangs&nbsp; were put up in a hairclip?”</p><p>That was indeed my real experience and very easy to understand.</p><p>“&#8230;” Hina stood silent for quite a while.</p><p>​​While I was excited by the long-awaited decent example, Hina had a complicated expression for some reason.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>When asked, she gently covered her face with her palms.</p>

Why did you even tell me that?!”</p><p>“I was waiting for you to retort…”</p><p>“Ah, sorry! My circumstances made me get used to narcissists!”</p><p>Yes, if you think about it, this was a normal human reaction!</p><p>I felt so bad to have let Hina, who had the courage to try to lighten the situation, die in embarrassment.</p><p>“Hah… Don’t think too hard, just find a time when she’s in a good mood and just keep apologizing.”</p><p>“So thoughtless! I’m sorry I made you so dispirited!”</p><p>When I saw Hina’s face again, it was flushed red. It’d be cruel to continue this conversation.</p><p>“An-Anyway… You gave me many references. I&#8217;ll try this and that.”</p><p>“Okay… Then, I’ll go first.”</p><p>As I wrapped up the conversation, Hina bought a sports drink and headed to the gymnasium, looking utterly drained.&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-2036076748"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1091729848"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p><em>She&#8217;s about to have a self-practice, but can she handle being that worn out?</em></p><p>“I’m in no position to worry about someone else, I have to do something about my own affairs.”</p><p>After tossing the can of café au lait I had finished drinking into the bin, I decided to buy a can of coffee for Yuzu and headed to the literature club room.</p>
 
  <p><br /></p>
  
<p>Despite the damage done to Hina&#8217;s spirit in many ways, putting Yuzu in a positive frame of mind about clearing up the misunderstanding was certainly a good idea. Furthermore, there was also the additional trick of finding the time when she was in a good mood.&nbsp;</p><p>Did I say I’d hold off on addressing this matter until after the exam? I lied. My resolve may have wavered now and then, but I’d try giving it a shot in any way I could.</p><p>I snuck through the corridor of the club building and opened the lock of the literature club room.</p><p>“Yo! Sorry for keeping you waiting!” I smiled as much as I could and greeted Yuzu, who had started studying inside.</p><p>“&#8230;I didn’t wait for you,” she answered, but she only took a glance at me and immediately returned her eyes to her notebook.</p><p>Her mood was so bad that I could tell from her short reply; the plan given to me by Hina was half-crushed within five seconds of entering the room.</p><p>“Um… Yuzu-san? Did something happen?”&nbsp;</p><p>I unknowingly applied the polite suffix when calling her, and she raised her face towards me.</p><p>She then took out her smartphone and silently showed me the display. On it was a photo of Hina and me talking in front of a vending machine—</p><p>“TH-This is…?!”&nbsp;</p><p>I was flustered and Yuzu’s stare sharpened on me.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-37923211"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-756523578"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p>“My friend coincidentally saw this and sent it to me, you know! I’d wondered where you’ve gone, not coming to the clubroom. And there you were, having a secret rendezvous!”</p><p>Oh no, I’d underestimated her connections!</p><p>“So, care to explain?!”</p><p>“It-It’s a misunderstanding! Honestly, nothing like that happened!”</p><p>What a mess! I had thought of clearing a misunderstanding only to create another!&nbsp;</p><p>Wait a moment! The present me could use that principle of ‘By other&#8217;s faults, wise men correct their own’! By putting this to use, wouldn’t both misunderstandings get cleared in one go?!</p><p>“Anyway, calm down, Yuzu. Please listen to me.”</p><p>“Heh… So you’re going to make excuses. Alright, I’ll listen.” Yuzu was miffed when I tried to justify myself, but she toned down her anger a little.</p><p>Alright, here was my chance to pop out some good analogies and teach her the magnificence of clearing misunderstandings.</p><p>“Look, it&#8217;s very damaging to keep a misunderstanding unaddressed. I once knew a girl in my class who was hiding her face with her bangs, so I gave her a hairpin. When I saw her face, which was surprisingly cute, it made a big difference to my impression of her. It&#8217;s important to clear up misunderstandings like this.”</p><p>“Isn’t that Hiiragi-san?! You’re telling me that lovey-dovey story right now? You have no intention of clearing any misunderstanding, do you?!”</p><p>“Huh? Could it be that I made a mistake in choosing an analogy?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1927926309"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1490355552"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_4/home_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22210777382"></div></div></div><p>“BIG MISTAKE!”</p><p>O-oh, this happened on the spur of the moment, so I went straight for the best analogy I&#8217;d heard earlier, but it seemed to backfire on me.</p><p>“Isn’t this enough to identify you as cheating?! Yamato, you cheater! Idiot!”</p><p>“Wait a minute! Seriously!” Having completely dug my grave, I hurriedly continued my defence.</p><p>In the end, that day I was so desperate to clear up the newly created misunderstanding that I didn&#8217;t mention the Christmas misunderstanding at all.</p><p>===</p><p>I was standing in front of the station on a weekday afternoon wearing casual clothes.</p><p>“&#8230;I really should do something about it soon.”</p><p>With deep determination, I waited for Yuzu in front of the station.</p><p>Starting today, it was our exam holiday.&nbsp;</p><p>Those long exams were finally over and it should’ve been okay even if I didn’t consider making her upset or whatnot. Also, the abominable cheating scandal was dispelled and there were no other worries.</p><p>“&#8230;It&#8217;s finally time to settle the issue,” I gritted my teeth as I said this, urging myself to be fully ready.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-665064458"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1689171248"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_5/home_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777379"></div></div></div><p>Today was the day we got back our exam papers, so school was only a half day.&nbsp;</p><p>And we were going on a date to fulfil my promise to Yuzu to go shopping for a muffler. Also my last and best chance to clear up the misunderstanding.</p><p>“Though I said that… Quite a while has passed and now it’s even more difficult to bring up this matter.”</p><p>Above all, along with the passing of time, some doubts had also been born; did Yuzu really understand the meaning behind the ‘Christmas Fulfilment’ event or not?</p><p>“It&#8217;s also possible that she doesn&#8217;t know the original meaning as I did before…”</p><p>In that case, my action of clearing up the misunderstanding itself would just be me ineffectually spinning my wheels. Thus, I must first ascertain Yuzu&#8217;s true intentions for this event.</p><p>“Ah, Yamato-kun! Sorry I made you wait~”</p><p>At the same time as I decided once again what I was going to do, Yuzu came running. She was dressed in a white knee-length dress, a grey coat, and black stockings.</p><p>“Oh, ay.” I was strangely nervous and I greeted her awkwardly.</p><p>“Anything wrong, Yamato-kun?”</p><p>My nervousness seemed to be something that Yuzu—an expert in attentiveness—could easily see through, and she peeked at me suspiciously.</p><p>“Mm, no-nothing.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-725666281"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1063792821"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p>“It doesn’t look like there’s nothing, though?” Yuzu closely scrutinised my face.</p><p>F-for the time being, let’s just gloss things over. I’d like to tell her myself on my own terms rather than the misunderstanding be unknowingly exposed.</p><p>“I-I’m okay. It’s just my standing-in-front-of-the-station allergy that flared up.”</p><p>“My first time hearing of that illness.”&nbsp;</p><p>That was a super illogical excuse! I took a deep breath and calmed myself down.</p><p>“Phew… Sorry, really, it’s nothing. I was just bothered by my performance in the exam.”</p><p>When I used an excuse that was just right for our situation, Yuzu nodded her head in agreement.</p><p>“Oh, so that’s it. I thought you&#8217;d overdosed on my cuteness and gone mental.”</p><p>“That worry is ridiculous, though.” That was a dangerous fear that only a narcissist could have.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, we would go nowhere if we only stood still here.</p><p>“So, let’s go buy the muffler?” I brought up the purpose of our date, yet Yuzu showed a slightly thinking face.</p><p>“Mmmn… That’s okay too, but this is also to celebrate the end of our exams, so I’d like to go around to other places before that. It has been quite a while since I last came here, and I bet you also want to stroll around to show off your cute girlfriend.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1220093943"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-579071767"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_3/home_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777376"></div></div></div><p>“Thanks for your consideration but you totally got that wrong. But well, I also agree to randomly go somewhere else first.”</p><p>It might be easier to broach the subject while strolling rather than when she’s focused on choosing mufflers.</p><p>“So, it’s set. Let’s go!”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Like that, we walked side by side.</p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
<p>“Do you have anywhere you wanna go?”</p><p>“Let’s see, celebration calls for a karaoke session, don’t you think?” Yuzu casually made such a suggestion.</p><p>In response, I made a serious face and told her the world’s absolute truth.</p><p>“Listen, Yuzu. Introverts are creatures that don’t go to karaoke.”</p><p>“Huh, why?” The extrovert Yuzu was stunned as if I just said something totally unexpected.</p><p>“It&#8217;s hard to sing in front of a lot of people, you know? And of course, we don&#8217;t have our own go-to songs because we don&#8217;t usually sing at karaoke, and that makes it even harder to go to karaoke.”</p><p>&#8220;What a vicious cycle. No one listens to other people&#8217;s songs as much as you think, Yamato-kun. They&#8217;re concentrating on choosing their own songs. You’re too self-conscious.”</p><p>“What? With all of that excitement… it&#8217;s actually such a lonely isolated activity?”</p><p>In the past, before I had awakened as an introvert, I used to go to karaoke normally too; even though other people were singing, I would try my hardest to keep the excitement high. Had it been suffocating for me because I’d tried so hard to do that all for nothing?</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1139950452"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-97330913"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>“I think I just realised the harsh truth… Ugh, I even unnecessarily recalled my black history.”</p><p>Having remembered my painful past of spinning my own wheels, I was slightly depressed.</p><p>“Hey there, don&#8217;t be so morose in the first few minutes of our date.”</p><p>“That’s my first time hearing someone use the word ‘morose’ aside from funeral-related matters.”</p><p>It appeared that my grave mood would be more at home at a funeral service.</p><p>&nbsp;“Then, how about a movie? Now that I think about it, I haven’t gone to one with Yamato-kun.”</p><p>“Well, that’s okay. I like movies too,” I stood up straight and regained my spirits, thinking that this was not the way to go on a date.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing this, perhaps satisfied, Yuzu also brightened her expression.</p><p>“Alright, so a movie it is! Then, let’s go!” She grabbed my hand and led me to the movie theatre.</p><p><em>I’ve become used to holding hands with Yuzu naturally like a couple. </em>As that thought tickled my heart, I didn’t point out this fact and just walked at the same pace as her.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1758850916"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1838119104"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>“But then again, it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve been to the movie theatre.”</p><p>I was basically a person who streamed movies online. This was a rare case for me to step into an actual movie theatre.</p><p>“Yamato-kun, what kind of movies do you like?” Yuzu asked me on the way there.</p><p>“If I had to say, I&#8217;d say Western action movies. I like the ones with a lot of explosions.”</p><p>“I&#8217;m the same as you! If you&#8217;re going to watch it in the theatre, you’d want a flick with a powerful visual impact, right?”</p><p>I was surprised by Yuzu’s gleeful response.</p><p>“That&#8217;s quite unexpected. I thought you liked live-action shoujo manga adaptations. You know, the kind with good-looking young actors.”</p><p>“In fact, that&#8217;s the type I watch the most.”&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at her snickering at those words, I came to a realisation.</p><p>“You were accompanying friends?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1381112368"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-155864150"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>“Correct.”</p><p>As I had wondered when we were at the amusement park, it was indeed hard to be someone who cared about their facade.</p><p>“But today I’m really looking forward to it since I can probably watch my favourite type of movie.”</p><p>“Is that so? By the way, I’m in the mood of watching horror movies.”</p><p>“Sure enough, our tastes don’t match! Why would you mention horror at this time?! Didn’t you say you like action movies?!”</p><p>“No, I just thought that rather than an action movie, it would be more fun to see you being scared out of your mind by a horror movie.”</p><p>“What do you think of your girlfriend?!”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu puffed her cheeks in anger, so I chuckled in response.</p><p>“I’m just kidding. I’ll let you choose what movie to watch, so stop making that coquettish angry face.”</p><p>When I pointed that out, her face instantly lit up.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-345142018"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-478554798"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“Hoho&#8230; you&#8217;re getting better at spotting my eagerness to be cute even when I put on an angry face, Yamato-kun.”</p><p>“I can&#8217;t help feeling that I&#8217;ve developed an unnecessary observational streak.”</p><p>While talking nonsense, we reached the movie theatre. There, Yuzu bought tickets for a movie of her choice and we entered the theatre. At the same time as we sat down at our assigned seats, the lights went off.</p><p>“Whoa, we entered at just the right moment.”</p><p>I focused on the screen as I listened to her jovial voice. A few moments passed before the movie started. The content of the film was a Western-style action movie with sci-fi elements, which was totally to my liking.</p><p>My attention naturally was on the movie—but a problem arose midway.</p><p>A buff male actor and a blonde-haired actress were intertwined in a grapple… a.k.a the bed scene.</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><p><em>Aw-Awkward!</em></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-983792225"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-909804208"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>I would like to see how Yuzu was faring, but I didn&#8217;t dare look at her next to me. Meanwhile, the high-pitched moanings of the actress echoed throughout the theatre.</p><p>I was so nervous that I started to get thirsty. The juice purchased with our tickets should have been in the pocket of the armrest. With my eyes fixed on the screen, I moved my hand in search of a drink.</p><p>However, my fingertips touched Yuzu&#8217;s hand, which was on the armrest, instead of the juice.</p><p><em>*gasps*</em></p><p>“&#8230;!”</p><p>Both of us retracted our hands as if static electricity had run through them. With the reaction I just got, I found out that Yuzu was also blatantly conscious of me.</p><p><em>Eh, but wait. Doesn’t this look as if I just got carried away by the bed scene and went to grab Yuzu&#8217;s hand?</em></p><p>In this situation where a bad misunderstanding might arise, I unintentionally glanced at the person next to me. Then, in a terrible slip of a moment, our eyes met.</p><p>She stiffened with a bright red face and turned her head downwards in embarrassment.</p><p>Yes, she completely misunderstood! She must be thinking here was a pervert who got carried away by the mood of the movie and tried to initiate physical contact!</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-593162127"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2116402113"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>Since the movie was still playing on the screen, I couldn&#8217;t really explain myself, and only a feeling of helpless embarrassment floated between us. As I looked resentfully at the characters on screen who had just finished their bed scene, I just wished the movie would end as quickly as possible.</p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
<p>A few dozen minutes later.</p><p>“&#8230;That was interesting.”</p><p>“&#8230;Yeah, it really was.”</p><p>After we left the theatre, we had an absentminded conversation with almost no eye contact with each other. Perhaps due to our nervousness, we were both walking faster than usual; the distance between us widened.</p><p><em>What should I do? If we continue on like this, a new date genre—walking race date—would be created.</em></p><p>“Um, let’s enter a cafe?” I suggested to Yuzu as I pointed to a cafe I had just spotted.</p><p>Rather than getting tired by speed walking for nothing, I decided to go to a space where we both could relax physically and mentally.</p><p>“R-right.”</p><p>Yuzu was also of the same mind as me, she mechanically nodded while her eyes were still not in my direction.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1774418327"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1618605936"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>Afterwards, we entered the cafe.</p><p>“Welcome. Two people?” A cheerful female waitress greeted us.</p><p>“Yes, please.”</p><p>In response to Yuzu’s answer, the waitress made an apologetic face.</p><p>“At this time, the only seats available for two people are a couple-seat, is that okay?&#8217;</p><p><em>Couple-seat&#8230;? What&#8217;s that?</em></p><p>“Th-that&#8217;s fine&#8230; Yes.”</p><p>I had a long history of being single, so these words were unfamiliar to me, but Yuzu seemed to understand and was nodding her head while turning a little red.</p><p>“Yes, I understand. Then, please come this way.”</p><p>Following the waiter&#8217;s directions, we proceeded through the restaurant.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1866450872"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-14086896"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>Eventually, we arrived at a cosy table with a sofa for two and a low table, unlike the usual table seating.</p><p>“Uh…” I inadvertently flinched at the sight.</p><p><em>This is the couple-seat…?</em></p><p>Indeed, being able to sit closely next to each other was probably the best space for lovers. Yuzu and I had been dating for quite a while, so more or less, I was already used to some degree of contact.</p><p><em>However, again, however!</em></p><p>To be this close right after watching that bed scene, that was too much to ask!</p><p>“Le-let’s sit?” Yuzu prompted despite also feeling the same awkwardness.</p><p>In that case, I also could not wimp out here, “Ow-okay.”</p><p>The two of us took our seats in the couple-seat. At a distance where our shoulders touched one another and with the armrest gone, I could feel her even closer to me compared to when we were inside the movie theatre. Lately, this level of closeness had been common when we were in the literature clubroom, but the nervousness I experienced here was entirely on a different level.</p><p>“Err, what should we order?”</p>
<p>“O-oh, right.”</p><p>Perhaps she couldn&#8217;t stand the pause anymore, Yuzu picked up the touch screen tablet on the tabletop. In the meantime, I repeatedly told my mind and heart to calm down.</p><p>“Okay&#8230; I think I&#8217;ll have a blueberry tart and tea set. What about you, Yamato-kun?”</p><p>“Cafe latte, please.”</p><p>“Roger that. Then, I&#8217;ll order,” Yuzu nodded and ordered from the menu after I reflexively replied.</p><p>Then, we were once again left without anything to do.&nbsp;</p><p>It was Yuzu who broke the silence again, “Um, what should I say&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry about earlier? Somehow it felt like you were trying to hold my hand and I rejected you.”</p><p>Presumably, she was talking about what happened in the theatre. She thought I received a shock from her action, so she did a follow-up on that.</p><p>“Uh, no-no. I only accidentally touched you when I wanted to take the drink. On the contrary, I’m sorry for giving you the wrong idea.”</p><p>When I hurriedly made an excuse, for some reason Yuzu&#8217;s lips twitched a little in dissatisfaction.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1983551115"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-482681696"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“Hmph… It&#8217;s true that I thought it was a little too proactive for Yamato-kun, but when you say it like that, it&#8217;s kind of unsettling. I thought you were trying to use the mood to make me fall for you.&#8221;</p><p>“I haven’t reached those heights yet.”</p><p>I was about to become quite a playboy in Yuzu’s mind, so I had to make a firm correction.</p><p>“It does seem so. However, it’s not good to remain this way. You need to be serious in order to properly catch me. Since we&#8217;re here, I&#8217;ll give you a lecture today on how to catch girls.”</p><p>“Is that proper for the caught party to give a lecture? What’s this charade?”</p><p><em>Wait, in the first place, I have no such intention.</em></p><p>In fact, it seemed to me that I was being directed in a roundabout way to make a Christmas confession, which was not very good for my mental health.</p><p>“Firstly, Yamato-kun needs to learn the very basics—the method to make yourself liked by others.”</p><p>I was just thinking of clarifying the Christmas matter right on the spot, but Yuzu-sensei was faster than me to have started the lecture.</p><p>“Listen, Yamato-kun. The trick to getting people to like you is to push yourself as high as you can and get closer to your ideal self. To grow to greater heights is to declare war on yourself—I&#8217;m going to go beyond what I am now.&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-733723229"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-233793300"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>How typical of Yuzu&#8217;s skill of winning over people&#8217;s hearts and minds. It was so unique to Yuzu that I could not imitate it.</p><p>“You say all these cool things for nothing, but the fact that the result is such a recognition-hungry monster takes all the persuasive power out of it.”</p><p>I rolled my eyes, but Yuzu was smug about it.</p><p>“I can&#8217;t help it. There&#8217;s no reason why I myself wouldn&#8217;t like someone who has so many elements that make people like her. I&#8217;m the one who sees my strengths and efforts the most, you know? That&#8217;s right, of course, I&#8217;d like me!&#8221;</p><p>“You&#8217;re really refreshing, you know that?”&nbsp;</p><p>For her to have reached this point, no one would feel otherwise.</p><p>“Therefore, Yamato-kun, to make me fall for you, you gotta grow up the best you can.”</p><p>“Sorry to say, but I’m the kind of man who is charming when unadorned in life-size.”</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders at Yuzu’s instructions.</p><p>“There is more than one way of putting it. At least you could try a bit harder for the girl you love.” After complaining with a pout of her lips, Yuzu let out an exhale, “But surely it&#8217;s better for Yamato-kun to be laid-back like that.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-208461419"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-67088569"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>“Why did you say that all of the sudden? A new type of sarcasm?”</p><p>I thought she would bitch about it, but Yuzu smiled calmly, without any hint of underlying emotion.</p><p>“No. You see, whenever I find something I don&#8217;t like or something that&#8217;s wrong with me, I do my best to overcome it. But Yamato, you don&#8217;t do that, do you?”</p><p>“Well, yeah.”</p><p>I’d already stopped that painful attempt to stand tall among other people when I was in middle school. Yuzu squinted at me as if looking at a dazzling object as I nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Sometimes, I’m jealous of you in that aspect. You seem like you’re enjoying your life.”</p><p>“&#8230;As I thought, this sounds like a new type of sarcasm.”</p><p>As I tried to probe her true intentions, Yuzu slowly shook her head.</p><p>“No, it&#8217;s not. How should I say it? It&#8217;s like accepting the parts you can&#8217;t do anything about by yourself with serenity. It&#8217;s almost a kind of enlightenment. For me, I always try to suppress the uncontrollable parts of me, and that sometimes makes me suffer.”</p><p>“Well, that might be true.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-66702044"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1433314756"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>This girl not only demanded control over herself but also over the interpersonal relationships around her. And she was deft enough to succeed in doing so to a certain extent. Even when she was aware that this would cause her suffering, she couldn&#8217;t help but stick her hand into things.</p><p>&#8220;But you enjoy it too, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; I asked her back.</p><p>Like watering a flower that was about to wither and making it bloom beautifully; she made herself happy by watching her surroundings revolve peacefully around her. That was the greatest virtue Yuzu could have, and the decisive difference between her and me in the past.</p><p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah, I guess so. That&#8217;s why I really only envy you sometimes.&#8221;</p><p>Perhaps embarrassed that I guessed right about what she felt in her heart, she smiled somewhat fretfully.</p>
 
  <p><br /></p>
  
<p>“Besides, there are some things that are just no fun.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>For her to say that much, I became a little curious and asked her what Yuzu meant by the hardship she was talking about.</p><p>Then she smiled like a hunter looking at their prey caught in a trap. “Of course, the part where I get irritated whenever I see Yamato-kun getting close with another girl, or when I wish you’d pay more attention to me. Yeah, things like that. It’s painful, you know?”</p><p>“Hey! In the end, isn’t that simply sarcasm?” I grimaced when I found that I was totally pitied by her.</p><p>“Well, I knew you’d say that. So, I think it’s good for me to earn points with you in parts that I can control. It’s just nice that we have a couple-seat here too.”</p><p><em>*pap* </em>Yuzu leaned over to me, our bodies touching.</p><p>The sensation of her soft flesh when her slender body was snug against my chest unknowingly made my heart go ba-thump.</p><p>“Geez… In the end, you only want to do this.”</p><p>I made an unamused face in order to conceal my nervousness. Yuzu then nodded happily.</p><p>“Of course, no way I’d miss this chance!”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-641472601"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1224237756"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_4/home_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22210777382"></div></div></div><p>“&#8230;Well, whatever.”</p><p>I didn&#8217;t reject her strongly either but accepted her behaviour for what it was. Before I knew it, the initial awkwardness had disappeared.</p><p>==</p><p>We left the cafe and decided to finally go buy the scarf this time; we had walked for several minutes when Yuzu suddenly stopped in her tracks.</p><p>“&#8230;Wow, there’s a general store open here. I wonder what it sells,” Yuzu peeked curiously into the store.</p><p>“Wanna try going in?”</p><p>“Yep, just a bit.”</p><p>There was still time, so we went in for a look.</p><p>“Wow… There’s a lot of cute stuff.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu looked around at the products on the shelves with a twinkle in her eyes. She then picked up one of the products among them.</p><p>“Ah… I like this. This is so nice. Yamato-kun, come here, look at this.”</p><p>A little excitedly, Yuzu showed me a golden teaspoon. However, the shape was different from ordinary ones. This teaspoon was shovel-shaped.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-116562248"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1009721271"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_5/home_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777379"></div></div></div><p>“Wow, there’s even such a thing.”</p><p>&#8220;Yeah. My interest has been piqued. Oh, there&#8217;s also a silver version as well&#8230; that&#8217;s pretty too. I wonder which one I should buy,&#8221; Yuzu exclaimed as she looked at the teaspoons.</p><p>I totally understood how she felt. I also experienced the same thing whenever I went to select games to buy in a game shop. Besides, the time spent browsing was the fun part, so I kept out of it without interrupting her to let her fret about it to her heart&#8217;s content.</p><p>“Oh no, I can’t decide. Yamato-kun, what do you think I should do in this case?”</p><p>“You can try throwing a normal spoon in the lake.”</p><p>“Even if I do that, things like the golden axe and silver axe won’t happen, okay?! That system only belongs to fairy tales!”</p><p>Since she dismissed the fantasy approach, I also decided to think seriously about it.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you just buy them both? You&#8217;ll still be left with regrets no matter which one you choose.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>When I suggested this, for some reason, Yuzu frowned.</p><p>“I see. So you hold the &#8216;Better to surround yourself with lots of teaspoons and women principle.”</p><p>“I’ve never heard of that.”</p><p>As if my cold words didn&#8217;t reach her, Yuzu sighed, lamenting, “I didn&#8217;t expect Yamato-kun to also advocate for a spoon harem.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-38255687"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1627638680"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_3/home_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777376"></div></div></div><p>“What the heck is that term? But wait, you said ‘also’, does that mean there are others too… No, in the first place, I’m not one!”&nbsp;</p><p>I was nearly about to admit to being this unheard-of advocate.&nbsp;</p><p>“Well, that thing aside… I think I’ll just buy both. This is just the right timing, I’ll go get a complete tea set.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu apparently made up her mind, perhaps having taken hints from our unproductive banter.</p><p>“A complete tea set you say… Is it okay to just buy on impulse like that? In three months&#8217; time, they could end up in a cupboard covered in dust.”</p><p>I became a little worried, and Yuzu showed me her smug expression.</p><p>“It’s okay. I’m originally a tea person. I drink tea a lot at home, so they won’t rot away even if I buy them.”</p><p>“You say that, but I have a feeling you always drink coffee, though.”</p><p>“It&#8217;s the reverse mindset. I like tea, so when I drink tea I don&#8217;t want to compromise on taste. But when I drink coffee, I can compromise, so I tend to drink more often when I just want to drink casually.”</p><p>“What a strange mindset.”</p><p>I felt like I was convinced, but also not at the same time. Whatever it was, if this wouldn’t be a wasted purchase, I had no reason to stop her.</p><p>“Anyway, I think it’s time to drink tea in the clubroom. Maybe I’ll keep this tea set there. Now all we need is an electric kettle and we&#8217;ll be all set.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1882578323"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1188385418"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_5/home_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777379"></div></div></div><p>“Having a tea set in the clubroom at all times, you&#8217;re finally making the room your private possession.”&nbsp;</p><p>I was feeling meh about it, but for some reason, Yuzu made a proud face.</p><p>“Ooh? Did you say something? You also brought in your personal Robot Buster game and have been playing it in the clubroom.”</p><p>“&#8230;I never said anything.”&nbsp;</p><p>There was nothing I could say when she threw that counter-argument at me.</p><p>“For the cup, maybe this…? Ah, but this one is so nice too,” Yuzu, who just brilliantly KO&#8217;d me, hummed and continued shopping.</p><p>While watching her like that, I suddenly had a thought.</p><p>&nbsp;<em>I may not know anything about Yuzu.</em></p><p>Yuzu had always been accommodating to my tastes and preferences when we went on these dates and during the time we usually spent in the literature club room. Even though nearly three months had passed since we were together, I could count the number of times I went on a date with Yuzu on one hand. I didn&#8217;t know that she liked action movies or that she liked tea.</p><p>“Alright! For now, let&#8217;s leave the rest for another day and just buy cups and teaspoons. Yamato-kun, wait here for a moment.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Leaving me a few words, Yuzu made a short run to the cash register.</p><p>“&#8230;Fake couple, was it?” I muttered.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1620623623"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1421114334"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_5/home_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777379"></div></div></div><p>That title stung me in the heart.&nbsp;</p><p>We were business partners achieving mutual objectives. There was certainly a relationship between us that developed through mutual help and exchange of opinions in order to achieve the same goal; but at the same time, something important may have been missed.</p><p>“Sorry to keep you waiting. Oh, my bad, I&#8217;m the only one who&#8217;s having fun. Let&#8217;s go and look at the scarves quickly.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu, who had finished paying the bill, came back with a slightly apologetic look on her face.</p><p>“No, there&#8217;s no need to be in such a hurry. We have time, let&#8217;s look around.” When I suggested this, her expression brightened.</p><p>“Really? It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve been in this area, so there are a lot of shops I&#8217;m interested in. Then let&#8217;s go.”</p><p>Yuzu took my hand in hers and started walking with a bounce in her step.</p><p><em>I want to know more about Yuzu.</em></p><p>While looking at her profile, such an idea crossed my mind.</p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
 <p>After that, we looked around various shops for a while, and finally, we headed to a clothes shop to buy a scarf at dusk.</p><p>“Well then, Yamato-kun. Please tell me if you find something that pulls at your heartstrings.”</p><p>As soon as we entered an apparel store that carried a lot of women&#8217;s clothing, Yuzu left the choice to me.</p><p>“Well, we did agree to something like that… but more than I expected, this is quite difficult.”</p><p>The women&#8217;s clothing department generally felt unbelievably distant to me, and it was a little disconcerting to be left to my own devices here.</p><p>“I guess I&#8217;ll have to rule out this and that for now&#8230;”</p><p>I ruled out the black scarf beforehand.</p><p>“Oh? You are excluding that one? I thought you would choose it first and foremost,&#8221; Yuzu asked me as if my choice was surprising, curious about my intentions.</p><p>“Just my intuition, I felt like it won’t suit you. Considering you&#8217;re going to wear it with your uniform, a brighter colour would be better.&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2124729243"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2067123668"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>Basically, Yuzu had never been a woman who fancied subdued colour shades. Our uniforms were a rather subdued blue, and matching a black scarf to them would never be her preference.</p><p>“Oh, I see&#8230; I&#8217;m surprised you&#8217;re thinking this through. I honestly thought you might just go for some funny choices just for the laugh of it.”</p><p>“If I really did that, you’d seriously think I have shitty taste, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>Such a feat was only possible for someone who had an ingrained image of being fashionable in general.</p><p>“&#8230;Okay, I choose this.”</p><p>So I chose a tartan-checked orange scarf<span id='easy-footnote-1-91246' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-91246' title='I actually had to google what this pattern is called in English'><sup>1</sup></a></span>. It would go well with the school uniform, and the bright colour would be a nice accent even when wearing casual clothes.</p><p>“How is this?” I was not confident with my preferences, so I timidly asked Yuzu who stared at the scarf with an inscrutable face.</p><p>“Hmm….”&nbsp;</p><p>I was nervous if this was not to her liking, but then she suddenly broke into a smile.</p><p>“You passed.”</p>

<p>“Hey, don’t scare me like that!”&nbsp;</p><p>I protested for being put under pressure for nothing, yet Yuzu only giggled.</p><p>“No, that was unintentional. But that was surprising for you to choose something that fit my taste. I like it.”</p><p>Yuzu took the scarf and raised her face to me.</p><p>“I’ll cherish it.”</p><p>I nodded and replied with a short “Hm”.</p><p>It felt sort of jittery, but it was not entirely a bad feeling.</p><p>“Okay, then as a thank you for making the selection, Yamato-kun, I’ll try on clothes you fancy. Indulge in the pleasure of being able to dress up your cute girlfriend!”</p><p>Alas, my feelings just now came to nought when she suddenly dropped that explosive statement.</p><p>“I appreciate the gesture.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1997090758"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-815803631"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>“Don&#8217;t be so modest. Now, what do you want me to wear?”</p><p>“Nothing in particular.”</p><p>When I flatly refused, for some reason Yuzu&#8217;s expression lightly twitched.</p><p>“Er… Does that mean you want me to be naked? That&#8217;s obviously difficult.”</p><p>“That&#8217;s not what I meant, okay?!”</p><p>She outrageously distorted the meaning of my words.</p><p>“Okay. So how about I give you several options, and in response, you pick one of those outfits for me to change into?&#8221;</p><p>“Whatever, that&#8217;s fine&#8230;.”</p><p>There was no loss to me, and I was beginning to feel that it would be better if I obediently asked her to dress up for me.</p><p>“Yamato, what do you consider the most important: colour, material, design or size?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-636844468"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2102535436">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“Well, first of all, size, right?”</p><p>Regardless of how good the design or colour was, I once heard that if you wore clothes of the wrong size, you&#8217;d get the impression that you were being worn by clothes.</p><p>Hearing my answer like that, Yuzu simply nodded her head in agreement.</p><p>“I see. For you who picked ‘size’, the right partner for you is a person of action!”</p><p>“A psychology test?!”</p><p>Her casual question was actually laced with traps.</p><p>“A person of action equals me! We’re perfectly compatible!”</p><p>“What the heck is that trick?!”</p><p>I suffered a loss so easily. I had misjudged the situation.</p><p>“Well, I’m just kidding. Come on, select an outfit for me.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-794332027"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-54436250"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>“It’s hard to do that now! I&#8217;m reeling with dread at what you&#8217;re going to test me for again!”&nbsp;</p><p>I resisted with all my might against Yuzu, who smiled after making an unreasonable request to me.</p><p>“I see… Then I’ll just give you multiple choi—”</p><p>“I’ll just pick one!”</p><p>I discovered that being offered choices was more frightening. So, I browsed through the selections and picked out a grey one-piece dress that caught my eye. It had a chic and neat look to it; this surely would suit the unquestionably beautiful Yuzu, if only she kept her mouth shut.</p><p>“Well then, I&#8217;ll go with this one.”</p><p>“Ooo, Yamato, you like this sort of style? Hmm…”</p><p>“Hey, don&#8217;t stare. Go on, put it on quickly.”</p><p>It was strangely embarrassing to have one&#8217;s preferences analysed.</p><p>“Okay, okay. Wait a minute. Oh, and don&#8217;t peek, okay?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1519873099"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1716298071">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“Who&#8217;s peeking?!&#8221;</p><p>I shooed her away with my hands and chased her into the fitting room. A few minutes of waiting passed and the curtain of the fitting room opened.</p><p>“Ta-da! Does this suit me? Do I look pretty?”</p><p>A white knitted dress up to just above the knees, and from down there were a pair of black stockings.</p>

<p>Since the dress was my own selection, it was a given for it to be to my liking, but it suited her so perfectly. I was at a loss to respond.</p><p>“&#8230;Well, not bad.”</p><p>“Ah, you’re shy.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>I could see that she would get carried away if I praised her too much, so I slightly frowned; unfortunately, it was already too late, and Yuzu looked into my face with a smirk.</p><p>&#8220;How do you feel about having your girlfriend dress in the fashion of your choice, dyeing her in your colours? Have you fallen in love with her all over again?&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1341280129"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-456519425"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“Yes, yes. I&#8217;ve totally fallen in love with you all over again. I love you, so very much.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Mm. I can tell that rudeness is an attempt to hide your embarrassment. Okay, I&#8217;m satisfied.&#8221; Yuzu nodded happily, interpreting my dismissive response positively.</p><p>“&#8230;Whatever, just interpret it however you like.”</p><p>I raised the white flag early before saying anything else, not wanting to be further bugged by her on this matter.</p><p>“If you like, I&#8217;ll buy this one too. Then Yamato-kun would be happy again.”</p><p>“I beg you, just spare me…”</p><p>It could be quite damaging to have your tastes and preferences in things related to your opposite sex being teased so much. The scarf alone had consumed a lot of my mental energy, and I simply couldn&#8217;t take it anymore.</p><p>“That’s a pity. Okay, I’ll change back. Oh, I’ll say this again, but don&#8217;t peek—”</p><p>“I WON’T!”</p><p>Yuzu shut the curtain as if escaping from my glare.</p>
 
  <p><br /></p>
  
  <p>I let out a sigh and quietly reflected. How should I word it? It was surprisingly embarrassing to reveal your preferences to someone. And to let that someone dress up according to that preference was&#8230; vexing and embarrassing, but unexpectedly not a bad thing.</p><p>“&#8230;I guess I also haven’t told her about the things I like.”</p><p>It was not only me who didn’t know Yuzu’s likes and preferences. Both of us still had to share more and more things with each other.</p><p>“Thanks for the wait!”</p><p>“Okay, then let’s go to the cashier.”</p><p>After Yuzu exited the fitting room in her original clothes, we went to settle the bill and left the store.</p><p>“Wow, it’s completely dark!” Yuzu exclaimed as soon as we were out of the store.</p><p>When we entered the store, the city was dyed red with the setting sun, but now it was enveloped in the darkness of night.</p><p>“Shall we go home? We walked a lot today too.”</p><p>“Yep. It’s a bit sad, but let’s do that.”&nbsp;</p><p>Nodding, Yuzu wrapped the scarf she had just bought at the shop around her neck and looked at me.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1851540523"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1466377184"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p>“How does this look on me?”</p><p>“The price tag is still on it.”</p><p>“Ugh!” Yuzu was so panicked that she took a pen out of her bag and wrapped the tag around it and twisted it off.&nbsp;</p><p>She really could do things so skillfully.</p><p>“Mmgh, why do you always notice the unnecessary things, Yamato-kun?” Yuzu&#8217;s lips pouted and she poked my side with her finger.</p><p>“Stahpppp! I’m sorry,” Unable to bear the attack on my flank, I apologised and Yuzu retracted her finger.</p><p>“Geez… I forgive you since I enjoyed today’s date, but Yamato-kun, you should learn to build up the mood.”</p><p>“I’ll take note of that.”</p><p>Perhaps satisfied to see me graciously complying with the stern warning, Yuzu held out her hand to me.</p><p>“Well then, let&#8217;s go home, shall we?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>I grabbed her hand and we walked away.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1008927788"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1269180174"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_5/home_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777379"></div></div></div><p>“But I might have made a good discovery today,” Yuzu blurted out as we walked along.</p><p>I unintentionally tilted my head in puzzlement, “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Contrary to my expectation, Yamato-kun actually knows me. Like my tastes and preferences.”</p><p>My eyes widened at her surprising comment.</p><p>“&#8230;Is that so? I was actually thinking the complete opposite. I realised how much I didn’t know about you.”</p><p>To my honest statement, Yuzu shook her head.</p><p>“Not really. Yamato-kun, you always look at me properly, to the point I’ve wondered, do you really like me that much?”</p><p>“Hush, that’s enough!”</p><p>Despite my hollering, I actually didn’t feel that bad.</p><p>“Yuzu,” I called her name after our conversation came to a pause.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>She looked up at me and I looked straight back into her eyes.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-738065658"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-153081898"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_1/home_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777373"></div></div></div><p>“The scarf suits you. So cute.”</p><p>“He…y! This is not the time to say that, is it?! Just like last time with the necklace, you always get your timing wrong!”</p><p>Yuzu’s face instantly flushed red.</p><p>“Whoa, I never thought you’d be caught by the same trick again. As always, your defence may as well not exist.”</p><p>“SHUT UP!”</p><p>My mood was lifted by the successful prank while Yuzu was red up to her ears.</p><p>We retraced our route home, chattering away together.&nbsp;</p><p>On the way, I remembered what I had to do today—clear up the misunderstanding regarding the &#8216;Christmas Fulfilment&#8217; event. Our date had been so enjoyable in general that this matter had completely slipped my mind, but this was actually the most important thing of the day.</p><p>“Thanks for sending me home. Today was fun.”</p><p>Almost as soon as I remembered that most important thing, we arrived in front of Yuzu&#8217;s house.</p><p>“Oh, it’s nothing.”</p><p>Although I had only just remembered and my mind wasn&#8217;t ready, I just had to cut to the chase now. I took one deep breath and straightened up, ready to go.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-444039791"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2001391337"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_4/home_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22210777382"></div></div></div><p>“Listen, Yuzu—” “Ah, yes,”</p><p>At the same time as I was about to take a step forward, Yuzu reached into her bag at the most inopportune moment.</p><p>“Wh-what&#8217;s the matter?” Having my attempt foiled, I stumblingly asked her what she wanted to say.</p><p>There, she took out a beautifully wrapped package from her bag.</p><p>“This… for you.”</p><p>I accepted it into my hand.</p><p>“&#8230;What’s this? May I open it?”</p><p>“Yes, please.”</p><p>I carefully unwrapped the gift and took out the content. Inside was a teacup we saw at the general store a while back.</p><p>&#8220;This&#8230; is the one you chose earlier.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a present. I haven’t given anything in return for the necklace, and it was just a perfect opportunity, so I was thinking I wanted a matching thing with you. Oh my, Yamato-kun, you are so blessed!”</p><p>“Th-thank you,” I was totally caught by surprise, so I could only utter my honest thanks.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-98902366"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-767230374"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_3/home_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777376"></div></div></div><p>Hearing that, Yuzu nodded satisfactorily.&nbsp;</p><p>“Today, I&#8217;m glad I got to know a part of Yamato-kun that I didn&#8217;t know much about. Surprisingly, you were good company, and you took shopping seriously. I thought boys were not fond of long shopping trips, so I was prepared for you to say you wanted to go home already to play games.”</p><p>“&#8230;Whoa, I wouldn’t say things like that now we’ve gone on multiple dates.”</p><p>But well, I also thought it was totally probable for me to say that.</p><p>“Yes, so I’m very glad to know that. Let’s go on a date like this next time.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu broke into a smile—a natural one.</p><p><em>A surprise hit.</em></p><p>My teasing earlier was nothing compared to this, I was dealt with a critical hit.</p><p>“By the way, Yamato-kun, weren&#8217;t you about to say something earlier? Somehow it turned out to be me interrupting you,” Yuzu asked, perhaps noticing that I was calling out to her earlier.</p><p>This was the biggest chance I’d ever have to clear up that misunderstanding.</p><p>However—</p><p>“&#8230;Nuh-uh, it’s nothing.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-234977877"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1934933553"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p>—I decided to no longer clarify the Christmas matter.</p><p>“Really? If you say so, then it’s okay. Alright, I’ll go in first. See you tomorrow.”</p><p>“Okay, see you!”</p><p>Yuzu disappeared into the lift of the apartment building, waving her hand as she walked away.&nbsp;</p><p>After I saw her off, I looked up at the sky and let out a deep sigh.</p><p>“Hmmm… Oh my goodness!”</p><p>Was it because today’s date was enjoyable? Or because I’d unwittingly let the guard around my heart down before she surprised me? Or due to the effects of my prolonged worry about that confession event?</p><p><em>No, from long ago, I—</em></p><p>“There’s no more room for deception…”</p><p>Seriously, this has reached a point where I couldn’t even deceive myself anymore.</p><p><em>—I have fallen in love with a girl named Yuzu.</em></p>
