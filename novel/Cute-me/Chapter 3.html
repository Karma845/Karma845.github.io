<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Are You Going to Have a Good Time?</h3>

<p>A day passed after I realised the most shocking fact of my life: I was in love with Yuzu.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, the world went on without a hitch, and my normal day-to-day life returned.</p><p>“I’d never have thought I&#8217;d end up like this…” I muttered to myself as I walked alone down the morning corridor.</p><p>I felt as if I was floating just a bit off the ground. I could feel my pulse speeding up a little, even though I wasn&#8217;t doing anything.</p><p>“Aren’t I too flustered? What’ll happen if I see Yuzu’s face now?”</p><p>Today, we went to school separately since Yuzu had plans to go to school with Kotani, but still, we’d meet each other in class.</p><p><em>Oh no, this is totally nerve-wracking.</em></p><p>“Oh, nice, you’re here, Izumi!”</p><p>At that time, my shoulder was tapped from behind.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1932726328"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-53684998"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>“WHOA!”</p><p>I jumped back with a start, then turned around and there was Namase with a quizzical look on his face.</p><p>“You don’t have to be that surprised… What’s wrong, Izumi?”</p><p>“Oh, nothing, sorry. I’m just used to a lifestyle where no one would call out for me,” I reflexively said something as a cover.</p><p>In response, Namase made a sad face at me, “What a sad thing to say… I also talked to you now and then, so cheer up!”</p><p>“Sorry… I don’t remember those.”</p><p>“What a sad thing to say! Now, it’s me who feels lonelier than you!”&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at his exaggerated reaction, I turned calm.</p><p>“So, what can I do for you? Um…Na-Namase,”</p><p>“That pause, you forgot my name, right?! We’ve been classmates for eight months!”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1252976443"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1188814937"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“Well, I was only half-joking.”</p><p>“I’m bothered by the remaining half!”</p><p>“Don’t be bothered. So, what do you want to talk about?”</p><p>When I prompted him again, Namase took a deep breath and got down to business.</p><p>“Just a bit, about Christmas.”</p><p>This topic could be easily predicted since it’s that time of the year, so here it came. Namase first confirmed that there was no one in the surrounding area, then whispered to me in a low voice.</p><p>“It’s Aki, she plans to confess to Sota again during Christmas.”</p><p>“Ooh… When I talked to her before this, it sounded to me like it would take her more time to reach that point.”</p><p>I thought it would take her all courage to just ask Sota for a date on Christmas, but surprisingly, the plan went as far as the confession.</p><p>“Well, it took a lot of effort to get her into the spirit to do that…”&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2119691323"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-815754935"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>Namase had a distant look. He must’ve been desperately pushing her.</p><p>“So, why are you bringing this up to me? There’s no way you’re asking for my help, are you?”</p><p>Kotani would never want my help. I knew that, so I asked him and what I got was his serious face.</p><p>“What? I’m just laying some groundwork. Yuzu would probably give more priority to Aki than usual, and it would be a problem if Izumi and Yuzu were to have a row because of that.”</p><p>I see. If Yuzu devoted more time to Kotani, I would be the first one to suffer. So he wanted to give me a follow-up in advance before I voiced my dissatisfaction to Yuzu. This guy sure knew how to socialise.</p><p>“I got that… Back to the real issue, is Kotani doing okay?” I inquired.</p><p>For the current me, I could understand how much courage it would take to confess feelings to someone. Moreover, it must take a lot of mental strength to make a second attempt at someone who had rejected you once before. It was a level of determination that deserved much respect.</p><p>“The odds are in her favour and we&#8217;ll do our best to take care of her emotional wellbeing. That&#8217;s why I’m also talking to Izumi like this.&#8221;</p><p>Namase’s words seeped with a strong determination.</p><p>“&#8230;Well, okay. I won’t do anything that’ll cause a disturbance in this crucial period.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-639123679"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1073384866">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>On my side, I was also having a tough time; ​​but for that reason, I would not want to put a burden on Kotani, who was going through a similar, if not together, time than me.</p><p>“Izumi… yes, thank you. You are surprisingly very thoughtful towards your friends. Exactly the type of friend one would need,” Namase spouted an inexplicable statement in relief.</p><p>“Friend? Huh, who’s a friend with whom?”</p><p>“Izumi and I, who else?!”</p><p>“Namase… Listen, between you and I, the relationship is merely ‘someone who just happened to be allocated to the same class for eight months.’”</p><p>“How can you push me away like that?! We&#8217;ve been through a few big troubles together! What, is it that difficult to be friends?!”&nbsp;</p><p>Namase plainly uttered something an extrovert would say. This guy sure would find it easy to get along with anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>“Well, I was only half-joking.”</p><p>“Again, what’s with the remaining half?! Since earlier, I think something that&#8217;s been bothering me for a while now is still fifty percent obscured!&#8221;</p><p>Paying no heed to Namase’s complaint, I continued, “Anyway, I earnestly wish that things go well. This is for Yuzu’s sake too.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-486004122"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1833243851"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>He was stumped in response to my honest sentiment and then let out a wry smile. “Whoa, I was just served with a super big display of affection. So you like Yuzu-cchi that much?”</p><p>I replied with a shrug of my shoulders to the teasingly snide comment, “That&#8217;s right. She&#8217;s the love of my life, after all.”</p><p>When I shamelessly acknowledged that, Namase blatantly frowned.</p><p>“Okay, okay, I’ve heard enough. Yuzu-cchi is so blessed to be loved this much. Compared to before dating you, Izumi, I guess she smiles more naturally now.”&nbsp;</p><p>I found his remark to be quite surprising.</p><p>“&#8230;Is that so?” I asked in surprise, to which Namase chuckled as he nodded.</p><p>“Yeah. Sure enough, the face she shows us is different from what she shows you.”</p><p>Yuzu was an expert at putting on a facade, but Namase’s social skills were at an expert level too. Without even trying, he could discern the difference in her.</p><p>“Perhaps, Yuzu needs someone to whom she can show that side of hers that she cannot show us. Therefore, I think it was great when Yamato and Yuzu-cchi started dating.”</p><p>He turned his somewhat crooked smile towards me. Despite having shown him how much I was smitten with Yuzu, I was too embarrassed to look back at him.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-928443525"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1402183406"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“&#8230;Well, it doesn’t feel bad to be told that.”</p><p>“Glad to hear it. But anyway, if you were to demonstrate any more displays of affection here, I would have to spit sugar out of my mouth, so I&#8217;m gonna take my leave now.”</p><p>Like that, he turned on his heel and walked in the opposite direction to the classroom.</p><p>“Okay, I wish you the best too!” I shouted out to his back and then headed for my own classroom.</p><p>He was an unexpected visitor, but perhaps because I spoke to him, my nerves were somehow relaxed. I smoothly opened the classroom door and entered the room.</p><p>Immediately, my eyes met those of Yuzu, who was talking with a few classmates.&nbsp;</p><p>She waved a small hand at me as she said &#8216;good morning&#8217;—not audibly, she only mouthed the words. I responded by raising one hand lightly, and then discreetly took my seat and looked out the window.</p><p>“&#8230;Oh my goodness. I&#8217;m amazed at myself.”</p><p>To think that this little exchange was enough to make my heart skip a beat.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As Namase had mentioned, Yuzu also ended up spending both the lunch break and all between-class breaks with Kotani. Owing to that, I had barely spoken to her the whole day.</p><p>“&#8230;Now here, suddenly it became only the two of us.”</p><p>In the literature clubroom after school hours. I came alone earlier to do some mental preparation beforehand and was sitting on a chair to psych myself up.</p><p><em>Okay! My mind is now as serene as a polished mirror!</em></p><p>I softly muttered, “All right, now my heart is ready—”&nbsp;</p><p>“Thanks for waiting! Sorry, I’m late!”</p><p>“WHOA!”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu’s sudden entrance at this exact time completely shattered my serene state of mind.</p><p>“What’s wrong, Yamato-kun?” Yuzu’s eyes widened at my huge reaction.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1516751900"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1177487210"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>“No-nothing… It’s just the door opened so suddenly, that’s why.”</p><p>There was also that time with Namase. Today was full of me being startled. This just portrayed how my heart was totally frazzled.&nbsp;</p><p>“I see. Well, this isn’t much of an apology, but I brought something good here,” she said as she took out something from her bag—a silver water bottle.</p><p>“Ta-dah! What do you think is inside this?”</p><p>“What is it? Coffee?”</p><p>“Wrong! As a special treat, I’ll give you hints. Hint number one: H<sub>2</sub>O.”</p><p>“Isn’t that water? That’s already an answer.”</p><p>She said it was a hint, yet it was straightforwardly the answer. What a new style of a quiz.</p><p>“You were close. The correct answer is hot water. Steaming hot.”</p><p>“What on Earth, that’s such a random trick question.”&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1081454428"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2094387587"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>Not that I could say that since I had indeed been tricked.</p><p>I continued to ask the main question, “By the way, why are you bringing hot water?”&nbsp;</p><p>Again from her bag, Yuzu took out another paper bag. From there emerged the teacup and spoons she had bought the previous day.</p><p>“I brought the teacup and everything as a set, thinking that I wanted to use them here. Yamato-kun, do you also bring your teacup?”</p><p>“Yeah, just in case.”</p><p>I also brought out the box with the teacup inside from my bag. As soon as that was out in the open, Yuzu let out a giggle as though she had been tickled.</p><p>“&#8230;Um, it does feel nice when a person uses the present I gave them.”</p><p>“Oh, yep.” Embarrassment suddenly flooded me, so I darted my eyes elsewhere.</p><p>During that time, Yuzu started to prepare tea.</p><p>“Ah, I need to ask you this upfront, Yamato-kun, are you a tea person or a coffee person?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-831956578"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-181910935">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“If I had to say, I&#8217;d say coffee.”</p><p>“I see. Incidentally, I only have herbal tea at the moment.”</p><p>“Then why did you even ask..?”</p><p>Despite the meaningless interjection, Yuzu quickly finished preparing the tea and contentedly nodded once.</p><p>“Yes, it’s done!”</p><p>A beautiful amber liquid had been produced in the teapot.</p><p>“Yamato-kun, put out your teacup.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>She poured boiling water into a teacup once to warm it up, then dumped it into a&nbsp; ’chakoboshi’</p><p>“Here you go. It&#8217;s Yuzu-chan&#8217;s special chamomile tea. I think you can see my character in its taste.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-130374353"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-466703562"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>“That sounds somewhat unsettling to my stomach.”</p><p>“Also, although I said I’m a black tea person, I think my inconsistency is showing for bringing herbal tea as a starter.”</p><p>“Indeed, I was also thinking something was off there.”</p><p>I intentionally didn’t touch on that matter, yet she mentioned it herself.</p><p>“Nah, actually my stock of black tea has run out…”</p><p>“You, you are really a black tea person, right…?” I threw a doubtful glance at Yuzu who simply giggled.</p><p>“But still, I guarantee the taste. I’ve poured in a lot of love too.”</p><p>“Well, if you say so…”</p><p>Sitting side by side on the simple chairs, I gently blew on my cup and sipped at my chamomile tea. The distinctive, refreshing aroma wafted through my nostrils and I felt the hot sensation of something falling into my stomach.</p><p>“Delicious.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-713262381"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1632174825">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“Really? I&#8217;m glad.”</p><p>While looking happy and joyful, Yuzu also wrapped a teacup with both hands and drank her tea.</p><p>It must be because of this tranquilness that my nerves, which had been forgotten in my shock, gradually returned to a state of tension.&nbsp;</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><p><em>Oh no, I can’t think of any topic to talk about in this situation!</em></p><p>“After all, it&#8217;s nice to start adding hot drinks here. I think we should continue to bring in a variety of different goods, depending on the season.”</p><p>“I, I guess so,” I chimed in to keep the conversation going while drinking my tea at a fast pace.</p><p>Chamomile tea supposedly had calming properties, but so far it had not fulfilled its potential.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Usually, what did I talk about with Yuzu?</em></p><p>“Hey, Yamato-kun, you’re not playing any games today?” Prompted by a curious Yuzu, I suddenly realised.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-246622526"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2012658775">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p><em>That&#8217;s right, I usually play games and just go along with any topic from there.&nbsp;</em></p><p>To forget such a basic thing, I must be pretty freaking out.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m playing soon.”</p><p>I turned on the old game console and grabbed the controller.</p><p>“Yuzu, you wanna play first?”</p><p>The game we had been playing lately was for a single player, so I always alternated with Yuzu.</p><p>“Nope, I’m in the mood to slowly enjoy my tea.”</p><p>“I see. Then, I’ll go first.”</p><p>I turned to the screen where it had finished loading and started the rest of the game. It told the story of a young boy with a sword in the shape of a keyring, adventuring through various worlds with world-famous ducks and dog characters.</p><p>“But then again, Yuzu, you pretty much just watch me play. Aren&#8217;t you bored?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1955791003"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1842009755"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>As I was defeating small fry enemies using nothing but muscle memory, I felt calm enough to chat with her.</p><p>“No. I like watching other people play and stuff. I&#8217;m interested to see how the story develops among others.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu engaged in the conversation while also staring at the screen.</p><p>“Is that what it&#8217;s like?”</p><p>“Yeah. Sort of like watching gameplay video clips?”</p><p>“Oh, I see. That&#8217;s easy to understand.”</p><p>“Right? And in addition, I can watch real-time gameplay from my exclusive seat, and Yamato-kun will take care of the troublesome or difficult parts half the time. It&#8217;s the perfect setting.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Yuzu then looked at me as if thinking of something.&nbsp;</p><p>“Yamato-kun, you don’t watch gameplay videos?”</p><p>“I don&#8217;t actively watch them. I&#8217;m the type of person who wants to play instead of watch.”</p><p>If I watched a gameplay video or such, and the game turned out to be interesting, I would regret not playing it myself.</p><p>“I see. So Yamato, you&#8217;re not bored when I&#8217;m playing?”</p><p>“Hmm&#8230; Not really. I actually enjoy it.”</p><p>“Oh? So it’s something like watching the cute Yuzu-chan playing&nbsp; is, in itself, worth seeing?”</p><p>“Not like that,” I politely denied it, yet the narcissist was already on the loose.</p><p>“No-no, you don’t have to cover it up. As long as I concentrate on my game, you can stare at your cute girlfriend&#8217;s profile without me noticing. Oh no, Yamato-kun is so calculating.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-977011815"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2079215186">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>&nbsp;“I’m being painted as a manipulative character without my input.”</p><p>This was a completely false accusation. To stop her wild thoughts, I had to quickly clarify it.</p><p>“Listen to me. When I said I enjoy it, it’s because I appreciated how you’re getting better at playing when, at first, you used to suck at it. As an analogy, it’s like watching kindergarteners at sports events and feeling deeply touched at how much they’ve grown.”</p><p>“In what way do you look at me? You&#8217;re treating me like I&#8217;m your child.”</p><p>“It&#8217;s kind of amusing, and a bit moving too. Yuzu, who was so small, can now hold a controller so well…”</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘so small’?! We met in high school! You&#8217;re getting too emotionally involved and creating a past that doesn&#8217;t exist!”</p><p>“You&#8217;ve gotten bigger, Yuzu.”</p><p>“I haven&#8217;t changed in size since we met!”</p><p>Yuzu protested, and I chuckled at her.</p><p>“Anyway, I&#8217;m having a fair amount of fun when you&#8217;re playing, so I&#8217;d say don&#8217;t worry about it.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-465333130"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1995749103"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“&#8230;Really?”</p><p>“Really.” I was somewhat relieved as I lightly chimed in.</p><p>To be honest, I was a little worried. I was worried that the change in my state of mind would disrupt the rhythm of this casual routine. Nonetheless, our usual day-to-day interactions continued normally without any problems.</p><p><em>I can handle this. I’ll be able to control my feelings without issue.</em></p><p>Once I was convinced of this, I felt at ease and concentrated on the game screen. But for some reason, Yuzu&#8217;s gaze was still fixed intently upon my profile.</p><p>“&#8230;What is it?” Unable to bear this discomfort, I asked Yuzu, who in turn cocked her head aside.</p><p>“No, I just wondered what kind of windfall it was that Yamato-kun, who usually stays focused all the time once the game starts, becomes so attentive to me today.”</p><p>My heart jolted a little bit, feeling as though she had seen through me. At the same time, I had mixed emotions boiling inside me.</p><p>“I… am I usually that bad of a boyfriend?”</p><p>“Relatively speaking, yes.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-970329245"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2060888280">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>It hurt when I couldn’t exactly object to that.</p><p>“Well, occasionally I can be attentive too.”</p><p>“I see,” nodding, Yuzu then snuggled into my shoulder firmly, “well then, I&#8217;ll keep my fingers crossed that such a time will come again.”</p><p>“&#8230;Don&#8217;t expect too much.”</p><p>To hide my embarrassment, I concentrated on the game screen.</p><p>Alas, as though the boy on the screen was also infected by my nervousness, he was miserably beaten by neverending blows.</p><p>==</p><p>A few hours went by as both of us alternated playing the game. When it was Yuzu’s turn, we arrived at the scene to challenge a stage boss.</p><p>“Oh, no! It’s super strong!”</p><p>“It’s okay! Your teammate will heal you!”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-884999419"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1427743876"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>As soon as I said that, a duck character activated the healing magic.</p><p>“I survived! Can I just bulldoze my way ahead?!”</p><p>“Yeah, you can!”</p><p>The boy controlled by Yuzu unleashed a series of concerted blows and killed the boss monster.</p><p>“Yay! I defeated it!”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu released the controller and reached out both hands toward me.</p><p>“Yeah, congrats!”&nbsp;</p><p>I responded by making high fives.</p><p>“Whoa, it was so strong.”</p><p>“Yep, now you can go to the next one.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-60686801"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-411918954"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>We were both happy as we watched the story play out after the boss’s defeat.&nbsp;</p><p><em>So now, what kind of world will the next one be—&nbsp;</em></p><p>I was immersed in that thought when suddenly the television screen went dark.</p><p>“Huh?” “WHA?” We both made silly yelps.</p><p>For a moment, I thought I had pressed the TV remote by mistake, but I was wrong. It wasn&#8217;t only the TV, but also the game console, which had completely stopped.</p><p>“Hey, what&#8217;s going on?”</p><p>“Look towards the academic building, Yamato-kun.”</p><p>Yuzu called out to me as I finally understood the situation here—all the classrooms were in pitch darkness when I glanced out of the window in the direction of the academic building.</p><p>“A blackout?”</p><p>To avoid being caught using the literature clubroom without permission, the lights in our room were not usually switched on, but it was odd that the other classrooms were also dark.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-605441732"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1561350602"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>“Seems like it… Ah, now I remember, Sota had mentioned that there’ll be an electrical utility inspection, so all club activities were to end early.”</p><p>I see. So was this a scheduled power outage for maintenance work?</p><p>Apparently, the students who had club activities were told, but the general students who were not required to stay in school were not informed as it was not relevant to them. I understood, and that was when I realised a problem.</p><p>“&#8230;Hey, when did you last save the game?”</p><p>Yuzu lightly twitched at my question.</p><p>“&#8230;An hour ago?”</p><p>I never thought we’d have to pay the price of committing the error of challenging the boss without saving beforehand.</p><p>“Oh no… We have to redo it again tomorrow.” My head drooped down in frustration.</p><p>“Don’t mind it so much. There’s nothing we can do about it today, let’s tidy up and go home.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-117051916"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1664431840">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>I let out a sigh and we started preparing to leave. I put away the game console while Yuzu cleared the tea set. Afterwards, we exited the clubroom.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the corridor was plunged into darkness with only the emergency exit light dimly lit, looking eerie.&nbsp;</p><p>“Er… when this corridor is so dark, it feels like… <em>those things</em> might appear.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu was jumpy and, like a small animal, she was wary of the surrounding area.</p><p>“By <em>those things</em>, you mean ghosts?” I tried to confirm but Yuzu’s face went pale.</p><p>“Do-don’t say the word! There&#8217;s a thing in the world called the power of speech! When you say a word, you’ll attract it!”</p><p>“You can&#8217;t tell me such superstitions with a straight face.”</p><p>“It&#8217;s not a superstition! I told myself I am cute every day and I actually became cute! My cuteness is the evidence, so to speak!”</p><p>&#8220;Even when scared, you still can&#8217;t stop praising yourself.&#8221;</p><p>This narcissism was guaranteed to make even the ghosts cringe.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1163884563"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-388660995"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230; my legs are shaking. I can&#8217;t walk anymore. Will you call me a taxi, Yamato?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in a school building.&#8221;</p><p>Her brain must have short-circuited; Yuzu actually made such a ridiculous request.</p><p>“If there&#8217;s such a thing as the power of speech, why don&#8217;t you just keep saying that ghosts don&#8217;t exist? Then they&#8217;ll disappear, right?&#8221;</p><p>I tried to use Yuzu&#8217;s assertion to make a positive suggestion, but she shook her head shakily.</p><p>“That won’t work. I’m originally cute to begin with, so I just had to continue telling myself that I’m cute. If anyone can turn cute by words, nobody will have a hard time to be cute.”</p><p>“So which one is it?!”</p><p>It was Yuzu herself who destroyed the evidence she had personally presented.</p><p>“A-ny-way! I’m scared of the dark! Yamato-kun, hold my hand. Alternatively, you can try illuminating your whole body.”</p><p>“That’s not even a real alternative! Am I a firefly squid?!”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-617538400"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1495468006"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>Substantively, there was only one option left.</p><p>“What do I do with you… Here’s my hand.”</p><p>I reached out my hand, but Yuzu hugged my arm with all her might.</p><p>“Eh, wasn’t it holding hands?”</p><p>“Just moments ago I realised that the more close contact I have, the less scary it is. In fact, I even want you to carry me on your back,” Yuzu uttered such a thing with a serious face in response to the protest I made after my heart rate increased from her surprise attack.</p><p>“&#8230;That’ll be even more frightening. Come on, let’s go.”</p><p>Yuzu must be nervous, but I was extremely nervous in a completely different way. My arms were wrapped in her body heat and softness, and my nerves were subconsciously sensitive.</p><p>Since the cultural festival, we had been getting closer to each other like this more often. Even on our date on the previous day, there was also this level of contact. In theory, I should have gotten used to it by now&#8230; but maybe because my feelings had changed, I couldn&#8217;t maintain a normal mindset today compared to usual.</p><p>Maybe it was because of the tension in the air, but we both fell silent.</p><p>“It-it’s scary when it’s so quiet. Yamato-kun, talk about something,” Yuzu made the request. This atmosphere apparently was killing her.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-667433899"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-8646251"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>“Okay. Then I&#8217;ll tell you a short story about the world&#8217;s craziest &#8216;man-eating clowns.&#8217;”</p><p>“You don&#8217;t have to! I can tell from the title alone that it&#8217;s a horror story! Yamato-kun, how come you are so merciless to do this to me?!”</p><p>“Well, you see, when it&#8217;s hot, it&#8217;s said that eating spicy food cools you down, and if you listen to horror stories when you&#8217;re scared, you won&#8217;t be scared anymore.&#8221;</p><p>&nbsp;“I appreciate the thought, but you really don’t need to be considerate of me like that Yamato; not now nor for the rest of my life.”</p><p>Despite all this talk, we steadily made our way down the corridor. Unlike a haunted house, there were no gimmicks and no tombs, so naturally, we made it out of the school building without encountering any ghostly phenomena.</p><p>“Phew&#8230; We&#8217;re safe now that we&#8217;ve reached here,” Yuzu patted her chest as she passed through the school gate.</p><p>“We&#8217;ve lost our game data, then an unexpected test of courage, we both really had a tough day.”</p><p>When I commiserated with her, she looked at me with a mischievous upward glance while remaining snuggled up against me.</p><p>“Really? At least Yamato-kun got the benefit of being stuck with me like this, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p><p>“Oh, you’ve become more relaxed now, have you? Okay, now I can talk about the man-eating clown—”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-700135820"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2118059870"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“STOP THAT!”</p><p>Yuzu instantaneously jumped away from me.</p><p>“&#8230;Yamato-kun, you’re so mean,” With puffed cheeks, Yuzu pouted coquettishly.</p><p>“Err, sorry. It was on impulse.” I didn&#8217;t want her to be seriously flustered, so I was the first to relent.</p><p>Yuzu then smiled wryly, indicating she was now in a better mood.</p><p>“You&#8217;re an utterly terrible boyfriend. The only person who can be with such a terrible boyfriend is me. If you don&#8217;t take better care of me, there will be consequences.”</p><p>“I do care for you. Second only to games.”</p><p>“When will I ever beat those games?! Yamato-kun, your damnation is confirmed!”</p><p>“That&#8217;s scary. I&#8217;ll escort you now so I can avoid the damnation, so please spare me.”</p><p>When I held out my hand, Yuzu also softened her expression a little and clasped it.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-849457745"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1185326064"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>“Mm. Do as you please. If you do well, I&#8217;ll cancel that damnation.”</p><p>“You are in a position to decide on heavenly punishment? What are you, a god?”</p><p>“What a thing to say, that I&#8217;m as beautiful as a goddess. Yamato-kun, you&#8217;re exaggerating.”</p><p>”I didn’t say a single word like that, but it seems that even this can be exaggerated by you. How informative.”</p><p>With a shrug of the shoulders, I walked her home.</p><p>—Although we got into a terrible predicament and things turned out a little messy, the fact that I could still think it was fun made me chuckle to myself.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I went home, finished dinner and homework, and also took a bath.&nbsp;</p><p>Normally this would be when I would play games, but today for some reason I was not in the mood for that, so I lay on my bed without even drying my hair.</p><p>“For me to actually experience such a frightening change…”</p><p>Bewildered by my own state of mind, I glanced at my phone.&nbsp;</p><p>On the screen were Yuzu&#8217;s contact details. All I had to do was tap the screen once more and&nbsp; I’d be dialling her number.</p><p>An unintelligible sound escaped my mouth as I was dithering.</p><p>Despite being together just a few hours previously, somehow I felt like I wanted to hear her voice. Before I realised it, I was chasing her with my eyes the whole day and getting embarrassed at the slightest touch; it felt like I was not being myself.</p><p>“It would be weird if I called her out of the blue…”</p><p>Although Yuzu had called me a few times, I&#8217;d never called her for no reason. Even now, I was trying to think of a suitable reason to call her, but I couldn&#8217;t think of anything in particular.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1262560587"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-747256283">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“&#8230;This is no good. Maybe some other time.”</p><p>I couldn&#8217;t think of any relevant reason and let out one sigh before giving up. Then I looked away from my phone screen and suddenly saw the calendar.</p><p>Christmas Eve was less than two weeks away.</p><p>“&#8230;The Christmas Fulfilment event.”</p><p>The event where one would invite someone they had a crush on to confess their feelings. The fact that I didn’t address the misunderstanding regarding this event during yesterday’s date pretty much meant that my course of action was half set in stone.</p><p>“So… I’ll confess? To Yuzu?”</p><p>&nbsp;When I put it like that, I suddenly felt like I was drowning from the pressure.</p><p>The odds were probably in my favour. If I were in the position of a third party, I would certainly think: <em>Just get on with it and confess!</em> But when it finally involved me myself, that objectivity instantly vanished.</p><p>I groaned in anguish.&nbsp;</p><p>What if all this was my own wishful thinking? Yuzu&#8217;s attitude up to this point had been that of a good friend, and I didn&#8217;t really see her as an object of romantic interest&#8230; So, it might not be so-called &#8216;love&#8217;, but just simple ‘like&#8217;?&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1442757399"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1117487979"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>In the first place, had I done anything to make Yuzu like me?</p><p>We just played games together every day. Yuzu was merely accommodating me and my hobbies. I wondered if I had really done enough to make her aware of me as a member of the opposite sex.</p><p>“&#8230;Kotani’s words now really hit home,” I unknowingly muttered.</p><p><em>“When I’m about to confess, all I can see is my own inadequacies. Like, maybe I&#8217;m not the right person for him because I have a harsh personality, or that we haven&#8217;t talked long enough with just the two of us, or that we haven&#8217;t looked at each other properly lately.”</em></p><p>Those words contained all the truths.</p><p>At the stage when you tried to muster up your courage, you would finally see all that you were lacking.</p><p>“&#8230;It&#8217;s not just about liking the other person, it&#8217;s about how much you can like yourself, huh?”</p><p><em>Can I like myself enough?</em></p><p><em>Enough to be able to confess by Christmas Eve?</em></p><p>“&#8230;Not good. I better go wash my face once.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1594148311"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1932611920"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>Feeling stuck in my thoughts, I let out a deep sigh and raised my upper body when suddenly—</p><p>“&#8230;Acchooo!”</p><p>—I sneezed as hard as I could, probably because I hadn&#8217;t even dried my hair this midwinter.</p><p>“So cold! I should go get the hairdr—<em>huh</em>?”</p><p>Before I finished my word, my eyes caught sight of the screen of my phone, which was still in my hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Displayed on the screen was: <strong>Calling Nanamine Yuzu</strong>.</p><p>“&#8230;No way, no way, no way!”</p><p>Huh? Did I mistap? During that sneeze?</p><p><em>Wh-what to do?! Is there any good reason I can say for making this call? No, before that, I should end this call before she answers—</em></p><p>[Hello!]</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1996780022"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1588033783"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>Alas, before I could execute that thought, I heard Yuzu&#8217;s voice from the receiver.</p><p>I was too late… Now that it had come to this, I should just take the plunge. I faintly took a deep breath and put the phone to my ear.</p><p>“Hello, is this Yuzu?”</p><p>[Yep. This is rare, Yamato-kun actually calls me.]</p><p>It must be my imagination, but the tone of Yuzu’s voice that reached my ear was somewhat bouncy.</p><p>“Um, it’s nothing, just wondering what are you up to?”</p><p>I had no idea of any reason for this call, so I just bullshitted some excuse.</p><p>&nbsp;[I’m just finishing up my homework. I was thinking this was the perfect time to take a break and here you are, giving me a call.]</p><p>Yuzu responded to the conversation without any particular incredulity. I was relieved, but at the same time, I realised that I had been overthinking things and felt irresistibly embarrassed.</p><p>[By the way, Yamato-kun, you’ve completed your homework?]</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1496939621"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1316056607"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>“Of course. It&#8217;s hard to concentrate on the game when there&#8217;s something on my mind.”</p><p>[Yamato-kun, you are always all about games.]</p><p>Even over the phone, I could imagine Yuzu&#8217;s exasperated face.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m the type of man who leads a full life centred around what he likes.”</p><p>“That&#8217;s a good life, but at least focus on me at Christmas.”</p><p>Being interjected with a very sensitive matter, I was dumbstruck.</p><p>“Ow, oh! W-well, that…” I stammered in reply.&nbsp;</p><p>It was unknown what impression she had of me due to that, but after a slight pause, Yuzu spoke.</p><p>[Listen, Yamato-kun, about the ‘Christmas Fulfilment’ event…]</p><p>“What about it?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1674329650"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1650585202"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>[&#8230;.Um, just wondering if you know what time it’ll start. You see, we’ve yet to arrange the time and the place to meet.]</p><p>“Yeah, that’s true.”</p><p>For a moment, I felt that Yuzu was trying to say something different, but over the phone, I couldn&#8217;t make out the finer nuances.</p><p>“On that day, the winter display lights start at sunset——”</p><p>Like that, we continued discussing the day of Christmas Eve for a while.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When most of the matters had been decided and we naturally returned to the flow of chatting again, Yuzu quietly raised her voice.</p><p>[Whoa, it’s already this late. I need to go take a bath.]</p><p>“For real. I didn’t even realise, we’ve been talking on the phone for two hours.”</p><p>I looked at the clock and was startled.</p><p>[So then, Yamato-kun, see you at school tomorrow.]</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>We had greeted our farewells, so I waited for the call to be disconnected.</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1292807769"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-871229022"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>However, for some reason, the phone showed no sign of disconnecting and only Yuzu&#8217;s breathing could be heard.</p><p>“&#8230;You’re not hanging up?”</p><p>[No, it’s kinda difficult to do so… Yamato-kun, you hang up.]</p><p>“Well, okay…”</p><p>At Yuzu&#8217;s request, I attempted to tap the end call icon.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><p>[&#8230;Not hanging up?]</p><p>“I-I’m doing it. I am but…”</p><p>Phone calls could be somewhat unsatisfying because you were unable to see the person&#8217;s face. Therefore, you’d end up wanting to make it last longer.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-321483708"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2034433557"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>[I got it. Let’s hang up together by the count of 3-2-1.]</p><p>Yuzu made such a proposal as if she thought it would be impossible to get anywhere if things continue as they were.</p><p>“Okay, roger.”</p><p>[Then, ready, 3—]</p><p>And just as Yuzu&#8217;s count started, I hung up the phone abruptly.</p><p>“If I don’t do this, the same conversation will only repeat and repeat…” I breathed out with a <em>Phew!</em>&nbsp;</p><p>I suddenly felt like the protagonist of a science fiction film who had escaped from a looping world. As I savoured my small sense of achievement, a text message from Yuzu arrived on my phone.</p><p><strong>[What were you doing, hanging up first?! You traitor!]</strong></p><p>A giggle suddenly escaped my mouth upon reading that text.</p><p>“&#8230;You should be thankful to me that I’ve spared both of us from wasting more time,” I muttered to myself and sensed that my feelings were finally in order.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1941890997"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-745099345"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>Even after disconnecting the call, my pulse was still going fast.</p><p><em>—I don’t know whether I like myself enough yet. But I&#8217;m sure I like myself better when I can properly tell her how I feel than when I was silent for so long because I couldn&#8217;t muster the courage to do so.</em></p><p>==</p><p>A few days after that.</p><p>When I reached our usual waiting spot, Yuzu was already standing there.</p><p>“Ah, Yamato-kun, morning!”</p><p>“Oh, good morning.”</p><p>I raised my hand to Yuzu in response to her fluttering hand wave. Once I had made up my mind, I felt calm and I was able to control my emotions over the last few days as if my previous emotional turmoil had all been a lie.</p><p>“It&#8217;s cold at night, but still so chilly in the morning. I&#8217;m glad I bought the scarf.”</p><p>Yuzu buried her mouth in the orange scarf</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2047392725"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1763791159">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>&#8220;Indeed, it&#8217;s getting colder and colder. I hear it&#8217;s going to get really cold on Christmas Eve.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Really? Then I wonder if it will snow or something.&#8221; Yuzu&#8217;s eyes immediately lit up.</p><p>“If I’m not mistaken, it said a 50% chance of snow.”</p><p>“Fifty-fifty, not bad odds. Shall we also pray for it?” Yuzu muttered while looking up at the sky. I nodded in agreement with her.</p><p>So I made a suggestion, “All right, let&#8217;s go to the shrine and pay our respects.”</p><p>&#8220;To pray for Christmas? Don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;ve got the wrong department?”</p><p>“It&#8217;s all right. They say there are 800 or 10,000 gods and goddesses, so even if one god from a different country is mixed in, they&#8217;ll accept it,” I justified.</p><p>Surely Shintoists, who had a track record of accepting even Buddhas at the time of the introduction of Buddhism, would be fine with it.</p><p>“Yamato-kun, you are so random.”</p><p>“In the first place, being excited about Christmas when you&#8217;re not a Christian is a bit cheeky, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s the same thing.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-541882140"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-407096008"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“If you say that, I have nothing to say in reply.” Yuzu seemed convinced by my argument and broke into a smile.</p><p>With all this talk, we arrived at school.</p><p>As we walked down the corridor past the entryway<span id='easy-footnote-1-91271' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-91271' title='I’ve mentioned before, this is the area where they changed into indoor shoes before stepping indoors, not sure if there’s any specific English term for this area.'><sup>1</sup></a></span> into the school building, I suddenly saw someone with flaxen hair ahead of us.</p><p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Aki. Hey, Aki. Good morning!&#8221; Yuzu, who immediately recognised her friend&#8217;s back, called out to her.</p><p>And when Kotani turned around, her face was somehow slightly twitching.</p><p>“Ah, Yu-Yuzu… And even Izumi.”</p><p>When I looked close, her walking was also stiff like a rusty tin robot.</p><p>“What’s wrong, Aki? Your movement is unlike normal,” Yuzu asked in concern.</p><p>“It-it’s just… a lot happened yesterday.”</p><p>“Ooh… just what happened?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-172541061"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2128972204"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>When Yuzu took a step forward, Kotani’s eyes went haywire, darting around. Before we could say anything, Kotani spun on her heel and made for the stairs.&nbsp;</p><p>“Ah, I&#8217;ll tell you later!” Saying this, she climbed the stairs at a quick pace.</p><p>“&#8230;What was that?”</p><p>“Who knows?”</p><p>Yuzu and I looked at each other in confusion.</p><p>Right at this moment, Namase came from the entryway.</p><p>“Ohh, it’s the Ba-couple<span id='easy-footnote-2-91271' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-91271' title='For those who’ve forgotten, it’s the word play on Baka+couple = dumb couple'><sup>2</sup></a></span>! Morning~”</p><p>The timing of his appearance truly couldn’t be any better.</p><p>“Who’s the Ba-couple? Rather than that, Namase, what’s wrong with Kotani?”&nbsp;</p><p>“She looks off just now, do you know anything?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1075962675"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-538759332"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>Both of us inquired at once. Namase grinned.</p><p>“Yeah, if it’s Aki, she finally managed to ask Sota out on a date. Then, Sota said yes.”</p><p>“What, really? I haven’t heard that!” Yuzu pouted, thinking that she had been left out of the loop.</p><p>“A-haha, don’t be mad. She was probably panicking and forgot to mention it to you.””</p><p>“Hmph… Yet she contacted Keigo.” Yuzu was still irritated.</p><p>Namase hurriedly defended himself, “You see, I also plan to go along on that day.”</p><p>“It’s not good to be a peeping Tom, Namase.”</p><p>“Keigo, you’re a jerk!”</p><p>Namase’s eyes widened when both of us stared at him in disbelief, “N-no! I’m only there to support her if things go south! If Aki fails, there’s no way I can just leave her alone.”</p><p>Aki’s first failure must still be fresh in his mind, so he was making early preparations to give support when needed.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1547913636"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1808837400"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“If that’s so, that’s acceptable&#8230;” Surely, Kotani must have approved of Namase&#8217;s actions, and so we had no right to complain anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>There was just one issue remaining.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>“&#8230;May I know where the date will be? It’ll ruin the plan if she meets other people she knows on the day, so you&#8217;d better choose your location carefully,” Yuzu anxiously voiced my same concern.</p><p>Kotani&#8217;s personality would make it impossible for her to make a public confession in front of people she knew. Hence the need to be thorough in choosing the right place.</p><p>“It’s okay! Sota hasn’t been told about the place—so he can look forward to the surprise—but the place we chose is not somewhere regular people or couples will normally go.”</p><p>“And that place is…?”</p><p>To our question, Namase cheerfully answered, “It’s the ‘Christmas Fulfilment’ event. Yuzu, I’ve told you about this event before, right? In the end, they’re going to participate in that.”</p><p>Yuzu and I froze upon listening to those words. Of all places, their date spot had to overlap with ours.</p><p>“It&#8217;s an event that you two, an established couple, don&#8217;t have any connection to, but if you bump into them on the way, just leave them alone. For Aki too, this second confession is her big gamble. So, see you later!”&nbsp;</p><p>Namase finished saying that and walked away with a smile. Only Yuzu and I remained with a heavy air enveloping both of us.</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2039313036"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1346771257">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“&#8230;”</p><p>Silence ensued, as we were unsure of how to take this situation.</p><p>“Er, somehow our places clash,” Yuzu first broke the silence.</p><p>I awkwardly nodded and mustered up, “Yeah… Well, it does seem appropriate for us to compromise, don’t you think?”</p><p>In the first place, Yuzu and I agreed to ‘date’ in order to help Sakuraba and Kotani to be together. If we ignored that cause, it would negate the very reason for this fake couple&#8217;s existence.</p><p>No, that wouldn’t do.</p><p>“Well, it&#8217;s not like we have to stick to this event, we can just go to another event, so it’s not really a big problem,” Yuzu said with feigned cheerfulness.</p><p>“That’s right. Let’s go search for a new event,” I answered while suppressing my inner turmoil.</p><p>It was still okay. Even if we cancelled our plan to participate in that event, it didn’t erase the fact that I had invited her to a confession event. So, nothing had changed in terms of the situation. I still had a good pretext to actually confess to her.</p><p>“Now that we&#8217;re at this point, let&#8217;s make it a super-luxurious plan. I&#8217;m looking forward to listening to your great ideas, Yamato-kun.&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-98255696"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1889185772"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>“Don&#8217;t raise the bar. I&#8217;m scared.”</p><p>Trying to rally our sinking hearts, we kept up our spirits and continued the conversation.</p><p>But when there were no more students other than us walking down the corridor, Yuzu looked a little more serious.</p><p>“Yamato-kun, there’s one thing I want you to answer me honestly.”</p><p>“&#8230;What is it?”</p><p>I sensed there was something different about Yuzu, so I corrected my posture.</p><p>Then, she looked into my eyes and asked, “Yamato-kun, do you know the meaning behind the ‘Christmas Fulfilment’ event and is it for that reason that you invited me?”</p><p>I was struck speechless.</p><p>For a moment, I dithered on how to answer her. However, at the sight of her straight-looking eyes, I gave up trying to fool her.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu was extremely perceptive of people’s hearts… I was not capable of weaving any lie that could fool her.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-153848968"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-832274538"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“&#8230;Um, I didn’t know at first.”</p><p>At the very least, I didn’t know the reason at the time that I made that invitation. It wasn’t done after mustering up my courage or with full determination; it was a result of a misunderstanding on my part.</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Hearing this, Yuzu smiled a little dolefully.</p><p>“Listen, Yuzu. Even then—”</p><p><em>Ding Dong~ Ding Dong~</em></p><p>Right when I tried to explain myself, the ringing bell indicated that it was five minutes before class.&nbsp;</p><p>“Whoa, it’s already this late. Let’s go now!”</p><p>Yuzu headed for the classroom at a quick pace, as if the bell’s tone was pushing her forward.</p><p>“&#8230;Yeah.”&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-674737625"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1189769906"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>Having lost my timing, I gave up speaking about that and went along with her.</p><p><em>…Even if I explain myself now, it’ll sound like I was just making up excuses on the spot. Let’s tell her when things get a bit calmer.</em></p><p>==</p><p>Lunch break.</p><p>“Yuzu, I have something to talk to you about, is right now okay for you?”</p><p>I headed to Yuzu&#8217;s seat before the reverberations of the bell had died down and tried to create some time alone with her.</p><p>“Oh, I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m going to have lunch with Aki today, so I&#8217;ll see you later,” Yuzu put up her usual smile and declined my invitation.</p><p>For the whole day, I had been trying to talk to her every time we had a break, but each time, she avoided it for this or that reason. The normal me would have backed down at this point, but uncharacteristically I persisted.&nbsp;</p><p>“&#8230;We can’t, no matter what?”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu also seemed a little surprised by this unusual me, but she immediately pasted on a smile that was recognisably fake and shook her head.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-99959762"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-756765451">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“Yeah. You see, I think she wants to talk to me about the Christmas Eve thing. Given our objective, how can I ignore her?&#8221;</p><p><em>The objective of our fake couple, huh?</em></p><p>Once she said that, I couldn’t force my way anymore.</p><p>“&#8230;I got it. But can you please make time for me when you have a moment? I have something to say to you.”</p><p>“Okay, I will… When both of us are calm, okay?” Yuzu left the classroom after dropping these words in my lap.</p><p>It seemed like she had judged that she was still not in a condition of being calm enough to talk properly.</p><p>“&#8230;No, she did say ‘us’, didn’t she?”</p><p>She must’ve sensed my perturbation as well.&nbsp;</p><p>When I let out a sigh, I found that all eyes were on me from all over the classroom. Apparently, my interaction with Yuzu—the central figure of the class—had attracted a lot of attention.&nbsp;</p><p>Feeling uncomfortable, I made my escape from the classroom.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Now, where should I kill time during the lunch break?</p><p>“Literature clubroom… That won’t do, it’ll be troublesome if I bump into Yuzu there. Let’s go to the back of the gymnasium.”</p><p>So I headed to the place that I imagined would be void of people and went down the stairs. I travelled along the first-floor corridor<span id='easy-footnote-1-91277' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-91277' title='Just a note, there is no ‘ground floor’ in Japan, so the first floor is where the ground is, and taking a flight of stairs will take you to the second floor.'><sup>1</sup></a></span> and came to the front of the gymnasium.</p><p>“&#8230;Hm? The door’s open.”</p><p>There was a crack at the door to the gymnasium. It seemed like the person who last used the gymnasium forgot to close it.</p><p>“It’s cold outside, so this is perfect,” I muttered and entered the gymnasium.</p><p>As I thought, someone forgot to lock the door after they left; there was no one inside. And there was a basketball laying on the court.</p><p>“So lazy… they’ll be scolded by the coach this way.”</p><p>I picked the ball and stood on the three-pointer line.&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1895236404"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1261715738"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>I focused my eyes on the hoop and jumped. Using the force from throughout my body and, with a snap of my wrist, I shot the ball. The ball drew a parabolic line as it left my hands and made a dry sound as it was sucked into the hoop.</p><p>“Phew…” I exhaled and let my concentration scatter.</p><p>At the same time, I heard a clapping sound from my back. I turned my head and there was Sakuraba.</p><p>“&#8230;Sakuraba. So you’re the unruly person who just left things here without tidying up.”</p><p>“A-haha. I only went to change into my basketball shoes just now. Well, if you&#8217;re here, you should watch me practise. I want to improve my three-pointer too.&#8221;</p><p>I nodded my head after thinking about it for a while.</p><p>“If it’s only to help you pick up the ball, all right.”</p><p>With my current inner turmoil, it would be better to move my body a little to distract myself. I handed him the ball and moved under the backboard.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>Sakuraba, who had received the ball, got ready at the three-point line. Then, he shot with an overzealous form. The ball missed the target and caromed off the rim.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1602364977"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1419190289">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“Oops, I missed.”</p><p>“You depend too much on your upper body to exert the force. It’s better to bend your knees more.”</p><p>“Roger!”</p><p>Sakuraba followed my advice and corrected his form. As he did that, the ball fell into the hoop on his second attempt.</p><p>“Nice shot!” I complimented him as I caught the ball and passed it back to Sakuraba.</p><p>“Oh, it’s easier to shoot it this way. Izumi, you’re good at teaching.”</p><p>“Well, given my communication skills, that’s a matter of course.”</p><p>“Ahaha. And what kind of an introvert are you to say something like that?”</p><p>While making small talk, I helped Sakuraba practise his shooting.</p><p>In the midst of all this, he suddenly muttered, “&#8230;Aki invited me out for Christmas Eve.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-142476025"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1243234479"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>“I see.” I nodded slightly.</p><p>Sakuraba&#8217;s eyes widened and he snickered, “Izumi, you knew?”</p><p>“Yeah, this morning.”</p><p>Thanks to that, I was also troubled.</p><p>“Maybe I’ll get confessed to again,” Sakuraba calmly mumbled as he shot the ball.</p><p>The ball went through the hoop with a whooshing sound.</p><p>“&#8230;You realised?” I was surprised as I held the ball that had fallen from the net.</p><p>From what Namase told me, Sakuraba should not have known that they were going to participate in the ‘Christmas Fulfilment’ event.</p><p>“Well… I just know from her mood. Aki is easy to read,” Sakuraba replied as he raised his hand to demand the ball from me.</p><p>I passed the ball and continued, “&#8230;You’re going to say yes?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1223360010"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1787591727"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>When asked about the crux of the matter, Sakuraba&#8217;s movement stopped as he was about to shoot.</p><p>“&#8230;Um, I don’t know. I’m thinking maybe I should.”</p><p>After he answered it like that, he made the shot. However, perhaps his mind was in disarray.&nbsp; The ball was rejected by the ring and flew off in an unintended direction.</p><p>“What do you mean by you should?”</p><p>I ignored my role of picking up the ball and looked Sakuraba straight in the eye. As if avoiding my gaze, he went to pick up the ball himself.</p><p>“&#8230;Literally, just as I said. I should accept it this time. During the previous confession, I rejected her and we all scattered. If I reject her again, the same thing will happen, won’t it?”</p><p>“So, you think it’s better to say yes?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Sakuraba nodded as he bounced the ball.</p><p>“&#8230;It’s not my place to say anything, but don’t you feel anything towards Kotani?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1548782667"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1471271348"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>At my question, he closed his eyes as if searching his heart.&nbsp;</p><p>He then slowly answered, “&#8230;It’s not that I feel nothing—I feel she’s cute and I know her good points. Above all, I’m happy she still likes me even after all that happened. But I don’t know exactly how far my feelings go.”</p><p>A fondness for her and a sense of duty to protect the group. Were these two things pointing in the same direction, so that they got mixed up and became indistinguishable?</p><p>“In this situation, I’m not sure if it’s okay to confront her and give her an answer.”</p><p>I bet Sakuraba was the kind of man who would try to respond to favours directed towards him as sincerely as possible. Because of this, last time, he told Kotani that he liked Yuzu, which threw the group into chaos.</p><p>And this was how he was still struggling with it.</p><p>“Sakuraba, you look like a perfect human, yet you’re also a klutz in unexpected ways.”</p><p>He frowned as he accepted my teasing words.</p><p>“If I’m perfect as you say, I wouldn’t need to be deceived or helped by you.”</p><p>“Well, true that.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-296453480"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1114638665"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“Izumi… at first you were only pretending to date Yuzu, right? Was it hard?” Sakuraba inquired, perhaps wanting to take my answer as a reference.</p><p>At his question, I took the chance to look back at the past few months.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>“No… I enjoyed it. Really, the experience has been almost too incredible for me. Personally, I don’t think that a relationship that started out fake is a bad thing.”</p><p>There were times that we had fights and there were times that we were utterly in sync with each other. During the time Yuzu and I were together, I saw a lot of her sides; I felt closer to her each time.</p><p>“It’s just, you just can&#8217;t stay fake forever. Somewhere along the line, you are going to have to face your feelings. In the end, maybe it was simply a way to put things off.”</p><p>There was nothing harder than deceiving yourself. Just like the current me, my heart had suddenly slipped off the reins at a moment’s notice.</p><p>“&#8230;Putting things off? The words of an experienced boyfriend sure strike the heart.” Sakuraba repeated my words as if to digest them.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite not being the perfect human, he was a better person than I was. There was only one thing left I could say to him.</p><p>“You may not be the perfect human, but you’re a good guy. So there’ll be someone to help you. Even if you guys were about to fall apart again, someone will hold you together. You can have a bit more faith in other people, can&#8217;t you?”</p><p>Sakuraba stiffened with wide eyes at my words. Then he chuckled in a relaxed manner. “&#8230;Yeah, that’s right. There’s no need for me to be burdened all alone.”</p><p>“Of course. Namase even came to me to lay some groundwork… Yuzu also wants to offer her support.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1691441074"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-387888587">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>I knew how Yuzu still regretted that she had run away last time. As someone always next to her, I could easily perceive the way she still felt guilty towards her friends and her sadness when things went awkward between them; those feelings were acutely transmitted to me.</p><p>If they were about to fall apart again, Yuzu surely wouldn&#8217;t run away this time and I… I would also support her wish.</p><p>So I was sure they&#8217;d be fine.</p><p>“Thanks, Izumi. That kind of lifted some weight off my shoulders. Thanks to your advice, I&#8217;ll be able to face the decisive day without thinking about extraneous things.&#8221;</p><p>&nbsp;After bowing, Sakuraba released a final shot. The ball traced a beautiful arc before perfectly dropping through the hoop.</p><p>“I’m glad to hear that.”</p><p>Truthfully, I was in no position to worry about others.</p><p>I then added, “Me too… this helped me sort out a lot of things as well.”</p><p>Perhaps it was thanks to having spoken my thoughts to Sakuraba. I, too, felt my restless heart calm down. My feelings remained the same, and what I needed to say was the same too. It was no use being in a hurry now.&nbsp;</p><p>I just needed to wait for Yuzu to finish preparing her mind.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1002178439"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-797152312"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>==<div class="sp-wrap sp-wrap-default"><div class="sp-head" title="Expand"> TL Note</div><div class="sp-body folded"><p><strong>It’s Yuzu’s POV from here</strong></p><div class="spdiv">[collapse]</div></div></div><p>After school hours.</p><p>Yuzu hadn’t stopped by the clubroom but had instead gone to an apparel shop in town. And the person joining her wasn’t Yamato –</p><p>“Yuzu, what do you think about this?”&nbsp;</p><p>The curtain of the fitting room opened, and Aki appeared.</p><p>She was in a white knitted jumper and long black skirt—the kind of fashionable clothes that she didn’t often wear. Seeing her outfit, Yuzu smiled and nodded.</p><p>“Yeah. I think it looks good. But I heard it&#8217;s very cold on Christmas Eve, so you might want to put another layer on. Sota won&#8217;t be happy to see you looking so cold.”</p><p>Today, Yuzu&#8217;s job was to coordinate the clothes that Aki would wear on her Christmas Eve date. Although it was unfortunate that she had to act separately from Yamato, this was also to support her friend.</p><p>Besides… It was also true that she wanted a bit of time to sort out her mind.</p><p>“Wouldn&#8217;t this one be nice?” Yuzu reached for an ash-grey coat that had caught her eye.&nbsp;</p><p>“Mmn… but will this colour be too dark? Matching it with other colours might look good too.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1424456212"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-712261950"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>Yuzu pondered the outfit combinations in her head but soon realised that there was another serious concern.</p><p>“Aki, by the way, I’m just asking…”</p><p>“What is it?” Aki tilted her head in curiosity, but Yuzu’s eyes darted away restlessly.</p><p>“No… It’s just…” Yuzu dithered.</p><p>There was something she needed to confirm but it was difficult to ask… However, she knew she couldn’t keep mum about it.</p><p>“What’s wrong, Yuzu?” Aki gave her friend a quizzical look when Yuzu hesitated.</p><p>Finally, Yuzu made up her mind.&nbsp;</p><p>“Do… Don’t you need to also select the underwear too?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>In response to Yuzu, who came out with a bold statement, Aki made a gaping sound as if she did not understand the meaning of it.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1852060940"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-194352812"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“If it’s underwear, does it matt…er…” However, Aki’s words stopped in their tracks.</p><p>Then she seemed to have understood what Yuzu was concerned about, and she turned red in a flash.</p><p>“Hey, w-what are you thinking?! I-I don&#8217;t need that!”</p><p>“Th-that might be true… But, Sota is also a guy.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu also found the topic pretty embarrassing to talk about, but for the sake of her friend, she overcame her shame.</p><p>“Uuuh…” Aki made a faint groan and froze on the spot before she could respond, “&#8230;I’ll think about it. Later. Just in case.”</p><p>“That’s fine, I guess. Just in case.”</p><p>It was a moment of consensus between the two. Nevertheless, it would be awkward for them to touch on this topic any further.</p><p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s put that aside for now and pick out some general clothes for now.” Yuzu switched the subject, and Aki nodded her head.</p><p>“Let’s do that. Ah, how about this one?” Aki grabbed a coat and Yuzu scrutinised it.</p>

<p>“Hmm, it makes you look mature pretty much… But maybe it suits Aki,” Yuzu mumbled as she considered the clothes coordination.</p><p>At this sight, Aki thoughtfully muttered, “Even so, it&#8217;s been kind of a long time.”</p><p>“What is?”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu raised her head to see her friend languidly smiling back at her.&nbsp;</p><p>“Since the last time the two of us went shopping like this.”</p><p>“Ye…ah. It’s really been a long time.”</p><p>Yuzu was slightly jolted by such casual words from Aki.&nbsp;</p><p>To be more specific, it had been since October—Sota and Aki’s first date. The last trip was also shopping for Aki&#8217;s clothes to prepare for the date.</p><p>Afterwards, Aki’s confession failed, and somehow they both avoided going shopping together. Yuzu had also been surprised when Aki asked her out today, but what was even more surprising was the fact that Aki deliberately mentioned it.</p><p>“Well, I’ve always been hanging out with Yamato-kun lately. I’m sorry, I kinda left you alone.” As though evading the fact, Yuzu brought out a different reason.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-369289906"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-561600583"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>“So true. As soon as you found a man, you were all over each other. I started to think female friendships were so superficial, you know?” As if buying into Yuzu’s excuse, Aki also teased her friend in a joking tone,</p><p>“A-haha! It seems I&#8217;m a woman who lives for love more than I thought.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu exhaled a sigh of relief, thinking she had escaped the dangerous topic.</p><p>“&#8230;Right. If you really were that kind of girl, it might have been easier for both of us. I&#8217;m sorry, Yuzu.” Aki turned a somewhat forlorn apologetic smile towards&nbsp; Yuzu.</p><p>&nbsp;“What’s wrong?” Yuzu probed in bafflement. “You don’t have anything to apologise for.”</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Aki cast down her eyes and mustered her voice to reply, “&#8230;In truth, I’m still very much scared. Scared that Sota will reject me again, but more than that, scared that everyone will fall apart again. Even now, I can’t say that we’re back to how we used to be.”</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><p>As Aki bared her heart, Yuzu was at a loss for words.</p><p>An invisible wall was definitely still present amongst the four of them: Yuzu avoiding going shopping for clothes with Aki, Sota smiling as if nothing had happened immediately after being rejected by Yuzu, and Keigo scrambling to avoid any two of them being alone. Indeed, a line that should not be crossed had been established.</p><p>“Before, Izumi dealt with it somehow. But&#8230; if Sota rejects me again and says he likes Yuzu again, will you and I be able to spend time together like this again?”</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>There was nothing Yuzu could say—she was not in a position to do so.</p><p>As someone who ran away from everyone last time, could she even have a say in it? Yuzu was afraid of being resented by Aki and thought that things would turn out well if she herself was out of the picture; that was why she eventually ran away in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>As Yuzu was immersed in that train of thought, Aki firmly grabbed her hand.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-326061660"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1292685568"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>“Despite it all, Yuzu, I&#8217;m still going to move on. So I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; Aki then spoke of her resolve with a determined expression; her hand cold and trembling.&nbsp;</p><p>Her inner struggle was probably yet to disappear. Nevertheless, she chose to move on.</p><p>“Seems like I&#8217;m also a woman who lives for love,” Aki snickered, feeling helpless at her own self.</p><p>Seeing this, Yuzu felt close to tears. Aki, the person who had probably been hurt the most at the time, was now moving forward. Yet, Yuzu couldn’t find the right words to say.&nbsp;</p><p>If this continued, nothing would change from that time. No, that would be utterly disappointing.</p><p>“&#8230;It’s going to be okay, Aki. This time will be all right. I also won’t run away.” Tightly gripping Aki&#8217;s hand back, Yuzu formed her best smile and conveyed her feelings. “I’m also moving forward. And this time, I promise – I’ll stick with you. On Christmas Eve, I’ll also go along with Keigo to watch over you two.”</p><p>Even if the confession were to fail, she would be the first one to rush to Aki&#8217;s side—to tell her that they would never be torn apart over something like this again.</p><p>When Yuzu swore so with determination, Aki looked surprised.</p><p>“But, Yuzu and Izumi…”</p><p>Being told that, Yuzu wavered for a moment in time.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-116092827"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1144064249"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>They had made a promise to spend Christmas Eve together. The other party asked her out to the ‘Christmas Fulfilment’ event. Alas, it was purely a misunderstanding. There was nothing special behind that invitation.</p><p>Yuzu and Yamato were merely a fake couple. A roleplay created in order to pave the way for the relationship between Sota and Aki.</p><p>“No problem. It just happened that our plan also went bust. Yamato-kun will surely understand.” Yuzu blew away one of her unresolved feelings with a cheerful tone of voice.</p><p><em>—Sorry Yamato-kun.</em></p><p>==<strong>Back to Yamato’s POV</strong></p><p><strong>[I have something to say, is it okay to meet now?]</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>It was after 7 p.m. when I received such a text message from Yuzu.</p><p>This was a godsend for me, as I had been told that she was going shopping with Kotani after school, so I hadn&#8217;t been able to find time to talk to her.</p><p><strong>[I got it. I’ll go to your house.]&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I replied so and wore my overcoat. Leaving the house, I contemplated what I was going to say as I rode my bike through the night.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2085607770"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1534246989">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“&#8230;I wonder how I should clear up this misunderstanding.”</p><p>I had simulated the situation many times in my mind so as not to make a mistake in the way I initiated the conversation. However, it seemed that my impatience made my legs quicken, so I arrived at my destination earlier than I had expected.</p><p>The apartment building was already so familiar to me. On the stairs in front of the entrance, I saw a girl sitting down.</p><p>“Yuzu,” I called out to her after I stopped my bicycle.</p><p>She then stood up and walked in my direction. “Sorry for calling you this late.”</p><p>Yuzu had a surprisingly calm expression on her face, it made me a little out of sorts.</p><p>“It’s nothing… I also want to meet you.”</p><p>I was afraid that things would have been awkward due to this morning, but Yuzu seemed to me like she had completely let the matter go. Did going out with Kotani help distract her?</p><p>“Really, then that’s good,” Yuzu curtly replied.</p><p>The conversation simply cut off midway.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-179199245"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-791850400"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“So, what do you want to talk about?”&nbsp;</p><p>Unable to bear the weight of the air, I cut to the chase and Yuzu nodded her head one time before opening her mouth.</p><p>“Yes. I have something to apologise to Yamato-kun.”</p><p>“&#8230;What is it?” I had a bad premonition, so I braced myself.</p><p>Yuzu then bowed her head to me, “Sorry, Yamato-kun. On Christmas Eve, I can’t spend time with you.”</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><p>It was thanks to me having braced myself beforehand that I managed to only end up speechless. Even then, there was a raging storm inside me; it took me a few seconds before I could open my mouth.</p><p>“May I ask for the reason?” I was relieved that the voice I finally wrung out wasn&#8217;t trembling.</p><p>Yuzu stared at me with eyes that concealed her emotions. “It’s Aki’s momentous event…so, I want to be by her side.”</p><p><em>So is this how things turn out?</em></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1027238851"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-237646711">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>That was my first thought. It was beyond my expectation, but not the least bit surprising.</p><p>I knew that Yuzu had always regretted running away the last time. So this time, she decided to stand her ground. There was absolutely no reason for me to stand in her way.</p><p>“Okay, nothing I can do about it then.”</p><p>When I nodded my head, having stifled my emotions with logic, Yuzu instantly made an apologetic face.</p><p>“&#8230;I&#8217;m really sorry. For suddenly saying all this.”</p><p>“It&#8217;s okay. That&#8217;s our role, isn&#8217;t it?” I forced a smile while saying this.</p><p>My desire to also support her wish was not a lie, nor can I turn it into a lie. So that was why… I couldn’t possibly hold her back.</p><p>“Well, I’ll surely find some ways to enjoy myself on that day. There’s also a lot of new games coming out during the Christmas sales that I want to check out,” I threw out empty words in an attempt to reassure her.</p><p>Yuzu quietly nodded, “&#8230;Okay. Thank you.”&nbsp;</p><p>Silence.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-31516600"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-591197412"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>Our conversation was already over. The misunderstanding that I needed to clear… Uh, too late to even bring that up anymore.</p><p>“Then, I’ll see you at school.”</p><p>“Yeah, see you.”</p><p>After bidding our farewells, I turned on my heel and headed toward my bicycle.</p><p><em>*bump*</em></p><p>Suddenly, Yuzu hugged me from behind.</p><p>“&#8230;Are you going to have a good time? With me absent?”</p><p>“Yuzu…”</p><p>I didn&#8217;t know how to respond to that sultry sound of her voice. For several seconds, I stiffened, unable to find the right words.&nbsp;</p><p>And then, Yuzu quietly pulled away. When I looked back, there was a slightly sad smile on her face.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-434507257"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1421359990"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, that was a weird thing to say. Even though I&#8217;m making you go along with my selfishness.&#8221;</p><p>She then walked toward the apartment building with a smile on her face.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really heading home this time. See you tomorrow!&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu walked away and I watched her go off disappearing into the distance before breathing out heavily.</p><p>The only thing that happened was that our plans for the event were scrapped. And this was by no means a bad cancellation. It might even be worthwhile considering the fact that Yuzu was adopting a more positive attitude towards the whole thing.&nbsp;</p><p>“But then, why…”</p><p><em>Why do I feel like I&#8217;ve lost such a big thing?</em></p>
