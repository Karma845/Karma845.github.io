<h3>Afterwords</h3>

<p>Long time no see. I&#8217;m Mikami Kota.</p><p>Well, I finally managed to successfully publish the third volume&#8230; Well, this time was a difficult delivery&#8230;</p><p>I had a lot of trouble deciding how to develop it, but I thought, well, this is the best I can do. The following is a bit of a spoiler, so if you haven&#8217;t read the main story, please stand back.</p><p>Now, the content of this issue has gone much deeper into their relationship. My frank impression is: “Oh, they&#8217;re getting together already? So soon?”</p><p>Isn&#8217;t romantic comedy more of a genre where the story is full of teases and taunts, and you want to shout, “You guys should get together already!”</p><p>There was an option to develop the story in that way, but I intentionally did not. Because this work is always going full throttle. I always try to have the series move at maximum pace so that, if the series ended here, the enthusiasm wouldn’t subside.</p><p>So this time, ‘Tokkawa’ (the official abbreviation, which is not at all widespread) has reached a major milestone. Whether or not I will be able to write a continuation is not up to me, but if I do, I will try my best again to go all out.</p><p>Finally, I would like to express my thanks to the following people:</p><p>-Saine-sensei for drawing the illustrations again.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-750882765"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1370307805"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>-My editor, who I’ve caused the most trouble in the past because of my slow writing.</p><p>-The proofreader who I heavily inconvenienced this time.</p><p>-All the other people involved in this book.</p><p>-And to all the readers who have stuck with me this far.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>Minami Kota</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ysh0FXcvwhFb4xbCi5xMTGZ6txHscBnkfxaSJ6bblAuhAAsHGasG7EIUaorcPz-LS6dW8HTbTFef6xWr27YkxiptntpEhJxoj3emAkX8HB_E3dg3MYogTefRNHnd6z524o0kTlZPoId6CQ0biRzxMs81o40h6sWZEekyWlBKQzbBD8aLl0hMxauF8g" alt="" /></figure></div>
