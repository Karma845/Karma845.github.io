<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; The Feelings Of Love For Yuzu-Chan Are Real, Aren&#8217;t They?</h3>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sudden, but I&#8217;d like to take measures against the cold in winter soon!&#8221;</p><p>In the literature club room as usual.&nbsp;</p><p>After we had finished playing games and were getting ready to go home, Yuzu suddenly made that announcement.</p><p>Her semi-long hair was slightly dyed just to a point that won&#8217;t be reprimanded by the teachers, her eyes were big and double-lidded. I didn’t want to admit this, but she was indeed pretty, and this pretty girl was currently hunching her head and rubbing her hands together due to the cold.&nbsp;</p><p>“Well, it&#8217;s December.&#8221; I nodded my head in agreement at Yuzu, who had unusually made a constructive comment, and then I looked out the window as well.</p><p>Even though it was only five o&#8217;clock, the sun had completely set and it was dark.</p><p>Since the literature club room was being used without permission, there was obviously no heating system, so once the sun had fallen and the gaming devices had been put away, the only source of heat in the space were our bodies.</p><p>&#8220;Right? It&#8217;s just too hard to be out there in the cold this time of year without anything to protect ourselves.&#8221;</p><p>Generally speaking, girls were more vulnerable to the cold temperatures than boys, and Yuzu was no exception—she looked like couldn’t bear it.</p><p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m cute when I&#8217;m cold and rubbing my hands together.&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1358336002"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1911912655"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p><em>Correction. She could still bear it very much.</em></p><p>&#8220;Narcissists with boiling heads in the winter aside, it sure is cold and it would be nice if we could borrow a heater.&#8221;</p><p>Even if it was still bearable now, it would be tough in the upcoming months.</p><p>&#8220;Hmmm&#8230;there is no chance of borrowing a heater at this time of the year,&#8221; Yuzu remarked.</p><p>Even Yuzu with lots of connections didn’t seem as if she’d be able to help with this one. Well, there wouldn’t be anyone who would have extra heaters to give us in this cold weather.</p><p>&#8220;I agree. An easier way to deal with the cold would be&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Oh? Were you just thinking about how warm it would be if the two of us were stuck together?&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>I looked at Yuzu, who had made the mysterious allegations against me.</p><p>&#8220;That idea never occured to me at all. I&#8217;ve never thought of sticking with you, and I never will.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Why not? You should always think about that.&#8221;</p><p>I snickered at Yuzu&#8217;s words. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but when I&#8217;m in this room, all I think about is games. I&#8217;m just a gamer, shaking off any evil thoughts while facing the game.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Why are you acting like a seeker of the enlightenment?! What truth are you trying to achieve through gaming?&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1018496357"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1264182463"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_4/home_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22210777382"></div></div></div><p><em>A seeker of the enlightenment sounds kinda cool, I want to embrace it positively.</em></p><p>&#8220;When I think about it, being cold like this is part of my training.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Training? For Yamato, playing games is not a hobby, but a form of training?!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;And being with Yuzu is also training.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;What does that mean? What do you mean?!&#8221;</p><p>Yuzu&#8217;s cheeks puffed up, and I thought for a moment before answering.</p><p>“The mental strength to keep silent without saying anything unnecessary, I guess.”</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s already an unnecessary thing to say!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Oh, beautifully put!&#8221;</p><p><em>She got me there.</em></p><p>I was honestly convinced, but Yuzu gave me a stern look, &#8220;That&#8217;s not the part for you to be impressed by! Let&#8217;s get back to the subject. Anyway, we need to protect ourselves from the cold.&#8221;</p><p>Yuzu forcefully changed the subject. I nodded lightly and went along with it since I didn&#8217;t want to continue the nonsensical conversation.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-179040206"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1572412278"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_2/home_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777385"></div></div></div><p>&#8220;Realistically, could we use something like a pocket body warmer?&nbsp;</p><p>&#8221; “That could work, but pocket warmers are a costly expense that will add up painfully fast. And they’re not reusable.”</p><p>&#8220;I agree.&#8221;</p><p>For a high school student on an allowance, the price could add up to become a body blow to me.</p><p>&#8220;The best way to do this is to wear thicker clothes, right? Gloves&#8230; will make it hard to play the games, so a scarf is a safe bet.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Eh, I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221; For some reason, Yuzu was reluctant to accept my extremely reasonable suggestion.</p><p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the problem with it?&#8221; When I asked her this, she lightly touched the jewelry shining on her chest. A necklace in the shape of a clover, which I had given her as a gift at the school festival.</p><p>&#8220;If I wear a scarf, the necklace Yamato-kun gave me couldn’t be seen.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Oh, okay,&#8221; I was caught by surprise and my heart inadvertently thumped.</p><p>However, this was a bad move against this peculiar person called Yuzu.</p><p>Immediately, she grinned and showed an annoying smile.</p><p>&#8220;How was it? Am I cute just now? Did your heart skip a beat? Really, sorry for suddenly acting as a picture-perfect girlfriend. But I&#8217;m just being cute as I am, so forgive me?&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-1827969831"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-105858041"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_1/home_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777373"></div></div></div><p>&#8220;Your annoyingness just shot through the roof!&#8221;</p><p>I must say, she was truly amazing to be able to annoy the hell out of me at such terrifying speed without any aid.</p><p>“You seem to be in good spirits even though you said it’s cold, so no need to do anything.” I gave in to the sudden annoyance and let out a sigh.&nbsp;</p><p>For some reason, Yuzu&#8217;s smile deepened even more, &#8220;Yamato-kun, you mean you want me to wear clothes that show the necklace all the time, don&#8217;t you? Oh my goodness, don&#8217;t you love me too much?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always trying to put a positive spin on things, no matter how it turns out! You have a heart of steel!”</p><p>She was a girl who was already an expert at rising above repeated failures and could now even gain benefits from them</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be happy to wear a scarf if it&#8217;s one Yamato picked out for me. Then, I can feel your love even if I can&#8217;t see the necklace. So, for our next date, let&#8217;s choose my scarf.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made your plans so easily, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p><p>Well, it was not a bad thing for me as well. If an item as small as a scarf could solve one of my difficulties—namely planning a date—that was not a bad idea.</p><p>At the very least, it was a more meaningful use of money than just buying consumable pocket body warmers in the long run.</p><p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ve got final exams coming up, so our next date won&#8217;t be for quite a while, though, will it?&#8221; As the conversation concluded, Yuzu suddenly decided to turn the tables on me.</p><p>&#8220;Hey, hey, in the end, you’ll still be cold for a while, won’t you?&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter" style="float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; " id="foxaholic-378779846"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-953684440"><!-- 71161633/home_incontent_5/home_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777379"></div></div></div><p>When I was already dismayed at the busted plan, Yuzu laughed mischievously and entwined her arm around mine.</p><p>&#8220;So, until I buy a scarf, I&#8217;m going to do as Yamato-kun first suggested and protect myself from the cold like this. This is how I’m going to make do.&#8221;</p><p>The body warmth and softness were transmitted from close contact, and above all, Yuzu&#8217;s eyes were at close range.</p><p>I felt shy and looked away from her eyes on the spur of the moment.</p><p>&#8220;&#8230;I didn’t make that suggestion, that&#8217;s for sure.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You didn’t? Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter either way. It&#8217;s a perk for you, too, Yamato.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;By any chance, are you gonna do this until the final exam is over?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I guess so. Yamato-kun, you really are so blessed,&#8221; Yuzu was in high spirits and was showing her usual narcissistic personality.</p><p>But to me, it looked fake.</p><p>&#8220;I guess so. It seems that when humans are shy, their body temperature rises. Yuzu is so warm now, so it helps me a lot.&#8221;</p><p>When I said that to throw her off balance, Yuzu&#8217;s expression instantly twitched.</p><p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not shy.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to force yourself, okay? I already know your defence is only paper-thin.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really not shy!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yuzu-chan is really cute, even though she&#8217;s shy. She wants to get close to me while hiding her embarrassment.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t even think about it that way! I was just feeling cold! I really was!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;And the reason why you set the date for buying the scarf so far away until after the final exam is&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Aah! Aah! I can&#8217;t hear you!&#8221; Yuzu cut me off with a loud voice.</p><p>I stopped further pursuit with the mercy of a samurai, and she then placed her forehead against my arm.</p><p>&#8220;&#8230;Yamato-kun&#8217;s so mean.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Even while complaining, Yuzu didn&#8217;t try to get away from me.</p>
 
 <p><br /></p>
 
<p>Lately, Yuzu has been increasingly initiating skin contact with me. The trigger was undoubtedly the cultural festival a month ago. Our days as a fake couple started again and I was reunited with my friend from junior high school, Hina.&nbsp;</p><p>After that event, in which I came to terms with my past and we reached a big climax as a fake couple, something in us undoubtedly started to change little by little.</p><p>“Anyhow, I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what kind of scarf Yamato-kun will choose for me.”</p><p>After leaving the clubroom, Yuzu blatantly raised the bar for choosing her scarf, as if to get back at me for teasing her earlier.</p><p>“Don&#8217;t set the bar too high.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#8217;t want her to be disappointed on that day, so I cautioned her in advance.</p><p>“Really? I think this necklace you gave me is rather nice.”</p><p>“That&#8217;s— I only found it by chance.”</p><p>For a moment, I almost said it was because I had asked Hina about a good shop to choose from, but it was obvious that Yuzu&#8217;s mood would deteriorate if I did so; I quietly reconsidered my words.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1802325245"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-734073460"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“I see. I feel like I blatantly saw the shadow of a girl there, but I&#8217;ll let it slide in return for your consideration in not mentioning her name. You better appreciate my generosity as your girlfriend.”</p><p>“Thank you very much. This time I&#8217;ll pick the item out by myself.”</p><p>Well, I used to pick out clothes for Hina, and I&#8217;d studied a bit about women&#8217;s fashion for that, so I should be able to barely manage.</p><p>&#8220;Mmm, so you&#8217;ve been thinking about other girls again.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Are you someone with extrasensory perception?&#8221;</p><p>Possibly because she was super high calibre, Yuzu apparently even showed some psychic insight.</p><p>“Well, it&#8217;s called a woman&#8217;s intuition. As long as I&#8217;m your girlfriend, you can&#8217;t cheat on me.”</p><p><em>What a frightening woman…</em></p><p>“I have no such intentions to begin with. I’m fully devoted to Yuzu-chan, you see?” I spat out in capitulation and Yuzu nodded her head in satisfaction.</p><p>“That&#8217;s good to know. By the way, I don&#8217;t have a big budget for the scarf. Please don&#8217;t choose anything too expensive.&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2080429022"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-518957362"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>I completely assumed it was going to be a present from me, but she actually planned to pay for it herself.</p><p>“I don&#8217;t mind paying for at least one scarf,” I offered, but Yuzu shook her head.</p><p>“Nah, it’s okay. There’s Christmas around the corner, so it’s better to save up.”</p><p>It seemed that she was being considerate. Since I would likely buy an expensive scarf to put on a show, she wanted to avoid that.&nbsp;</p><p>This thoughtfulness of hers struck my heart.</p><p>&nbsp;“I see&#8230; I almost forgot that Christmas is also important to me, so I should save up. Thanks for your consideration.”</p><p>When I obediently nodded, Yuzu was a little surprised.</p><p>“Huh? Yamato-kun, do you also look forward to Christmas day? I honestly thought you’d be someone who finds it troublesome.”</p><p>“How can that be? There’s a lot of interesting titles to be released this year.”</p><p>“Titles…? What are you talking about?” Yuzu was baffled.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-853687384"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-111663451"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“I’m talking about the Christmas games sale. In this season, a lot of makers are releasing their featured titles.”</p><p>“THAT?! You’re thinking of games at this kind of time?”</p><p>As a senior gamer, I kindly taught her a few things, but surprisingly she did not respond well.</p><p>“Eh, Christmas is all about games, right?”</p><p>Yuzu looked at me with incredulous eyes as I was getting a bit confused.</p><p>“Of course not! How much of an RPG idiot are you?! Stupid! Idiot! The most unpopular guy in the whole of Asia!”</p><p>“What on Earth is that insult?”</p><p>Bewildered, I was unable to keep up with Yuzu’s abrupt mood change.&nbsp;</p><p>“In what world does a boyfriend talk about games when his girlfriend broaches the subject of Christmas?!”</p><p>“In our current world.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-621273139"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1398997528"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>“Such a world should just perish! Shouldn&#8217;t it be about time that games and I swap places on your list of priorities?!” Yuzu yelled, irritated.</p><p>“Even if you ask me that… games are fun.”</p><p>“Isn’t it fun when you are together with Yuzu-chan?!”</p><p>Well, now that we’ve come this far, I wouldn’t deny that. Unfortunately, there was still one big problem.</p><p>“Just think about it. When I’m with you, we’re always playing games, aren’t we? That means when I am increasing my favorability of Yuzu, at the same time my favorability of games is also increasing.”</p><p>“What an unexpected pitfall! I think I&#8217;ll ban playing games in the literature clubroom now!”</p><p><em>Oh no, at this rate, a ban on games will be issued out of anger. I must appease her somehow.</em></p><p>“No, it&#8217;s not that I neglected Yuzu-chan for the sake of playing games.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Explain…?” Yuzu&#8217;s lips twitched but she toned her anger down as if she were at least listening to my plea.</p><p>“You see, I thought Yuzu might be spending time with Kotani and the others during Christmas.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1272017311"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-382120858"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>Our status was that of a fake couple. A relationship that was specially created to keep Yuzu&#8217;s social relationships running without a hitch.</p><p>“Well, that’s…”</p><p>Yuzu also nodded with a complicated expression, like she had been drained of her venom, probably because she felt that my argument made sense.</p><p>After a slightly troubled pause, she continued, “But if I have a boyfriend and we don&#8217;t spend Christmas together, it’s going to be suspicious. In times like this, we need to spend time together.”</p><p><em>Well, that&#8217;s reasonable, and if Yuzu wants to do that, I have no reason to refuse.</em></p><p>“That&#8217;s certainly true. Then, let&#8217;s go somewhere together for Christmas.”</p><p>When I deliberately invited her, Yuzu’s expression brightened.</p><p>“Yes! I’m looking forward to it! Anyway, you have plans ready?”</p><p>“Do you think a guy who was just a few minutes ago preoccupied with the Christmas games sale would have one?”</p><p>“&#8230;Nope.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-135208282"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-716903732"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>Yuzu&#8217;s bright face reverted to a sour look.</p><p>“Right? On that note, Yuzu, if you look forward to Christmas that much, you must have a place you want to go, don&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ll leave it to you to decide where to go,” I fully passed the job to her but Yuzu blatantly puckered her lips.</p><p>“That’s okay, too… Well, I have no expectations of Yamato-kun anyway… But sometimes, I kinda want Yamato-kun to take the lead. It&#8217;s a special day, after all…” Yuzu coquettishly made a sulky comment.</p><p>When she said it like this, I couldn&#8217;t avoid giving it some thought too.</p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
<p>“All right. Then we&#8217;ll both go to the game shop.”</p><p>“You don’t understand, do you?! Clearly, you haven’t got that Christmas sale out of your head!”</p><p>My answer that contained my lingering feeling for games only made Yuzu seriously pissed off and she glared at me with icy eyes.</p><p>“Yamato-kun, no matter how much time passes, you will just never gain the awareness of being a boyfriend, will you?”</p><p>“Well, I’m fake anyway…”</p><p>I tried to knock down a straight argument, but perhaps that displeased Yuzu, and her expression became even grimmer.</p><p>“But the feelings of love for Yuzu-chan are real, aren&#8217;t they? Okay, I&#8217;ve made up my mind. I&#8217;ve decided to ban games in the clubroom after all,” Yuzu cut me off.</p><p>“WAIT A MINUTE!” I hurriedly put a stop to Yuzu as she was about to carry out the final ultimatum.</p><p>“I won’t. You better reflect on the Christmas matter.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1239961429"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-398185242"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“No, I already reflected a lot, as deep as the Mariana Trench<span id='easy-footnote-1-91351' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-91351' title='Trivia: Mariana Trench is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth located in the western Pacific Ocean about 200 kilometres east of the Mariana Islands'><sup>1</sup></a></span>.”</p><p>“I can’t trust you.”</p><p>It seemed that in the past few minutes I had completely lost Yuzu&#8217;s trust in me and her mood was not picking up.</p><p><em>Darn it… I must do something.</em></p><p>“Then at least give me a chance. I&#8217;ll think about it properly this time.”</p><p>“&#8230;Really?”</p><p>Perhaps my desperate pleas reached her, Yuzu&#8217;s attitude softened a little. I nodded repeatedly as if to pry open the slightest possible gap.</p><p>“Really. Please, give me a chance to prove my love for Yuzu-chan.”</p><p>“Mmm&#8230; I don&#8217;t feel bad when you say so. Okay, I&#8217;ll give you one chance.”</p><p>“Thank you for your blessing.”&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-191262845"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-275202668">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>I was relieved that the sanction had been successfully withdrawn.</p><p>“Well, go and plan a nice Christmas date by next week. If I like it, we&#8217;ll let bygones be bygones for now.”</p><p>“&#8217;&#8230;By the way, what if you don&#8217;t like it&#8230;?”</p><p>“I&#8217;ll confiscate all the memory cards in the clubroom.”</p><p>“You&#8217;re a devil!” I almost screamed at this extreme punishment.</p><p>Unlike modern game consoles, which were capable of storing save data on their own, the retro game console we were using in the clubroom could only store saved data on an artefact from the ancient relic called a memory card.</p><p>“Fufufu. Go ahead and taste the hell of not being able to save no matter how far you go in the game,” Yuzu smiled wickedly, perhaps satisfied with the look of fear and horror on my face.</p><p>“What a pointless system… Holy cow!”</p><p>Did my indifference to Christmas create a demon?</p><p>“Now I’m really looking forward to next week. Right, Yamato-kun?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1383999102"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1258426432"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>I glared back at Yuzu, who sent me an amused look, setting my teeth on edge.</p><p>“Damn… I’ll never be defeated. I&#8217;m going to make a perfect Christmas date plan and shut you up.&#8221;</p><p>The declaration of war, very much unlike an exchange between a couple, echoed through the night streets.</p><p>==</p><p>It was a weekday, the day after that night of my declaration of war.</p><p>Even though it was lunchtime, I didn&#8217;t eat with Yuzu, but sat at the root of a tree in the backyard, chewing on a piece of bread and staring at my phone.</p><p>“I need to think up a suitable plan for Christmas…”</p><p>With a sense of urgency, I searched for information, but nothing seemed to feel right.</p><p>“<strong>Christmas at a famous theme park</strong>… That will surely be crowded to death, and I doubt I can get a ticket in the first place.<strong> Exclusive Christmas meal plan</strong>&#8230; That is too expensive. I&#8217;m a high school student, you know!”</p><p>The internet had always been a place where old information from years ago lingered on, and where business people would write stealth articles to promote their products. And when it involved a big event like Christmas, the amount of information was already overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-803853176"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1977994864">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>It was difficult to find the information I wanted.</p><p>“In the first place, there are just too many events that cost money. Again, I’m telling you, I’m just a high school student!”</p><p>Many of the articles by corporations were aimed at working people with strong financial resources or were date plans that required people to spend a lot of money. Couldn’t there be an event just right for me? Affordable, with a good mood and easy to enjoy.</p><p>“Sigh… Isn’t there anything nice? An event that is affordable, with a good mood and easy to enjoy?” A voice of a girl suddenly entered my ears.</p><p>I looked around in surprise since the content was so identical to what I had in mind. Then, just on the other side of the tree that I was leaning against, I saw flaxen hair fluttering in the air.</p><p>“&#8230;Kotani?” When I called her name, the girl on the other side of the tree turned around warily.</p><p>She had flaxen hair and a well-defined face. It turned out to be Kotani Aki as I had guessed. She was also holding a smartphone in her hand as if she was doing some research.</p><p>“Isn’t this Izumi? I didn&#8217;t recognise you at all, aren&#8217;t you a little too blended in the background?&#8221; Kotani widened her eyes in surprise upon discovering me.</p><p>“Leave that be. That’s my strength,” I somewhat defiantly countered and received a bemused look from Kotani.</p><p>“What kind of strength is that… Rather than that, what are you doing here?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1917743066"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1524442094"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“Nothing much, I’m just having my lunch.”</p><p>“Heh… Alone without Yuzu?”</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders at her curious words.</p><p>“I also have a time like this. But isn’t it rare for you to be by yourself there?”</p><p>It didn’t look like she was waiting for Sakuraba, she must’ve been here to think alone.</p><p>“&#8230;I also have times where I’m alone like this.”</p><p>“I see.” I nodded and our conversation ended.</p><p>Although we were connected through Yuzu, Kotani and I had very little contact with each other. If we were complete strangers, we could just ignore each other, but the fact that we weren’t was extremely troublesome.</p><p>Thanks to that, my introverted trait of being comfortable talking about business but being incapable of making small talk, reared its head.</p><p>“&#8230;May I ask, what are you planning on Christmas with Yuzu?”</p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
<p>In contrast to me, Kotani was the extrovert among extroverts. She could continue the conversation despite my lacking self.&nbsp;</p><p>“Well, we’re planning to go on a date,” I answered.</p><p>“Ohhh… By any chance, were you thinking of a date plan by yourself here?”</p><p>“Yeah, something like that. If I come up with a lame plan, there’ll be a game ban, so I’m desperate now.”</p><p>Kotani sneered at my sudden grumble, “Is that so? I’m so jealous.”</p><p>“&#8230;In that course of conversation, was there anything to be jealous of?”&nbsp;</p><p>I was baffled, and then Kotani nodded with a sigh.</p><p>“Of course there is. You can go on a date with someone you like with certainty.”</p><p>There, I gleaned what she was searching for on the phone.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1156823614"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1427245235"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>“Kotani, aren’t you inviting Sota out?”</p><p>As soon as I asked her that, Kotani blushed.</p><p>“&#8230;I will. Perhaps, maybe, probably.”</p><p>“The number of your words is proportional to your anxiousness.”&nbsp;</p><p>I absent-mindedly retorted and she snapped her face away to another direction as she began fiddling with her hair.</p><p>“Shut up. You’re so lucky. I heard you got confessed to by the other party.”</p><p>“That’s right, I was so shocked at the time. It somewhat felt like suddenly encountering a traffic accident, I guess?” I recollected with nostalgia.</p><p>Kotani made a doubtful face. “Your metaphor has not the slightest bit of love in it… Oh yes, during that time, it was a farce, was it?”</p><p>“Well.”</p><p><em>We are still a fake couple even now.</em></p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-905843720"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-255939807"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>“I see… So, now you’re really dating, so one of you must’ve confessed, right? What was the situation like?”</p><p>“Why do you wanna know so much?”</p><p>It was rare for Kotani to be interested in me this much.</p><p>“Just tell me, it’s not like you’re gonna lose anything.”</p><p>Kotani still pressed on despite the awkwardness. It seemed like she really wanted data on confessing that much.</p><p>“Okay… The second time was also from Yuzu. I’d never thought that in such a short span of time, I’d encounter a traffic accident twice.”</p><p>“Again, there’s no hint of love.”</p><p>My nostalgic recounting was once again greeted by Kotani’s doubtful face.</p><p>“You can’t say that. I love Yuzu in my own way.”</p><p>It would be troublesome to be doubted, so I simply displayed my lovey-dovey feeling for Yuzu. That somehow made Kotani relieved and she slightly chuckled.&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1681061588"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1526270257"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“That’s right. And it also looks like you cherish Yuzu, right?” She said somewhat insinuatingly as she pointed to her own neck.</p><p>If there was any meaning in that… Oh, that could only mean the necklace.</p><p>“&#8230;You heard from Yuzu?”</p><p>“Well, of course, I’d be curious if she keeps wearing the same thing. So, for once, I asked her about it and she lovingly bragged quite a lot. Glad to hear things went well for you two.”</p><p>“&#8230;Well, thanks.”</p><p>Yuzu, did she brag about my present? Imagining that situation made me feel embarrassed. No, it didn’t make me feel bad somehow.</p><p>“You’re a blessed guy to have a girlfriend who would exude that lovey-dovey aura when talking about you. So jealous.”</p><p>After teasing me for a bit, Kotani seemed to remember her own love situation and let out a deep sigh of frustration.</p><p>Her nerves were really stretched thin…</p><p>Anyway, it was my and Yuzu’s mission as a fake couple to arrange for them to be together. So, I couldn’t simply leave her be.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2055804107"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2008211650"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>“If you’re that worried, why don’t I help you with your date plan?”</p><p>When I offered, Kotani&#8217;s movements abruptly halted. Then she looked at me with a more serious expression.</p><p>“&#8230;It’s okay. Previously, you also helped me out so much to set up the date. If I repeat that, I won’t be making any progress.”</p><p>“&#8230;I see.”</p><p>If Kotani said it like that, I had no reason to impose myself.</p><p>“Well, I appreciate your feelings. I confessed once, got rejected, and I learned something from that.”</p><p>“&#8230;And that is?”</p><p>Intrigued by the way she spoke, I asked her about it, and she showed neither regret nor embarrassment but began to speak frankly.</p><p>“When I’m about to confess, all I can see is my own inadequacies. Like, maybe I&#8217;m not the right person for him because I have a harsh personality, or that we haven&#8217;t talked long enough with just the two of us, or that we haven&#8217;t looked at each other properly lately.”</p><p>Her words were laden with conviction, and I couldn&#8217;t help but listen.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-896533979"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-201538329"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“The parts of me that I normally don&#8217;t bother with or I unconsciously look away from are exactly the ones that come into play at that moment. So when I make the confession, the important thing is not only how much I like the other person, but also how much I like myself.”</p><p>“&#8230;That makes sense,” I interjected.</p><p>Mental preparation prior to confession and self-confidence; she painfully learned from her bitter failure that she was lacking in these areas.</p><p>She then added, “Yes. So instead of relying on someone else to set the stage for me like before, I&#8217;ll first make sure I can properly ask someone out on a date by myself. Only then can I think about confessing my feelings.”</p><p>If she was this determined, I shouldn&#8217;t do anything unnecessary.</p><p>“All right. I&#8217;ll just support you from the sidelines.”</p><p>“Please do so. Besides, you must be fully occupied with your own date, so it’ll be bad for me to ask for your help.”</p><p>Kotani’s words laced with teasing made me helplessly shrink back.</p><p>“Seriously, there’s nothing that hits home when I search for plans on the internet. Isn’t there anything that is affordable and can make Yuzu happy?”</p><p>It was just the right opportunity, so I should ask Kotani, who was close to Yuzu, for some tips.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1548714353"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1373805421"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“Hmm… How about going to see some winter light displays? It’s only strolling in town so you pay nothing, and it’s beautiful.”</p><p>The answer she gave after mulling it over for quite a bit was advice that unexpectedly hit the nail on the head.</p><p>“Oh, that’s just what I’m looking for! I’ll check immediately if there’s any suitable winter light events nearby.”&nbsp;</p><p>With my mind awhirl, I tried to search the internet on my phone.</p><p>“If you’re looking for events nearby, won’t it be better to find information in local publications rather than on the internet? They should have more detailed information and the latest updates.”</p><p>“I see, what a perfect piece of advice. Thanks, Kotani!”</p><p>Feeling so much enlightened, I thanked her and she wore a somewhat serene expression.</p><p>“Well, this is in return for your help before.”</p><p>“&#8230;Oh. In that case, I’ll graciously accept it.”&nbsp;</p><p>I returned a smile to Kotani.</p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
 <p>After school hours.</p><p>Yuzu had other plans so I separated from her and walked alone in front of the train station. I had one objective: to follow Kotani’s advice by getting a magazine from a bookstore.</p><p>“&#8230;And yet, no matter where I look, the Christmas vibe is everywhere.”</p><p>In December, the city had completely entered Christmas mode, with the early sights of trees and the melody of jingle bells. Even Father Christmas, with his impetuous nature, would not get into Christmas mode this early.</p><p>Thinking of such nonsense, I entered a large bookstore in front of the station.</p><p>“Welcome~”</p><p>When I entered the bookstore, I was greeted by the voice of one of its staff and the air that had been warmed by the heating system. The warmth soothed my body, which had been exposed to the outside winter air for so long.</p><p>At the same time as I felt&nbsp; subtly relaxed, something tugged at the corner of my mind.</p><p>“&#8230;Where have I heard that staffer’s voice before?” My head tilted in thought&nbsp; as I proceeded through the shop.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1597696086"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-362561918"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>Then, I felt a gaze from behind me.</p><p>“Eh, is that Yamato?”</p><p>I was suddenly called by name, and I reflexively turned back towards the voice.</p><p>There was a girl with long hair pulled back into a ponytail and wearing an apron that looked like a school uniform. She was my friend Hinano Hiiragi.</p><p>“What’s wrong, why are you here?” She wore a surprised expression as she walked in my direction.</p><p>“Nothing’s wrong, just looking for some magazines… But you Hina, I never knew you worked here.”</p><p>“Yep, just for a short term. You see, I need to prepare for the year-end holiday,” Hina beamed, though with a little abashment.</p><p>Then it occurred to me.</p><p>“Oh, you made plans to go out with friends?”</p><p>“Well yeah. The girls from the basketball team plan to hold a Christmas party.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1712796859"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1995740857"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>Just as I thought. Hina had always made this kind of face when she reported that she had been invited by a friend. Even now that her personality had brightened up considerably, apparently this habit still stuck with her.</p><p>“Christmas party with the girls&#8217; basketball team…? So nostalgic.”</p><p>“Fufu… Yamato, you wanna come too?” Hina teasingly invited me when she saw me staring into space.</p><p>“Don’t joke. I’m a guy who vowed to never again set foot in a girls’ gathering.”</p><p>When we were in middle school, Hina once invited me to the Christmas party held by the girls’ basketball team. At the time, I was worried about Hina, who was still not yet used to social interactions and was sure to be nervous in a gathering of many people, so I decided to participate together with her.</p><p>“Oh right, Yamato, you were told that guys should not be present in a girls’ gathering and were forced to be a Santa in a miniskirt as a punishment after all.”</p><p>“Don’t remind me of that!” I frowned and glared at Hina who just evoked my trauma.</p><p>However, she took no notice of that as she just shrugged her shoulders and said, “It suited you, you know?”</p><p>“No way I’d be happy hearing that! That’ll only give me a greater shock, okay?!”</p><p>I denied it with all my might, and then Hina lightly touched the hairpin she had on her head.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2069384252"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2042359964"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“Even though you used to wear a girls’ hairpin so willingly?”</p><p>“If you mention that, how can I say anything anymore!” I was struck speechless when she knocked me down with my darkest history.</p><p><em>Just why did I buy such a thing?</em></p><p>“&#8230;Talking about things to wear, Hina, will you be doing alright? At that time, you even refused the invitation, saying that you didn’t know what to wear.”</p><p>“Ugk! I-I’m already doing fine. That time as well, I went there no problem,” Hina flinched at my counterattack.</p><p>But I didn’t let that slip and dealt her another blow.</p><p>“Ah, to be more accurate, it was that you wanted to refuse because you didn’t know what to wear, but you had no courage to refuse so you had no choice but to go, or was I mistaken?”</p><p>“D-don’t remind me of that unnecessary stuff…!”</p><p>Hina was gradually reddened as I counterattacked, exposing her dark history..</p><p>“I remember that time I helped you pick out the clothes and you managed to pull through. What do you say, do you want me to help you pick out clothes this time too?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-743289442"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-183452668"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>“No-no need! I properly have clothes to wear to the party!”</p><p>We glared at each other as we exposed the other’s dark histories.</p><p>“&#8230;This is going nowhere.”</p><p>“&#8230;Yep.”</p><p>In the end, however, after realising that the exchange produced nothing for either party, a truce agreement was reached between us.</p><p>“Geez, Yamato has become so mean,” Hina protested with her cheeks puffed.</p><p>“The same goes for you. You becoming a bright person also comes with this problem<span id='easy-footnote-1-91359' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-91359' title='as in her becoming a brighter/more social person has also led to her being meaner/more willing to attack him'><sup>1</sup></a></span>,” I scowled as I stared at her.&nbsp;</p><p>Our stare-off lasted for a few seconds before we burst into laughter as both of us found this to be so stupid.</p><p>“Well, if Yamato-kun is having fun, there’s no problem.”</p><p>“The same also goes for you.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-694880521"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-390751589"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>And so Hina resumed organising the bookshelves while continuing to chat.</p><p>“Back on topic, Yamato is spending Christmas with Nanamine-san, right?”</p><p>“Well, yeah,”&nbsp; I nodded honestly, though a bit shyly.</p><p>“I see, so you’ve decided where to go?”</p><p>“Not yet. That’s the reason I came here. Is there any local magazine that introduces Christmas Eve events around here?”</p><p>Since the girls&#8217; basketball team was also planning a Christmas party, I bet they had checked out the events to be held around here. Thinking that I might’ve found the right person to get the information, I asked her.&nbsp;</p><p>Hina quickly took out some magazines from the bookshelves.</p><p>“This, and this. Also…this one? Yep.” She passed me several magazines she had taken out.</p><p>If I were to buy all these, it would cost me so much money.</p><p>“&#8230;You gave me so many. Do you have any recommendations among them?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1164858682"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2116520629"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“All of them.”</p><p>“&#8230;You’re so good at sales.”</p><p>At my begrudging look, Hina beamed at me with a mischievous smile that I could never imagine in her old self.</p><p>“That was a joke. This one might be good,” Hina picked one out of the pile.</p><p>“Hngh… You, you really have become mean.”</p><p>“That’s rude. I was simply being a nice person who recommended magazines to her friend who was trying to save money on Christmas,” Hina nonchalantly replied.</p><p>Well, what she said wasn’t wrong, though.</p><p>“That’s right. Since you did me a favour this time, when you find someone you like, I’ll support you with all I can.”</p><p>“Huh? What’s that advance crime notice? Scary~” Hina finally gave me a shuddering look as I shot her a super refreshing smile.</p><p>In the end, we both went to the cashier and she handled my payment.</p>
 
  <p><br /></p>
  
<p>“Phew… Just one magazine, but it hurt my wallet. I should also get a short-term part-time job.”</p><p>A magazine was a surprisingly large expense for a high school student.</p><p>“Then, how about the garbage cleaning job at the train station front? There’ll be an event there on Christmas Eve, so they’re recruiting people to pick up the garbage.”</p><p>“That’s a good suggestion, but… A Holy Night strewed with garbage—oh so sinful!”</p><p>“Truly. Humans are creatures that can’t live without making a mess.” Hina chuckled as she put my magazine into a paper bag and passed it to me.</p><p>“Tell me when you’ve decided where to go. I’ll try my best to avoid going to the same place.”</p><p>Certainly, from how it went during the cultural festival, Yuzu was wary of Hina. Meeting her boyfriend&#8217;s female friend at on Christmas Eve might put a damper on Yuzu&#8217;s mood.</p><p>“Thank you for your consideration.”</p><p>It was strangely embarrassing to be given this kind of consideration by a long-time acquaintance, much less by Hina, when I’d been the one supporting her for so long.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1523081019"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2049767533"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>As I expressed my gratitude in an embarrassed manner, she smiled a little teasingly at me, “Well, if Nanamine-san dumps you before Christmas, you can join the girls&#8217; party over here.”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>So I took the paper bag from Hina, who had tacked on a few unnecessary words, and walked out of the shop.</p><p>Afterwards, I entered a fast-food restaurant right next to the bookshop, ordered only a coffee and started reading a magazine. The magazines were recommended directly by the bookstore staff and covered all the information I wanted at the moment.</p><p>Among them, there was one event that caught my attention.</p><p>“<strong>Christmas Fulfilment event</strong>…?”</p><p>Apparently, this event would be held on Christmas Eve in the town one station away from here. Photos from last year&#8217;s event showed that all the buildings on the street in front of the station were decorated with LED lights, and a large fountain reflected the city lights and shone beautifully.</p><p>“Wow… This looks nice.”</p><p>It was nearby, and it wouldn’t cost me much money, and also the dreamy atmosphere would be well received by girls.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go with this!”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-375416670"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-73873395"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>I skimmed the article on the event and slammed the magazine shut.</p><p>—At the time, I didn’t know my action of not properly reading the article would eventually be choking me later on.</p><p>==</p><div class="sp-wrap sp-wrap-default"><div class="sp-head" title="Expand"> T/N</div><div class="sp-body folded"><p><strong>Yuzu’s POV</strong></p><div class="spdiv">[collapse]</div></div></div><p>“Welcome~ One person?”</p><p>After school hours.</p><p>After going separate ways with Yamato, saying that she already had plans with other people, Yuzu went to a cafe.</p><p>“Ah, I think my friends are already here,” Yuzu excused herself to enter the shop and discovered Aki and Keigo who had reached the cafe before her.</p><p>Today, Yuzu cancelled her usual after-school time with Yamato to spend time with these people instead.</p><p>“Sorry I made you people wait. What about Sota?”</p><p>She lightly greeted her two friends as she approached them and they raised their heads from looking at their phones in response.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1229083946"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1772097899"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>“Yo, Yuzu-cchi.

So, what are you two watching so fervently just now?” Yuzu asked while she sat beside Aki.</p><p>Aki froze for a while before she could reply, “&#8230;Just a bit, about the Christmas thing.”</p><p>Looking at Aki’s stiffness, Yuzu could guess what was bothering her. To confirm her thoughts, she looked at Keigo, who noticed the meaning behind her gaze. He nodded.</p><p>“Aki apparently is going to invite Sota on a date.”</p><p>“Ohh… So she’s resolved.” Staring at Aki, Yuzu felt surprised and convinced at the same time.</p><p>“Yeah, well…but I don’t know if I can properly ask him out,” Aki was shy but didn’t deny Namase’s words.</p><p>“So, this is a meeting to work on the plan?” Aki leaned forward to ask, to which Keigo nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Yes, it is. This is Aki’s big challenge, we’ve got to gear up and select the best stage for her confession!”&nbsp;</p><p>At the words of the overzealous Keigo, Aki glanced up and looked startled.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-194911911"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-816109455">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“N-no, I haven’t decided to confess! It would be good enough if I could just go on a date.”</p><p>Aki hadn’t thought that far ahead, so she blushed at just the thought. Seeing that, Yuzu happily nodded.</p><p>“All right. For Aki’s sake, let’s do our best to find the best stage to confess!”</p><p>“Yuzu too?!” Aki’s eyes widened, astounded by Yuzu who also started to get hyped up despite Aki’s protests.</p><p>“You see, Yuzu-cchi also says the same, so make up your mind already!”</p><p>“No way! My heart is not prepared yet!” Aki shook her head vigorously, declining Keigo’s offer.</p><p>“Geez, it’s winter yet you’re all so heated up. I’ll go cool down my head.” Aki said in an attempt to escape the topic…&nbsp;</p><p>She then actually made a short run to the restroom.</p><p>“I could feel her growth… but Aki is still inexperienced and fainthearted when it comes to romance,” Keigo chuckled while watching her off.</p><p>“Well, that’s exactly what’s so cute about Aki.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1331136277"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-913356238"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>One wouldn&#8217;t guess it from the way she looked just now, but she was usually an imposing girl, no matter who she was dealing with, and her sense of self was unshakeable.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu, who had always been good at conforming to others and not being herself, had been dazzled by Kotani’s character and envied her—a girl who attracted people just by being herself, without any deception. Yuzu was also attracted to that and became her friend&#8230;&nbsp;</p><p>But for some reason, Kotani was such a reserved person when it came to romance.&nbsp;</p><p>“I agree with that. But I think it’s high time for her to take on the challenge,” Keigo nodded to Yuzu&#8217;s words with a gentle wry smile.</p><p>“As a matter of fact, what do you think are Aki&#8217;s odds of success?”&nbsp;</p><p>On the surface, Yuzu touched the topic as if nothing was wrong, but in Yuzu’s perspective, it was difficult for her to probe deeply into the matter between Aki and Sota; the relationship between the two was unclear to Yuzu.</p><p>“I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s fifty-fifty. It&#8217;s not impossible, but it&#8217;s not a sure thing. That&#8217;s why I was hoping for a romantic event to give it some momentum.”</p><p>If that was how Keigo viewed it, then the credibility would be high.</p><p>“Fifty-fifty…? At this point, would it be good to confess?” Yuzu hesitated at these not-so-high odds.</p><p>“Yeah, now is the best time.” Keigo, however, nodded his head, exuding a firm will. “Once their relationship is fixed, there won’t be any further changes. This time, Sota will try to maintain the status quo in our group and I think Aki will follow his will. If there&#8217;s going to be a change, now is possibly the last time.&#8221;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-234707365"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-623708681"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>Keigo&#8217;s words, which showed a glimpse of seriousness and a sense of crisis, had a certain persuasive power. Yuzu also reached the same answer after rounds of questioning inside her head.</p><p>Once the fake couple was dissolved, Yuzu and Yamato became friends. The relationship was cosy and&#8230; therefore frightening.&nbsp;</p><p>Would Yuzu and Yamato’s own relationship remain the same and never progress?</p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
<p>“Besides, I had just found the perfect event.”&nbsp;</p><p>Keigo took out a magazine from his bag and showed it to her.</p><p>“What&#8217;s this&#8230; &#8216;Christmas Fulfilment&#8217;?”</p><p>The name of the event was listed along with a picture of the beautiful winter light display. Apparently, it was an event to be held on Christmas Eve at a neighbouring station.</p><p>Yuzu inquired further, “So this is the perfect event you said?”&nbsp;</p><p>It was indeed a beautiful view, but there were plenty of other options for something as good as this. Yuzu found it nice that the venue was close by, but she didn’t get any other impression that appealed to her.</p><p>“Yeah, actually this event is special in that you invite your crush there and hold your confession. A lot of people come here for that, so it&#8217;s perfect, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p><p>“I see…”</p><p>If the event had such an objective, it might be just the right one. However, there remained one major problem.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1964479992"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1559837726"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>“&#8230;But isn&#8217;t that the same as confessing to someone when you invite them to this event?” When Yuzu pointed out this fatal flaw, for some reason Keigo chuckled.</p><p>“Yeah. So, without telling Aki anything, I recommended her to invite Sota to this event. That way, she won&#8217;t have to be brave and her confession will already be realised without her knowing about it.”</p><p>“You’re so crafty…”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu was exasperated, but Keigo only shrugged like he had said nothing wrong.</p><p>“It’s for my important friends’ sake, so I don’t mind playing dirty. In truth, don’t you also think this is just perfect?”</p><p>With a smile, Yuzu nodded at his words, , “Yes, I suppose so. Except for one mistake.”</p><p>“Mistake? What mistake?”</p><p>&nbsp;Yuzu quietly pointed at the perplexed Keigo’s back, “Look behind you.”</p><p>“What an interesting plan you have there, Keigo.”</p><p>There was Aki, who had heard everything. At once, blood drained from Keigo&#8217;s face.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1608655508"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2085529131">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“N-no, this is…”</p><p>“What? I’ll listen to any excuse you have.”</p><p>“Nothing! I’m sorry!” Keigo was instantly defeated by Aki&#8217;s tremendous pressure.</p><p>With these two friends absorbed, Yuzu stared at the photos of the &#8216;Christmas Fulfilment’. A fantastic landscape of vivid winter light displays and fountains; the perfect situation for a confession.</p><p>“&#8230;I don&#8217;t think he would invite me to this kind of thing, though.” Without thinking, a sigh was spilled from Yuzu&#8217;s mouth concerning a different matter.&nbsp;</p><p>He said he would think of a date plan, but she wondered to what extent he would actually commit to it. Her boyfriend had always been an ever-elusive one.</p><p>“He did work hard during the cultural festival, but this time…”</p><p><em>Would it be too extravagant for me to demand that once again?</em></p><p>Perhaps Yuzu’s worries were shown on her face, Aki’s attention was drawn this way while she was intimidating Keigo.</p><p>“What’s wrong, Yuzu?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1556800387"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-544348555"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>“Nuh-uh, it’s nothing.”</p><p>To her bewildered friend, Yuzu concealed her real thoughts with a smile.</p><p>==<div class="sp-wrap sp-wrap-default"><div class="sp-head" title="Expand"> T/N</div><div class="sp-body folded"><p><strong>Back to Yamato’s POV</strong></p><div class="spdiv">[collapse]</div></div></div><p>Exactly one week had passed since Yuzu assigned me to plan a Christmas date.</p><p>“Well, today is the deadline for telling me the date plan, have you thought it through properly without running away?”</p><p>In the literature club room after school. Today, when the promised date arrived, Yuzu and I were confronting each other face-to-face.</p><p>“Of course. I&#8217;m a guy who&#8217;s good at levelling up. I&#8217;ve raised my level as a boyfriend exactly this past week,&#8221; I smiled smugly back at her as I already had the plan all prepared.</p><p>Having decided on the main event, I spent a week planning the day&#8217;s activities and assessing all possible problems.&nbsp;</p><p>I would present her with a date plan that was perfect and flawless.</p><p>“Wow, that&#8217;s something to look forward to,” Yuzu also smiled like a demon king and toyed with the multiple memory cards in the palm of her hand.</p><p>If my date plan was not well received, I would have to say goodbye to those memory cards forever. Little devices filled with irreplaceable memories and saved data that held the key to unlocking the future. Without fail, I&#8217;d protect it.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1549098658"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1090476480"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>“Well then, Yamato! Announce your date plan!”</p><p>In answer to Yuzu&#8217;s command, I nodded my head.</p><p>“Here… it is!” I took out of my bag a magazine I bought a few days ago. “We’re going to take part in this ‘Christmas Fulfilment’ event! This is my plan!”&nbsp;</p><p>With determination, I unleashed my best move. So now, what would be Yuzu&#8217;s ruling?</p><p>There was a long pause before she exclaimed, “&#8230;Huh?”</p><p>In front of me, who watched with bated breath, Yuzu stiffened with a blank look on her face. The memory cards fell out of her hand.</p><p>“Whoa!” I caught the memory cards on pure reflex, just before they hit the floor.</p><p>&#8220;Th-that was close&#8230; I almost lost my saved data.&#8221;</p><p>After letting out a sigh of relief, I glanced up at Yuzu.</p><p>“Hey, Yuzu! What are you doing all of a sudden? Ah, could it be that you didn&#8217;t like my plan, so you tried to destroy the memory cards&#8230;?”&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-166214889"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-348494836"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>When I timidly asked her about it, Yuzu behaved oddly before suddenly returning to her senses.</p><p>“N-nothing. I didn&#8217;t think Yamato would invite me to such an event, so I was so surprised.”</p><p>Apparently, she had thought I would come up with the lamest plan of them all. That was quite a shock.&nbsp;</p><p>​​Yuzu then for some reason looked at me with a flabbergasted expression on her face.</p><p>“Um, for the record, did anyone instigate you to choose that event or anything like that?” She asked curiously.</p><p>For a moment, the faces of Kotani and Hina flickered in my mind, but it wasn&#8217;t like they were instigating me.</p><p>“No, I chose it myself. This is hundred percent my choice.”</p><p>I wouldn&#8217;t want her to invoke her woman&#8217;s intuition again like she did when we had the talk about the scarf, so I assured her of that.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu then turned her head downwards in embarrassment. “Re-really…so you chose it yourself.”</p><p>How should I take this reaction of Yuzu&#8217;s?</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1465028836"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2141851124"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“I chose this one after some serious thought too. I want you to understand that.”</p><p>I concluded that I had no choice but to push with sincerity and decided to try to persuade her using the psychology of demonstrating my seriousness.</p><p>“Yo-you’re serious? Ehh, oohh… Hmm.”</p><p>Yuzu was looking very fidgety as she hemmed and hawed. Although she seemed restless, her mouth was slightly slackened. What kind of mental state was she in?</p><p>&#8230;No, wait. How could Yuzu, who always had a clear attitude, be so vague? If this wasn&#8217;t fidgeting, it might have been frustration? Maybe she didn&#8217;t like it at all!</p><p>“I-if you don’t like this, I can think of other plans too…?”</p><p>I suddenly became weak-kneed because I was so desperate for the memory cards. Under pressure, I was a pathetic man.</p><p>“N-no, you don’t have to! Not at all!”</p><p>However, Yuzu was surprisingly flustered and rushed to reject the idea.</p><p>“Really? But you don’t look like you’re so into it.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2075287490"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1011106572"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>“No, nothing like that… I’m okay with this…” Yuzu was somehow red up to her neck.</p><p>Huh, why? Was there any reason for her to flush red? By any chance, was that anger? Was she suppressing her anger?</p><p>“No, you don’t have to force yourself. I want to hear your true feelings.”</p><p>It would be no good if she complained about it later on. Or even worse, if she destroyed the memory card at that time. Thinking about it this way, I asked her to confirm her feelings aloud, but in addition to flushing red, her eyes also started to dart in every direction.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pnvcrpiRQIJMCFAVhtE48N8G7i5HDN-EQgLBMgCKtr_2jjPne2mJ1d1KW0n67pZMm7bLUUikJUNR82wpmY7JL0vbpCcvCC7xM7v1bhDlmq7q2ozdsnM3D-Pb-0iFoprlVL5_MBQkZJpJCiOpxXeQ-Jk" alt="" width="380" height="550" /></figure></div><p>“Fe-feelings…? I do feel, happy…”</p><p>“Seriously?”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu&#8217;s somewhat faltering way of saying that further increased my suspicions.</p><p>“I-I’m serious. I really am happy…! Isn’t that enough already!”</p><p>I didn&#8217;t know why, but Yuzu was on the verge of getting KO’ed. Something about this made me feel uncomfortable like I was bullying her further; anyway, if she was happy with it, then I didn&#8217;t need to bother complaining.</p><p>In other words, it seemed my memory cards were safe.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-298332347"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-993382364"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“Okay, so that&#8217;s settled then. No punishment for me.”</p><p>When I reminded her, Yuzu fidgeted like a small animal, but took one deep breath and nodded her head.</p><p>“AHH… I got it! I’ll prepare myself too…!”</p>

 <p><br /></p>
 
<p>Nevertheless, why was she so nervous about it? For me, Christmas was just an event that was about the release of a new game, but for a girl, it might be something much bigger.</p><p>Or maybe something else bothered her&#8230; Oh, there was indeed that one thing.</p><p>“Come to think of it, what about Sakuraba and Kotani?”&nbsp;</p><p>I suddenly thought of them. In the end, was Kotani able to ask Sakuraba out on a date? Probably because of my success over here, I began to wonder about her, who had borrowed my strength.</p><p>&#8220;Aki said she&#8217;d do her best to ask him out. Sota will also have his schedule free, so I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll refuse. Keigo seems to want to have her confess there.&#8221;</p><p>I see. So they too were apparently going through a critical phase, just as expected.</p><p>“I see. Yeah, I think it&#8217;s good. Confessing at Christmas, that&#8217;s the classic way to go.”</p><p>“Th-that’s right.”</p><p>For some reason, Yuzu nodded awkwardly as if it were her own personal matter. She seemingly had a great deal of emotional attachment to Kotani.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-780170362"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1695627127"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>“Confessing in a beautiful setting, with beautiful scenery and a nice atmosphere, would probably have a higher success rate than usual, and it&#8217;s just the right time.”</p><p>“Ooo… Well, Yamato-kun especially will think so.”</p><p>“Yeah, this doesn’t just concern them. I hope Kotani’s confession will go well.”</p><p>After all, Yuzu and I had been working so hard to make things work out for them. In any case, I hoped that it would end happily.</p><p>“Doesn’t just concern them… You resonate that much… So Yamato-kun also…” Yuzu looked down and mumbled something in a low voice.&nbsp;</p><p>Why was she even red up to her ears? Did she catch a cold?</p><p>“Hey, are you feeling sick? Even your ears are red.”</p><p>When I asked her, Yuzu looked up as if she was shocked and shook her head.</p><p>“No, it&#8217;s not like that! It&#8217;s just that when I think about Christmas for a minute, it just comes naturally!”</p><p>“Okay… It’s fine if you’re okay.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-118314948"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1705812284"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>I wondered if it was a psychological thing?</p><p>Hm, come to think of it, when I was a member of the basketball club, just thinking about going to club activities before an important game or when a tough practice was announced would stress me out and make me feel somewhat ill.</p><p>Yuzu&#8217;s symptoms might be the same as that. That just meant that she was that worried about Kotani and the others.</p><p>“​​Take it easy, okay? If you want, we can go to the infirmary, okay?”</p><p>When I approached her to support her, she jumped back with a start.</p><p>“I-I’m okay!”</p><p>“I, I see,” Somehow I felt like I was being shunned and I was shocked.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was feeling slightly depressed, Yuzu&#8217;s eyes swam as if she was troubled, then she picked up her own bag.</p><p>“I’m fine! I’m fine but… I need to prepare myself a bit, so I&#8217;m going home today! I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow!”</p><p>“Oh, okay.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1314134487"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1948602499"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>Without waiting for me to nod, pushed by the momentum, Yuzu ran off like the wind.</p><p>“&#8230;What on Earth was wrong with her?”</p><p>Yuzu had always been strange, but I felt that there was something weird about her today that was different from her usual odd behaviour. As I mulled it over in my head, I picked up my own bag too.</p><p>I couldn&#8217;t go on with the game alone, so I&#8217;d have to go home today. I put the memory card back in the console and then left the clubroom.</p><p>“&#8230;Oh, by the way, there is someone I have to inform of my plans.”</p><p>I suddenly remembered that I had promised Hina that I would report my Christmas plans to her. So, I took out my phone to call her, but then I thought about it, that girl was in the middle of club activities; her stuff would probably all be thrown in the locker until the club activities are over.</p><p>“I could just leave a message but&#8230;hmm.”</p><p>I somehow just got a free schedule right now. This was just nice, I might as well pass the time and show up at the gymnasium.</p><p>I thought so on a whim and changed course.</p><p>==</p><p>Stepping into the gymnasium, I was surrounded by a heat that I could not believe in early December. The temperature created by a group of exercising people; this brought back nostalgia.</p><p>“The girls team… they should be at the court on the other side.”</p><p>Of the two basketball courts, they apparently were practising at the rear today. This meant that I had to cut through the court of the men&#8217;s basketball team practising in the front, but I didn&#8217;t want to do that in my school uniform; as an outsider, it would have been conspicuous.</p><p>“&#8230;Hm? Isn’t this Izumi, why are you here?”</p><p>As I was having second thoughts, one of the club members who was stretching on the men&#8217;s basketball court noticed me. He had freshly-cut short hair, a model-like height and a well-defined face.</p><p>Sakuraba Sota, the pride of our class and a friend of Yuzu and the others.</p><p>“Sorry, did I disturb you all?”</p><p>“No, we’re in the middle of break. Oh, you’re not together with Yuzu today.”</p><p>“We were together till just now, then this and that happened.”</p><p>I didn&#8217;t know how to explain Yuzu&#8217;s situation, so I muddled it up a bit. Perhaps that had the opposite effect, Sakuraba anxiously furrowed his brow.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-927481540"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1779239149"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>“Eh, did you two get into a fight by any chance?”</p><p>“Now and again we&#8217;ve had fights, but not this time. Well, what can I say&#8230; Understanding a girl’s mind is difficult.”&nbsp;</p><p>Sakuraba, seeing that I am at a loss to explain, sensed something and wryly smiled, “Well, when you&#8217;re in a relationship, things happen. Sorry, that was tactless.”</p><p>“No, don&#8217;t worry about it.”</p><p>And there the conversation stopped for once.</p>
 
  <p><br /></p>
  
<p>I could have said goodbye there, but I had some things on my mind, so I decided to continue talking a little longer.</p><p>“&#8230;.How&#8217;s your leg?”</p><p>A little over a month ago, he was injured in an accident at the cultural festival. Since then, his injuries had been healed and he no longer seemed to have any problems with his daily life, but I wondered if it had affected his basketball game in any way.</p><p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m all better now. Now I&#8217;m finally going to be a regular player,&#8221; Sakuraba replied with a carefree smile.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that.&#8221;</p><p>I was a little relieved to see that he didn&#8217;t seem to be straining himself. In a way, as someone who was present at the scene, I was a bit concerned about it; so, it was good to hear it directly from the man himself.</p><p>“I owe it all to Izumi, who took over for me at that time. If I had pushed myself too hard there, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to come back yet.”</p><p>“Don&#8217;t worry about it. I didn&#8217;t do much and it was a good opportunity for me too.”</p><p>That time gave me a lot to look back on. And it was Yuzu who substituted for Sakuraba in the first place. I really didn&#8217;t do much for him. I mean, seriously, I didn&#8217;t do anything.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-418018107"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1648998012"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“If things are going so well, it looks like you&#8217;ll have plenty of time for Christmas,” I continued.</p><p>Perhaps because I was talking about this with Yuzu earlier, I suddenly remembered and broached the subject. It would be beneficial to find out more about his feelings at the moment.</p><p>“Well. I haven&#8217;t made any plans yet, so I&#8217;m going to talk to Keigo and the others about it. Izumi, you’re going out with Yuzu?”</p><p>“Yes, tentatively.” My reply was rather brusque.</p><p>I was not sure how Sakuraba was feeling about Yuzu at the moment. Normally, I would believe his words that he has already broken it off and talk about Yuzu as if nothing had happened on the surface, but at a delicate time like this, the distance I should place between us suddenly became difficult to gauge.</p><p>“Don&#8217;t sweat it so much. If it&#8217;s about Yuzu, I&#8217;ve already sorted my feelings properly.” Perhaps sensing my hesitation, Sakuraba encouraged me with a bitter smile.</p><p>“Sorry, I do know that, but still. Well, I’m glad you’ve got it properly sorted out. If Sakuraba is still after Yuzu, I&#8217;d be too anxious and have insomnia,” I deliberately offered a light-hearted remark in order to dispel the heavy mood.</p><p>Then Sakuraba smiled back at me, “It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m not dragging it out as much as people think. See, I&#8217;m popular. I won’t always get hung up on a single girl.”</p><p>“It does feel like that when you say it, that pisses me off…”</p><p>I was overwhelmed by his tremendous ikemen<span id='easy-footnote-1-91373' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-91373' title='Just a note, Ikemen means ‘hot, charming guys’.'><sup>1</sup></a></span> aura and was impressed despite myself.&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1899850293"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2030492903"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>“Haha, I was waiting for you to retort, though.”</p><p>“That only works when comedians do it. It’s too much for me when you come to me like that.”</p><p>“What a pity,” Sakuraba slumped his shoulders.</p><p>When the chit-chat had died down, Sakuraba cut to the chase, “By the way, Izumi, didn’t you come here to do something?”</p><p>“Ah, I’m just looking for Hina…Hiiragi for a bit,” I honestly answered, but I was glared at by him in return.</p><p>“Owh? You’re cheating?”</p><p>“If that’s the case, I’ll keep it a secret from you, Sakuraba. I’d get punched otherwise.”</p><p>“Indeed. I’d give you the mightiest straight punch I could muster.”&nbsp;</p><p>Sakuraba shadowboxed with a half-serious look in his eyes.</p><p>“That’s scary, I’ll keep that in mind. See you later.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-308089121"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1888617325"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>“Yeah, later.”</p><p>I slightly raised my hand to say goodbye, and Sakuraba also lightly replied.</p><p>Perhaps because I had spent so much time chatting with Sakuraba, the attention on me had already faded, so I headed down to the girls&#8217; basketball team without feeling particularly uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>“Hina!” I called out to Hina who was on a break.</p><p>She turned her head towards me. “Whoa, it’s Yamato. It’s rare for you to come to the gymnasium. You made up your mind to join the basketball club?”</p><p>I shook my head at her hopeful, glittering eyes.</p><p>“I won’t. I just want to talk to you about the matter from the other day.”</p><p>Hina was a little disappointed at my rejection.</p><p>“Oh, so it’s about Christmas. You’ve decided where to go?”</p><p>“For the time being, yes. What about the girls?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1815717786"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2092633674"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>I asked back and she reflexively turned a thumbs-up.</p><p>“Yep, we decided to go on a Christmas gourmet tour for now. We thought of trying every single one of the special Christmas menus at the restaurants near the station.”</p><p>“Sounds like a fattening-up plan,” I muttered to myself, and Hina looked away awkwardly.</p><p>“We&#8217;re fine because we usually move around. Plus we are sportsgirls.”</p><p>“Really? With New Year&#8217;s coming up<span id='easy-footnote-2-91373' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-91373' title='New Year in Japan involves eating many festive foods like mochi and the whole osechi set.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>? Can you look me in the eye and say that?”</p><p>When I reminded her, Hina&#8217;s expression was blatantly distorted and twisted.</p><p>“We’re also entering super hard training today…”</p><p>“It’s not worth the effort, you know.”</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders and Hina glared at me with a sullen expression.</p><p>“Shut up! You, for one, where did you decide to go?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-161308772"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-108841344"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>“I&#8217;m going to join an event at the neighbouring station, called &#8216;Christmas Fulfilment&#8217;&#8230; What&#8217;s with that subtle expression?”</p><p>As soon as she heard my report, for some reason, Hina mysteriously cocked her head a little.</p><p>“No, hmm… You’re going to that, now?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>I couldn’t understand what Hina was implying. There was supposed to be no restriction on when to go to see the winter light displays, as far as I knew.</p><p>“Huh? Well, that event is where one confesses to their crushes, right?”</p><p>“&#8230;What?”</p><p>Still in a rather vexed tone of voice, Hina explained to the dazed me, “It is also written in the magazine I recommended to you. &#8216;Christmas Fulfilment&#8217; is an event where you invite the person you like and confess your feelings to him or her in a beautiful illuminated setting.”</p><p>“&#8230;Fo-for real??”</p><p>I suddenly felt my blood drain away. At the same time, I remembered Yuzu&#8217;s strange attitude earlier.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-953298425"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-560394063">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p><em>“N-nothing.
