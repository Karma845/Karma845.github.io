<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; I Imagined It Would Feel More Dazzling and Fantastic</h3>

<p>Finally, the day of Christmas Eve arrived.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, this special date turned out to be the same as any other year. Simply another day of new game releases.</p><p>“&#8230;In the end, it doesn’t snow, huh?”</p><p>The time was 6 p.m. After spending the day looking around for new games and buying titles I liked during test play, I looked up at the overcast sky as I walked through the crowded streets.&nbsp;</p><p>If I still had plans to confess my feelings on a white Christmas, this weather would have been disappointing for me. But now I felt the overcast skies were a blessing because they meant I wouldn&#8217;t slip as I shopped for games.</p><p>“Well, it&#8217;s all good.”</p><p>As desired, Kotani was able to confess once more, and now Yuzu had the chance to clear her past regrets. Considering that we, a fake couple, sprang into existence in order to keep her clique intact, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;d accomplished our true mission.</p><p>Yup. When I think about it like that, there was no downside whatsoever, were there? I even got the time to relax and enjoy playing games.</p><p>“&#8230;Alright! Let’s play the games I just bought today!”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1716146233"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-173403726"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>I picked up speed on my way home, getting excited by the fact that I was able to buy all the games I was interested in. It was then that suddenly—</p><p>“Huh, Yamato?”</p><p>—a familiar voice called out to me from behind.</p><p>I turned my head around to see a group of girls. One of them was raising her hand to me.</p><p>“&#8230;Oh, Hina.”</p><p>I stopped my feet and then Hina said something to her friend before trotting my way.</p>

How is it going with the girls&#8217; team’s fattening-up tour?”</p><p>“It’s walk-and-eat! What is that super unpleasant-sounding tour name?!”</p><p>I thought that was pretty much the same, but seeing Hina puffing up her cheeks, I decided to not pursue the matter. <em>Silence is golden</em>.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1615469891"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-824075237">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“But then again, I never thought I&#8217;d actually see you on Christmas Eve. I&#8217;m glad it looks like you are not yet on your date. Are you meeting up with Nanamine-san after this?”</p><p>“Well, yeah. Something like that.”</p><p>I was at a loss for words for a moment, though Hina had asked me without any other intention. However, my nonchalant attitude must have looked strange to Hina, who then squinted her eyes.</p><p>“&#8230;Really?” Hina pressed me with a sharp gaze that resembled a prosecutor&#8217;s..</p><p>Although she was asking in the form of a question, she definitely must have known that I had told a lie.</p><p>“&#8230;Well, a lot happened,” I admitted in a roundabout way.</p><p>Hina let out a sigh and then her voice turned gentle.&nbsp;</p><p>“If Yamato doesn&#8217;t want to tell me, that&#8217;s fine, but I&#8217;ll hear you out, at least.”</p><p>I wasn&#8217;t strong enough to brush off that kindness.</p><p>“&#8230;Please, not a word to anybody.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1343036329"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1328951805"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>I started to reveal to Hina the situation revolving around Kotani and the rest.</p><p>“Today, Kotani is confessing to Sakuraba.”</p><p>“Could it be at the &#8216;Christmas Fulfilment’ event?”</p><p>I nodded at her words.</p><p>“That’s right. The thing is, Kotani actually got rejected once before. Following that, their clique fell apart…and Yuzu made a run for it. She greatly regretted it. For Yuzu, this is a chance for her to try again.”</p><p>“So, she chose to be beside her friend to avoid running away like before?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>After hearing the general situation, Hina pondered deeply before speaking her mind, “Then Yamato, you simply nodded your head to that? To cancel your Christmas plans with her and let her prioritise her friends?”</p><p>“Well, I have no reason to stop her.”</p><p>Hina twitched her eyebrows at my answer.&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2054714642"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-617857641"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>“I believe Nanamine-san would’ve wanted you to stop her, though.”</p><p>“&#8230;You think so? I know she felt sorry for me, but she was the one who decided that if she runs away again here, she’ll regret it, and I also think the same. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any greater cause beyond that.”</p><p>Hearing that, Hina slowly closed her eyes and then blurted out, “&#8230;Reasons, causes or whatever, none of that matters.”&nbsp;</p><p>When I failed to catch her meaning, she opened her eyes and looked straight at me.</p><p>“Tell me, Yamato, are you and Nanamine-san really dating? Or is it all actually a lie?”</p><p>I was too stupefied to even utter a sound.&nbsp;</p><p>This sudden exposure of what I had been hiding so far froze me in place—this sight of me finally convinced her that she had guessed right, she withdrew her gaze and let out a sigh.</p><p>“Sure enough.”</p><p>My halted thoughts began to restart from there.</p><p>“&#8230;.How did you know?” I spat out agitatedly.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1760048220"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-58884053"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>She then replied while looking at the crowd in the distance, “Because Yamato, you were looking for a reason to be with Nanamine-san. It&#8217;s as if you shouldn&#8217;t be together if you don&#8217;t have a reason.”</p><p>Hina&#8217;s words helped me perceive my mental state, which even I myself was unaware of.</p><p><em>“I have no reason to stop her”</em></p><p><em>“I have no purpose that takes precedence over that.”</em></p><p><em>“Not spending Christmas with a boyfriend when you have one would raise suspicions.”</em></p><p><em>“We’re dating to protect the interests of the Riaju</em><span id='easy-footnote-1-91292' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-91292' title='A refresher, the Riaju in their case is like the popular people in class'><sup>1</sup></a></span><strong><em> </em></strong><em>clique.”</em></p><p>She got it right. From the very beginning, we always had a reason before us. A reason why we had to be together. Because there was this reason, we could be together; we had been holding on to this stated principle.</p><p>“I too… when things didn&#8217;t work out with Yamato, I thought about similar things… I wondered if there was any reason I could use to talk to you or if we had any errands that we had to do together so that I could be with you&#8230; things like that. Finally, when I could say with all my heart that we were friends, I could talk to you even without those pretexts,” Hina muttered in a melancholic tone.</p><p>She then added, “Maybe it&#8217;s different between lovers and friends, but the part where you&#8217;re looking for reasons…made it feel like the relationship you have is fake. I have no idea what kind of circumstances led you guys to that, though.”</p><p>“I see… Ah, that makes sense.” I just nodded as I digested the words that pricked at my heart.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1707896736"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1353508863">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“If your feelings are genuine, you don&#8217;t need a reason. Just having the desire to stay together is enough for you to actually be together. If you still need a reason just to be together, what you have there is fake.”&nbsp;</p><p>Then she looked at my face again.&nbsp;</p><p>“Therefore, I believe Nanamine-san would have wanted you to hold her back. Especially by you, who no longer has any reason to be with her. Maybe she would have prioritised her friends on top of that, but still…”</p><p>Hina hypothesised that, when I didn&#8217;t make an effort to be with her without a reason, Yuzu must&#8217;ve taken that to mean there were no feelings on my side whatsoever. Thinking about it this way, Yuzu would surely be glum about it.</p><p>“Yamato, what do you wish to do? There is no reason for you to stay with Nanamine-san now. There is no great cause, no necessity, no obligation. As such, what does Yamato want to become with Nanamine-san now?”</p><p>Quietly, I looked into my heart and tried to find the answer.</p><p>But I didn&#8217;t have to.&nbsp;</p><p>The answer was always right there, but I had forcefully kept a lid on it.</p><p>“I—”</p><p>“Stop. Not to me, you should say that to Nanamine-san,” Hina stopped me with her hand as I was about to open my mouth.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1302412799"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1497961246"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>Surprised by this, I chuckled and nodded. “&#8230;Yeah. I will.”</p><p>“Hmm. Good luck.”</p><p>I turned my back on her, who cheered me on, and I started sprinting towards the station.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>I swung on to the train that pulled into the platform and headed for the next station with a sense of urgency. As I travelled, I was thinking about all the times I had spent together with Yuzu.</p><p>When I reflected on them, the biggest mistake I had made was probably during the festival.</p><p>That time, we ended up resuming our once-ended fake couple relationship. It was actually our golden chance to end this false relationship and start everything from scratch, but in the end, I couldn&#8217;t stand the prospective precariousness of a real relationship and settled for a fake one.</p><p>We were people with different values and ways of being, and we had no connection other than being a fake couple. When that was taken away from us, I reckoned I wouldn&#8217;t know how to deal with it.&nbsp;</p><p>So we decided to re-pick up the relationship that was supposed to be over, and, in doing so, we shackled ourselves with it.</p><p>“&#8230;We were cowards.” Self-mockery spilled out of my mouth.</p><p><em>This time, I gotta redeem myself.</em></p><p>[Thank you for boarding the train. Soon, the train will arrive at—]</p><p>The train slowed down at the same time as the conductor&#8217;s announcement echoed.&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-731661484"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1610661200"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>As soon as the doors opened, I hurried out of the car and went through the ticket gates into the city. What greeted me was the glittering blue winter light display, though their quiet beauty was eclipsed by the throngs of people.&nbsp;</p><p>There were more people than I had imagined. It would be a tough task to find Yuzu when she was out and about. So, I picked up my phone and called Yuzu&#8217;s number. However, it was doubtful that she would answer.</p><p>[&#8230;Hello?]</p><p>Contrary to my expectations, Yuzu answered the call after a few rings.</p><p>“Hello, this is Yamato. I&#8217;m here at the &#8216;Christmas Fulfilment&#8217; venue as we speak.”</p><p>When I told her this, there was a gasp on the other end of the phone.</p><p>“I want to see you now.” Undeterred, I made a straightforward request.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu sounded a bit ruffled, yet she answered gently.</p><p>[We can’t. We decided we wouldn’t meet today. I chose to be over here—Yamato, you also said the same, right?]</p><p>While speaking on the phone, my eyes kept scanning the crowds in search of Yuzu, hoping to find her amongst the multitude.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1532239261"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1834510336"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>“&#8230;I did say that, but I’ve changed my mind.”</p><p>Normally I could never find her. But out of the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of a bright orange colour. My gaze, as if drawn to it, shifted in that direction.</p><p>[That’s selfish of you.]</p><p>A hundred metres away, there stood a girl with an orange scarf on the other side of the street. Even at this distance, I could swear we were looking right into each other&#8217;s eyes.</p><p>“I guess that makes two of us. I thought we had made an appointment first.”</p><p>[&#8230;Right. I guess we&#8217;re both self-centred. But then I&#8217;ll just do as I like in the end. I won&#8217;t meet Yamato-kun.]</p><p>The words were imbued with a determined and strong will. To which I responded with a nod.&nbsp;</p><p>“Okay, then I’ll also just go to you as I like.”</p><p>[&#8230;You’re too late, you idiot.]</p><p>After a few slightly trembling words, the call was disconnected.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-399308619"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1750679761"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>At the same time, from the side, a truck passed through the street just in front of Yuzu, blocking her from my sight. As the vehicle went by, she was no longer there.</p><p>“&#8230;I’m not late. We haven’t even started,” I mumbled a word that reached no one.</p><p>Our relationship had always been fake. We hadn’t started anything real.</p><p><em>So let&#8217;s end it. Our lovers role-play.</em></p><p>There were countless people making a boisterous din. Amongst all this, there was only one person I was looking for.</p><p>“I’m gonna catch you!”</p><p>I put my phone away and ran into the crowded streets.&nbsp;</p><p>Although she disappeared from my sight, she couldn&#8217;t have gotten far. I slid through the crowd and reached the place where she had been earlier. However, Yuzu was nowhere to be seen. I looked around, but could not catch a glimpse of that orange scarf.</p><p>“&#8230;Just like the time during Kotani’s previous confession, also during the cultural festival, this girl really is fond of this disappearing act.”</p><p>She was usually depressingly aggressive and would stay by my side even if I didn&#8217;t call her, but when it mattered, she would simply vanish—this was simply what Yuzu was like.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-977616404"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1872096193"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>“And here’s me, falling for such a difficult woman,” I muttered quietly and took a step forward.</p><p>I put my mind to the task at hand. As long as she was avoiding me, it was impossible to corner her in a straightforward manner. I needed to anticipate her behaviour.</p><p>In a flash of inspiration, I figured out the key people to solve this. I looked around and searched for my target.</p><p>—<em>There they are.</em></p><p>“The lights are very beautiful. Aki, don’t you feel cold?”</p><p>“I-I’m okay.”</p><p>Sakura and Kotani—the stars of the day—were walking leisurely down the main street. Their attention was on the winter light displays; they hadn’t noticed me on this side.</p><p>“&#8230;As expected. Yuzu came here to watch over them, it’s a given for these two to be nearby.”</p><p>Relieved that my reading was correct, I looked around again. These people were unfortunately not the one I was looking for. I was searching for the other person who should be here as well.</p><p>“&#8230;Found him.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-567262418"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-295701846"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>In the shadows of an alleyway a little way off, I spotted a shady figure stalking Kotani and Sakuraba—Namase Keigo.&nbsp;</p><p>He was the mastermind and the central figure of the day. As the one who drew up this plot, he would obviously grasp the plan and know how Yuzu was going to move. I blended in with the crowd to make myself inconspicuous, bypassing the alleyway and approaching him from behind.</p><p>“Hey, Namase.”</p><p>“Whoa!”</p><p>I tapped on his shoulder as I called out to him. Namase jumped in place and exclaimed in surprise. Then, he turned his head and widened his eyes upon seeing me.</p><p>“I-Izumi?! Why are you here?”</p><p>“If you make noise, you’ll be discovered by them.”</p><p>When I warned Namase to calm down, he huffed and glanced at the pair in the distance. Then, patting his chest in relief that they had not noticed him, he turned to look at me again.</p><p>“&#8230;So, why are you here, Izumi?” He asked me the same question again.</p><p>“No need to ask me, you should know why I’m here, right?”&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1236296605"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-482365529"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>Namase went silent when I returned another question to him.</p><p>It was unknown how much he had heard, but since Yuzu was coming here, he must’ve sensed that there was some kind of trouble brewing between Yuzu and me.&nbsp;</p><p>“&#8230;I don’t know the details, but well, sort of.”</p><p>“Then that makes it quicker to talk. Do you know where Yuzu is?”</p>

<p><br></p>

Their attention was on the winter light displays; they hadn’t noticed me on this side.</p><p>“&#8230;As expected. Yuzu came here to watch over them, it’s a given for these two to be nearby.”</p><p>Relieved that my reading was correct, I looked around again. These people were unfortunately not the one I was looking for. I was searching for the other person who should be here as well.</p><p>“&#8230;Found him.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-567262418"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-295701846"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>In the shadows of an alleyway a little way off, I spotted a shady figure stalking Kotani and Sakuraba—Namase Keigo.&nbsp;</p><p>He was the mastermind and the central figure of the day. As the one who drew up this plot, he would obviously grasp the plan and know how Yuzu was going to move. I blended in with the crowd to make myself inconspicuous, bypassing the alleyway and approaching him from behind.</p><p>“Hey, Namase.”</p><p>“Whoa!”</p><p>I tapped on his shoulder as I called out to him. Namase jumped in place and exclaimed in surprise. Then, he turned his head and widened his eyes upon seeing me.</p><p>“I-Izumi?! Why are you here?”</p><p>“If you make noise, you’ll be discovered by them.”</p><p>When I warned Namase to calm down, he huffed and glanced at the pair in the distance. Then, patting his chest in relief that they had not noticed him, he turned to look at me again.</p><p>“&#8230;So, why are you here, Izumi?” He asked me the same question again.</p><p>“No need to ask me, you should know why I’m here, right?”&nbsp;</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1236296605"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-482365529"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>Namase went silent when I returned another question to him.</p><p>It was unknown how much he had heard, but since Yuzu was coming here, he must’ve sensed that there was some kind of trouble brewing between Yuzu and me.&nbsp;</p><p>“&#8230;I don’t know the details, but well, sort of.”</p><p>“Then that makes it quicker to talk. Do you know where Yuzu is?”</p>

<p>At my words, Namase&#8217;s expression twitched. “Who knows… That&#8217;s not for me to say.”</p><p>In other words, he knew—exactly as I thought.</p><p>“Yuzu&#8217;s keeping you from telling me.”</p><p>“I can&#8217;t tell you that either,” Namase implicitly acknowledged.</p><p>Well, if I were in Yuzu&#8217;s shoes, the first thing I&#8217;d do would be to stop him from talking, and rightly so. There was indeed a way to make him spit it out, but I’d rather not do that.</p><p>Namase called out to me in a concerned manner as I was deliberating what to do, “Hey&#8230; Izumi, did you and Yuzu get into a fight?”</p><p>Unable to suppress his doubts, Namase boldly took a step forward with his words.</p><p>In response, I shook my head helplessly. &#8220;No&#8230; we didn&#8217;t even get into a fight. In fact, we ought to have had one of those fights.”</p><p>We had always argued about trivial things, but we couldn&#8217;t even put up a fight when it mattered the most.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-928055530"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-822968685"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>I should have told her not to go.</p><p>“I see. I think I kind of understand.”</p><p>Namase nodded his head as if he sympathised with my oblique words.</p><p>Suddenly, I remembered what happened a few months ago.</p><p>These people couldn&#8217;t express their true feelings, and because of that, they didn&#8217;t get into a fight. He must have had some thoughts about it, as he had hit the same problem a step earlier than me.</p><p>“Alas… I have my loyalty to Yuzu. Sorry, I can’t help you out, Izumi.” His words were filled with firm determination.</p><p>For Namase, their clique’s interests were his priority. It was a given that he wanted to avoid any unnecessary problems that could stir the group.</p><p>&#8220;Sure. I&#8217;m sorry for the trouble I put you through.&#8221;</p><p>Giving up any further attempts to pursue the matter, I turned on my heel.</p><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not gonna threaten me?&#8221; Namase asked me from my back.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1768357149"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-972939641"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>My steps halted and I turned my head around.</p><p>He then added with a somewhat grim face, “You could just say ‘If you don’t tell me, I’ll ruin it for Kotani’ and I’d have no choice but to leak the information.”</p><p>Upon hearing that, I shrugged my shoulders, “It just didn’t occur to me to resort to such an unscrupulous method.”</p><p>“Liar. Izumi, aren’t you good at doing such things?” Namase flatly denied my evasive words.</p><p>…Well, truthfully, I’d already thought of that method to force him to talk from early on.</p><p>“…How can I bring myself to do that, I know how much you guys have struggled so far.”</p><p>I knew how much they had suffered to get here. I had discovered firsthand just how desperately each group member wanted to break the invisible barriers that they themselves had erected.&nbsp;</p><p>“On top of that, what I need from now on is to love myself. If I do that, I’d just despise myself instead.”</p><p>Thus, I wouldn’t resort to such dirty means. Doing so would only make me even lose the qualification to proudly say that I love Yuzu.</p><p>“You also have problems on your side… yet you are so thoughtful of others. Izumi, you’re too good-natured,” Namase had a somewhat helpless expression.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1241846238"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-563967171"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>I chuckled in response, “…You have a point. Even though I used to dislike that side of me.”</p><p>However, in order for me to not hate myself, I aspired to be the good-natured guy once more. If I were to ask myself why I bothered to go to all that trouble again, the answer was easy.</p><p>“Well, maybe it’s because I fell for a good-natured girl?”</p><p>Unmistakably so. I was dazzled by Yuzu who made things complicated from her good-naturedness and eventually got the short end of the stick; even so, she tried to always view her situation in a positive light.</p><p>Thanks to her, I should have disliked myself, but now I liked myself a little bit more.</p><p>“But still…sorry, my mouth is shut. I can’t tell you where Yuzu is,” Namase put on a pained expression.</p><p>In the end, it seemed that his determination was solid.</p><p>“However, if it’s where Kotani will hold his confession, I can tell you.”</p><p>My eyes widened at those words.</p><p>“Namase…”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-169389832"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1313800343"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>Yuzu planned to come and watch over Kotani&#8217;s confession. So, as long as I knew where Kotani&#8217;s confession would take place, I would be able to find out Yuzu&#8217;s whereabouts from there.</p><p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yeah. She didn’t swear me to secrecy on that point.t. Furthermore…” Namase wore a somewhat relaxed smile, “I&#8217;ve said it before, but I still think Yuzu-cchi needs Izumi.&#8221;</p><p>“&#8230;I’m indebted to you,” I expressed my deep gratitude and I adjusted my posture to listen to him.</p><p>“Aki will confess in front of the fountain. Thirty minutes from now, the fountain area will be lit up. Aki is supposed to confess to Sota at this time. If things go well, both of them will go home by train; that’s our plan.”</p><p>In other words, by that time, Yuzu would surely appear near the fountain.</p><p>“&#8230;I got it. I’ll thank you again later.”</p><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. What you could really use is a friend, ya know?” Namase shot me a somewhat mischievous look.</p><p>I smirked when I realised that it was a reference toward &#8216;someone who just happened to be allocated to the same class for eight months&#8217;<span id='easy-footnote-1-91321' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-91321' title='This is what Yamato said to Namase in chapter 2'><sup>1</sup></a></span>.</p><p>&#8220;Right. I&#8217;ll keep that in mind this time,&#8221; I replied and ran out of the alley.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-73804191"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1374216686">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>The fountain was only a hundred metres away from here. But it would take a long time to move in the crowd. Furthermore, if I wanted to find the hidden Yuzu from there, would thirty minutes be enough time? Right when my head was full of these thoughts, my eyes caught something in its view.</p><p>“Oh yeah, I also have to avoid being discovered by them…”</p><p>Once again, I saw Kotani and Sakuraba&#8217;s figures as they headed towards the fountain. If those two found me, I would feel very sorry for Namase, who had lent me a hand.</p><p>After checking the surroundings, I found a descending staircase a little further on.</p><p>“It looks like I can bypass them from there.”&nbsp;</p><p>The only problem was, could I stay undetected until I got there?&nbsp;</p><p><em>Oh please, don’t turn around.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>I wished so, but it seemed that&#8230; God was not fond of me; suddenly Sakuraba turned around as if he was bothered by something.</p><p>“Oh no…!”</p><p>As soon as I said that, I jumped to the staircase in the nick of time.</p><p>Alas, haste led me to my doom. I missed my footing and had the sensation that I was not stepping on a staircase, but something strange—a transparent PET bottle shrouded in the darkness of the night.&nbsp;</p><p>Softly, a floating sensation enveloped my entire body.</p><p><em>“A Holy Night strewed with garbage—oh so sinful!”</em></p><p>For a moment, the conversation I once had with Hina flashed through my mind<span id='easy-footnote-2-91321' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-91321' title='In chapter 1'><sup>2</sup></a></span>. Once the recollection faded, I tumbled down the stairs in a single swoop.</p>

<b>Yuzu’s POV</b></p><div class="spdiv">[collapse]</div></div></div><p>Hiding in the shadows, Yuzu quietly drew in a series of deep breaths. In both hands, she held the phone she had just finished answering, and her heart was thumping at a rapid pace in her chest.</p><p>Glancing down the main street, she found Yamato standing where she had been a moment ago, looking around. Before long, perhaps deciding that he was getting nowhere, he headed off elsewhere.</p><p>“He came…” Yuzu muttered, ruminating on the earlier phone call.</p><p>“But…”</p><p><em>—Are you going to betray your friend?</em></p><p>The other Yuzu inside her heart questioned her in a whisper.&nbsp;</p><p><em>—You ran away at a crucial time before, are you going to run away again?</em></p><p><em>—You’ve fooled your friends by being a fake couple with him, have you forgotten what it was for?</em></p><p>Of course, she did it for her friends. But if she were to run away at the most important time, all of that would be nothing but lies.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1941476538"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1182249406"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“&#8230;That’s why, I won’t be meeting Yamato-kun,” she carefully chose her words, reminding herself of her resolve.</p><p><em>I won’t meet him. I won’t be meeting him today. That’s what I’ve decided.</em></p><p><em>But… If I really don’t meet him, what’ll happen to Yamato and me? Will we be able to talk like normal from tomorrow? Maybe things will never be the same again, he will leave by himself and those days will never come back.</em></p><p>“&#8230;.Ugk!” Her heart ached.&nbsp;</p><p>She couldn’t allow such a future.&nbsp;<em>Totally unacceptable!</em></p><p>Alas… She couldn’t run away from her current position.</p><p>“Yuzu-cchi, what’s wrong?”&nbsp;</p><p>Keigo, who was standing next to Yuzu, called out to her in a worried tone when he saw Yuzu’s pale face.</p><p>“Ah… It’s nothing.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu awkwardly feigned a smile, trying to evade the issue.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-409076175"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1116734329">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>“Well, if you say so…”</p><p>Keigo, too, seemed to realise that her words were far from the truth, but he did not inquire further at this critical juncture.</p><p>Taking advantage of his generosity, she decided to ask him for a favour.</p><p>“Keigo, Yamato-kun came here,” Yuzu told her friend who looked surprised upon hearing that.</p><p>“&#8230;Isn’t he here to pick you up, Yuzu? There’s no problem with only me here, why don’t you go see him?”</p><p>The all-too-tempting offer swayed her heart for a moment. But she clenched her teeth and shook her head.</p><p>“No, I won&#8217;t see him. I think Yamato-kun will probably look for you, Keigo, and he’ll ask you where I am. So I want you to cover it up for me.&#8221;</p><p>At this request, he showed some hesitation.</p><p>“Are you sure about that…? He even came all the way here.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’ve made my decision.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1038048824"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-687669487"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_7/chapter_incontent_7 --><div data-fuse="22210777409"></div></div></div><p>That was a lie. In truth, Yuzu was still wavering.&nbsp;</p><p>While asking him to do this, she had also hoped that Keigo would refuse. Her mind was a jumbled mess, and even she didn&#8217;t know where her heart was inclined to.</p><p>“&#8230;I got it. If that’s what you’ve decided, I’ll respect your choice.”</p><p>Alas, contrary to Yuzu’s expectation, Keigo actually accepted her request. Her chest tightened and her breathing became shallow. Yuzu suppressed these emotions and smiled.</p><p>“&#8230;Thanks.”</p><p>“No problem, it’s just a simple matter. But Yamato is sharp and a quick thinker. There&#8217;s no guarantee I can fool him.”</p><p>Being told that, Yuzu started to think. Yuzu, who had always been by Yamato’s side, knew his wits better than anyone else; he was not one to be underestimated.</p><p>“Then pretend to betray me and tell him where Aki will confess. I think that will work out. I&#8217;ll wait at another place and will call you to find out the result of the confession.”</p><p>Her heart might be in disarray, but her mind was still nimble. This skill was built up after years of efficiently separating her real face and the facade she put up in front of people. She had always thought it was a good thing, but only at this moment did she begin to feel that she could have lived more honestly without it.</p><p>“Yuzu-cchi… I’m reconfirming this with you, but are you sure about this?” Perhaps some hesitation showed on her face, Keigo anxiously questioned Yuzu&#8217;s intentions.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-318505823"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-535285948"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>“Yes. It&#8217;s really a pity I won&#8217;t be there to witness Aki&#8217;s confession,&#8221; she answered without a pause—afraid that a bad answer would come out if she were to mull on it.</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><p><em>Will Yamato understand me? He did once and saw me off before. So surely it will be okay this time.</em></p><p>“Yamato-kun…”&nbsp;</p><p>Even though she believed so, her heart ached; the anxiety was tearing her heart out.&nbsp;</p><p>What was it that was important to her? What was the thing that she had wanted to protect all along? She didn’t even know anymore. She had no clue but the only thing that had kept her from collapsing now was her resolve to not ever run away.</p><p>==</p><div class="sp-wrap sp-wrap-default"><div class="sp-head" title="Expand"> TL Note</div><div class="sp-body folded"><p><b>Back to Yamato&#8217;s POV!</b></p><div class="spdiv">[collapse]</div></div></div><p>“Ouch…”</p><p>After a brief moment of blacking out, my consciousness returned to normal.</p><p>My whole body was aching. My vision was spinning and swaying. With a deep breath, I slowly raised my upper body, while keeping the pain under the control of my rational mind.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-197625662"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-213261399"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“I fell quite badly…”</p><p>I took a spectacular slip and tumbled down a flight of stairs that had about twenty steps. The damage was considerable, as I was so startled I couldn&#8217;t even catch myself.</p><p>“My bones… none are broken.&#8221;</p><p>I couldn&#8217;t avoid full-body bruising, but it was fortuitous that I got away with just that.</p><p>I rose to my feet, checking each movement one by one—</p><p>“&#8230;Argh! I shouldn’t have moved that.”&nbsp;</p><p>—I couldn’t help but wince at the extreme pain in my right ankle; it had been sprained.</p><p>This wouldn’t be so bad normally, but to slip through this crowd in this condition, was way too difficult.</p><p>“There’s no use crying, huh?”</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>I had decided not to quit. I was determined to go see her.&nbsp;</p><p>Holding on to these reasons, I just kept on walking, even with my hands against the wall. Every time I lightly bumped into someone, and each time I tried to avoid them, I felt severe pain in my leg.</p><p>“It’s all right… Just a little more.”</p><p>I took a couple of deep breaths, gritted my teeth and kept going. And finally, I arrived at my destination—the fountain.</p><p>&nbsp;At the end of the main street, right in front of the station, buildings surrounded an open plaza. At its centre, a beautiful fountain was illuminated by bright lights.</p><p>“I never thought&#8230; I&#8217;d come here in this manner.”</p><p>I couldn&#8217;t help but giggle at this strange quirk of fate. Confessing with the lit-up fountain in the background was the exact confession plan I had in mind. So I actually came at my planned time, at my planned place—just in a way I hadn&#8217;t planned.</p><p>“&#8230;But now I consider myself lucky.”</p><p>In any case, my preliminary research had been done meticulously. As a result, I knew that all the buildings around here were locked and that the only place where I could monitor the fountain square without being detected was on the bridge, which was a little further away.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1816436626"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-123141208"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_1/chapter_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse="22210777397"></div></div></div><p>“Gotta hide quickly…”</p><p>I had to hide before Kotani and Sota’s arrival. If they happened to see their classmate in such a ragged state standing here, they would be in no condition for a confession.</p><p>Dragging my sore feet, I climbed onto the bridge and stared at the square. A quick glance at my phone showed that there were only five minutes left until the light-up—the scheduled time for the confession.</p><p>“&#8230;Here they are.”</p><p>Kotani and Sota arrived in front of the square. I swept my gaze around the area at the same time. Yuzu and Namase should’ve come nearby by this time.</p><p>“&#8230;Huh?” However, they were nowhere to be found.</p><p>Did Yuzu discover me first, so she avoided me? No, if that was the case, it’d be strange that Namase who took my side did not tip me off. So either there was some kind of trouble that caused the delay or…&nbsp;</p><p>Yuzu had known from the start that Namase would leak the information to me.</p><p>“Yuzu set this up…?”</p><p>Thinking it that way, it all made sense.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1908417087"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-42679960"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>Namase was giving me the information at Yuzu&#8217;s behest; Namase originally had no intention of telling me what Yuzu was up to.

Thirty minutes from now, the fountain area will be lit up. Aki is supposed to confess to Sota at this time. If things go well, both of them will go home by train; that’s our plan.”</em></p><p>Suddenly, I noticed something strange about those words: Namase&#8217;s statement included information that I didn&#8217;t need. He should only have told me where the confession would take place. So, why did he even tell me that Kotani and Sakuraba were going home by train?&nbsp;</p><p>No… Why did he mention that only Kotani and Sakuraba were going home by train?</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1952809692"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-425262541"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_3/chapter_incontent_3 --><div data-fuse="22210777406"></div></div></div><p>“&#8230;Are Namase and Yuzu supposed to go home with other means of transportation?”</p><p><em>Right. That must be it!!</em></p><p>The newly-formed couple would go home by train, and it was unlikely that Namase and Yuzu would get in their way. Even if they took the train at a different time, Kotani and Sota might be spending time in front of the station before going home. They would want to avoid the possibility of bumping into each other as much as possible.</p><p>And above all, this scenario would only happen if Kotani and Sakuraba became a couple after a successful confession. If it failed, both of them presumably would go home separately to avoid any awkwardness. Sakuraba, who was unaware of the plan, would take the train while Kotani would take a different means of transport—probably together with Namase and Yuzu.</p><p>“​​If the train is not an option, then buses or taxis. It&#8217;s difficult to catch a taxi on Christmas Eve, so the cautious Yuzu wouldn&#8217;t factor that into the plan. So, the bus would be her first choice.&#8221;</p><p>However, waiting at the bus stop in front of the train station—the venue of the &#8216;Christmas Fulfilment’—was akin to inviting me to find her. So, the next bus stop would be the one to aim for.</p><p>“Yuzu is sure to show up there!”</p><p>With my back to the now-lit-up fountain, I started walking towards that bus stop.</p><p>I had a bellyful of words to say to her. And another bellyful of questions for her. Although we had been together every day and talked so much, after all this time, it was strange that it felt like we didn&#8217;t know much of anything about each other.</p><p>“Darn it! This just keeps getting more and more painful.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-792548741"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2085292557"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_2/chapter_incontent_2 --><div data-fuse="22210777403"></div></div></div><p>As time passed, the pain in my right leg became more and more intense. But there was no time to rest. If Kotani&#8217;s confession went well, Yuzu would immediately head for the bus. I was running out of time.</p><p>As I trudged along, taking deep breaths to keep the pain under control, I suddenly felt a drop of water hit my neck.</p><p>“&#8230;Rain?”</p><p>As I looked up to the sky, droplets of rain were falling from the cloudy sky. It was cold rain that had failed to turn into snow. The rain, which had begun to fall, was gaining momentum like a landslide rumbling down a mountain..</p><p>“No better time for this rain to fall. I just needed to cool my ankles,” I bluffed under my breath. I started walking again.</p><p>Every step taken caused me pain and robbed me of my body heat.</p><p>Worst conditions ever. Yet, strangely, my legs kept moving forward. My heart pounded against my chest. My whole body was telling me to stop, urging me to rest, but only my heart kept telling me to go on.</p><p><em>—It doesn&#8217;t have to be today.</em></p><p>Somewhere in the back of my mind, the cold version of me whispered. Telling me that I could meet Yuzu anytime. That there was no need to insist on today; if I wanted to say something, I could say it at any time.</p><p>“But… That’s exactly why it has to be today.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1306235801"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-2145225537"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>Because there was no reason for me to meet her today. Precisely because there was no reason, I could go meet her just because I felt like it.</p><p>“Ouchhh…!”</p><p>The pain in my legs increased at an accelerated rate and my steps slowed in inverse proportion. Soon enough, the designated bus stop gradually came into view. I was nearly there.</p><p>But before I reached there—</p><p>“Ahhhhh…”</p><p>—a bus passed right beside me going in the same direction; this bus was the one that departed from the bus stop in front of the station. It easily overtook me before slowing down to a stop. I started chasing it in a hurry.</p><p>“Wait for me…!”&nbsp;</p><p>My legs were aching. My water-soaked clothes were heavy. Even so, I kept on running and running.</p><p><em>Thump!</em></p><p>My knees gave way and I fell, tumbling down.</p><p>“Sh*t…!”</p><p>The pain and cold had apparently taken a lot of my strength before I knew it. I stood up desperately and looked straight ahead.</p><p>But the bus had left unceremoniously.</p>

 <p>“I missed it…?” I was taken aback.</p><p><em>No, no matter what, I still have to keep walking.&nbsp;</em></p><p>It was Christmas Eve, the roads would be jammed, and there was a chance I could catch up if I tried. So I gnashed my teeth and was about to start walking again when—unexpectedly—the rain stopped.</p><p>No, it was still raining, but not against my body. Someone was holding an umbrella over me.</p><p>“What are you doing being so desperate there, boy?”</p><p>From behind me, the voice I had always wanted to hear echoed.</p><p>“&#8230;Well, it&#8217;s pretty much a given that the only reason a boy would be so desperate during Christmas Eve is to get a girlfriend,” Fighting back the urge to cry, I replied without looking back.</p><p>“That&#8217;s funny. I thought you had a very cute girlfriend.”</p><p>“Yeah. But that girlfriend was a fake one. We weren’t dating, nothing had ever started between us.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-904591856"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1779884318"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>From here on out was uncharted territory and neither of us had possessed the courage to venture there. We had kept it vague by obscuring things with jokes; hiding our feelings behind pretences and logic. Our relationship had been pleasant, but static and fated to fall apart.</p><p>“&#8230;Yes. I chose to support Aki rather than be with Yamato-kun. Turns out, we&#8217;re a fake couple after all.”</p><p>When I finally looked back at her, Yuzu showed a lonely expression.</p><p>“That was because I didn’t hold you back.”&nbsp;</p><p>I denied what Yuzu said but she shook her head.</p><p>“You know, I really hated it when you didn’t stop me back then. That shouldn’t be, right? I was the one who asked you to do the impossible.”</p><p>Yuzu quietly revealed the feelings she had kept hidden inside her. Saying nothing, I listened to her.</p><p>“I imagined falling in love with someone would feel more dazzling and fantastic. But, the reality was different. I felt furious and frustrated over why you didn&#8217;t stop me, and I was worried that it was just my own misunderstanding after all,&#8221; Yuzu turned her head down and chided herself.</p><p>I understood how Yuzu felt so painfully.</p><p>“Even now… When I spotted you, I was actually going to hide myself… But before I knew it, my body went the opposite way.”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2098835060"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-205398575"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_4/chapter_incontent_4 --><div data-fuse="22211093991"></div></div></div><p>She felt like she was not herself and losing control of her emotions. This made her ill at ease.</p><p>“Somehow, I’m starting to feel like I don’t even know myself anymore. Inexplicable emotions and thoughts I should never have kept gushing out of me… I’ve been slowly hating myself. I never thought that falling in love was such a scary thing.”</p><p>Then she looked up and looked straight into my eyes. Her eyes that locked with mine were firm and resolute as if all emotions were fully repressed.</p><p>“That’s why, I made the decision that I don’t want anything beyond that… Just staying as a fake couple is enough.”</p><p>“&#8230;”</p><p>Most likely, I was currently being rejected. She was saying that she was fine staying as a fake couple; that was the same as giving me a warning not to confess.</p><p>“&#8230;I see. But in my case, it’s the opposite.”</p><p>Despite what she said, I started to make my case.</p><p>“You know, I’ve always disliked being swayed by other people. I disliked that I needed to be considerate of my surroundings and act good-natured in odd situations. In order to liberate myself, I thought the only way forward was distancing myself from people.”</p><p>Even at this moment, I still believed so. I had finally reached a point where I discerned the right distance for me to deal with people.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1081485055"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-119679541">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>And yet, there was an exception.</p><p>“But, I changed a little after meeting Yuzu. Even if I had to do things that I felt weren&#8217;t worth it, I thought it would be okay if they make Yuzu happy. I enjoyed them no matter how stupid they were.”</p><p>Even the things that I used to sigh at and consider just a waste of time when I was alone changed when Yuzu was next to me.</p><p>This kind of feeling was novel, interesting, frightening—and dear to my heart.</p><p>“Even now I&#8217;m not trying to be friends with everyone. But I like the time I spend with Yuzu, and I&#8217;ve come to like myself for being able to think that way.”</p><p><em>If it’s now, I can say it. With this feeling I’m having right now, the current me can properly tell her.</em></p><p>“That’s why, I love you, Yuzu.”</p><p>And so I blurted out my feelings as it was.</p><p>For a moment, Yuzu’s eyes widened, but immediately she had an exasperated expression as though she was holding back tears.</p><p>“&#8230;..What the heck is that? After listening to what I said, you actually told me that?”</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-1117511325"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-194735628"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_8/chapter_incontent_8 --><div data-fuse="22210777418"></div></div></div><p>“Sorry to say, I’m that kind of introvert who cannot read the mood.”</p><p>As soon as I replied like that, Yuzu pressed her forehead to my chest in an attempt to hide her facial expression.</p><p>“&#8230;You idiot. I’m saying that was fantastic.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“&#8230;Even after I warned you by saying I’m fine with fakes.”</p><p>“You did.”</p><p>“Yamato-kun, you’re always like that. You never do what I want you to. You make me anxious, you’re bad on dates, you only have games in your head.”</p><p>“&#8230;When you deliberately say that, it makes me sound like a bad boyfriend.”&nbsp;</p><p>Listening to this list of my idiosyncrasies, I was appalled at myself.</p><p>“Really, you are. But… but I actually feel this happy, doesn’t that make me look like an idiot too?” Yuzu grumbled, yet her hug tightened around me.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-2127918355"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-908573907">"<!-- 71161633/book_incontent_1/book_incontent_1 --><div data-fuse=""22287275007""></div>"</div></div><p>The clear plastic umbrella fell. Droplets of rain once again hit my cheeks, but I paid them no heed as I firmly hugged Yuzu back.</p><p>“&#8230;If you want to retract your words, it’s now or never. Surely, I’ll slowly become a loathsome girl. Yamato-kun, you might regret this later, “ Yuzu muttered while still not showing her face to me.</p><p>I chuckled in response.</p><p>“You say that now? I already know a lot of your shortcomings. A narcissist who never stops praising herself, yet fakes who she is when in front of people, and chickens out at critical times.”</p><p>“&#8230;When you deliberately say that, that makes me sound like a bad girlfriend.”</p><p>“Indeed. Nevertheless, even after knowing all that, I still fell in love with you.”</p><p>I liked her smug face when she managed to pull a surprise on me and also her narcissistic self who always thought about others and became timid when it came to her own problems. She worked hard in order to like herself and worked even harder for others to like her. I thought that was cunning of her, but sometimes that became a drawback for her. But in the end, she still deemed all of that to be alright.</p><p>I was inexplicably attracted to her like that.</p><p>“&#8230;For real?”&nbsp;</p><p>I nodded my head vigorously to Yuzu, who was still questioning me anxiously.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-749161031"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1041383493"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_6/chapter_incontent_6 --><div data-fuse="22210777412"></div></div></div><p>“For real. Do you know? The secret to continuing a relationship is not to expect perfection from the other person. So even if you have one or two things I don&#8217;t like about you, I still love you.”</p><p>When I replied like that, I felt Yuzu forming a smile on my chest.</p><p>“Then, say that you love me again.”</p><p>“I love you, Yuzu.”</p><p>“Again.”</p><p>“I love you, Yuzu.”</p><p>“Again.”</p><p>“I love you, Yuzu.”</p><p>After I said it three times, the request came to a halt.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, she slightly moved her shoulders to take in a deep breath before she raised her head to face me. Finally, with an expression of a tear-streaked smile on her slightly reddened face, Yuzu opened her mouth.</p><div class="foxaholic-publift-post-page-chapter-mobile" id="foxaholic-776044151"><div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; " id="foxaholic-1099152894"><!-- 71161633/chapter_incontent_5/chapter_incontent_5 --><div data-fuse="22210777415"></div></div></div><p>“I love you too, Yamato.”</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KBVwhTucCaV3m_XvKYEb4olG7-Op5EK-P7NID52x0NKJzfedxFd8fC5jA-GRXxaOZJ6ZmiK-B9olCLae_y20MyaFDEU-3n-H6WxPVH7T2Heli7jE0uuEKNqQnOEQnfptW9V575n5FY_WaG9WqQsMkVQi2A_SYd7-vQtnXUEmpFyt_tZmQAtosyEBlQ" alt="" width="482" height="600" /></figure></div>
