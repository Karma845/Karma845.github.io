<h3>Chapter 52 &ndash; Boring Conclusion</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“You can feel proud knowing you are going to experience first-hand the peak of power.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi, as Theo treated Xena behind her.</p><p class="calibre2">When Theo got Xena to retreat, he panicked a little as he realized he had nothing to treat her with, but suddenly their things came down from the sky.</p><p class="calibre2">As he thought he had to thank Helvi later, Theo started briskly treating Xena’s wounds.</p><p class="calibre2">“And… Done. Are you alright?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, thanks Theo! Pretty much all the pain is gone!”</p><p class="calibre2">Her wounds were not deep, but she was hurt all over.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s been a while since you were hurt so badly. How many years has it been?”</p><p class="calibre2">“About three or four? Back when I still didn’t have a good grasp on my steel magic. It’s probably the first time since I’ve learned how to use it well.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo had also never seen Xena so hurt.</p><p class="calibre2">This man, the leader of the bandits, truly was on par or even stronger than Xena and Celia.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-is Helvi going to be alright…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo believed in Helvi’s strength, but was still worried about his wife taking on such a strong opponent by herself.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m sure she’ll be fine Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I think so too.”</p><p class="calibre2">“R-really…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia did not seem particularly concerned.</p><p class="calibre2">In fact, they were a little unhappy about having their prey taken away from them, and looked at Helvi’s opponent with pity.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo did not understand, but Xena and Celia did so very well, since they had fought both Helvi and the boss.</p><p class="calibre2">They knew very well who was stronger.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi and the boss stood in front of each other.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was simply not moving, but the same could not be said about the boss.</p><p class="calibre2">(…! I don’t get it! What is this…!?”)</p><p class="calibre2">He could not move.</p><p class="calibre2">Usually he would be the first to attack in case of a deadlock, but he could not move at all.</p><p class="calibre2">He knew that no matter how he attacked, it would not land.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not as though he could not see an opening, in fact, Helvi had her guard down completely.</p><p class="calibre2">He simply could not see himself winning no matter how or where he attacked.</p><p class="calibre2">“What is the matter? Do you like staring contests?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…! Dammit…!”</p><p class="calibre2">At that rate, nothing would change.</p><p class="calibre2">He ignored his intuition, took a step towards her, and swung his fist.</p><p class="calibre2">His first attack was easily dodged, as were the blows aiming for her stomach and chest, even though they should have been more difficult to dodge.</p><p class="calibre2">(If I can just hit her once, my fist will rip through her flesh and sever her bones…!)</p><p class="calibre2">His fists were more powerful than even Xena’s steel magic. Even a single hit could turn into a fatal wound.</p><p class="calibre2">But in the end, none of that mattered if he could not hit.</p><p class="calibre2">His attacks continued to be dodged, but his opponent would not attack him.</p><p class="calibre2">Although he looked as though he was struggling, his opponent had a calm smile on her face.</p><p class="calibre2">(Dammit, if I can just hit her once…!)</p><p class="calibre2">He thought as he continued swinging his fists.</p><p class="calibre2">And then…</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm, enough. I think it’s time to end this.”</p><p class="calibre2">Whispered Helvi, as the boss’ fist landed on her stomach.</p><p class="calibre2">He thought for sure he had won.</p><p class="calibre2">He had done this many times before. His fist would create a hole and blow away his opponents intestines with the sheer intensity of his strike.</p><p class="calibre2">He was sure the same thing would happen that day… But it did not.</p><p class="calibre2">“Why…!? Why won’t it pierce…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">His perfect hit caused no damage, not even a little scratch.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you using the rotation power of your fist? Not a bad technique, but it will not work on me.”</p><p class="calibre2">By rotating his fist at an abnormal speed, he could tear through his opponent’s body as if he were digging into it.</p><p class="calibre2">Not only did Helvi quickly realize this after just one hit, but the hit itself was completely ineffective.</p><p class="calibre2">“Why… You…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“I told you. I am the peak.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi grabbed his arm with her left hand.</p><p class="calibre2">The boss tried to run, but could not move from that spot.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now, one for one. I will also hit your stomach, so I advise you to harden your abdominal muscles as much as you can.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi made a fist with her right hand, and just as she lightly pulled her arm back, the boss came to a realization.</p><p class="calibre2">(I’m going to die…!)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi punched at full speed.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Hmm. I did not expect you to avoid it.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi opened her right hand, which did not hit her target, and threw away the arm she was still holding with her left.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh, ahh…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The boss grimaced as he held his left shoulder and tried to bear the pain of losing that arm.</p><p class="calibre2">His strategy of sacrificing his arm before Helvi’s attack connected was a success.</p><p class="calibre2">He estimated that if Helvi’s attack hit him, he would not be left with a hole in his stomach, but rather his entire torso would have been obliterated.</p><p class="calibre2">(She’s dangerous. She’s on a different level than those girls…! At this rate I’m gonna die..!)</p><p class="calibre2">He barely avoided this attack, and figured he would not avoid another one.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi stepped forward to finish him off.</p><p class="calibre2">“Dammit…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The frightened boss ran away as fast as he could, weaving through the trees.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmph…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi had a bored expression on her face as she watched the boss run away.</p>
