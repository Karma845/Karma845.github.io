<h3>Chapter 32 &ndash; Travel Quest</h3>

<p class="calibre2">After their conversation about traveling together, Xena and Celia returned to their inn, and they all gathered in the mercenary guild the next day.</p><p class="calibre2">“Good morning Theo and Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Good morning Celia.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Good morning.”</p><p class="calibre2">After everyone except Xena said good morning to each other, Theo was going to greet her as well, but…</p><p class="calibre2">“Did you two have fun last night?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…What do you mean?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was genuinely confused, and tilted his head.</p><p class="calibre2">“O-oh? Do you really not get it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Did you seriously just say that Xena…”</p><p class="calibre2">After the two went back to their inn, they mostly talked about Helvi and Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was cute, Helvi was surprisingly cute as well, why was Helvi so strong… That sort of thing.</p><p class="calibre2">The most exciting topic however, was imagining what they did at night. Their delusions grew bigger as they shared them with each other.</p><p class="calibre2">Xena mentioned that she wanted to ask this question, but Celia told her not to.</p><p class="calibre2">Obviously, Xena could not resist, but Theo had no idea what she was talking about.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-Helvi… you get it don’t you?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena looked at Theo, thinking he was strange, and turned her attention to Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“…I haven’t the faintest idea.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, you’re lying! You know!”</p><p class="calibre2">Yelled Xena, pointing to Helvi after she turned away very conspicuously.</p><p class="calibre2">She could see Helvi’s ear, and noticed it was red.</p><p class="calibre2">Celia had been acting disinterested, but started grinning upon seeing Helvi’s reaction.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh… Could it be that you’re more interested in that sort of thing than you let on, Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I have nothing to say about this to you two.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi knew their imaginations were running wild about herself and Theo. She did not want them to know that she got excited after peeking into their minds, and kissed Theo right after they left.</p><p class="calibre2">She would not have known about these delusions if she did not look into their minds in the first place.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, can you lend us Helvi for a bit?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Can you go on ahead and look for quests? Please.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes…”</p><p class="calibre2">The two moved away and took Helvi with them, without any resistance from her.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I feel like this happened yesterday too.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo entered the guild while remembering what happened the previous day with the receptionists.</p><p class="calibre2">“A stay over quest?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Fiore the receptionist.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. For me, Helvi, Xena, and Celia.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Sounds like you’ll be alright no matter what happens.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia, who were known as the strongest adventurers in town, and Helvi, who defeated the legendary Chimera on her own.</p><p class="calibre2">It was hard to imagine anything dangerous happening with these three around.</p><p class="calibre2">“But we haven’t received quests like that lately… Hold on.”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore started looking through quest documents.</p><p class="calibre2">Most stay over quests were difficult, so not many made their way to the mercenary guild. They mostly received simple monster hunting quests.</p><p class="calibre2">When Xena and Celia lived in this town, they would receive designated quests, and Theo would go with them as a supporter.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, there is one that’s been here for a while.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Really! Great…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo happily smiled.</p><p class="calibre2">He was worried that there would be no quests that allowed him to travel with the other three.</p><p class="calibre2">“But this quest… It’s kind of…”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore frowned as she looked at the document.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-what is it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Nothing. With this quest, you’ll probably spend one or two nights away. Is that alright?”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore’s expression quickly turned into a smile, and she asked a question, seemingly to change the subject.</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, that’s good.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, understood. By the way, what are the other three doing?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Apparently Xena and Celia wanted to talk to Helvi…”</p><p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, the three outside the guild…</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh!? You’re not doing it!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena’s eyes were wide open, upon hearing this shocking truth.</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re too loud.”</p><p class="calibre2">“S-sorry… But is that true?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it is.”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia was not shouting like Xena, but deep down she was just as surprised as her.</p><p class="calibre2">“I thought it was strange that you two blush when you’re just holding hands… Now it makes sense.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Q-quiet. We have only been married for two days, so we have a long road ahead of us.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was not rushing things.</p><p class="calibre2">She was going to stay with Theo for a long time, and would have many chances.</p><p class="calibre2">“But Theo was that ignorant about this… Fufu, I’m sure Theo is the only person in the world that could actually believe babies were brought by storks.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes… But Helvi, you do know about this sort of thing, and you do have an appetite for it, right?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes, I will not deny that.”</p><p class="calibre2">She was only telling this because they were all girls, and would not talk about it in front of Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">Celia asked another question.</p><p class="calibre2">“Isn’t it hard to control yourself?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, yes, I’d think so too. Theo is so cute.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Fu, fufufu.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi let out a strange laugh, and told how she felt.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I want to assault him so much. It is so hard having such ripe fruit in front of me and being unable to taste it. It is close to torture, and I do not know how much longer I can bear it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-that’s what I figured.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s kind of graphic… Make sure you don’t hurt Theo alright?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I would never hurt him. I am better at holding back my strength than you would think.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I know that from our fight, but this is different…”</p><p class="calibre2">After talking about this for a while, the three women entered the guild, where Theo was waiting.</p><p class="calibre2"></p>
