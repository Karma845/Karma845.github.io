<h3>Chapter 32: First Love × Bad End</h3>


<p>As if a dam had burst, my brother began to shed tears suddenly. </p>



<p>I was disconcerted, not knowing which of my words had triggered him, but it seemed I had inadvertently touched a wound of his. </p>



<p>I tried to hug and console him in a panic, but his muffled sobs wouldn’t stop. </p>



<p>It was a striking scene: a high school boy, no longer a child, crying unabashedly in the midst of a festival where everyone else wore merry faces. It stood out terribly.</p>



<p>I caught the curious glances directed at us, wondering what had happened…</p>



<p>This was bad. </p>



<p>Before coming here, my brother had mentioned that students from Seiun High School were likely to visit the festival. Attracting attention could risk our peaceful lives and, more importantly, it would be embarrassing for my brother. </p>



<p>We needed to find a secluded spot, away from prying eyes.</p>



<p>That’s when I remembered the sign for an internet café I’d seen near the station on my way here.</p>



<p>I grabbed my brother’s hand and we slipped away from the festival, rushing into the internet café that boasted soundproof private rooms.</p>



<p>I chose a flat-type room with a mattress instead of a reclining chair, pushed my brother in, and then went to the drink bar to make two drinks.</p>



<p>Watching the hot cocoa trickle out frustratingly slow, perhaps by design to prevent splashing, I pondered. </p>



<p>What could have stirred my brother’s emotions like this? </p>



<p>But I couldn’t figure it out. </p>



<p>I didn’t recall saying anything particularly special.</p>



<p>In the end, the time it took to fill two small mugs with cocoa didn’t bring any clarity to me. </p>



<p>With a sigh, I returned to the room, wondering how I should interact with my brother from now on.</p>



<p>As I opened the door, which was too light to boast of soundproofing, my brother, who had been keeping his face down until now, looked up.</p>



<p>“Have you calmed down?”</p>



<p>“…Sorry.”</p>



<p>His eyes were still red, but the tears had stopped. </p>



<p>The stormy moment of intense emotion seemed to have passed for now.</p>



<p>“It’s silly, isn’t it? Just because a date got postponed by a single day… and yet here I am, no longer a child, breaking down like this…”</p>



<p>“Everyone has moments when they can’t control their feelings.”</p>



<p>In the cramped, three-tatami mat-sized private room, I sat down beside my brother. While handing him a mug of cocoa, I comforted him…</p>



<p>It seemed the cause of my brother’s breakdown was a last-minute cancellation by my sister. </p>



<p>It appeared that one of my words had brought back the sadness he felt.</p>



<p>“It may sound strange for me to say this, but it’s better not to hold it in too much. I know you, Onii-san, you probably thought you shouldn’t bother Nee-san as she tries to do her best, so you suppressed your own feelings. But if it bothers you so much, you need to express that dislike; otherwise, you’ll just exhaust yourself.”</p>



<p>I laugh a little at my own words.</p>



<p>What kind of advice am I giving?</p>



<p>For someone who would probably be the happiest person in the world if my brother and sister’s relationship were to sour, I am offering guidance.</p>



<p>“…I did say it though…”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“I never intended to say it. I thought I had to support her. But today, I wanted her to choose me… But in the end, I backed down. I was scared to insist, afraid about what would happen if she didn’t choose me.”</p>



<p>It’s pathetic, my brother said, scratching his head.</p>



<p>“Haruka even said she wanted to marry me, she trusts me so much, and yet, I couldn’t fully trust her and became anxious again on my own… Really… I haven’t grown at all.”</p>



<p>My brother muttered this, biting his lip with a bitter expression as if to blame himself. </p>



<p>…On the other hand, I was very surprised. </p>



<p>Surprised that this brother of mine had even once rebelled against my sister. </p>



<p>And that’s why… I ended up laughing.</p>



<p>“Ahah, ahaha!”</p>



<p>“Shigure?”</p>



<p>“What’s that? It’s so silly.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but laugh at the sight of my brother blaming himself for feeling inferior to the strength of my sister’s feelings. Really, how kind-hearted can one person be?</p>



<p>“Onii-san. Do you know why wedding rings are made with diamonds?”</p>



<p>“I think it’s because they’re incredibly stable substances, representing unchanging, eternal love.”</p>



<p>“Long ago, there was a couple who pledged their eternal love with that stone.”</p>



<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>



<p>“They fell in love, cherished each other, and had two lovely little girls. Twins who looked just like their mother. As a family of four, they spent a very happy time together.”</p>



<p>Having said that, my brother’s face showed that he understood what I was talking about.</p>



<p>“…The happiness that was supposed to be eternal didn’t last long. As the twin girls grew up, their father began to spend more time away from home. It became common for him to come home the next day, and the family of four no longer gathered around the dinner table. The girls remember it clearly even now. Their mother would feed them, put them to bed, but she herself would never touch her dinner, always waiting for their father to return. This scene repeated itself over and over again. But even that didn’t last forever. Eventually, tired of waiting, their mother made a mistake with someone who could fill the loneliness she felt, and the love that was supposed to be eternal shattered to pieces. —Onii-san. Was our mother pathetic?”</p>



<p>“…I don’t think… she was pathetic at all.”</p>



<p>What’s this? He understands, doesn’t he?</p>



<p>“Right. There’s no such thing as convenient, unchanging eternal love in this world. No words, no contracts, not even diamonds, can guarantee love. It’s about conveying and being understood in the present. That’s all love is, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>Love is not eternal.</p>



<p>It is the desire and effort to make the bond that exists now last forever that is called love.</p>



<p>If one stops wishing and striving, then it’s only natural that the color fades away.</p>



<p>“Onii-san, you said you feel pathetic compared to Nee-san, but it’s quite the opposite. Nee-san never doubts the unshakable bond she has with you because you tirelessly express your love. Despite being rejected many times, you search within the bounds of what’s permissible and desperately try to show your love—that’s why Nee-san trusts in it so much—”</p>



<p>That’s why you think that you cannot escape from yourself.</p>



<p>“And the reason Onii-san can’t trust Nee-san is because Nee-san isn’t trying hard enough. It’s because even a single day’s absence becomes so unbearable, Nee-san hasn’t been giving anything back to you. And yet, Onii-san, you only blame yourself… It’s really absurd. Is it that heavy? The so-called true love that doesn’t even attempt to be beside you when you have such a pained expression?”</p>



<p>“Shigure…”</p>



<p>I laugh, really, like a fool, a hearty laugh. </p>



<p>Because if I don’t, I feel like I’ll overflow with tears.</p>



<p>I thought I would be the happiest to see the strained relationship between my sister and brother.</p>



<p>But knowing the discord between them, the emotions that flooded my heart were not of joy.</p>



<p>It was a choking sensation, a fury towards my sister, akin to hatred.</p>



<p>…Why won’t you be by his side?</p>



<p>Do you have any idea how much this person has respected you until today?</p>



<p>The physical closeness he desired, the schedule tailored around your club activities—despite wanting more touch, more meetings, all those desires were suppressed, always, always, with a frustration that centered solely on thoughts of you.</p>



<p>Such a lover… he couldn’t hold back anymore and spilled out his wish to be with you today.</p>



<p>Why can’t you see how desperate he was to make such a request?</p>



<p>Even though he’s not one to lie well.</p>



<p>Is it so… that you see nothing at all?</p>



<p>Are you looking at nothing at all?</p>



<p>Not even realizing the expression on the face of the lover before you.</p>



<p>Ahh~~~~,</p>



<p>It’s frustrating. So frustrating, so frustrating, so frustrating!</p>



<p>With a frustration that sears my chest, my expression almost contorts.</p>



<p>Why does it have to be you?</p>



<p>Why am I not enough?</p>



<p>Bitter resentments circle relentlessly in my mind.</p>



<p>If it were me, I wouldn’t let him wear such an expression during our time together.</p>



<p>Just because you met him earlier than I did, just because of that, why—</p>



<p>But, …that ‘just because’ weighs heavily on my brother.</p>



<p>He can’t disregard a love once declared. Even if his heart no longer follows, he cannot betray himself.</p>



<p>Because he is kind. Kind and weak, lacking the courage to hurt others.</p>



<p>I resent this weakness of his. It’s infuriating.</p>



<p>Yet—</p>



<p>While I feel this way, it’s exactly because of this that I love him.</p>



<p>Clumsy, timid, incapable of willfully causing pain to others even if mistaken.</p>



<p>It’s precisely because he is such a person that I want to cherish him. I want to nurture him with all I’ve got, to bring a smile to his face.</p>



<p>I think this. I feel this strongly. Therefore…</p>



<p>“Onii-san, why don’t you make Nee-san realize?”</p>



<p>“Make her realize…?”</p>



<p>“The things she takes for granted, to show her that they’re not so inevitable. Even Nee-san, as insensitive as she can be, would surely start to panic and try to win Onii-san back if she saw him looking like a lover with someone else. …I think I could help you with that.”</p>



<p>I grasped his hand, whispering sweet justifications for him to forgive himself.</p>



<p>I am aware, even to myself, it’s a terrible pretext, transparent with ulterior motives.</p>



<p>Yet, no matter how awkward the excuse, I wanted to touch his heart right now.</p>



<p>But—</p>



<p>“…I don’t like that idea.”</p>



<p>The response was a firm rejection, stronger than I had anticipated.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>It was a sweet proposal.</p>



<p>Shigure always affirmed my weaknesses. </p>



<p>She accepted them. </p>



<p>If I were to accept this offer… I imagine it would be quite enjoyable. </p>



<p>I could indulge in the pleasure of being loved while maintaining a shallow self-affirmation that I was not betraying Haruka.</p>



<p>Yes, just as I had comforted myself by seeing Haruka in Shigure after the camping trip at the beach.</p>



<p>But I felt a strong aversion to it.</p>



<p>“…I don’t want this. Please stop.”</p>



<p>“…Is that so? I see. Was it that obvious that I had an ulterior motive?” </p>



<p>Shigure asked with a mischievous smile.</p>



<p>Shigure truly understood me.</p>



<p>And living together, I thought I had come to understand quite a bit about her as well. </p>



<p>That’s why I knew.</p>



<p>There was no ulterior motive behind her suggestion.</p>



<p>Shigure was… indignant on my behalf.</p>



<p>Beneath the superficial smile, I could believe in the deep affection she had for me. </p>



<p>Because Shigure… time and time again, on every occasion and for every reason, had conveyed her love to me. </p>



<p>Even at this very moment.</p>



<p>Love is not a promise.</p>



<p>It’s about what’s conveyed and what’s felt in the moment, she said.</p>



<p>And so… Shigure was always desperate, as much as I had been for Haruka.</p>



<p>In the face of such earnest desperation, what had I ever given back?</p>



<p>Nothing at all.</p>



<p>Not only that, I had selfishly indulged in the love I saw for Haruka within Shigure. I had voraciously taken it and then pushed her away. Even after that, I decided to let any sprouting emotions wither at the bottom of my heart, choosing not to give them voice. </p>



<p>Despite knowing all too well how lonely, how unsettling it was, to the point of tears.</p>



<p>And yet, to think of using Shigure’s feelings again… I detested the idea.</p>



<p>Even if Shigure herself would forgive me for it. </p>



<p>I no longer wanted to face this admirable fidelity with such half-hearted feelings…!</p>



<p>“I’m sorry. It was unnecessary, wasn’t it?”</p>



<p>Shigure said, looking disappointed as she let go of my left hand.</p>



<p>But then, I caught her hand instead.</p>



<p>Her eyes, wide with surprise, reflected my image, and the calm part of me questioned.</p>



<p>Do you understand the meaning of the words you are about to say?</p>



<p>Are you prepared to live up to them?</p>



<p>…Honestly, I don’t know.</p>



<p>Maybe I’m just trying to escape to the easier path. </p>



<p>If someone could make me forget about Haruka, perhaps anyone would do.</p>



<p>I no longer understand myself, not even a little.</p>



<p>But… through all the anguish, the turmoil, and the mess, there is one thing, just one thing that I know isn’t a lie, isn’t a mere whim.</p>



<p>It’s a certain feeling that remains unweathered in the depths of my heart. </p>



<p>And so, I put it into words.</p>



<p>“I love you too. Right now, more than anyone else.”</p>



<p>“────……”</p>



<p>I conveyed it. </p>



<p>The feelings I had hidden. </p>



<p>The love that should never have been revealed. </p>



<p>For the first time… I returned it to Shigure.</p>



<p>At this, Shigure’s eyes went round for a moment…</p>



<p>“…Haha, have you finally fallen, Onii-san?”</p>



<p>She eventually showed a mischievously triumphant smile. </p>



<p>Her words were painfully clear and transparent.</p>



<p>But, embarrassingly enough, I couldn’t deny it. I shrugged my shoulders, admitting defeat.</p>



<p>“Yeah, in the end, I never stood a chance against Shigure…”</p>



<p>“There’s no way a weakling like you could beat me. And yet, you gave me quite the trouble. Really… truly…”</p>



<p>Suddenly, Shigure’s boastful words began to fade away.</p>



<p>Her sly smile crumbled.</p>



<p>And before I could even ask what was wrong, tears started to spill from the corners of Shigure’s eyes.</p>



<p>“…Ahh… no…”</p>



<p>“Shigure…”</p>



<p>“Huh… This is strange… I thought I could bluff better than this…”</p>



<p>She covered her face with both hands, as if ashamed. </p>



<p>But her body and voice trembled even more violently—</p>



<p>“I don’t need promises, or status, or any of that… Just being Nee-san is enough… I always… always wanted you to say… that you loved me…!”</p>



<p>“~~~~!”</p>



<p>Love.</p>



<p>A simple, unremarkable word that should be easily exchanged between two people in love. </p>



<p>She had been waiting so earnestly for this. </p>



<p>And I hadn’t even given her those few words.</p>



<p>As Shigure sobbed, a passion and fondness that had once settled surged up from the depths of my heart. </p>



<p>But this time, I didn’t hold it back. </p>



<p>I embraced her as she overflowed from my arms, not caring about the strength of my grip, nearly clutching her desperately. </p>



<p>I couldn’t help myself. </p>



<div><img>

<p>Shigure must have felt the same.</p>



<p>She quickly wrapped her hands around my back, clinging tightly as if digging her nails in. </p>



<p>The pain of her seeking me was so dear and adorable that it made me want to give her more and more.</p>



<p>“…!”</p>



<p>With a rush of emotion, I took her lips. </p>



<p>My first kiss given to Shigure.</p>



<p>I had received many from her, yet until now, I hadn’t been able to give anything back.</p>



<p>As if to atone for that, I poured into the kiss an indescribable fondness that overflowed from the depths of my heart.</p>



<p>But the affection swelling inside my chest seemed bottomless, no matter how much I poured out, it never depleted. </p>



<p>It was agonizing.</p>



<p>My emotions grew too large within my chest, making it hard to breathe.</p>



<p>It was frustrating.</p>



<p>With every breath, our lips parted, and even that slight distance of a few millimeters became unbearable.</p>



<p>I wanted to convey more, to make her understand more deeply. </p>



<p>Driven by that impulse, I kissed her more fiercely, more deeply.</p>



<p>Yet, in that intense moment, a scene from a night at camp flashed through my mind.</p>



<p>A bitter memory of conveying true love and being rejected.</p>



<p>Was I about to make the same mistake again?</p>



<p>In a panic, I started to pull away from the kiss, but—</p>



<p>“No, don’t stop, no!”</p>



<p>Shigure’s hands, wrapped around my back, pressed down on the back of my head, urging me not to run away. </p>



<p>She sought a deeper connection from her side, nibbling on my lips and rubbing her body against mine, showing her affection for me in her entirety. </p>



<p>Her love effortlessly erased my bitter memories in an instant.</p>



<p>…It feels good.</p>



<p>To have my love affirmed.</p>



<p>And to be responded to with even greater affection.</p>



<p>I never knew such happiness existed.</p>



<p>“Shigure… I love you…”</p>



<p>“Me too… …mm.”</p>



<p>—Of course, I understand what we’re doing right now. </p>



<p>I’m aware that anything beyond the relationship I have with Shigure can only lead to ruin.</p>



<p>I have a lover named Haruka, and Shigure is Haruka’s sister, and we are bound as siblings by law.</p>



<p>We will probably be condemned by many: parents, friends, lovers… everyone might look down on us.</p>



<p>But…</p>



<p><em>“Intense obsession splits the world you live in into ‘just one person’ and ‘everyone else.’ That is what love is, isn’t it?”</em></p>



<p>I’m no longer afraid of any of it.</p>



<p>Because no matter what happens, no matter what difficulties await, if I have that one person who loves me by my side, there’s nothing better than that. </p>



<p>If I can convey these feelings, I’ll do anything.</p>



<p>Yes, at this moment, I had finally caught up to Shigure’s feelings.</p>
