<h3>Chapter 51 &ndash; Switch</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“Why’s someone as strong as you a bandit?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena asked abruptly.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahn? What’s that all of a sudden?”</p><p class="calibre2">It was an honest question.</p><p class="calibre2">He could hurt her hard body, and evade the attacks of two people that were even employed by nobles.</p><p class="calibre2">How did this man end up becoming a bandit?</p><p class="calibre2">If he became a mercenary like them, he could easily climb to the top, and never have to worry about money or social status.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m not a big fan of talking while fighting to the death.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You were talking a lot earlier.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright then, I’ll give you an answer.”</p><p class="calibre2">The man ignored Celia’s interjection, and continued speaking.</p><p class="calibre2">“I hate working under other people.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…There’s your answer, say something.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? That’s it?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena was quietly waiting for him to continue, and was surprised to hear that was all he had to say.</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s the biggest and best reason I could have. I don’t like people giving me orders, especially people that are weaker than me. Those nobles are all weak but act all high and mighty just because they have money. I’d rather die than work for them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahaha, that hits too close to home.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. There are a lot of idiot nobles like that.”</p><p class="calibre2">What the boss said rang true to Xena and Celia.</p><p class="calibre2">They were currently employed by a specific noble family, but they had previously been working as mercenaries for various nobles.</p><p class="calibre2">Among them, there were several for whom their status as nobles meant they saw Celia and Xena as lower people.</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s why I became a bandit, to rise in the world by my own power alone. There used to be smaller groups of bandits on this mountain, but they had to either follow me or die.”</p><p class="calibre2">The boss smiled boldly and spread his arms.</p><p class="calibre2">“I want to be the best! Stronger than anyone, and above everyone!”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia looked at him coldly as he laughed loudly.</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s way less interesting than I was expecting.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You want to be above everyone else by falling into banditry? Are you an idiot? The fact that you’re a bandit in itself makes you lower than everyone else.”</p><p class="calibre2">The boss giggled menacingly.</p><p class="calibre2">“If I’m so low, then what are you, if you’re having such a hard time defeating me two-on-one? You have to be lower than me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Grr…! It’s not over yet! We’re just getting started!”</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re going to be begging for mercy.”</p><p class="calibre2">In reality, both realized that this was an opponent that they could just barely defeat.</p><p class="calibre2">The boss also realized that while he could definitely kill them one at a time, there was the possibility that he could be defeated in a two-on-one fight.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, he was enjoying himself, since it was the first time in a while that he got to fight someone on equal terms.</p><p class="calibre2">The three had daring smiles on their faces, and the fight started once again… Or at least it was going to.</p><p class="calibre2">“Wait.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia stopped and turned around when they heard this.</p><p class="calibre2">They saw Helvi, with Theo standing behind her with an embarrassed look on his face for some reason.</p><p class="calibre2">They did not see what Theo and Helvi were doing while they were fighting, but could guess by looking at Theo’s face.</p><p class="calibre2">“What Helvi? We’re getting to the good part.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Even if you win, this is going to take too long, and you will end up hurt. I will be stepping in.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? Really? I want us to do it though…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Who do you think has to treat you when you get hurt?”</p><p class="calibre2">As Helvi said this, Theo noticed Xena’s wounds and ran towards her.</p><p class="calibre2">“A-are you alright!? Y-you’re hurt all over…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s alright, they’re just flesh wounds.”</p><p class="calibre2">“We have to treat…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo pulled Xena by the hand, trying to get her to retreat with him.</p><p class="calibre2">The boss was irritated by Theo’s arrival. A clearly weak being that stood behind someone else until just now.</p><p class="calibre2">He was not going to let him interfere in his fight with opponents that could go toe-to-toe with him.</p><p class="calibre2">He took one step forward with the intent to kill, but before he could take another step, he felt something on his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre2">“I am your opponent.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Without him realizing, Helvi had moved next to him and placed her hand on his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre2">He quickly took her hand off him and stepped back.</p><p class="calibre2">“What…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">When he saw her hand on his shoulder, he felt a chill, even though she did not seem to be casting magic.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi should have been right behind Theo, but before he knew it, she was by his side. No one had ever approached him so easily.</p><p class="calibre2">He watched the fight between her and his subordinates, although it could hardly be called a fight, as all the men surrounding Helvi all collapsed at the same time.</p><p class="calibre2">Magic? Poison?</p><p class="calibre2">He wanted to avoid getting close to her, since he could not figure it out, but before he knew it, she was touching him.</p><p class="calibre2">However, there was no sign that he was going to drop dead.</p><p class="calibre2">Was it a limited technique? Did she simply choose not to use it and use something else instead?</p><p class="calibre2">“I have been hearing you say you are the strongest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah? That’s right. There’s no one in this world that’s stronger than me!”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see, then rejoice. Since I am the actual strongest in the world, you can claim that title for yourself if you defeat me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah? What are you talking…”</p><p class="calibre2">The boss did not believe for a second that Helvi could possibly be as strong as she claimed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh whatever, that doesn’t change anything anyway. Weak or strong, I’m still gonna kill you.”</p><p class="calibre2">The man looked at Helvi with bloodlust in his eyes, and she responded with a light laugh.</p><p class="calibre2">“You can feel proud knowing you are going to experience first-hand the peak of power.”</p>
