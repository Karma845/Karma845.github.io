<h3>Chapter 45 &ndash; Weak Point?</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, Xena and Celia returned to their tent… Or not.</p><p class="calibre2">(Are you not going back?)</p><p class="calibre2">(Well, now we know you two aren’t doing that, but you know…)</p><p class="calibre2">(Yes, we know but…)</p><p class="calibre2">“Hnfu… Ahh… Ahh…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s charming voice was still coming from inside the tent.</p><p class="calibre2">(This is good too! We’re going to stay here and listen a little more.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Yes, I’ve never heard Theo make noises like these. I want to hear a little more… Well not a little.)</p><p class="calibre2">(You… Fine, as long as you do not disturb us.)</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi directly to their minds, before she stopped peeking into their thoughts.</p><p class="calibre2">And so, they stayed outside, making sure to make as little noise as possible so as not to let Theo hear them.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi could hear them breathing heavily out of excitement, but that was within her acceptable limits.</p><p class="calibre2">She had been on top of Theo for a while, listening to the sounds he was making, so she took several deep breaths to compose her breathing.</p><p class="calibre2">Because Theo twisted around during the massage, he rubbed against the parts of Helvi that touched his back several times.</p><p class="calibre2">No one was more excited and tempted during this time than Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">Over ten minutes later, it was over. Contrary to how it sounded, everyone except Theo had a very exciting time.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh… That felt really good, and my body feels so relaxed! Thank you very much!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Fuu, good to hear.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi took a deep breath as she stepped away from Theo’s back.</p><p class="calibre2">This massage was longer than the previous one, which meant Helvi had to hold back for longer.</p><p class="calibre2">However, she just barely contained herself. She moved her hips just enough for Theo not to notice, which she deemed acceptable.</p><p class="calibre2">But outside the tent, things were different.</p><p class="calibre2">(Ahh… Great…!)</p><p class="calibre2">(Kuh… Just a little more…!)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi peeked into their minds, and found Xena was satisfied, and Celia not so much.</p><p class="calibre2">Judging by the raw sounds coming from outside the tent, it was easy to imagine what they were doing… But it was better to leave it at that.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi also wanted to let loose, but couldn’t in front of Theo. Thankfully she could change her clothes in an instant, so she would not have to stay in her wet underwear.</p><p class="calibre2">“I feel bad that I’m the only one feeling good. Let me massage you too!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? Really? Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">For a devil like Helvi, the general idea of exhaustion was something she was not very familiar with, so a massage was never something she desired.</p><p class="calibre2">However, the chance to be touched by Theo would give her pleasure in a completely different way, and there was no way she was going to let this opportunity escape.</p><p class="calibre2">(Ah… Theo’s massages feel nice.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Yes. He used to do it to us too.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Hou? Really?)</p><p class="calibre2">(Uwah! Don’t just come in here all of a sudden Helvi! You scared me!)</p><p class="calibre2">(I figured she was listening all this time.)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi thought to ask why she was doing what she did if she thought she was listening, but decided not to bother with it.</p><p class="calibre2">But now that she heard the other two had received Theo’s massages in the past, she absolutely wanted it as well.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo and Helvi switched places, with Helvi now lying face down with Theo on top of her.</p><p class="calibre2">“Am I too heavy?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Not at all.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo could not make himself lighter with magic like Helvi, but his body was still surprisingly light.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are there any places that feel especially stiff?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well… Not really, but I guess my back and shoulders.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright, got it.”</p><p class="calibre2">But the moment Theo’s hands touched her back, close to her hips…</p><p class="calibre2">“Hyaun!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh…?</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Someone let out an unexpectedly loud voice.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo, and Xena and Celia, who were still outside, all expressed their confusion.</p><p class="calibre2">The two outside managed not to be too loud, and since they made sounds at the same time as Theo, he did not notice them. Not that Theo would have noticed them anyway, since the impact of the previous voice was too strong.</p><p class="calibre2">The person who let out a loud voice was lying face down, with her face red all the way up to her ears.</p><p class="calibre2">Her position meant that her face could not be seen anyway, but she still went out of her way to try to hide it.</p><p class="calibre2">“…What is the matter Theo? Why did you stop?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, no, hum… Are you alright?”</p><p class="calibre2">“What do you mean?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, eh…? Well, that voice…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Did you hear something?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…No, it’s nothing.”</p><p class="calibre2">And then Theo once again placed his hands on her back, and started gently rubbing it.</p><p class="calibre2">“…! Hiyuh…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was a devil, and she had been alive for tens of thousands of years.</p><p class="calibre2">She prided herself of being the strongest being in existence, and thought she had no weak points… Until that day.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh… Ahn…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Just having her back rubbed made her unable to contain her voice .</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was ticklish.</p>
