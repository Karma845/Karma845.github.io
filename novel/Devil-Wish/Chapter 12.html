<h3>Chapter 12 &ndash; Little Bunny?</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Imagine… A little bunny sleeping without worry, next to a starving fierce animal.</p><p class="calibre2">Normally, that little bunny would be gobbled up in an instant, it would be impossible to even imagine a different outcome.</p><p class="calibre2">But the fierce animal still had some reasoning power left, and started thinking… Why would that little bunny be sleeping without a care? Was it because the beasts around the little bunny, protecting him, were stronger than the fierce animal? Or could it be that the little bunny was confident that the fierce animal would not attack him?</p><p class="calibre2">Did the little bunny trust the fierce animal?</p><p class="calibre2">(Damn it…! If that is what you are thinking, I cannot attack you can I?)</p><p class="calibre2">The fierce animal, Helvi, grit her teeth as she struggled to hold back her outstretched hand, and the little bunny, Theo, was sound asleep, completely defenseless, having fallen asleep halfway through Helvi’s massage.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo fell asleep face down, but turned around unconsciously, even while Helvi remained on top of him.</p><p class="calibre2">Usually this would not be possible, but Helvi was using magic to make her body lighter.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi struggled because Theo being face up meant that she could watch his innocent face and adorable lips.</p><p class="calibre2">(Ahh, I want to close those half open lips… And when it becomes difficult to breathe and you wake up, I would silence your confusion by pressing you down and…)</p><p class="calibre2">Her imagination was accelerating, and inside her head she was already doing this and that to Theo…</p><p class="calibre2">When she snapped back to reality, Theo’s shirt was a little rolled up, and her hand was rubbing his exposed upper half.</p><p class="calibre2">She did it unintentionally, and moved her hand back when she noticed…</p><p class="calibre2">(It is so smooth… Kuh, you are a man, and yet your skin might be shinier than mine. There are almost no muscles, and it is so soft…)</p><p class="calibre2">She could not pull her hand back. She touched Theo’s skin, her breathing became heavier and heavier, and her cheeks became red.</p><p class="calibre2">(I cannot hold back any longer… I imagined the first time would be while we fooled around, but doing it while Theo is asleep is also an option…! It may even be more exciting…!)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi swallowed, and with bloodshot eyes, she was about to undress Theo when…</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo? Helvi?”</p>

<p class="calibre2">The door opened, and Fiore the receptionist peeked inside.</p><p class="calibre2">“…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, Helvi, is Theo… Eh?”</p>

<p class="calibre2">Fiore received word that the Chimera had been slain, but information on who did it was a secret.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi wanted to avoid the fuss that it would create, so Lauro withheld that information.</p><p class="calibre2">Speculation over who had slain the Chimera was running rampant across town, but Fiore immediately thought of Theo and Helvi. They did go out to defeat it after all.</p><p class="calibre2">She thought they could not defeat it, and their names did not come up, but information about the Chimera being slain was making the rounds.</p><p class="calibre2">She was surprised when she realized that they, or rather, Helvi defeated it.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, they never went back to the mercenary guild, so she was worried that they had gotten hurt, and decided to visit Theo’s home.</p><p class="calibre2">She opened the door as usual, and saw Theo lying on the couch with Helvi on top, who seemed like she was about to start something.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-hum… What… Are you doing…?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Hmph, I was merely giving Theo a massage.”</p><p class="calibre2">“In that position?”</p><p class="calibre2">All Fiore could see was Theo lying face up, with Helvi’s hands under his shirt.</p><p class="calibre2">It was hard to see how this could possibly be a massage.</p><p class="calibre2">“…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…”</p><p class="calibre2">The two went silent, and the only sound in the room was Theo’s breathing.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was the first to break the silence.</p><p class="calibre2">“I will be truthful. I was about to assault Theo while he slept!!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t be so defiant about it!”</p><p class="calibre2">Shouted Fiore as her face became red.</p><p class="calibre2">“Why while he’s sleeping…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Do not be such a wet blanket. Because Theo is here…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“You probably meant to sound cool, but you didn’t!”</p><p class="calibre2">As she saw Fiore’s reaction, Helvi realized something.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fiore, are you inexperienced?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? What…?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You have never gone out with a man, have you?”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s right, so?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Fuh… I knew it…. You’ll understand it when you find a man you like. Seeing him sleeping so adorably brings out the urge to do something!”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s something I don’t want to understand!”</p><p class="calibre2">As they spoke, Helvi’s hands were still touching Theo, but only his upper half.</p><p class="calibre2">“S-stop your hands! It’s not proper to do that while Theo is sleeping!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Fiore, it seems you do not know that this kind of play exists in this world…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“P-play…”</p><p class="calibre2">Some receptionists were knowledgeable about this sort of thing, and Fiore would occasionally hear about it when they went out to drink.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, I am fine with the first time being like this. I would even recommend it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“F-first time…! Don’t you feel bad for Theo? He is still sleeping!”</p><p class="calibre2">“What is there to feel sorry about? Not knowing about the first time? Or is it about not being able to show love for my body?”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-that’s not it… I’m sure he wants his first time to be done properly too…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi moved her hands even while they talked.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore noticed this again, and was about to say something, but Helvi realized something.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What is this!?”</p><p class="calibre2">She noticed something hitting her butt, and when she realized what it was, she jumped too fast for Fiore’s eyes to register.</p><p class="calibre2">“Kya! What’s that all of a sudden?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…! Nothing at all…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi tried to play it off like nothing happened, but her face was completely red.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore looked in Theo’s direction, and was also surprised. She could feel her face becoming red as well.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s “Theo” was Theo’ing.</p><p class="calibre2">The little bunny was not a little bunny in that part.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore understood why she jumped away, but at the same time, she didn’t.</p><p class="calibre2">She had a hunch. Could it be that for all of her posturing, Helvi was…</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi… Is this your first time?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s face was bright red as she covered her behind with her hands and turned away.</p><p class="calibre2">She did not respond, and Fiore felt like she got back at her.</p></div>
