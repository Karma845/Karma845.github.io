<h1>Chapter 12: Okinawa Trip</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a two-and-a-half hour flight on the first flight of the morning, the six of us landed in Okinawa; the everlasting summer capital of Japan. It’s my first time on a flight and also to Okinawa, so everything I see is new to me, and my excitement is already at the climax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Already, Yuya-kun. We’ve only just arrived, but you’re getting too excited. At that rate, your strength won’t last, will it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kazuha-san is right, Yoshizumi. I know you’re having fun, but let’s calm down a little, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede smiles bitterly, and Nikaido admonishes me with an exasperated tone. I know, but I can’t help it. Because of my shitty father, I’ve never been able to travel until today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, the duo’s outfits today are quite contrasting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede is wearing high-waisted shorts and a tank top with frills alongside a sheer shirt dress. Although the outfit is feminine, the glimpses of her bare skin through the dress appear glossy and catch my eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikaido, on the other hand, wore an off-shoulder top and skinny denim pants. The tight-fitting pants beautifully highlight Nikaido’s basketball-trained legs, and the uncharacteristic boldness of Nikaido’s skin shows off, shocking everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine. In fact, there’s someone over there who’s more excited than me, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said this, I pointed to a group of Meiwadai’s proud couples who were happily talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shin-kun, Shin-kun! What do you think of Okinawa? When I asked my mom, she told me to go to the aquarium! Also, there’s the famous Heart Rock, which is said to bring happiness to couples! “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehe. I’m looking forward to it now, Akiho. But how about we calm down a little?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Otsuki-san is breathing heavily from thinking about her plans, while Shinji is smiling and reprimanding her. He pretends to be calm, but his mouth is so loose that it becomes obvious that he is actually holding back the urge to have fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Compared to those two, I’m pretty cute, aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…yeah, that’s right. It’s still better than those two.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it’s still a lot better. Besides, what happened to Yui-chan? I was supposed to be with her until I received my luggage, but I couldn’t find her anywhere. Maybe she got lost?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay, Yuya-kun. I asked Yui-chan to pick me up. Ah, it looks like they just came. It’s that car!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede-san pointed at a large, shiny, luxury minivan. Even though I don’t know much about cars, I know it’s a purely domestic car from the commercials. If it weren’t that big, it would be very cramped and difficult for six people, including Yui-chan, to move around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kaede-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Quietly getting out of the car was a beautiful woman of a young age wearing sunglasses and with the same sparkling blonde hair as Yui-chan, which reached her waist. Her slender limbs and willow-like waist seemed more like a British noblewoman. Her ample melons are better than Kaede and Otsuki-san. A person full of elegance, different from the atmosphere that Kaede’s mother, Sakurako-san, emits. Is this person Yui-chan’s mother? She’s very different from my mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice to meet you. My daughter has always been very helpful to me. I am Yui’s mother, Mary Miyamoto. I will be serving as the guide for your trip to Okinawa starting today, so please take care of me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She even seemed to be bowing while saying that, and the four of us, Nikaido, myself, Otsuki-san, and Shinji, couldn’t help but bow our heads as well. I’m sure I’m not the only one who thought of the words “bowing high to the queen” in my mind. Kaede-san burst out laughing when she saw us like that, and Yui-chan seemed dissatisfied somehow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… Everyone who meets my mom for the first time does the same thing. Even though I have half of my mom’s blood in my veins, don’t you guys react so differently towards me!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan protests by stamping her feet while puffing out her cheeks. Ah, yeah. I think something is wrong with it, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s how cute Yui-chan is, and I like it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really!? Ehehe… If Kaede-nee says she loves me, then that’s fine!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, Yui. Don’t be too lazy with Kaede-san and guide everyone to the car. I’ll put your luggage in the back trunk, so hurry up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I can’t rely on Mary-san to take care of everything, I take care of Kaede and Nikaido’s luggage and head off to load them. Considering that we will be taking care of many things from now on, including driving, we need to do what we can to the best of our ability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mary said, “It’s my job,” and took Ootsuki-san’s luggage from Shinji, urging everyone to get into the car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuya Yoshizumi, was it? You’re a high school student, but you’re so solid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was loading the luggage that Kaede-san had entrusted to me, Mary-san, who was loading Ootsuki-san’s bag next to me, spoke to me. By the way, Mary-san speaks good Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, the reason I can speak Japanese is because I’ve lived in Japan for almost half of my life. I’ve known Sakurako and Kazuhiro since we were in college.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mary-san answered my question with a wry smile. Mary continued talking as she loaded her luggage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I heard Sakurako’s story, I was worried that her idiot parents had finally gone this far, but now I understand why she allowed you to be with Kaede.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe. I’m talking to myself, so please don’t worry about it. Still, if I have to say it, it’s that not just anyone could do what you’re doing right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mary-san said with a smile on her face as she slammed the trunk door shut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, Yuya-san, hurry up and get in the car. If you don’t hurry, it’ll get crowded and we’ll have a hard time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s only after 10 o’clock, but do we still have to hurry somewhere?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re headed to the most famous and popular aquarium in Okinawa. We’re supposed to be there when it opens, right?”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Mary drove us, the first place we arrived at was Okinawa’s world-class aquarium. An acrylic panel aquarium that was once recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s largest, and the vast grounds include not only an aquarium but also a facility where you can enjoy dolphin shows. There also exists a manatee and sea turtle pavilion that was the inspiration for the mermaid legend, making it a place where one can enjoy spending a whole day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow! Look, Yuya-kun! That’s a really big whale shark! Is that a manta ray swimming over there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly follow Kaede, who is happily frolicking among the crowd of children. I keep telling them that it’s dangerous to run around in the dimly lit building, but they don’t listen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kaede-nee loves this aquarium. She comes here every year and has a lot of fun every year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan told me with a wry smile. I was able to learn another unexpected side of Kaede. It might be a good idea to plan an aquarium date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I can understand how Kazuha-san feels. This is amazing. It’s even moving.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikaido was also fascinated by the fish swimming inside the huge acrylic panels that could never be seen anywhere else. By the way, Shinji and Otsuki-san are not here. That couple went to see sea turtles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yoshizumi-senpai, I want to go see the dolphin show as soon as possible, so could you please bring Kaede-nee and Nikaido-senpai with me? I am looking forward to being able to interact with dolphins.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan pulls on her sleeve and pleads with me. I agree with that opinion. I’ve never seen a dolphin show before, so I’ve been curious about it ever since I received the pamphlet at the entrance. Additionally, the time and place to meet up with Shinji and the others coincides with the start of the dolphin show. So if we don’t start moving soon, we won’t be able to make it in time, but the problem is how do I bring those two people?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry! Kaede nee will be right away if Yoshizumi-senpai drags her by the hand! I’ll salvage Nikaido-senpai for you! Then I’m counting on you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan pushed me on the back for her dolphin show, shoving me away. It’s violent. Now, I have to convince Kaede, who is clinging to the acrylic panel with shining eyes, as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kaede, it’s almost time for the dolphin show, so let’s move on, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay, Yuya-kun. We can still go as long as we sprint as fast. So stay here with me a little longer!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede pulls her arm and asks me to sit with her. Yeah, doesn’t this seem like it’s a nuisance to the small children around me? Also, if you’ve been to this facility many times, you probably know that if you sprint as fast as you can, you won’t be able to make it in time for the start of the dolphin show, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go, Kaede. I have to meet up with Otsuki-san and Shinji. And more than anything, we’ll be causing trouble for Mary-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While we were freely touring the facilities, Mary was helping us find the best spot to watch the dolphin show. We can’t neglect that kindness, can we?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh… I’m sorry to leave you behind, but if  my mother finds out I caused trouble for Mary-san, she’ll get angry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede slumps her shoulders and wraps her arms around me. Come to think of it, Mary also used to call Kaede’s mother Sakurako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My mom and Mary-san have been best friends since college.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sakurako-san and Mary-san attend the same university… It seems like it would be a lot of trouble just imagining it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe. It’s just as you imagined, Yuya-kun. There were many things like being confessed to every day, and the beauty pageant at the school festival having reached the same number of votes for four years in a row, not resolved. Even now, people still talk about them to this day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can just picture the boys confessing their feelings with determination, only to be cut off quickly and discarded. But Kaede’s father and Miyamoto-san are amazing for winning over two such guys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She doesn’t talk about it often, but my mother said that Miyamoto-san and Mary-san were very much in love. I hope I can hear about how they first met someday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right. I’m curious to know Miyamoto-san’s proposal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It will be useful for future reference, I thought to myself. Kaede was grinning and it looked like she wanted to say something, but I pretended not to notice. Oh no, my cheeks are getting hot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey Kaede-nee! Yoshizumi-senpai! What are you doing?! Let’s go quickly! Or rather, could you please not flirt with me here!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan called us and we started running in a hurry. Seeing that Nikaido was next to her, it seemed like she was able to retrieve her safely. I mean, it’s no good to shout someone’s name out loud, right? Besides, we’re not even flirting, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that kind of blabbering is fine. Let’s move more quickly! If I’m late for the dolphin show, it’ll be Yoshizumi-senpai’s fault!”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The four of us dashed and were able to make it just in time for the dolphin show to begin. Kaede and Nikaido almost stopped in front of the souvenir corner, but we made the right decision by pulling them by the hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan teased me, saying that I was holding flowers with both hands, but I didn’t have time to worry about that. She only noticed it when Otsuki-san, who was waiting ahead of her, informed her. Kaede was laughing out loud, and Nikaido could see her cheeks turning red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was amazing, the dolphin show! The tricks were detailed and the jumps were perfect! Also, it was so cute to see everyone sing along in the chorus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprisingly, Nikaido was the one who enjoyed the dolphin show the most. After leaving the aquarium, we were driving to our next destination, but she was still excited, grabbing my sleeve and having fun all by herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I get back, I want to go see a dolphin show at another aquarium! I’m sure some spectacular shows will get your clothes wet without a raincoat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nikaido-senpai, that’s a performance of a killer whale, not a dolphin. It’s bigger than a dolphin, so the jumps are impressive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikaido listened to Yui-chan’s story with shining eyes. For me, dolphins were good, but I’d also like to see penguins. Aren’t they cute when they walk so slowly?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe. Then let’s go see the penguins for the rest of the summer vacation. Oh, Yuya-kun! Look out the window. It’s so beautiful!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Kaede’s urging, I looked out the window. What spread out there was a truly spectacular view. According to Mary, our car was running on an emerald green sea that was as beautiful as the jewel, with extremely high transparency that even the locals praised. Was the slightly small-looking island our destination?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re heading to a famous spot where couples from all over the country gather. It’s also called Love Island.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, so it’s on that island! The heart-shaped rock!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Otsuki-san was intrigued after hearing Mary’s explanation. Come to think of it, when we arrived at the airport, Otsuki-san listed it as one of the places she wanted to visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, mom. What should I and Nikaido-senpai do since we don’t have a boyfriend? Kaede-nee and Yoshizumi-senpai are all we can handle, so are we going to look at couples from all over the country? Are you trying to kill me?” Yui-chan grumbled. Nikaido also gave a wry smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you talking about, Yui? I told you it’s an island of love, didn’t I? It’s a sacred place for couples, but at the same time, it’s a power spot to seek love. I don’t know if it’s for you, but if there’s someone you like, just make a firm request and it might come true, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Listen to these words from Mary! Yui-chan exclaimed in happiness. However, Nikaido’s expression remained clouded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, we were crossing the bridge and moving around the island to the beach where the heart rock was located.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nikaido-senpai, were you by any chance going to pass this chance? Don’t worry, I’ll go with you! As single people, let’s go pray to God!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hey, Yui-chan. It’s dangerous, so don’t pull my arm. I’ll go. I’ll be begging you too, so don’t run!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walked from the parking lot to the beach, but the road there wasn’t paved and was a little steep, so I held Kaede’s hand tightly to make sure she didn’t fall. Normally, Otsuki-san would make fun of her, but since she and Shinji were tightly linked, it doesn’t seem like that would be the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After less than a 5-minute walk, we arrived at a small beach surrounded by the blue sea and natural rocks as seen from the car. Under the clear skies, many people had gathered to take photos at the famous heart-shaped rocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at it, Yuya-kun! It really is shaped like a heart! The tide is low now, so you can almost touch it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, Kaede? Are you going to touch it!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede took off her shoes and socks and stepped into the sea without hesitation. I hurriedly took off my shoes and rolled up the hem of the pants so they wouldn’t get wet before following.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s cool and feels good. Come on, Yuya-kun, please come quickly. Let’s touch the rock together. Let’s receive a lot of happiness from these rocks!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying that, Kaede took my hand and we touched the rock together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Both of you. Could you please turn to me so I can take a picture?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mary called out to us while holding the camera she had taken out of nowhere, so Kaede and I turned to her with our hands folded together. In front of my line of sight, I saw Otsuki-san and Shinji grinning, and Nikaido and Yui-chan were talking about something with mysterious faces. What were you planning, Yui-chan?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I’ll take a picture. What’s the answer to 1+1, both of you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nii────!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mary was making a classic call that didn’t suit her face, so I was more surprised than responding, making my reaction. Then, Kaede’s smile suddenly changed to her own. Yeah, her sullen face always seems cute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don’t you say ‘nii’ with me anymore? But I’m glad that you pat my head!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede said as she rubbed her head and asked me to pet her more. She won’t change even if she comes to Okinawa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“… Yui. Is Kaede-san always like that when she’s with Yuya-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, that’s true, Mom. I’ve talked about it many times at home, but Kaede-nee is always like that when she’s with Yoshizumi-senpai. She’s cute, but she spreads sugar in all directions, so we don’t know what to do. It’s tough…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that’s okay. When I was younger, I was always like that with Manabu-san, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time I learned that Miyamoto-san’s name was Manabu, and I was really curious about how the elderly gentleman was flirting with Mary. By the way, I wonder what Yui-chan was talking about me and Kaede-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, Yuya-san. Put your arm around Kaede-san’s waist and cling closer to her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, look, Yuya-kun. You must follow the cameraman’s instructions, right? Besides, we can’t have it all to ourselves forever, so we’ll start taking pictures quickly!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mary scolded Kaede, who was drawing closer to me. Yui-chan shrugged her shoulders and walked on the beach with Nikaido as if pretending not to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave up and made up my mind, wrapping my arms around Kaede’s soft waist and hugging her. No matter how much time passed, it was embarrassing to stare at Kaede at close range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, both of you. Give me one more look. Then let’s go. Yes, Cheese!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mary, a beautiful blonde, singing her old-fashioned chant. We couldn’t help but smile at the gap. At that moment, the shutter snapped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. They both look nice. I’ll give you the data later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Mary! Hehe. Let’s put this photo in a photo frame and display it at the entrance to fill that house with memories!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, let’s make a lot of summer memories. But since it’s embarrassing, wouldn’t it be nice if you could leave his waist?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede clung to my waist while not liking the thought of leaving my waist.  I tried to get her to leave me somehow, but she held on tight as if she were a suction cup, and I couldn’t pull her away. And it was obvious what would happen when one plays Oshikura-manju on the sea…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TN: Oshikura Manju is a simple Japanese singing game that is played on cold days to get warm. The game is played with at least three players, but it is better if there are more.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“────Wow!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bashan! With a splash, I held Kaede to her chest and dived into the sea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yuuya-kun!? Are you okay!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s my line, Kaede. Are you okay? Are your clothes wet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked as I slowly stood up. Even my underwear was completely wet, but I’m sure it would dry quickly with this sunshine and temperature. It was hot so it should be just right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks to Yuya-kun, I’m okay, but… Are you hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, it doesn’t hurt, so it’s okay. But it’s dangerous, so please don’t get angry anymore, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying this, I patted her on the head, and Kaede became quiet, like a borrowed cat. It’s not that she’s particularly angry; in fact, I’m relieved that nothing happened to Kaede-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow!? Yoshizumi-senpai, while I wasn’t looking at you guys, you got all wet!? We’re going to the beach tomorrow, aren’t we? Are you perhaps flying?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, Yui-chan, who had come to my side, let out a voice of surprise mixed with shock. Well, it was normal until just now, but that was how one would react if their whole body was wet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell…what are you doing? Here, wipe your face with this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ah. Too bad. Thank you, Nikaido.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shrugging her shoulders, Nikaido handed me a handkerchief. As I gratefully accepted the handkerchief embroidered with a cute otter and wiped my face, a question suddenly occurred to me. Where have you two been and what have you been doing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-nothing special? I was just taking a walk with Yui-chan and talking about how excited we were to go swimming at the beach tomorrow!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“… Nikaido-senpai was such an easy-to-understand person?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan muttered something meaningful as Nikaido snorted and looked away. Were you sure you were not planning something?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, Yoshizumi-senpai. We’ll find out everything tomorrow, but it’s not a bad thing. In fact, it’s a good thing for Yoshizumi-senpai!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Those are words that don’t make me feel secure. They are the same as Kaede’s ‘It’s okay.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey Yuya-kun, I shouldn’t ignore that!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Put your hand on your chest and think about it. After all, there exists no example of Kaede’s ‘okay’ being okay.</span></p>
