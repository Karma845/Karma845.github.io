<h3>Chapter 13 &ndash; Before Dinner</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“Hn, hnn…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo could feel his body shaking, or rather, being shaken, and his consciousness returned from a very pleasant sleep.</p><p class="calibre2">“Wake up Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn, Helvi…?”</p><p class="calibre2">The world around Theo was blurry, as he had just woken up, but he could see what seemed like pure white hair, and its owner was calling out to him.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. It’s already night.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn… Eh… Ehh!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s words did not reach him at first, but when he understood them, he suddenly screamed and got up.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, h-how? It was lunch time…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo remembered making lunch and eating it with Helvi… And receiving a massage.</p><p class="calibre2">He realized he had fallen asleep because of how good it felt.</p><p class="calibre2">“You have been asleep all this time.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was dumbfounded. He could not believe he wasted the afternoon sleeping.</p><p class="calibre2">Usually, he would spend this time carrying out quests he accepted in the mercenary guild. This time however, Helvi completed the quest in the morning, so his afternoon was free, but he still did not think he would sleep all the way until nighttime.</p><p class="calibre2">“Sorry for falling asleep when you’re here with me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It is no problem. By the way, Fiore was here earlier.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, Fiore?”</p><p class="calibre2">The receptionist dropped by from time to time, but it was usually after work, during the evening.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it seems she was concerned because we did not return to the guild, even though the quest was completed.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, I see. We should’ve said something…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, but she will be back, so you can apologize then.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, wait, she’s coming back?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Apparently she is coming here during dinner time. You should make enough for three, Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Got it!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo got up from the sofa, and headed towards the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre2">“Is there something I can do to help?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, then I want you to tear vegetables and stuff by hand.”</p><p class="calibre2">“An easy request.”</p><p class="calibre2">They started working in the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre2">“What did you and Fiore talk about?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, all sorts of things…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh… Like what?”</p><p class="calibre2">“We have no common subject to talk about besides you, Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, me?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi and Fiore had just met that day, so the conversation would inevitably end up being about Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">Having that said, Helvi and Theo also got married that day, right after they met. Theo summoned a devil, fell in love at first sight, and asked her to marry him.</p><p class="calibre2">“I asked what she and other receptionists think of you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, that’s kind of scary… They don’t dislike me or anything right?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course not, they all have a very favorable impression of you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see, that’s great.”</p><p class="calibre2">Out of the corner of her eye, Helvi saw Theo smile with relief.</p><p class="calibre2">Even though Theo seemed relived, Helvi was not. Many of them went past having a favorable impression, and actually fancied him.</p><p class="calibre2">Judging by what Fiore said, it seemed all of them would like to have that sort of relationship with Theo, and some even actively flirted, although Theo never noticed it.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore herself had done something similar, although she was never as assertive as others.</p><p class="calibre2">“Surely you’re the only man whose home she visits.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was a little embarrassed as she spoke, but she remembered it all came down to one thing.</p><p class="calibre2">(I’m not giving you to anyone… Theo is mine.)</p><p class="calibre2">“What’s wrong?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, nothing.”</p><p class="calibre2">For a second, Helvi’s eyes turned to those of a predator, but she held it back.</p><p class="calibre2">Afterwards, they continued preparing dinner, and before it was done, there was a knock on the door.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, Helvi, it’s Fiore.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Come in!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, you’re awake.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I’m sorry I didn’t go back to report that the quest was completed.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s alright. I heard that the Chimera had been defeated, so I knew you were alright.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmph, like I would lose to such a weakling.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hahaha… You’re really incredible, if you can call the Chimera a weakling.”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore’s dry laugh echoed.</p><p class="calibre2">She did not see the fight, or rather, the hunt, or even the corpse, so she did not know about Helvi’s overwhelming power.</p><p class="calibre2">Even Theo, who did watch, did not yet know just how strong she was.</p><p class="calibre2">In the current day, the only one that had tasted a fraction of that power was the chimera.</p><p class="calibre2">“Come have dinner with us then. We just finished preparing it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see, thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Then can you set up the table? I am going to the bathroom.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright.”</p><p class="calibre2">While the two carried the plates and put food on the table, Helvi left the living room.</p><p class="calibre2">She knew where the bathroom was, but that was not where she was headed.</p><p class="calibre2">“I turned a blind eye this morning, but now it seems I really need to take out the trash.</p><p class="calibre2">Only the Chimera knew how overwhelming Helvi’s power was, but within the next few minutes, that number would increase.</p></div>
