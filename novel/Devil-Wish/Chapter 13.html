<h1>Chapter 13: Side Story: Prince With Her Head In The Sand</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was standing alone on the balcony looking at the night sky. The sky in Okinawa was so clear that a natural planetarium spread all over the place, something you could never see in the city. The golden moon shining on the sea was also fantastic and made me feel as if I was in a fairyland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After seeing Heart Rock, we moved to the villa owned by Kazuha-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was still light when we arrived at the villa because of its tropical location, but it was already late in the evening. In addition, the long trip and sightseeing we had done since early in the morning had made us more tired than we thought, and the moment we laid down on the bed, sleep came over us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We whipped our heavy bodies and gathered around the dishes prepared by Mary and her husband, a white-haired gentleman named Manabu Miyamoto, who had joined us at the villa. It was impressive that Yoshizumi helped serve the food as if it were a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rock-paper-scissors decided the room assignment fairly, but there was a dispute here. It was only natural that Kazuha-san said she wanted to be in the same room with Yoshizumi! And then, Akiho-san insisted that she wanted to be with Higurashi, too. In Akiho’s case, I knew she was completely in a bad mood and was joking, but Kazuha-san was extremely serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, it was not a good idea for high school boys and girls to spend time in the same room together, so the pairing of Yoshizumi and Higurashi was decided, and we ladies decided by rock-paper-scissors. As a result, I was paired with Yui-chan. As soon as Yui-chan finished her dinner, she went off to bed and went into a dream, leaving me with nothing to do. But that didn’t stop me from going to Kazuha-san and Akiho’s room to play with them, so here I was alone, looking at the sky and soaking up the sentimentality of the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Finally, tomorrow is the time we go to the beach…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was almost crushed with anxiety as I talked to myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I assumed that the swimsuit I chose was cute, even though I was not being myself. I showed it to my mother after I bought it just to be sure, and she said, “Don’t worry Ai. I’m sure Yoshizumi-kun will be pleased with this one!” I was so pleased that she endorsed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no! I’m not trying to make Yoshizumi happy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head and chased away the evil thoughts, chiding myself. What Yoshizumi wanted to see was Kazuha-san in her swimsuit, not me. I would be happy if she said I was cute, but it was not a good idea to have high hopes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most important thing to think about is the plan that Yui-chan gave me. I agreed to carry it out, but now that I think about it, I was being too hasty. I may have talked too much to Yui-chan during our walk on the island of love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">~Rewinding the time~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nikaido-senpai, how about appeasing Yoshizumi-senpai at the beach tomorrow? I have a good idea… Do you want to hear it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the devil’s temptation. Not only Akiho but also Yui-chan saw that I was in love with Yoshizumi. She had anticipated this and made the suggestion. But to Yui-chan, Kazuha-san was supposed to be like a close sister. Was it okay for me to approach Yoshizumi, the boyfriend?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, of course, I’m on Kaede-nee’s side, right? But I like Nikaido-senpai just as much. Especially when it comes to Yoshizumi-senpai, I really like the way she becomes a clumsy maiden in love! That’s why I’ll support you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to tsk at Yui-chan, who clenched her fists and forcefully explained who was the clunky maiden in love, but I wanted to be a princess in front of Yoshizumi, so I couldn’t say anything back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to do the standard summer beach begging! Well, I think Kaede-nee is thinking about it too, and if anything, it’s a confirmed future to the point where I force Yoshizumi-senpai, who refuses, to do it for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d heard that there were predictions and measurements in future vision, but I was sure that Yoshizumi was the only one who would understand when I talked about this stuff so I wouldn’t say anything. What was more important was what Kazuha-san was planning to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Yui-chan told me about the plan, I was appalled. No, it was too embarrassing. I couldn’t ask Yoshizumi to do such a thing. There was no way I could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, this is only destructive because Nikaido-senpai will do it. If my calculation is correct, there is a high probability that I can defeat Yoshizumi-senpai with a single blow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, wasn’t that too aggressive? In fact, if I went that far, wouldn’t Yoshizumi find out about my feelings?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry! If something happens, just say, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The sea has a magical power to make women bold, Yoshizumi,’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and I’m sure he’ll understand! Maybe, maybe, MAYBE!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I sometimes hear that line from Kazuha-san, but then it’s usually not okay, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan laughed as if to deceive me in response to my perfectly honest question. They really were like sisters, Yui-chan and Kazuha-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave it to me to take care of Kaede-nee while you’re carrying out your mission. I’ll invite her and pull her away from the two of you without any further ado. Please make memories in Okinawa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would have preferred something a little more normal if possible…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s the case, why don’t you invite them to a summer festival? If you want, how about going to watch the fireworks together? The magic of yukata is as powerful as the ocean, you know!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The summer festival would be held as soon as we returned from this trip. It was a big festival that I went to last year with all of my classmates, including Yoshizumi, and the biggest draw was the massive fireworks display. Yoshizumi and I were so mesmerized by the colorful flower circles of all sizes that we forgot to breathe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnh… If you can make a face like that, why isn’t Nikaido-senpai really dating Yoshizumi-senpai? It’s one of the seven wonders of Meiwadai High School, this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even Yasaka-kun told me that. Well, to put it simply, he said I was a slacker. In that respect, she is…Yasaka-kun is amazing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before our trip to Okinawa, Yasaka-kun, a first-year student, confessed his feelings for me. He told me “I love you” in a very natural way, without any pretense. He easily did what I had not been able to do for more than a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the days between the confession and the trip, I saw him several times, but he acted as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t mean to be rude when I say this, but didn’t you ever think of going out with him on a trial basis? When you were in junior high school and even now? There are a few girls like that around you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I have. Maybe that’s normal. But you know, Yui-chan. I can’t do it. I can’t be the one to go out with someone lightly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yasaka-kun confessed casually as if nothing had happened, but when he said “I love you,” there was no lie in his eyes, he was serious. This was very different from me, who was afraid to take the last step because I was afraid of ruining our current relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, I was surprised when he told me, and to be honest, I was happy. I didn’t feel bad, strangely enough. I’m sorry to say this to him, but when I close my eyes, the first face that comes to mind is not Yasaka-kun, but Yoshizumi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said with a wry smile. My feelings for him had grown even stronger since Yoshizumi cheered me up during the ball game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Yasaka-kun’s confession gave me the courage to go on like this. So I’ll…try my best.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s the spirit, Nikaido-senpai! I’ll support you too, even if it’s only a little bit! Good luck at the beach tomorrow!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">~Back to present~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did I agree to it? I don’t know how I got so worked up about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed for the umpteenth time in self-mockery. Immediately after this conversation, Yoshizumi dived into the sea with Kazuha-san in his arms. I handed him a handkerchief that I had with me, relieved that he did not seem to be hurt. Thinking back, I was too blunt at that time. I should have wiped his face instead of handing it to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if Kazuha-san would get angry if I did that. If she knew about tomorrow, she might get even angrier. But to borrow a phrase from Yui-chan, one can’t resist the magic of the sea, can they?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t help but laugh. The anxious feeling had vanished somewhere and I was kind of looking forward to tomorrow. Kazuha-san was Yoshizumi’s girlfriend, so it was a privilege to flirt with her, but I also wanted Yoshizumi to pay more attention to me.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yeah, I’ll try my best tomorrow.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went back inside my room to get my energy up for the next morning. In the bed, Yui-chan, who was a beautiful girl when silent, was sleeping with a happy face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Munyamunyai… Ehehehe… Me and Kaede-nee will take a bath together. Yoshizumi-senpai please have a mixed bath with Nikaido-senpai. …… mnya mnya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe. What on earth are you dreaming about? I’m glad you’re having fun, but even showing Yoshizumi myself in a swimsuit is embarrassing, and taking a bath together is too high of a hurdle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckle as I gently stroke her silky smooth blonde hair. If I were to take a bath with Yoshizumi, I would definitely have to wear a bathing suit, otherwise it would be too embarrassing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would have to wear only a bath towel and surprise Yoshizumi, who was probably wearing a bathing suit under it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one would break a promise themselves. I need to get ready for bed instead of thinking about stupid things.</span></p>
