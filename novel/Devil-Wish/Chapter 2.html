<h3>EX2: The Night the Magic Wears Off</h3>


<p>A few stations away by express train, there’s a famous hotel located in the entertainment district not far from the office area. I met with the aforementioned producer in the café situated in the hotel lobby.</p>



<p>“G-Good evening! Thank you for inviting me today!”</p>



<p>“Hi, good evening. Sorry about this, calling you out all of a sudden the day after yesterday.”</p>



<p>“No, it’s fine.”</p>



<p>She appeared to be in her mid-thirties, but her composed demeanor gave the impression of someone slightly older. </p>



<p>I tended to believe the latter. </p>



<p>Like my mother, people in this industry generally look younger than their actual age.</p>



<p>“I’ve been hearing about you from Yagami-sensei, your drama club’s alumnus. She mentioned a junior with great potential. Then there was that whole buzz incident. I wanted to meet you before other agencies approached you… So by coming today, you’re okay with appearing in the project, right?”</p>



<p>“…Eh?”</p>



<p>Appear? What is she talking about?</p>



<p>All I knew was that a producer, who was directing the movie adaptation of our club leader’s award-winning work, wanted to meet me.</p>



<p>Taken aback by the sudden turn of the conversation, I frantically turned to look at the leader sitting beside me for support.</p>



<p>“Ah, maybe I didn’t mention it? We’re currently shooting a movie and I wanted Haruka-chan to play a small role.”</p>



<p>“I haven’t heard anything about this!?”</p>



<p>“Eh—? I’m sure I mentioned it… Oh, sorry, I might not have said it was for a movie. But if a producer summons Haruka-chan for a meeting, what else could it be for? You should’ve guessed.”</p>



<p>What an unreasonable thing for her to say…! I was left speechless, unable to find words.</p>



<p>Seeing my change in complexion, the producer must have realized that there had been no confirmation of my intentions and said with a troubled look, </p>



<p>“Oh dear, Yagami-sensei, you need to be more clear. You always fall short with your explanations.”</p>



<p>“It can’t be helped. I have such a rich imagination; it’s hard to understand people who don’t think the same way.”</p>



<p>“Well, if the message didn’t get across, let me ask you again. How about it? The role is of the protagonist’s classmate, and there aren’t many lines, but if you’re interested in the world of acting, I think it could be a great experience for you.”</p>



<p>The producer made the proposal to me once again.</p>



<p>Indeed, I was bewildered by the unexpected turn of events, but the reason I had accompanied the leader today was precisely to seize such opportunities. And now, that opportunity had literally rolled to my feet. </p>



<p>This was a pleasant surprise.</p>



<p>…My heart was pounding fiercely. I felt a warmth spread through my body, and I could sense the sweat breaking out on my back, drenching it.</p>



<p>I wondered if I was getting carried away.</p>



<p>Was I, on a mere whim, trying to leap into a world that was way out of my league?</p>



<p>Everything was going too well, too conveniently.</p>



<p>Was there some kind of dreadful setback waiting for me?</p>



<p>The calm part of me whispered these doubts.</p>



<p>The anxiety was definitely there.</p>



<p>But… if I didn’t seize this chance now, presented by a stroke of incredible fortune, I knew I would regret my cowardice forever.</p>



<p>I understood that much.</p>



<p>I didn’t want that.</p>



<p>So… with all the courage I could muster, I reached out for the chance before me.</p>



<p>“I’ll do it! Please let me do it!”</p>



<p>“That’s great to hear. From now on, we’re colleagues. I look forward to working with you.”</p>



<p>“Yes! I look forward to working with you too!”</p>



<p>I said it.</p>



<p>There was no turning back.</p>



<p>With that realization, the overly loud beating of my heart began to calm down.</p>



<p>The leader had said it as well. </p>



<p>Up to this point, it was all just luck. Seizing that luck depended on the courage to reach out and the strength of one’s grip. I had mustered the courage. </p>



<p>Now it was about strength.</p>



<p>Maybe I still lacked the necessary strength.</p>



<p>The chance I thought I had grasped might slip through my fingers.</p>



<p>But… that would be the outcome. It’s not something I can control.</p>



<p>What I can do from now on is to give it my all, to do everything I can.</p>



<p>I’ll exert my utmost effort. I’ll practice even more than I do now.</p>



<p>It might mean less time for dates, but Hiromichi-kun will understand.</p>



<p>“Then, now that we’ve settled our discussion, let’s hurry to the restaurant. It’s on this building’s rooftop, right? I didn’t eat anything because I planned on having Itoi-san treat me today, so I’m really hungry.”</p>



<p>“I understand. But could you wait just a little bit longer?”</p>



<p>“Why’s that?”</p>



<p>“Well, actually, it’s not just me who wants to meet Haruka-chan…”</p>



<p>“Someone wants to meet me?”</p>



<p>“I haven’t heard anything about this.”</p>



<p>“Today, at another filming site, everyone was talking about Haruka-chan’s viral commotion. When I mentioned that I’d be meeting today’s Cinderella, one of the actors insisted on joining us. Haruka-chan, your mother was an actress back in the day, right? It’s someone who worked with her and seems to remember meeting Haruka-chan as a child.”</p>



<p>“Eh? My mother…?”</p>



<p>Who could it be? Mom’s active years as an actress weren’t that long, but even so, I met so many people back then, I can’t pinpoint who it could be. To begin with, I don’t remember most of their names.</p>



<p>What should I do? It would be terribly rude if they remembered me but I didn’t remember them…</p>



<p>“Ah, here they come. This way, please, ──Takao-san.”</p>



<p>But the moment I heard that name, all my worries vanished.</p>



<p>I remember that name.</p>



<p>It’s impossible to forget.</p>



<p>“Sorry about that. The taxi got caught in a traffic jam. Did I make you wait?”</p>



<p>“No, we were just early.”</p>



<p>“────────”</p>



<p>My calm heart began to stir again.</p>



<p>But unlike before, my body did not become hot.</p>



<p>Rather… it felt cold. As if freezing right from my fingertips.</p>



<p>Compelling my rigid body to move, I turned towards the direction of the voice.</p>



<p>“Heh, you’ve grown up beautifully, haven’t you, Haruka-chan? I wonder if you remember me?”</p>



<p>The man who had destroyed my family was standing there.</p>
