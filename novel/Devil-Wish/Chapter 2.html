<h3>Chapter 2 &ndash; Summoned</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“What is this…?”</p><p class="calibre2">It was inside a dirty old book about magic.</p><p class="calibre2">Usually, if someone wanted to study magic, they would start with newer books. Newer books had the latest advancements in magic research, and there was a lot to learn from them.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was completely clueless about this, so he thought a beginner like himself should start with old books.</p><p class="calibre2">Inside the old book, he found a piece of paper. It was completely unrelated to the contents of the book, and it was just sitting there inside it.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo grabbed the paper and read it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Devil summoning technique…?”</p><p class="calibre2">There was a drawing of a magic circle, and written above it was [devil summoning technique].</p><p class="calibre2">Theo didn’t really know anything about devils, so he decided to investigate.</p><p class="calibre2">He read in a certain book that ‘devils deceive people and are the lowest kind of being’.</p><p class="calibre2">Everything else he read gave off the same bad impression, but there was something written in almost every book Theo read about the subject, that piqued his interest.</p><p class="calibre2">“In return for granting a wish… They take something important.”</p><p class="calibre2">They didn’t say what that important thing was, but Theo was drawn by the idea of having a wish granted.</p><p class="calibre2">If he asked a devil to make him strong, that wish could come true.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo sprung to action, and looked up how to summon a devil.</p><p class="calibre2">He decided to perform the ritual in the house where he lived with the elderly couple.</p><p class="calibre2">The summoning was performed by placing the piece of paper with the magic circle on the floor, and letting a drop of his own blood fall in its center.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo lightly cut his own wrist. His face twisted in pain, but it did not hurt as much as when a member of a party he was working with kicked him in the stomach and called him useless.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, the drop of blood fell on the summoning circle…</p><p class="calibre2">“Wah, wawah!”</p><p class="calibre2">The summoning circle started overflowing with a mystical light, and Theo instinctively put up his hands and closed his eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">A few seconds later the light settled, and when Theo opened his eyes, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen was hovering above the magic circle.</p><p class="calibre2">The books did mention the appearance of devils, but focused mainly on their horns and wings.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo could not help but be fascinated, and completely missed what the devil said.</p><p class="calibre2">[Wait, I have to say my wish…!]</p><p class="calibre2">What Theo wanted was power, but…</p><p class="calibre2">“Please m-marry me!!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Ah?”</p><p class="calibre2">At that moment, he wanted the devil woman to be his wife.</p><p class="calibre2">There was a long silence. Perhaps it only felt long to them, and in reality, only a few seconds passed.</p><p class="calibre2">The devil was the first to break this silence.</p><p class="calibre2">“What are you saying?”</p><p class="calibre2">She understood the meaning of those words. They were the words that men said to women they wanted to marry, but she did not understand why they were being said to her.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you by any chance saying you fell in love with me at first sight?”</p><p class="calibre2">That was exactly it.</p><p class="calibre2">In that world, a demon like herself was something to be avoided.</p><p class="calibre2">Her pure white hair and those very unhuman horns and wings were characteristic of devils.</p><p class="calibre2">It was beyond foolish for someone to like such a being, let alone ask her to marry him…</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-Yes! I fell in love at first sight!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Wha!? D-Don’t lie!”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s not a lie! Grandpa told me not to lie!”</p><p class="calibre2">The devil had no reason to care about this, she did not even know who this ‘grandpa’ was.</p><p class="calibre2">The boy, whose face was completely red by now, said he was not lying, but she had the power to peek inside his heart.</p><p class="calibre2">[It matters little how much you lie on the outside. I can see everything, including whatever it is you are plotting inside your heart.]</p><p class="calibre2">The devil activated her magic to peek inside his heart, and then…</p><p class="calibre2">[Pretty, beautiful, lovely… No, those words aren’t enough to describe her! I’ve never seen a woman like her! I like those sharp eyes so much. How soft would those trembling lips feel if I touched them? Those big eyes and crimson pupils are so beautiful… The contrast between her black dress, horns, and wings and her pure white hair is just lovely. Oh? Is her face getting red? This isn’t fair, not only is she beautiful, but she’s cute too! And I feel I shouldn’t say this, but her figure is great too…]</p><p class="calibre2">She stopped looking.</p><p class="calibre2">[Wait wait wait. What is with this boy?]</p><p class="calibre2">She quickly turned her head, so as not to let the boy see her face rapidly becoming red.</p><p class="calibre2">Devils lived long lives, but she had never felt so much affection being thrown her way.</p><p class="calibre2">Up until that point, all the humans that summoned her were people consumed by desire, who did not waste time before saying their wish, and tried to run when it was granted.</p><p class="calibre2">They were afraid of the compensation, but none managed to get away.</p><p class="calibre2">The boy standing in front of her was completely different. He told her his wish, but she could not understand its meaning.</p><p class="calibre2">[Wanting to marry a devil like me…!]</p><p class="calibre2">She turned away, and only snuck small peeks, but Theo misinterpreted these movements and thought she was shaking her head.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I’m sorry… This wish is impossible to grant…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo lowered his head, with tears welling up in his eyes, and the devil’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p class="calibre2">[D-Did I… Just think that this boy is cute…!?]</p><p class="calibre2">Thought the devil while her heart was pounding.</p><p class="calibre2">“T-There is no wish I cannot grant.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, then…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The boy suddenly raised his head, and his expression became bright.</p><p class="calibre2">The devil tried her hardest not to let her face show that her heart had once again skipped a beat.</p><p class="calibre2">“C-Contract formed. I will m-m-marry you!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-Yes! Thank you very much!”</p><p class="calibre2">And thus, a new couple was born.</p>
