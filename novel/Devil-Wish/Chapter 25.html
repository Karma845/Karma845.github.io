<h3>Chapter 25: Reluctant X Restart</h3>

<p>I love my twin sister Haruka Saikawa, who has been separated from me since childhood.</p>



<p>She is so innocent, charming, kind, yet clumsy.</p>



<p>I’ve always thought highly of her because of the qualities that I don’t have.</p>



<p>My love did not change even when I began to like her boyfriend, Hiromichi Sato, also my stepbrother from my mother’s second marriage.</p>



<p>Though I feared her as a formidable love rival, I never once thought of hating her.</p>



<p>But…</p>



<p><em>|| “</em>Even if we don’t do anything extreme, we’ll grow to love each other. I think true love is like that. It’s not lust. A pure relationship of mutual affection, I want us to be like that, Hiromichi-kun.”</p>



<p>As I listened to her pleadings over the phone call, while my brother slept on my lap exhausted from crying, I felt as if my heart had been pierced with a cold sharp knife.</p>



<p>Judging from my brother’s cries and my sister’s pleadings, I had a rough idea of what had happened between the two of them today.</p>



<p>Unknowingly, this brother of mine had made a terrible mistake.</p>



<p>He had been struggling with his feelings lately.</p>



<p>Ever since my sister rejected him at the beach, he had been afraid of closing the distance between them.</p>



<p><em>Is it okay to get any closer? What if she rejects him again?</em></p>



<p>He was so cautious that it became difficult for him to spend time with my sister.</p>



<p>That’s probably why he wanted to clear the misunderstanding as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Apparently, he prepared the contraceptive to show my sister that he wasn’t after her body, who was supposedly rejecting him in fear of unwanted pregnancy.</p>



<p>However, this upset my sister.</p>



<p>It is something that can’t be helped.</p>



<p>She just explained about our parent’s divorce over the phone. It was a traumatic experience, which also triggered her actions.</p>



<p>And unlike me, my sister was taken in and raised by an <em>unfaithful</em> father.</p>



<p>I guess that also influenced her views on love.</p>



<p>Well, in any case, revealing contraceptives in front of a woman, even if it’s your girlfriend, was the worst thing my brother did.</p>



<p>I suppose a good slap should return some sense into him.</p>



<p>But that’s the end of the story.</p>



<p>Until she scolded him for bringing the contraceptive and expressed her rejection.</p>



<p>There are a few things that we as humans just can’t accept. There’s nothing wrong with expressing that by having a fight and reconciling. Rather, such a conflict should not be avoided. </p>



<p>But from this point on, this phone call is different.</p>



<p>After accusing my brother for spinning out of control in order to gain her trust. She kicked him out. And even said she wanted to marry him before the end of the conversation.</p>



<p>But justifying her views based on the trauma caused by the divorce of our parents…</p>



<p>Isn’t that just too cruel?</p>



<p>What will happen to my brother if he hears her talking like this?</p>



<p>He won’t be able to say anything.</p>



<p>He won’t be able to ask for love, and he won’t be able to distance himself from my sister who says she loves him.</p>



<p>And worse, he would blame himself for being a frivolous man by trying to rely on me, when my sister is so serious about their future. </p>



<p>Indeed, just like the night at camp. </p>



<p><em>It’s not her fault. It’s all his fault. He should be patient. For the sake of the broken, poor girl, he has to push down his feelings and endure no matter how lonely he is.</em></p>



<p><em>No matter how lonely, no matter how hard, no matter how painful it will be…</em></p>



<p>Out of kindness.</p>



<p>Such a gentle person who tries his best for others.</p>



<p>Why can’t you see that your boyfriend is such a kind person?</p>



<p>Why can’t you see how much this phone call will push him over the edge? </p>



<p>… No, it’s not that she can’t understand.</p>



<p>She knows.</p>



<p>She’s aware and thinks about it subconsciously.</p>



<p>… That my kind brother will not be able to escape from her if she says this. </p>



<p>She believes that there’s no way my brother could give up on her.</p>



<p>What a cunning witch she is, wearing such a cute smile.</p>



<p>This phone call is like a collar.</p>



<p>Her words are like a chain gripping his throat, making him swallow all complaints, and keeping him in her yard, not allowing him to run away out of thirst or hunger.</p>



<p>For the first time in my life, after hearing such words, I hated my sister.</p>



<p>And at the same time, I thought to myself.</p>



<p>I can’t let my brother hear these words.</p>



<p><em>⸺Please let me forget Haruka. </em></p>



<p>I don’t want to see my brother, who is so gentle and sincere, get hurt by my sister, who doesn’t understand him.</p>



<p>So I pressed the call button on my brother’s phone, which was recording her phone call.</p>



<p>“Enough of your selfishness, Nee-san!” </p>



<p>And then, on impulse, I blurted those words without thinking about the consequences.</p>



<p>In a cold tone that I have never directed at her before.</p>



<p>The words that will inevitably destroy the secret relationship between me and my brother, and the relationship between us sisters. But… </p>



<p>|| “I’m really sorry about what happened today… Let me apologize again when I see you.”</p>



<p>There was no response from my sister.</p>



<p>The reason was simple.</p>



<p>I didn’t swipe the button I had pressed because I had no reason to.</p>



<p>|| “Oh. My dad’s home now, so I’d better go. I’d be happy if I could talk to you, even if it’s LINE. See you then.”. </p>



<p>In the meantime, the call from my sister was cut off and the recording ended.</p>



<p>My fatal words were never conveyed to her. </p>



<p>I let out a sigh.</p>



<p>It’s not a relief that I didn’t say anything unnecessary to her.</p>



<p>It’s a relief that I was able to stop myself from becoming the kind of person that I detest.</p>



<p><em>Seriously, what were you just thinking, Shigure Sato? </em></p>



<p><em>You feel sorry for your brother?</em></p>



<p><em>You don’t want to see your brother hurt by your sister?</em></p>



<p><em>You, of all people, talk of fairness?</em></p>



<p><em>You, who took your brother’s lips without permission, knowing that he had a girlfriend, your own sister, and ruined his first love, and now feeling sorry for him.</em></p>



<p><em>“How shameless!!”</em></p>



<p>These feelings inside me are not out of pity.</p>



<p><em>I just hate it. I hate the fact that my sister is able to sway his feelings more than me.</em></p>



<p><em>I am utterly jealous of the difference between us sisters. After all, he touched me in hopes of my sister.</em></p>



<p><em>I am jealous to the point of burning myself.</em></p>



<p><em>Don’t try to disguise it with ill-fitted righteousness.</em></p>



<p><em>You don’t have the right to do that, and more importantly… It’s a waste. </em></p>



<p>This is the first love that I wanted to get, even if I had to destroy my relationship with my beloved sister.</p>



<p>“… I’m sorry, Shigure…” </p>



<p>My brother, who is sleeping on my lap, shuddered.</p>



<p>What are you apologizing for? </p>



<p><em>“Then let me hold you.”</em></p>



<p>At first I thought he was trying to take out his frustration on me.</p>



<p>I took advantage of his weakness and urged him to do so.</p>



<p>And yet, he can only blame himself. Such a person… </p>



<p>Such softness is charming.</p>



<p>Such a kind heart is precious.</p>



<p>I gently stroked his hair hoping he could dream better.</p>



<p>“It’s okay. It’s not your fault, Onii-san. So please don’t make that face. “</p>



<p>And at that moment, I decided…</p>



<p>If my sister wants to chain and love him only when she feels like it, so be it. I will give him everything I have in place of her.</p>



<p>I will satisfy his hunger.</p>



<p>I will quench his thirst.</p>



<p>I will warm his cold.</p>



<p>Not as my sister, as I have been doing. But as Shigure.</p>



<p>I’ll make him forget about her, just as he wanted.</p>



<p><em>“I love Haruka more than Shigure.”</em></p>



<p>I’ll make sure that he’ll never say something like that again.</p>



<p>I’m sure he’ll resist doing so out of concern for her, but no matter what…</p>



<p>I won’t let him say that again.</p>



<p>Because that is the only thing I can do. </p>



<p>“You are not the only one who can take advantage of his kindness, Nee-san!” </p>



<p>***</p>



<p>When I woke up, I was alone in my room.</p>



<p>I found a note saying that Shigure had gone out to shop for dinner.</p>



<p>She hadn’t made anything for me because I was with Haruka.</p>



<p>But after having a scuffle with her, I returned home without having dinner.</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Laying in the middle of the empty room, I looked up at the lamp and frowned.</p>



<p>Not because of the light.</p>



<p>But because of the regret that burns deep in my heart. </p>



<p>After I listened to Haruka’s recorded phone call.</p>



<p>I never knew that Haruka and Shigure were separated like that.</p>



<p>I never asked Shigure about it either.</p>



<p>No wonder Haruka was uncomfortable regarding sex.</p>



<p>And yet, I imposed my feelings on Haruka.</p>



<p>I didn’t buy the c*nd*m because I wanted to have sex with Haruka,</p>



<p>I too,</p>



<p>I was trying to regain the trust that was damaged a few days ago at the beach trip.</p>



<p>I wanted Haruka, who was wary of making a mistake on impulse, to know that I would not act so thoughtlessly, and that I cared for her not by just words but with assurance as well.</p>



<p>But… that said, I can’t deny that I found her to be sexually attractive.</p>



<p>I guess, it was this nature of mine that she’s afraid of.</p>



<p>“I have to change…”</p>



<p>There aren’t enough words to express how much I love her.</p>



<p>That’s why I wanted to tell her by kiss and contact. I wanted her to be aware of it. But I never thought that she’d hate me for it.</p>



<p>That’s how I felt, but knowing Haruka has such a trauma, I won’t ask for it anymore.</p>



<p>I care for her more than myself.</p>



<p>I cherish her with compassion and consider her dear to me.</p>



<p>Together we will nurture the “true love” that she desires.</p>



<p>I’ll never force my feelings on her ever again.</p>



<p>I will hold back, till the day she forgives me.</p>



<p>It’s okay. I can do this.</p>



<p>Because Haruka, despite my mistake, has told me that she wants to have a family with me.</p>



<p>Even if she refuses physical intimacy, I know that in her heart, she loves me. </p>



<p>As long as our hearts are connected, I will be fine.</p>



<p>“I’m home.”</p>



<p>As I was thinking, Shigure came back from shopping.</p>



<p>In both of her hands, she was carrying a shopping bag with green onions and radish leaves sticking out.</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re up already Onii-san.”</p>



<p>“… Shigure.”</p>



<p>“Please wait for a while. I’ll make it quick.” </p>



<p>… Oh, yeah. Haruka wasn’t the only one I had to apologize to.</p>



<p>I made a crazy remark to Shigure earlier saying “If you love me, let me hold you.”</p>



<p>I turned to Shigure over my frustration when Haruka rejected me.</p>



<p>I owe her a sincere apology.</p>



<p>I got up and went to the kitchen.</p>



<p>“Um, Shigure… I’m sorry about what happened earlier.” </p>



<p>“Earlier…? Why did you say that?”</p>



<p>“… You know, the funny thing I said about holding you.”</p>



<p>Shigure chuckled and replied with a tender smile.</p>



<p>“I don’t mind, Onii-san. You haven’t done anything.”</p>



<p>… Why are you so kind to me, Shigure?</p>



<p>Why are you always there for me?</p>



<p>Why do you always give me what and when I want?</p>



<p>Yet, for me to rely on you this many times…</p>



<p>I knew I shouldn’t, but like an alcoholic, it had become a bad habit of mine.</p>



<p>I asked for something I shouldn’t have, but now I have to put an end to this.</p>



<p>I will change, and from now on, I will trust Haruka, and together we will build a ‘true love’.</p>



<p>So that’s why, Shigure has to know… </p>



<p>“Rather, it made me happy.”</p>



<p>“… Why are you happy?”</p>



<p>“Of course I am. Because it was the first time you needed me as ‘Shigure.’ Onii-san, you who used to prioritise and love Nee-san, said that you wanted to forget her.”</p>



<p>“… H-how?”</p>



<p>W-wait, t-that’s not what I meant.</p>



<p>Well, I did want to forget about her.</p>



<p>I wanted to, but that was because I was unaware of her worries.</p>



<p>I lost my mind because I didn’t know that Haruka was in such a situation.</p>



<p>But now that she told me, I will never wish to forget her.</p>



<p>Well, before the situation turns bad, I have to clear up this misunderstanding right away. </p>



<p>“N-no, that was different!” </p>



<p>“Different?”</p>



<p>“I was a bit desperate at the time, my feelings got messed up and I said something without thinking…”</p>



<p>“So you’re saying it was a lie?”</p>



<p>“No, it’s not a lie, but…”</p>



<p>“Onii-san, when you knew that I liked you, why did you make fun of me by saying something you didn’t mean?”</p>



<p>“N-no, I wasn’t trying to make fun of you…” </p>



<p>“If it’s not Nee-san, you can rip my heart as much as you want. Am I that insignificant to you, Onii-san?</p>



<p>“That’s..” </p>



<p>Now that you mention it, I’m probably the worst.</p>



<p>How selfish of me to say that when I knew Shigure liked me, but then change my mind and pretend that it never happened, suddenly wanting to change everything and stop relying on Shigure from now on.</p>



<p>I am too selfish!</p>



<p>Why did I never consider Shigure?</p>



<p>I took advantage of her love, kept her to myself, and then abandoned her when she was no longer needed.</p>



<p>It’s not a matter of being a brother or a man, it’s a matter of being a human being.</p>



<p>… But even so,</p>



<p>I hate to say it, but nothing good is going to happen if I keep avoiding problems.</p>



<p>I’ve already made a decision to reconnect with Haruka. I’ll work harder for the sake of the girl who was hurt. For that to happen, I have to clear things here.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry.” </p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>“I had no idea that Haruka was traumatized because of your parents divorce. If I had known, I would have never considered the possibility that Haruka didn’t like me! But now that I have heard her message, I have no doubts. So please, forget about that stupid thing I said earlier! I know I’m hurting you by making such a selfish request, but I want to start over with Haruka again… So please forgive me…!”</p>



<p>I told her how I felt and bowed my head sincerely.</p>



<p>That’s because I knew a lame excuse would hurt her even more.</p>



<p>So all I could do was tell her of my sincerity.</p>



<p>It would be fine, Shigure is a kind girl. I’m sure she’ll understand…</p>



<p>“No. I won’t.”</p>



<p>I was hoping that she would forgive me, but the response I got was unexpectedly harsh.</p>



<p>W-what should I do? To be honest, I don’t know how to pursue when someone rejects.</p>



<p>“Onii-san, you’ve got one hell of a misunderstanding.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“I care for you, not because I am kind or out of pity, but because I love you. I want you to look at me, even if just a little. I want to touch you, regardless of the reason. I really love you. Do you expect a woman like me to accept the nonsense that you want to try again with Nee-san? Why would I? If possible I’ll use any means necessary to ruin it.”</p>



<p>“S-Shigure…?”</p>



<p>R-ruin you say, what does that even mean? What are you saying…</p>



<p>“So, my answer is this: if you keep refusing me, I’ll tell Nee-san everything you’ve done up to now, every secret you’ve been keeping from her…”</p>



<p>!!!</p>



<p>“I’ll tell her that we have been living together as brother and sister, and you’ve been kissing me in secret, and how sweetly you’ve been spoiling me, and about what you asked for a while ago… Now tell me, will you be able to start over when Nee-san hears that?”</p>



<p>I was shocked to see her smile as she uttered something outrageous.</p>



<p>Because her eyes weren’t smiling.</p>



<p>I was reflected in her eyes that are filled with burning passion and scorching obsession.</p>



<p>Shigure was serious. If I try to reject her, she’ll ruin everything, the very thread of balance that exists, because of her desire.</p>



<p>If that happens, Haruka will find out that I relied on Shigure like an alcoholic to cover my insecurities— there’s no way I can start over.</p>



<p>Everything will be destroyed.</p>



<p>“Do you understand now? You may think that you can start over, but that’s impossible. You’ve already reached a point where there’s no turning back, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>Then she hooked her arms around my neck. And then licked her lips showing her red tongue, like a snake entangling its prey…</p>



<p>“Yes. I won’t allow you to go back. No matter what. I’ll make you forget.” </p>



<p>And all of a sudden, her moist lips bit mine.</p>



<p>I accepted the preying kiss, unable to move like a frog stared at by a snake.</p>



<p>I felt dizzy as the heat from her tongue seeped in like poison, consuming my whole body.</p>



<p>All I could hear was her breathing as her saliva mixed with mine.</p>



<p>The resolution I had just made became distant.</p>



<p>My heart ached painfully.</p>



<p>Thump, thump.</p>



<p>At that time I couldn’t tell if it was from anxiety or excitement.</p>
