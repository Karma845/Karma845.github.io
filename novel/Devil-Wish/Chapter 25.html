<h3>Chapter 25 &ndash; Report of Quest Completed</h3>

<p class="calibre2">In the end, Theo and Helvi only finished their medicinal herb picking quest in the evening.</p><p class="calibre2">Such quests usually ended before sunset, but both knew very well why they were late.</p><p class="calibre2">“So, should we go back…?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes… I’m sorry it has gotten so late.”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-no, I lost track of time too…”</p><p class="calibre2">They went back to the guild, too embarrassed to even look at each other.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was a little used to this by now, but Theo was not. Because of this, it was mostly Theo who could not look at Helvi’s face.</p><p class="calibre2">(It’s so cute how he’s looking down, with his face completely red…)</p><p class="calibre2">The city was full of people in the evening.</p><p class="calibre2">Many were returning from work, and many went to the shopping street to buy what they needed for dinner.</p><p class="calibre2">In such a busy street, it was only a matter of time until someone walking while looking down bumped into someone else, and Theo was about to collide with someone going the opposite way.</p><p class="calibre2">“Watch out.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah…”</p><p class="calibre2">But just before it happened, Helvi put her hand on his shoulder and pulled him closer.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s face was pressed into Helvi’s chest for a moment.</p><p class="calibre2">“Looking down while walking is dangerous.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yesh…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo finally looked up, and was surprised to see his face was in Helvi’s chest.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-hum…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hnn, don’t speak there Theo… It tickles.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s clothes had a small opening in the chest area, so his breath was hitting her directly.</p><p class="calibre2">“…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s face was red all the way up to his ears, and Helvi, who was looking down, was also starting to turn red.</p><p class="calibre2">She wanted to seal his mouth right there, but realized they were right in the middle of the shopping street, and most people passing by were watching their passionate embrace.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi did not feel embarrassed about people around them watching, but also did not feel like putting on a show by kissing Theo there.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let us keep going Theo. If we do not report soon, it will be dark before we get home.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, y-yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi did not miss the sad face Theo made for a second when she stepped away from him.</p><p class="calibre2">She approached his face from the side…</p><p class="calibre2">“You can touch all you want when we get home.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…!? No, hum…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi let out a captivating smile, as she saw a surprised Theo step back.</p><p class="calibre2">Afterwards, Helvi could not see Theo’s face at all, and took him by the hand to the guild.</p><p class="calibre2">“What’s wrong Theo? It’s like your face is on fire.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Please don’t ask…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo could not answer Fiore’s question.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo delivered the medicinal herbs in good condition, and the quest was completed.</p><p class="calibre2">But just as the two were leaving, the guild’s door was opened. It was opened with such force, that most people present turned its way, and Theo and Helvi, who were getting ready to leave, were no exception.</p><p class="calibre2">There were two girls.</p><p class="calibre2">One looked like a warrior, and had a lot of exposed skin. Her shoulder length hair was red, and while it looked messy, it was a little tidy.</p><p class="calibre2">With her cute eyes, she started looking around the guild.</p><p class="calibre2">The other girl looked like a sorcerer, with a pointed hat to match.</p><p class="calibre2">She looked a little awkward, but also gave the impression of being very skillful.</p><p class="calibre2">Her slightly wavy, beautiful blonde hair reached her back, her eyes were a little pointed, and she was beautiful.</p><p class="calibre2">Not many women entered this mercenary guild full of dirty men.</p><p class="calibre2">That day, the guild was quiet due to the absence of the usual men, but were it not the case, it would certainly be rowdy.</p><p class="calibre2">Since there were few people around, the warrior quickly found who she was looking for.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah! Theo, it’s been a while!”</p><p class="calibre2">She ran towards Theo with a smile on her face, and right behind her was the sorcerer, looking a little happy.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, Xena!? And Celia!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo yelled upon seeing them.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, you remember us.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course! It’s been a while Xena!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes it has!”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena, the warrior looking woman, smiled.</p><p class="calibre2">“Celia too. It’s been a while.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufu, yes. I’m glad to see you’re energetic as always Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I’m glad to see you’re doing well too.”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia the sorcerer let out a light smile.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, but you still look like the same old Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Really?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, like your height.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Uu… Don’t say that, I’m self-conscious about that.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was smaller than Xena and Celia back when they were a party, and that had not changed.</p><p class="calibre2">“I like it, see? It makes it easier to pat…”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena said as she reached over to touch Theo’s head, but…</p><p class="calibre2">“I cannot allow you to touch without my permission.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi grabbed her arm.</p></div>
