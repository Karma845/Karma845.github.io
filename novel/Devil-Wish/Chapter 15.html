<h3>Chapter 15 &ndash; Continuation of Reward</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“Ah, welcome back Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo says with a smile as he sees Helvi enter the living room.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I’m back.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi as though nothing happened, with her cheeks softening a little.</p><p class="calibre2">“We just finished setting everything up.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see, I apologize for having you do it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“No problem, Fiore helped me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo did almost everything by himself.”</p><p class="calibre2">And then, they sat at the table and started eating. That night’s dinner was hamburger steak.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi told Theo that she liked meat, so Theo cooked his best meat dish.</p><p class="calibre2">She thought her reward had ended with lunch, but Theo felt differently. He knew Fiore was coming as well, so he made sure to make a wonderful meal.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi and Fiore grabbed their knives and forks at the same time and started eating, and Theo looked on nervously.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-how is it? It’s my first time entertaining guests, so I’m not too confident…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo lowered his head and peeked up, which struck a chord with Helvi and Fiore as they chewed.</p><p class="calibre2">After swallowing, both smiled.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s marvelous Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it’s very good.”</p><p class="calibre2">“R-really!? Great…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The uncertainty in Theo’s face was replaced with a cute expression, and Fiore had to do her best not to squirm in her seat.</p><p class="calibre2">(Ahh… Theo is too cute…)</p><p class="calibre2">She felt she would not be able to hold back a grin if she continued to watch that smiling face, so she averted her eyes and focused on her meal.</p><p class="calibre2">That smile was already playing back inside of her head.</p><p class="calibre2">(Good job holding that in, me! That smile just isn’t fair, but…)</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore peeked Helvi’s way.</p><p class="calibre2">As far as Fiore could see, she was just eating as though nothing happened. She did not budge at all after seeing that smile.</p><p class="calibre2">(Could it be that Theo’s smile has no effect on her? That would be a shame…)</p><p class="calibre2">She felt it would be a waste if Theo’s smile did not trigger any maternal instincts or anything. As she thought about this, she grabbed her cup and…</p><p class="calibre2">(That is not it. Of course it’s cute.)</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn!?”</p><p class="calibre2">She suddenly heard these words echoing inside of her head, and almost spit out her drink.</p><p class="calibre2">“A-are you alright Fiore? Did you choke?”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-no, I’m fine.”</p><p class="calibre2">She breathed a sigh of relief after managing to not spit out her drink, and looked over to the person whose voice she heard.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What is it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-nothing…”</p><p class="calibre2">She looked at her like it was strange, so Fiore said nothing.</p><p class="calibre2">(Was it just my imagination?)</p><p class="calibre2">(It was not.)</p><p class="calibre2">“!?”</p><p class="calibre2">She really did hear a voice, and was startled again. She looked over to Helvi again, but it did not seem as though she was speaking.</p><p class="calibre2">(I am communicating directly to your head.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Y-you can do that…?)</p><p class="calibre2">(Yes. I am the strongest…)</p><p class="calibre2">(I don’t really get it…)</p><p class="calibre2">They were having a conversation without speaking. Theo only smiled, as from his point of view they were doing nothing more than eating.</p><p class="calibre2">(Look at that face. How can you even describe it without saying it is cute?)</p><p class="calibre2">(I-I agree… Can you really say that so plainly?)</p><p class="calibre2">(What about you? Were you not just saying he was too cute?)</p><p class="calibre2">(I didn’t say it! I just thought about it!)</p><p class="calibre2">Theo could not even imagine that such a conversation was taking place.</p><p class="calibre2">They continued eating without talking through their mouths too much.</p><p class="calibre2">Afterwards, they put away the tableware. Helvi tried to help wash the dishes again, but…</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, Helvi. There’s desert, so eat it if you want.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Desert?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. You said you like sweet things right?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I tried making pudding. There’s enough for you too Fiore.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, really? Thank you Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo made pudding with a cup about the size of his palm, and placed it in front of Helvi and Fiore.</p><p class="calibre2">“You can eat while I wash the dishes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What about you Theo? Don’t you have one?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, I do but…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Then leave the dishes for later and come eat with us. If not, it will only be half as good.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…! Yes, thank you!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufuh. No, thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore smiled as she looked at Helvi and Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">(I guess I really can’t beat a long-time fiance… I’m glad you get to marry a good person, Theo.)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi did not hear this thought.</p></div>
