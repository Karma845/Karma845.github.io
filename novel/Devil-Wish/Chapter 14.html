<h3>Chapter 14 &ndash; Taking out the Trash</h3>

<p class="calibre2">There were sixteen men gathered outside of Theo’s home.</p><p class="calibre2">They were registered in the mercenary guild, and there were about five parties present with whom Theo worked previously They were called by two members of the party that was in the guild earlier that day, and thought it was presumptuous of Theo to suddenly bring along a fiancee.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo had worked with seven parties until that point, and all but one were present.</p><p class="calibre2">The reason was obvious, Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hey, that’s a really nice woman isn’t it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’ve never seen one like her.”</p><p class="calibre2">They whispered to each other.</p><p class="calibre2">Such beauty was unseen in that world, and it was no wonder woman-starved men would become obsessed with her.</p><p class="calibre2">They knew that woman was with Theo, who they thought was lower than them.</p><p class="calibre2">They were irritated, and then chuckled. Such a fine woman being with someone like Theo was unforgivable, so they would just have to take her from him.</p><p class="calibre2">That was why the sixteen men gathered.</p><p class="calibre2">“Your party’s leader, what was his name…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Carl.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, Carl. Isn’t he coming?”</p><p class="calibre2">“He’s injured, so he’s sitting this one out.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, poor guy, being hurt in a night as good as this.”</p><p class="calibre2">Carl’s fellow party member lied.</p><p class="calibre2">Carl really was hurt, but that was not the reason why he did not go.</p><p class="calibre2">Carl was afraid of the woman that hurt him, the woman they were targeting. His right arm was bandaged, and he vehemently rejected his comrade’s proposal to get revenge.</p><p class="calibre2">“No way… That woman’s not human…! This time she’d kill me…!”</p><p class="calibre2">They tried to force him to come, but he would not budge.</p><p class="calibre2">His fellow party members decided to leave him behind, and called other parties for a nightly assault.</p><p class="calibre2">They did not tell anyone else about this, as there was a very good chance this would severely damage their party’s reputation, and settled on only telling about the injury.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hey, when are we attacking!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I can’t wait any more!”</p><p class="calibre2">Said the men with bloodshot eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore the receptionist was also in Theo’s house. She was not as enticing as Theo’s fiancee, but was still a good woman, and if they attacked now, they could have both.</p><p class="calibre2">The men were unable to contain themselves thinking about this.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes… Let’s go already!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s make it so whoever kills that Theo gets to have his woman!”</p><p class="calibre2">Their hearts raced thinking about the banquet that awaited them, but said banquet was about to change.</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re too noisy, trash. I will close those stinking mouths.”</p><p class="calibre2">Suddenly, a woman’s voice echoed. The men all turned in its direction, and saw the very same beautiful woman they were targeting, Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">They did not know when she got there behind them, but grinned after seeing her,</p><p class="calibre2">They did not even need to go inside, she came to meet them. They saw this as a perfect chance.</p><p class="calibre2">“I do not have time for this, let us change location quickly.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi snapped her fingers, and for a second, the men felt as though they were floating, and found themselves in a wide area.</p><p class="calibre2">It was too dark to see very well, but the walls seemed like bare rock.</p><p class="calibre2">“This used to be the Chimera’s nest.”</p><p class="calibre2">The men were confused.</p><p class="calibre2">“C-chimera’s nest!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You brought us near that monster!?”</p><p class="calibre2">They said, but one man was thinking calmly, and screamed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Calm down you people! The Chimera’s supposed to be dead!”</p><p class="calibre2">They started calming down after hearing these words.</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, I heard it was put down today.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Good, what if that thing really was here…”</p><p class="calibre2">The men breathed a sigh of relief, but Helvi said something that riled them up even more.</p><p class="calibre2">“I defeated the Chimera.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah…?”</p><p class="calibre2">The sixteen men were dumbfounded.</p><p class="calibre2">The woman in front of them killed that legendary monster? Who would believe that?</p><p class="calibre2">“It matters little if you believe me or not, you will die just the same.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi stretched her right hand and, just as she did when she killed the Chimera, waved it lightly.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh…”</p><p class="calibre2">Someone said that. Perhaps all did, perhaps it was the one that survived.</p><p class="calibre2">Fifteen out of sixteen heads were sent flying. The last thing they saw before dying was the world spinning around them.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, eh…?</p><p class="calibre2">The one man left standing could do nothing more than just that, stand in the middle of the sea of blood that suddenly appeared around him.</p><p class="calibre2">He could not believe what he was seeing, but he could certainly smell the immense amount of blood from his now dead partners.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now, as for the reason why you are still alive…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said the woman that created the sight in front of him.</p><p class="calibre2">“You were the one that said the one that killed Theo could have his woman.”</p><p class="calibre2">The last man standing was the one that said it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Kill Theo. Even I did not know just how much these words would displease me.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi glared at the man.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, ahh…!”</p><p class="calibre2">This glare had more bloodlust behind it than the bloodlust that terrified Carl.</p><p class="calibre2">“I will show you a different kind of hell than the rest.”</p><p class="calibre2">The man cried, as he envied the ones who died when their heads were chopped.</p></div>
