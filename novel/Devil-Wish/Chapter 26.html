<h3>Chapter 26: Worried x Brother</h3>


<p><em>“How could you!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Aah, calm down, Haruka!”</em></p>



<p><em>Haruka was yelling at me, eyebrows raised like I’ve never seen before. I tried to grab her hand to make her listen to me, but she shook me off.</em></p>



<p><em>“I can’t! Why didn’t you tell me that you have been living with Shigure all these years as siblings…! Why did you hide it from me?”</em></p>



<p><em>“T-that’s because I thought you’d be shocked if you learned that your sister, who looks exactly like you, was living with your boyfriend… It was for that reason, I swear.”</em></p>



<p><em>“That was not the only reason, Onii-san.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Shigure?”</em></p>



<p><em>Out of nowhere, I heard Shigure’s voice and found her hugging me from behind. When did she get here…?</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s not for you, Nee-san. In fact, he enjoyed flirting with me behind your back. Isn’t that right, Onii-san?”</em></p>



<p><em>Why is she saying this in front of Haruka?</em></p>



<p><em>“Hiromichi-kun, you kissed Shigure…?”</em></p>



<p><em>“N-not exactly, that was a misunderstanding!”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s not a misunderstanding. How many times have you kissed me, Onii-san? I suppose we’ve kissed more times than you kissed Nee-san. Please hug me like you always do and say, you’re the only one, I love you, I love you more than Haruka.’”</em></p>



<p><em>I’ve never said anything like that! I want to complain, but I need to explain to Haruka first.</em></p>



<p><em>“Haruka, listen to me! I did kiss Shigure, but I was only thinking about you at the time! The love I said was for you, Haruka…”</em></p>



<p><em>“I knew you kissed her…!”</em></p>



<p><em>“…”</em></p>



<p><em>“You’re the worst Hiromichi-kun…! I was even thinking about marrying you…! And yet, you were having an affair behind my back! Of all people, with my sister! That’s disgusting! I’m sorry but I hate you!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Wait Haruka, Haruka!”</em></p>



<p>“Haa…!”</p>



<p>All of a sudden, the view in front of me turns to a familiar roof. What? So it was a dream… Thank goodness… I was afraid of what I would do if it was real.</p>



<p>“I love my cute sister, Shigure… I love her even more than my girlfriend…”</p>



<p>But why was I hearing Shigure’s voice if it’s not a dream? As I moved my head in wonder, my eyes met Shigure’s as she crouched down close to me.</p>



<p>“… Oi! Shigure.”</p>



<p>“Oh, my. Good morning Onii-san, you’re awake.”</p>



<p>“What the h*ll are you doing?”</p>



<p>“Hmm. I tried to wake you up but you kept calling Nee-san in your sleep, which kind of pissed me off, so I tried some sleep aid. How effective was it?”</p>



<p>“Don’t ever do that again, I beg you.”</p>



<p>Shigure grinned, showing her canine teeth.</p>



<p>Beauty is really a blessing because even with such a nasty expression, she has a lovely charm. If it had been Takeshi, I would have probably beat him to death.</p>



<p>“Hurry up and put away the futon. Breakfast is ready.”</p>



<p>The room was filled with the aroma of delicious food. Even though it was summer vacation, Shigure’s daily routine was the same. She wakes up early in the morning and prepares breakfast at the same time as when we usually go to school. It’s impressive. Still, it’s summer. It wouldn’t hurt to be a little more lazy. I had a bad dream so I think I should stay like this for a while.</p>



<p>“I just need four more hours of sleep…”</p>



<p>“That’s a lot of time for ‘just’.”</p>



<p>“You know, it’s summer. There’s nothing to it… “</p>



<p>“Once you get used to slacking, you will find it hard to get back on track. Onii-san, don’t you have a part-time job this morning? Come on, get up quickly.”</p>



<p>Mmm, she’s right. Being late is not good. I reluctantly got up, stomping on the futon. I then folded it and went to the sink to wash my face. When I came back, the table was set in the middle of the room, ready for breakfast. Today’s menu was… French toast.</p>



<p>“”ITADAKIMASU””</p>



<p>As usual, the two of us were having breakfast together. The French toast was so soft that you could easily cut it into pieces with a fork, and it melted in your mouth like cream. The tender sweetness of the French Toast is a perfect match for morning hunger.</p>



<p>“Fufu…”</p>



<p>Shigure, who had been observing my face, narrowed her eyes in happiness. I feel a little embarrassed by her gentle gaze. I reached for my drink as if to cover it up. I thought it was milk tea, but it had a faint aroma of spices mixed in it.</p>



<p>“It’s iced chai. I saw it on the Internet and it looked delicious, so I made it.”</p>



<p>“Yes, it’s delicious. I prefer this compared to regular milk tea.”</p>



<p>“Onii-san, you love having sweets in the morning, don’t you?”</p>



<p>“Huh? Really? Well, I never really thought about it, but I guess I do when I wake up. When I was alone, I would sometimes eat chocolate chip buns or melon pan slices for breakfast. You do keep a close eye on me, Shigure…”</p>



<p>“It’s been about three months since we have been eating breakfast like this. I know your likes and dislikes.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Three months. So we’ve been living together like this for three months now. It seems like a very short time, probably because we had so much fun. Ever since Shigure’s came here, my everyday life has become far more enjoyable than when I was alone.</p>



<p>She was the exact same age as me, and the twin of my girlfriend. Living together with a girl like that was unthinkable for me three months ago when I was a bit of a sucker for girls, but now it’s become the norm. I feel at ease knowing that it’s okay to treat her a little carelessly. I suppose this is what you call trust.</p>



<p>All of this is because Shigure took me by the hand gently. Of course, that mean smile is a part of her personality, but the reason she dared to show it to me was to make it easy for me to express myself, since I get nervous around the opposite sex. If Shigure, who never showed such a bad face at school, had treated me like an honor student like she does at school, a clumsy guy like me would have never been able to get to know her.</p>



<p>Besides cooking for me daily, Shigure has always been kind to me. She cares deeply for me. But why did she say those things…</p>



<p><em>“If Onii-san refuses me in the future, I will reveal everything that happened until today to Nee-san.”</em></p>



<p>I never expected her to make such an egoistic threat. I wonder how serious she is. Is she going to blackmail me every now and then and force me to kiss like she did yesterday? No, but there is no point in kissing someone like that if you don’t feel for them. That’s what Shigure herself said when she kissed me for the first time…</p>



<p>“…… Fufu. Now that I think about it, it’s kind of amusing.”</p>



<p>“Eh? What?”</p>



<p>“My sister, who is your girlfriend, has never got to see your cute face when you wake up, and she doesn’t even know what you like to eat, while I, her little sister, have seen and know everything about you. Isn’t it hard to tell which one of us is the lover?”</p>



<p>“Wu!”</p>



<p>“Well, if you want, I can teach her. She should at least know your taste in food. *Giggles.”</p>



<p>This girl, stop messing around with that knife pointed at me and put it down. What are you even trying to say? That my life right now is in your hands? I understand now. You never intended to stop after yesterday’s attack. You’re truly threatening me.</p>



<p>This situation is pretty bad. As Haruka’s boyfriend, I have to do these things for her, but kissing behind her back is out of the question. There is no way I can nurture “true love” in such a situation. I have to stop her somehow.</p>



<p>“Um, you know what, Shigure?”</p>



<p>“What is it, Onii-san?”</p>



<p>“I understand that I said a lot of hurtful things to you out of self-interest, and it’s no wonder that you’re mad at me. However… Haruka told me over the phone that she wanted to marry me.”</p>



<p>“So what?”</p>



<p>“If such a shy girl like Haruka said that to me… I would like to meet her expectations, trying not to make her sad. So can you please keep my disappointments a secret?”</p>



<p>“I’ve no problems. As long as you treat me well, I’ll keep it to myself.”</p>



<p>“… Then, I’ll take good care of you as a sister.”</p>



<p>“You do understand that’s not what I meant, right?”</p>



<p>Suu, Shigure glared at me. It was the same look that had threatened me yesterday, and I was sure I just stepped on a landmine.</p>



<p>“Onii-san, please say that you love me.”</p>



<p>“Why this all of a sudden…?”</p>



<p>“Hmm? I just felt like it. Isn’t this what you always wanted to hear from the person you love? Plus, Onii-san, it seems like you still don’t understand your position.”</p>



<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>



<p>“Eh? That’s not good! Then I should stop listening to your request and perhaps I should just tell my sister everything.”</p>



<p>Grinning, Shigure rested her chin with her hand on the table and said to me as if to scare me.</p>



<p>“Oh, come on, there’s no point in doing this. I can say whatever I want.”</p>



<p>“If you can say whatever you want, why not? Now say it…♪”</p>



<p>Her tone was light, as if she was joking, but her eyes were not smiling. I was afraid to go against the current Shigure. I had no choice but to obey.</p>



<p>“…………………. I, love.”</p>



<p>“Don’t avert your gaze. Look at me properly. And try again.”</p>



<p>I thought I could resist, but I had to do a retake.</p>



<p>“AiRabuYou.”</p>



<p>“Mou— I won’t forgive you if you mess around again.”</p>



<p>I can’t run away from this no matter what. But I can’t just say it. I know it’s just words, but I’m being forced to say it. And even if I say something like that, it won’t change my resolution to reconnect with Haruka. </p>



<p>This will not make Shigure’s wish come true. Though it would only bring us a little closer. Of course. I’m being forced to say something I don’t want to say. I hate this kind of thing. That’s right. I hate this wicked Shigure.</p>



<p>Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate. I hate her────  </p>



<p>“Uu…”</p>



<p>I don’t know why my heart is pounding so hard just by making eye contact with Shigure when I’m swearing so much in my mind to hate her. Stop it you idiot…!</p>



<p>My heart jumped as I peeked into her beautiful round eyes. She was sitting right in front of me, waiting. Not just my face, but my entire body started to heat up from the core.</p>



<p>I’m afraid that if I say “I love her” in this situation, I won’t be sure if it’s true or not.  However, I don’t feel like I can get away with not saying it. My escape route was cut off by the intimidation. </p>



<p>The next moment, I made up my mind and opened my mouth.</p>



<p>“… I… Love… yo~u…”</p>



<p>Quickly averting my eyes, I finally managed to squeeze out a few words, but it was a bit of a mess. I was so embarrassed and nervous over such meaningless words, it was pathetic of me. Sure enough, seeing me in such an unsightly state, she smirked wickedly.</p>



<p>“Fufufu. You sure can say whatever you want, but your face is beet red. I wonder why?”</p>



<p>“Ugh, shut up.”</p>



<p>“But this feeling of straining to say something is not so bad. I think I might get addicted to it. Well, the fact that you looked away at the end is a point deduction. However, I’ll forgive you for being so cute.”</p>



<p>“Guu…”</p>



<p>“Your shift today will be until evening. I made you lunch, so please take it with you.”</p>



<p>After saying that, Shigure left her seat. As I watched her leave, I let out a huge sigh… I’m like this because Shigure is Haruka’s twin sister. It is normal to be nervous when you see the same face as your girlfriend in front of you. It’s not that I was excited to see Shigure. While making such excuses to myself, I pondered on what I should do from now on.</p>



<p>I knew I had to stop this blackmailing. But how can I get her to stop the threats? There was no point in asking her sincerely.  </p>



<p>So what if I do the opposite and force her?… This is a bit dangerous. There’s no telling how she’ll react. And looking at the fact that I can no longer maintain my relationship with Haruka without Shigure’s cooperation, it would be unwise to risk provoking her.</p>



<p>If I could at least get something that would give me the same kind of leverage, I might be able to negotiate.</p>



<p>“Kyaaaaaaaaa!!!”</p>



<p>That’s when it happened.</p>



<p>A scream from the kitchen that I had never heard before.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>The moment I heard her scream, I threw away my scheming thoughts and got up quickly. But as a result, I bumped my knee on the table. Gritting my teeth, I headed for the kitchen.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Onii-san! O-over there, that!”</p>



<p>Shigure was crouching on the floor looking pale like I’ve never seen before, as if she had lost her usual peace of mind.</p>



<p>It was unusual for her to be this shaken up. I looked at where she was pointing with her trembling fingers.</p>



<p>There was nothing special to be found except a tiny spider clinging to the wall of the kitchen.</p>



<p>“… Ah, it’s just a spider.”</p>



<p>I lost my tension with a sigh of relief. </p>



<p>I thought something terrible had happened when I heard her scream. What a commotion. </p>



<p>As I was thinking, Shigure protested.</p>



<p>“What do you mean by just a spider? It’s even bigger than the palm of my hand, you know!”</p>



<p>“Of course, it’s a Huntsman Spider. They come out sometimes in the summer. We have a shabby wooden apartment with lots of cracks and openings, so cockroaches, bees and even civets can get in.</p>



<p>“Unbelievable…”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that’s true.</p>



<p>But this spider is the SSR for miserable people like us.</p>



<p>“I’m glad you came this year. Thank God.”</p>



<p>“W-what are you happy about? I don’t get it…!”</p>



<p>“Have you not heard of it, ‘honour-student’? These spiders kill cockroaches, you know. Huntsmen are of the army generals class that can get rid of all the cockroaches in the house.”</p>



<p>“I, I’d rather live with cockroaches than live with this monster!”</p>



<p>… Well, it does look like a monster.</p>



<p>After all, they eat cockroaches, so they need to be huge.</p>



<p>For those who fear spiders, their appearance is probably even harder to accept than cockroaches.</p>



<p>And judging from her reaction, Shigure seems to be that kind of person.</p>



<p>“O, Onii-san, hurry up and get rid of it!”</p>



<p>“Eh~ what a waste. General is a model insect because he eats pests and doesn’t spin webs.”</p>



<p>“No, it’s visually menacing! The appearance alone is enough to tip me over the edge! Just get rid of it!”</p>



<p>Perhaps because of Shigure’s yelling,</p>



<p>Before I could do anything, General ran out of the window with great speed.</p>



<p>After witnessing that, Shigure let out a huge sigh.</p>



<p>“Haaaah~”</p>



<p>“I’m surprised to learn that Shigure is not good with spiders.”</p>



<p>“… I’m fine with normal sized spiders. But there is a limit. Hah, all the fun I had from teasing you has been ruined.”</p>



<p>“There’s no doubt that it’s a divine retribution.”</p>



<p>Because you enjoy blackmailing people.</p>



<p>Though I felt a little sorry for her when I saw her cowering on the floor.</p>



<p>I couldn’t believe how distraught she was, since she usually doesn’t show her weak side.</p>



<p>… Interesting.</p>



<p>Maybe if I use this to my advantage, I can stop her from intimidating me? </p>



<p>Chapter 26.4</p>



<p>I thought of an idea to take advantage of Shigure’s phobia of spiders.</p>



<p>That day, while working, I spent a lot of time thinking about it, but it turned out to be a waste of time.</p>



<p>Since I couldn’t have control over the spider itself, how am I supposed to use it as an intimidation?</p>



<p>Although there are probably some shops that sell spiders, it would be too blatant to buy one just to harass her, and more importantly, I don’t want to have a spider as a pet.</p>



<p>I don’t like spiders much anyway.</p>



<p>Ultimately, at the end of the day, when I turned off the lights in my room and lay down on my futon, I was back to square one.</p>



<p>“… Time for bed.”</p>



<p>As I put my head on the pillow, weighted down by too many thoughts.</p>



<p>Just then…</p>



<p>The sliding door that separates my room and Shigure’s quietly opened. </p>



<p>“Um, Onii-san, are you awake?”</p>



<p>“Hmm? What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>I turned my head to see Shigure standing behind the door in her sleepwear, holding a pillow.</p>



<p>It was unusual for her to be awake at this hour, since she usually wakes up earlier than me to prepare breakfast.</p>



<p>When I asked her what was going on, she said,</p>



<p>“Um, is it okay if I sleep in your room tonight?”</p>



<p>“Haaaah?”</p>



<p>I shouldn’t have done that. It was late at night yet I raised my voice so loudly. The neighbors might complain tomorrow, but it can’t be helped because what she said was so absurd.</p>



<p>… Oh, no way, is this another threat?</p>



<p>She made me say I love her, kissed me, and now she wants me to sleep with her! At this point, I can already imagine what the next threat would be. </p>



<p>I won’t let you do so.</p>



<p>Shigure, are you really ignoring my and Haruka’s feelings to get me to the point where I can no longer return? </p>



<p>No, you shouldn’t do that! No matter how much you tease, there’s a limit…</p>



<p>“I can’t calm down thinking that the spider might come in again.”</p>



<p>T-that’s it?</p>



<p>I was surprised, wondering why I became that unreasonable.</p>



<p>Since our rooms were actually separated by a single sliding door, it’s fine if she wants to sleep… but wait?</p>



<p>Wait a minute. Could this be a chance for me?</p>



<p>I discarded that idea a while ago thinking it was useless, but it might be a chance for me to use the spider as a bargaining chip to make her stop intimidating me.</p>



<p>If she wanted to stay here, I could threaten her back, telling her to stop blackmailing.</p>



<p>It might work, for sure.</p>



<p>I could tell just by looking at her face that of an abandoned puppy hugging her pillow.</p>



<p>If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I probably wouldn’t have imagined that the usual fearless Shigure could make that sort of face.</p>



<p>She truly hates spiders.</p>



<p>It was a look that really didn’t suit her. If I were to push now, there’s a high chance she would listen to me. This is a rare opportunity. Yes, it is. And yet… Oh, whatever.</p>



<p>“… I’m not sharing my futon. Get your own.”</p>



<p>“Thank you very much~”</p>



<p>With a smile that was brighter than the moon, Shigure rushed back to get her futon.</p>



<p>Seeing her off, I let out a sigh of relief.</p>



<p><em>You really are a half-wit, man</em>.</p>



<p>While I was feeling sorry for myself for wasting this chance, Shigure dragged her futon right next to mine and laid down on it.</p>



<p>“Ha~ There are many problems with the roof, such as the numerous insects, leaks, air drafts, and the roof heats up so much that it gets very hot during the day. The second floor of this wooden apartment is really fragile.”</p>



<p>“But the house you used to live in also had a balance boiler, right? Then wasn’t it the same?”</p>



<p>“We lived in a UR reinforced concrete building. And we were on the fifth floor, so we didn’t get many bugs or anything.”</p>



<p>“I see. Well, Huntsman Spiders don’t approach humans on their own, so the two of us should be fine.”</p>



<p>“I wonder. I did not hear it from the spider itself, so I don’t think this information is reliable. Onii-san, have you ever gone on seaside trips during junior high?”</p>



<p>“Oh, yes. I did.”</p>



<p>We spent the night at a hotel near the sea and did some canoeing.</p>



<p>“So once, we had to stay at a rundown inn in the countryside, and the next morning, when I woke up, I found a big spider just like earlier, crawling on my face.”</p>



<p>“Uwa…”</p>



<p>“I can still feel its leg hair on my cheek. That is why I can’t stand spiders.”</p>



<p>“Well, you sure had a scary experience, it’s no wonder you hate spiders. But you can’t sleep if you keep thinking about them. Forget it and go to sleep, I’ll be here with you.”</p>



<p>To be honest, sleeping side by side with a girl, even if it’s a different futon, is making me nervous. But since it’s Shigure, I’m sure it won’t be hard to sleep.</p>



<p>Every night we sleep through a cheap sliding door that doesn’t even have a lock on it. Once I close my eyes, I won’t even be able to see her face.</p>



<p>With that thought in mind, I cut my gaze away from Shigure and turned over.</p>



<p>But then, Shigure poked my back with her finger.</p>



<p>“What is it…? Is there something wrong?”</p>



<p>“Umm, can I have your hand?”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>What do you want to do with my hand?</p>



<p>Tilting over to face Shigure, I took my right hand out of the covers.</p>



<p>She then grabbed it, intertwining her fingers with mine.</p>



<p>“W-what is it…?”</p>



<p>“… Nothing. I’m thinking Nee-san would’ve never imagined that Onii-san would be holding hands with her sister in the same room so late at night.”</p>



<p>“You, there you go again… I won’t sleep with you if you keep doing that.”</p>



<p>“Won’t you be happy then? I mean, you can use it as a bargaining chip.”</p>



<p>“…!”</p>



<p>She stared into my eyes with a questioning gaze.</p>



<p>Apparently, she knew that I had been thinking of trying to stop her threats.</p>



<p>She sure got sharp eyes.</p>



<p>Well… yeah, I had a feeling that if I do this, I’ll regret it for sure.</p>



<p>But I can’t do it, because she was really… scared.</p>



<p>I wondered what would happen if I threatened her and she went back?</p>



<p>Then probably like this morning, she would have been cowering in fear like this morning.</p>



<p>I somehow, someway, really didn’t like that.</p>



<p>It’s true that Shigure is threatening me. But it’s me who took advantage of her for my own reasons and that I wanted her to hide it from Haruka.</p>



<p>I think that she, who is threatening me, also has a bad personality, but the root of all that evil is me.</p>



<p>If I imposed my selfishness on my sister by taking advantage of her fear, I wouldn’t be able to look at her again, that would be beyond shameful. So that’s why,</p>



<p>“I couldn’t think of anything. It’s a regret.”</p>



<p>“… If you say something like that.”</p>



<p>And then, Chuu~ I felt a moist touch on my fingers.</p>



<p>It was Shigure’s lips.</p>



<p>While I was in shock, Shigure smirked and said,</p>



<p>“You know, the reason why I like you, the reason why I kissed you, the reason why I threatened you, everything is because of you, Onii-san! It’s not my fault that you never let me hate you. And you’re already aware of it.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>She then looked at me as if staring at a precious treasure.</p>



<p>Her moist eyes weren’t trying to hide her love for me.</p>



<p>I turned my face away and closed my eyes forcefully.</p>



<p>I felt like I was about to drown in the overflowing love from her eyes.</p>



<p>While I was thinking, I soon heard her soft breathing.</p>



<p>I peeked over to the side and saw that she was asleep holding my hand.</p>



<p>Her face was so peaceful. I don’t know what kind of expression she usually sleeps with, but it doesn’t look like she’s having a nightmare.</p>



<p>That’s good. If not, it’s not worth sleeping in the same room.</p>



<p>—Anyway.</p>



<p>“… Such a small hand.”</p>



<p>I gently squeezed her hand back and thought about what Shigure said, about how it was my fault for not letting her hate me.</p>



<p>I wondered if I could settle a lot of things if I shook this small hand off roughly.</p>



<p>But… With these hands, she makes delicious meals for me every day.</p>



<p>With these hands, she held me when I was in so much pain that I couldn’t help myself anymore.</p>



<p>There’s no way I could treat it roughly.</p>



<p>But…</p>



<p>If I really love Haruka, do I have to do that someday?</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Shigure was right, Haruka, who is probably asleep right now, wouldn’t even dream of a situation like this.</p>



<p>I couldn’t believe that Shigure’s sleeping here holding my hand.</p>



<p>With each passing night, there were more secrets that I couldn’t tell Haruka.</p>



<p>The best time to tell Haruka about us would be next year when our parents come home.</p>



<p>But how many of our secrets would have piled up by then?</p>



<p>While I let out a sigh full of anxiety, I heard the sound of a LINE notification on my phone, which was charging at my bedside.</p>



<p>Who could it be at this hour?</p>



<p>I reached my free hand out to the phone and looked at the notification.</p>



<p>Haruka: “Um, Hiromichi-kun. Can I come to your house this weekend?”</p>



<p>The next moment, I forgot how to breathe.</p>
