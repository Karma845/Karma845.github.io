<h3>Chapter 26 &ndash; How Strong?</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Xena, whose arm was grabbed, had her eyes wide open.</p><p class="calibre2">She was somewhat surprised about being stopped from patting Theo’s head, but what surprised her the most was the strength she could feel from the person gripping her arm.</p><p class="calibre2">Xena was very strong for this world, and not many would have her hardened body beat when it came to pure strength. She would absolutely not lose to just any man.</p><p class="calibre2">However…</p><p class="calibre2">(I can’t move…)</p><p class="calibre2">She tried to shake her off, but could not move her arm at all, even though she was really trying.</p><p class="calibre2">She was only using the strength of her arm, and would perhaps be able to move if she used her entire body, but she did not want cute little Theo, who she saw as a little brother, to see her in that state.</p><p class="calibre2">“Xena Ademollo and Celia Solicia. I have heard about you from Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said the person holding her arm.</p><p class="calibre2">“I am Helvi, Theo Asper’s wife.”</p><p class="calibre2">And then, she said something that surprised Xena even more.</p><p class="calibre2">“Wife! Eh? Theo, did you get married!?”</p><p class="calibre2">She looked at Theo, who nodded as his face turned red.</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes…”</p><p class="calibre2">When she saw Theo, she smiled, as she thought nothing had changed from when they said goodbye.</p><p class="calibre2">It really was unbelievable. Theo married such a beautiful and strong woman.</p><p class="calibre2">Celia, who stood behind Xena, was also surprised.</p><p class="calibre2">“Really? Are you sure you’re not being tricked or something?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I’m not!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you sure? You always were too nice…”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia peeked at Helvi, who introduced herself as his wife, over-reacted when Xena tried to pat his head, and was still holding his arm.</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems fine, as far as I can tell.”</p><p class="calibre2">It was a sign that she treasured Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum, can you let go of me already?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, yes. Next time you want to pat Theo’s head, make sure to ask for my permission.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi let go of Xena, who started rubbing her arm.</p><p class="calibre2">There was no mark or bruise, even though she was being held strongly enough to not be able to move.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi… You’re strong aren’t you?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, the strongest.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi responded, feeling as though it was obvious.</p><p class="calibre2">“How strong?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Unmatched in this world.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh… That’s a bold claim.”</p><p class="calibre2">“And true.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena thought Helvi was probably stronger than her, but not as strong as she claimed.</p><p class="calibre2">“What’s that all of a sudden Xena?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asked Celia, who did not know how strong Helvi was.</p><p class="calibre2">“Celia, Helvi is really strong. I was trying as hard as I could to move my arm, but it wouldn’t budge!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…! So she’s stronger than you? That’s incredible!”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia was somewhat interested after hearing this.</p><p class="calibre2">She knew very well how strong her partner was, and could not imagine someone matching her strength.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi, are you a bare-handed warrior like Xena?”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia reached this conclusion after seeing that Helvi did not carry any weapons.</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I am not a fan of fighting with my fists. I would say I am better at using magic.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You use magic too?”</p><p class="calibre2">She thought it was absurd that someone stronger than Xena could also use magic, but Helvi did not seem to be lying.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hey hey, let’s fight!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Ah?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was surprised by Xena’s sudden proposal.</p><p class="calibre2">“I like fighting, and so does Celia! Let’s fight!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…What is this woman saying?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi asked Celia, while pointing at her partner.</p><p class="calibre2">Celia had her hand on her forehead, and sighed while saying ‘ not again…’.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry, she’s crazy about fighting.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t pretend you don’t like it too Celia.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Not like you. But I have to say, I am curious about Helvi’s strength.”</p><p class="calibre2">How strong was Helvi, who had no weapons or even a staff?”</p><p class="calibre2">They thought she could not possibly be stronger than both of them.</p><p class="calibre2">“Xena, Celia, I think you should stop…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo nervously.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s alright Theo, we won’t hurt your wife.”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, that’s not it… I really don’t think you too can beat Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Both were surprised by Theo’s response.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, you know how strong we are don’t you? We’ve become even stronger since the last time we met too.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, way stronger. Are you saying we’ll still lose?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum… Sorry, but I think it will be very hard…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo, hesitatingly. Could it be true? Was he just biased towards his wife?</p><p class="calibre2">There was only one way to find out.</p><p class="calibre2">“All the more reason why I can’t back down.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s right, now I’m kind of excited.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia both grinned.</p><p class="calibre2">They really enjoyed fighting, and were especially excited because it had been a while since they fought a strong opponent.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-what are you going to do Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmph, I do not mind, I am curious as well. How strong are this world’s strong people?”</p><p class="calibre2">She was summoned into this world, and wanted to see how strong were these two, who were considered to be among the strongest humans.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, can I pat Theo’s head before we fight?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asked Xena, as though she just suddenly remembered.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Ah, yes, alright.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Thank you! Hn, it’s been a while! You’re so cute!”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo as he had his head pat by Xena.</p><p class="calibre2">“Can I hug him too?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I cannot allow that.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Che, stingy. What about you Celia?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I want his head on my lap.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I cannot allow that either.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I figured.”</p><p class="calibre2">If hugging was not allowed, laying his head on her lap most likely would not be either.</p><p class="calibre2">“I know, you can do it if you beat me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ou, well said! Now we really can’t lose!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, now we have a real reason to win.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia were more motivated.</p><p class="calibre2">(I’ve never had him lay his head on my lap… We will try that once we’re done here and return home. Can I really have him do that…)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi started thinking, with a serious expression on her face.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-wait, am I a prize?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said a confused Theo, who was not participating in the battle, but suddenly found himself being a prize for victory.</p></div>
