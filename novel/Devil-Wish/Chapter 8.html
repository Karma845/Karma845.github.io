<h1>Vol 3 Chapter 8: Let's Go Stretch Our Legs!</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just because I became a sophomore in high school it didn’t mean that anything special had happened. But I had to be worthy of being next to Kaede-san, I would have to use my own capabilities to make her happy. For that, unlike last year, I’ve been focusing on my studies right from the beginning. Although balancing club activities was tough, I would do it myself to the best I could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Time flies by so fast, doesn’t it? I can’t believe I am in the second grade, and it’s almost summer vacation.” Kaede-san said with a somewhat happy expression as she spread strawberry jam on the freshly baked bread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been less than a month since the school uniforms changed to summer uniforms. The fact that you didn’t have to wear ribbons anymore along with the second button of the blouse being open, made one see the other’s décolleté line and it was not good for my mental health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The cherry blossoms were in bloom just a few days ago. The final exam has ended, and summer vacation will soon begin.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The final exam was the most difficult part of the semester. If one could get through the final examinations without any problems, they would have a month-and-a-half-long vacation ahead of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Students may play, engage in club activities, or study with an eye toward the future. It was truly a privileged period only students were allowed to enjoy. By the way, I would be doing club activities and working part-time as I did during spring break. It was the only time I could save money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… I’m fine with a part-time job, but I want to fully enjoy summer with Yuya-kun.” Dejectedly, Kaede-san dropped her shoulders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also wanted to enjoy summer together in the mountains, but it won’t start without something that precedes it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t strain your shoulders, Yuya-kun. Look, couples share their wallets, right? So don’t worry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to say that we’re not married yet, also I don’t want to be carried by Kaede-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s what makes Yuya-kun wonderful, but the beach, the pool, the summer festival, and the fireworks display! I want to do everything I can! So please don’t whine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t just nod in understanding like this. Or rather, it seemed that the exam had disappeared from Kaede-san’s head. But even so, I am afraid that I would definitely be number one in my grade on this test. Was it a summer festival? Last year we went with Nikaido and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m the one who can’t get my head around it. I think Yuuya-kun is really working hard. Didn’t you get fifth place in your grade during May’s midterm exam?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the final exam of the first year, I couldn’t achieve my goal of being in the top 5 in my grade, but I was able to get revenge in the first exam of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was attracted to Yuya-kun, who never gives up, never gets complacent, and keeps trying. Even if you don’t get results right away, Yuya-kun will be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kaede-san… Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufufu. Besides, I promised to give you a reward if you get 5th or higher in your grade on this exam, so I really want you to achieve it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede-san smiled as she said that and she seemed like a goddess of compassion, but I knew that deep inside her eyes was a bewitching little devil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can understand what Yuya-kun is thinking in his head. Honestly, you want to see me in a school swimsuit again, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not right!? What have you been saying since morning!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? It’s written on your face, isn’t it? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">~Kaede-san’s precious school swimsuit, I wish I had taken a picture of it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was such a fool. I’m supposed to possess a serious and sincere face, right? But certainly, just a little bit, I thought it would have been better if I had taken a photo of Kaede-san in her school swimsuit. I wanted to make it the standby screen of my smartphone for summer vacation only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah…Yuya-kun, you’ve been doing well since this morning. If you’re going to go that far, I’ll go change my clothes now, shall I? Oh, is it possible to wear a school swimsuit under the school uniform? It’s going to be hot today, so I think it will be comfortable!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that’s indeed a no-no, Kaede-san. I thought for a moment that it might be okay, but absolutely not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why not? Isn’t it fine, as long as you’re wearing a swimsuit underneath, there should be no problem unless I get soaked in the rain?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was nothing but problems, Kaede-san. Rather, why were you making a blank face?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kaede-san, even though I look like this, I have a strong desire to possess you. That’s why I don’t want other men to see Kaede-san wearing a school swimsuit. Because that is a reward only for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How small of a person I was! But wasn’t it perfectly natural to want to monopolize the sight that the person you love shows only to you? A wedding dress would be a perfect example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s really going on today? Are you planning our wedding in your head, Yuya-kun? If so, would you like to go find a wedding venue during the summer vacation? Where would you like to spend your honeymoon?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede-san asked while leaning forward. She should be careful, she would get jam on her uniform. Also, we’re not looking for a wedding venue yet. I wanted to go on a normal trip with Kaede-san before the honeymoon. Come to think of it, we’re also going on a school trip this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, we will have a wedding ceremony, but let’s prepare the expenses ourselves. Kaede-san’s parents are likely to say they will help us, but let’s not be dependent on them as much as possible. I know it’s a lot of work, but I think it will be the best ceremony.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt embarrassed after saying this and sipped my coffee to cover it up. I didn’t put any sugar or milk in it, but the sweetness spread in my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, Yuya-kun! I don’t think it’s good to say romantic things so plainly. But Yuya-kun is right. It’s our ceremony, so let’s do the best we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede, smiling as if she was illuminated by the morning sun shining through the window, was as beautiful as a goddess in a painting.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, everyone! What shall we play today? Bowling? Karaoke? Or the arcade? We have lots of time, so we can do everything!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since we only had a morning exam, a very excited Otsuki-san suggested we go somewhere to play. Now we were discussing the location with Yui-chan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to listen to Yuya-kun sing! Please perform some of Mr. X-Na Japan’s classic songs!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede-san wanted karaoke? Did she want to hear me sing that much? I was not that good at it. I’d rather listen to your singing voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anywhere other than bowling? I’m not good at bowling.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only thing Nikaido, who was the ace of the basketball club and had good athletic skills, was not good at would be bowling. When she was a freshman, she went bowling before heading to karaoke at the launch of the school festival, but her score was terrible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, hmm! Otsuki-senpai, I think we should go all the way! Wouldn’t an hour and a half of bowling, two hours of karaoke, and an hour at the arcade be perfect!” Yui-chan made the greedy claim of wanting it all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That might be the most ideal, but I think we’d run out of time, and just when things would start to get exciting, we’d have to head to the next one. This way, we wouldn’t be able to enjoy ourselves after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Shinji and I would like to go bowling. We wanted to exercise our bodies that have been dulled by studying for exams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm? We wouldn’t come to a decision this way… Or rather, doesn’t it sound like a math problem?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where does Akiho-san want to go?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, me!? Of course, I’m the same as Yui-chan, and I’ll do everything as long as time allows! I’m prepared to play with oars for the summer!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unexpectedly, Otsuki-san was a Yui-chan fan. She was going to play all night long, wasn’t she? Where in the world did she get the strength to do that with her tiny body? She was too fuel-efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, speaking of summer, it’s almost vacation. Do you have any plans to go anywhere?” Kaede-san suddenly broached the topic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, I didn’t have any such plans. Nikaido says she would go back to the countryside for the Obon holiday, focusing on those activities. Shinji and Otsuki were of similar opinions too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TN: Obon or just Bon is a fusion of the ancient Japanese belief in ancestral spirits and a Japanese Buddhist custom to honor the spirits of one’s ancestors.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to enjoy the sea of Okinawa with Kaede-neesan. Speaking of which, what are you going to do this year?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh no! Yui-chan, you revealed everything! It was supposed to be a great surprise, but it’s ruined!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede-san was flustered by Yu-chan’s casual remark. The two of them were family members, so they must have traveled together every summer vacation. I mean, she said it was a surprise, but what was she planning?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oops. Then I’ll take it easy and make a proposal. Why don’t we all go to Okinawa this summer?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Okinawa─────────!?” The four of us, excluding Yui-chan, exclaimed beautifully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikaido asked me why I was surprised, but I guess it couldn’t be helped since it was the first time I’d heard it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since it’s only a one-time high school summer vacation trip, I wondered if it would be a good idea for everyone to spread their wings. Oh, don’t worry, we’ll prepare airfare and a place to stay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede-san told me that her family had a vacation home in Okinawa. She had already obtained permission from her parents to use it. She was indeed the daughter of the President of one of Japan’s world-class companies. She was too generous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be that this was what she meant when she said she would reward me after the exam? If so, I would probably refuse. As I told her this morning, it would be a shame for me to piggyback on her for everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I’ve prepared a separate reward for Yuya-kun, so please look forward to it. Your trip to Okinawa will be a memorable experience for everyone!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kaede-chan… you’re the person…! I love you!” Otsuki-san, who was deeply moved, hugged Kaede-san while screaming. Kaede-san was like a goddess as she gently caressed Ootsuki-san like she was soothing a crying child. What a beautiful scene! I should take a picture of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okinawa huh? I’ve never been there so I’m looking forward to it. Ah, Okinawa is all about marine sports, right? I have to go buy a swimsuit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unusually, Nikaido was also excited. Since Meiwadai High School did not have a swimming pool, the lamentations of many male students, including Mogi, have become an annual summer tradition. Many of them would especially like to see Kaede-san, Otsuki-san, and Nikaido, who were known as the three most beautiful girls in Meiwadai, in their swimsuits. What would they say if they knew about the trip?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If Nikaido-senpai says so, I might as well buy it too. I bought it last year, but I want a new one because it’s been a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do have one, but the size may not fit, so I think I’ll buy it on this occasion. What about Kaede-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m thinking of buying a new one too. The one I bought with Yui-chan last year is too tight…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Kaede-neesan’s breasts are still growing? Or rather, Otsuki-senpai’s are still big…? Isn’t the world too unfair?” Yui-chan, who heard Otsuki-san and Kaede-san grumble, placed her hands on her chest and muttered while shaking her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that the two unconscious remarks had stepped on a landmine inside her. Nikaido gently patted such a junior on the shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! In that case, how about we go shopping for swimsuits together?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kaede-chan, you’re a genius! Let’s go now, let’s do it!” Otsuki-san immediately responded to Kaede-san’s statement, and Shinji and I raised our voices like crushed frogs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was easy to imagine what would happen next. These two were definitely going to start a fashion show and toy with me and Shinji’s naivety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, what is it, Yuya-kun? What about that face? Anyway, I want to wear a swimsuit that Yuya-kun likes. That’s why you’ll come with me, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shin-kun. I have the same opinion as Kaede-chan. I would really like to hear your opinion on what kind of swimsuit Shin-kun likes!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two predators approaching. Shinji and I, the pitiful herbivorous animals that live in the savannah, had no choice but to nod obediently in approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go together, Nikaido-senpai! I’m begging you, please take me with you! If I had to choose a swimsuit with those two, I’d die in a society with a disparity in chest size!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even I don’t like it!? Going shopping for swimsuits with two couples!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice idea, Yui-chan! The four of us will bewitch Shin-kun and Yoshizumi! Let’s do it!” Otsuki-san, who tried to refuse Yui-chan’s invitation, forcibly grabbed Nikaido’s arm and left the bag in the classroom as it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exactly. Akiho is having a blast. I’ll take Akiho’s bag, so Yuya should bring Nikaido’s bag.” Leaving those words behind, Shinji ran after them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, we should be going soon, Kaede-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of swimsuit should I choose to captivate Yuya-kun… In this match, I absolutely cannot lose!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede-san’s eyes were burning with a fighting spirit. Who was she going to fight? Also, I wouldn’t say it out loud, but if I had to say one thing, no matter what Kaede-san wears as her swimsuit, I would be captivated, so there was no need to worry.</span></p>
