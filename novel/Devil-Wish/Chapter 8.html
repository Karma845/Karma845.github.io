<h3>Chapter 8 &ndash; Chimera</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Long ago, monsters ruled over this world, as the frail beings called humans were no match for these strong beings, and lost their place to live.</p><p class="calibre2">Humans had intelligence, but that did not make for a very strong weapon back in those days. That was, until a human used said intelligence to summon a devil.</p><p class="calibre2">“Kill strong monsters, and turn this world into a place where humans can live.”</p><p class="calibre2">He wished, and after a few days, almost all monsters had been exterminated.</p><p class="calibre2">Monsters feared even by gods, that were said to have come from hell itself, disappeared from this world, exterminated by one devil.</p><p class="calibre2">There were beings that escaped because they were ‘weak’, and Theo and Helvi (the one that carried out that extermination long ago) were facing one, the Chimera.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi… The Chimera is sleeping, let’s run…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo whispered with tears forming in his eyes, as he watched the Chimera as it laid in front of them.</p><p class="calibre2">It was big even while lying down, probably surpassing ten meters in length, but Helvi showed no fear.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hm. It sure is unpleasant to see it still sleeping even when I stand before it. I will awake it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Please don’t…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo, but it was too late.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi suddenly released her bloodlust towards the Chimera.</p><p class="calibre2">“…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">The Chimera was awakened by Helvi’s bloodlust, and jumped back.</p><p class="calibre2">The cave shook as its body hit the ceiling.</p><p class="calibre2">“Wawah…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Oops, are you alright?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi stopped Theo from falling, as the cave shaking made him lose his balance.</p><p class="calibre2">Usually, the man would hold the woman and stop her from falling, but in this case it was the opposite.</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum, you can let me go…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi had her arm around Theo’s waist, and was pulling him closer. She looked down at Theo, and focused her eyes on his lips.</p><p class="calibre2">[It was postponed earlier, so now is the time…! No, there would be no elegance if it were done in a place such as this. It has to be somewhere with a better mood…]</p><p class="calibre2">There was a conflict inside of her heart, and she held back her desire.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, be careful.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Thank you very much.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi let go of him, and they watched as the Chimera ran.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Helvi, what did you do?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I released my bloodlust, but I also set up barriers so it does not escape.”</p><p class="calibre2">The Chimera tried to escape by going deeper inside the cave, but was stopped by an invisible wall.</p><p class="calibre2">In its frenzy to escape, it tried to hit the ceiling and the walls with its body, but they were also blocked by barriers.</p><p class="calibre2">There was no noise when it hit the walls and ceiling, so it looked as though it was doing some sort of strange dance.</p><p class="calibre2">“That legendary monster is so desperate to escape… Helvi, you really are strong.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I believe I said so earlier, but I am the strongest. It is time to end this.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi stretched out her right hand, and lightly waved it sideways.</p><p class="calibre2">In an instant, the Chimera’s head was separated from its body, but there was no blood, as Helvi made it so it would not come out.</p><p class="calibre2">The reason was simple, it would stink.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-wow… You defeated the Chimera so easily…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s eyes were wide open, as he looked at the corpse of the Chimera, whose head alone was bigger than him.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi giggled.</p><p class="calibre2">“I can do this much before breakfast. Now that I think about it, I have not eaten since coming into this world.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ah, I can cook.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see, your cooking does sound delicious. Can you do it once we get back?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was excited. Not only was it his first time cooking for someone other than the elderly couple, but it was for his wife.</p><p class="calibre2">“What do you like?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s see… Meat, and also sweet things.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, I like sweet things too! Then I should prepare a dessert!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Desert…”</p><p class="calibre2">(Theo for desert.. No, stop it.)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was going to say something, but stopped.</p><p class="calibre2">“We should be going back soon. Should we take the entire corpse with us?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I don’t know how to rip materials off an incredible monster like this, so we should take it back as is.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright, that will be simple.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo seemed concerned, but the Chimera’s head and body simply started levitating.</p><p class="calibre2">To show how easy it was to carry it, Helvi moved her finger around, and the Chimera’s corpse followed its movements in the air.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ohh, amazing!”</p><p class="calibre2">“See, this is simple. Let us go back.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes!”</p><p class="calibre2">And then, they left the cave behind and returned to town.</p></div>
