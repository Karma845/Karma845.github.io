<h3>Chapter 41 &ndash; Disquieting?</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“Y-you two really are strong…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo looked on with wonder, as Xena and Celia easily dispatched two opponents that were by far out of his league.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well yes, we are the strongest in Nemophila… Or at least we were.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena as she looked at Helvi, who took that title away from them.</p><p class="calibre2">“Something like that is no problem.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Celia as she brushed up her long, golden colored hair with her hands.</p><p class="calibre2">“It was really cool!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufu. Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo Theo, what about me?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You were cool too! Blocking an attack like that like it’s nothing and then punching that giant monster away…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hehe. I guess…!”</p><p class="calibre2">For them, they were weak opponents, but being complimented like this did not feel bad at all, and both had big smiles on their faces.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo used to compliment them like this back when they traveled together, and it was a good source of motivation.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s wife however, felt not too pleased as she watched the other two being complimented.</p><p class="calibre2">She did not stop it, but had a pouting look on her face as she watched from the back.</p><p class="calibre2">(I don’t remember being complimented so much when I killed the Chimera…)</p><p class="calibre2">It was true, Theo did not compliment her so much, but that had more to do with the Chimera being well beyond what one might have seen as a reasonable opponent.</p><p class="calibre2">Seeing such a monster being killed in the blink of an eye was too shocking for Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">When they went out to collect medicinal herbs, they only encountered weak enemies, and nothing that would make Theo that excited.</p><p class="calibre2">Defeating Xena and Celia would be worth complimenting, but there was no time for that, because Helvi immediately kissed Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">(Damn it. I would have defeated them myself if I knew he would compliment me so much. I could have evaporated their heads with a simple flick of the forehead.)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi decided to take on the next relatively strong opponent they came across.</p><p class="calibre2">They continued walking through the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a little dark, since the trees blocked the sun, but everyone except Theo had good night vision.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo tripped and almost fell, but was caught by Helvi. After this, they held hands as they walked.</p><p class="calibre2">He was a little embarrassed about being treated like a child, but Helvi’s slightly bad mood from before was now completely gone.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now that I think about it, we didn’t plan things out before coming here. Which mountain top are we going to first?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena asked Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was the only one who could tell the medicinal herbs apart, so it was up to him where to go first.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes… Let’s go to the one on the right first.”</p><p class="calibre2">According to Fiore, that was where bandits were staying.</p><p class="calibre2">“Understood! We’ll beat up those bandits and take those herbs!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I want to deal with them quickly.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said the two women as they turned right and continued walking, with Theo and Helvi following them while holding hands.</p><p class="calibre2">They continued walking for a few hours, and it was starting to get dark, so they decided to start making preparations to camp.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi brought their things down from the sky, and they started making their camping preparations while Theo prepared their meal.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’re making good progress. We should reach our destination by noon tomorrow.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo with a relieved tone as he cooked.</p><p class="calibre2">They did not encounter many more monsters after their first encounter with the Black Bears. Only a few weak monsters crossed their path, which was disappointing for Helvi, who wanted Theo to compliment her.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s going well… But maybe a little too well.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. This sort of thing happens from time to time… And it always ends with something bad happening later to balance things out.”</p><p class="calibre2">“R-really?”</p><p class="calibre2">The two women who had experienced hundreds of travels and adventures said something ominous, which sent a chill down Theo’s spine.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo felt something warm on the hand holding his kitchen knife, and saw Helvi’s hand holding his.</p><p class="calibre2">“It will be fine. I’m here.”</p><p class="calibre2">She said with a kind smile, making Theo’s cheeks feel a little hot.</p><p class="calibre2">He thought he was used to holding hands by now, but felt a little more embarrassed than before.</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo turned away in embarrassment and continued cooking.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi felt satisfied as she watched this, let go of his hand, and helped him.</p><p class="calibre2">The other two pouted as they made camping preparations behind them.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, I’m here too, so don’t worry.”</p><p class="calibre2">“The same goes for me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, I’m counting on you!”</p><p class="calibre2">The four continued their respective preparations.</p>
