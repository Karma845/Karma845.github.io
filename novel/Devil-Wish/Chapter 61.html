<h3>Chapter 61 &ndash; Their Secret</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“I apologize for taking so long.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi said after she transported herself back to where the others were.</p><p class="calibre2">For some reason, Xena and Celia sat on the ground, seemingly exhausted.</p><p class="calibre2">“What happened while I was gone?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi wondered if they were attacked, but saw no signs of a battle, or enemies.</p><p class="calibre2">“Did that absurdly powerful magic energy… Come from you?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Celia, while gasping for air.</p><p class="calibre2">She was covered in sweat, and more tired than she had been the entire journey.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi thought back and remembered the magic energy she released when she undid the seal on her memories.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, that was me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I knew it. That was incredible, no, that doesn’t do it justice.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’ve never felt such a big clump of magic energy. I wasn’t even attacked, but I felt like I was on the receiving end of an incredible attack.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi realized that she had concentrated enough magic energy to destroy the entire planet, and it was powerful enough for its effects to be felt even a thousand kilometers away.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you alright Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes. I don’t know why but yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see, that’s good.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was most likely resistant to Helvi’s magic energy due to their contract.</p><p class="calibre2">“You really only care about Theo don’t you… How about caring about us too?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I apologize. If you are that exhausted… I wonder what happened in Nemophila.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m sure some people passed out…”</p><p class="calibre2">They passed by the town later to confirm, and found that fewer people than they expected were affected. The townspeople that could not feel magic energy were actually less affected.</p><p class="calibre2">A few dozens of people in the adventurer guild fainted, but it was nothing serious.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh well, it will be fine regardless.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What do you mean fine? There’s a chance that everyone in town passed out, you know? Can you really call that fine?”</p><p class="calibre2">“As expected from Helvi. Or as exelvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t shorten it like that, that’s lame.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hahaha…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s dry laughter echoed through the quiet forest.</p><p class="calibre2">Afterwards, they made their way to the peak of the western mountain.</p><p class="calibre2">One good thing to come out of the whole ordeal was that when Theo was kidnapped, he was taken to a place close to their destination.</p><p class="calibre2">They had no reason to return to the eastern mountain, and reached their goal in about one hour.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo and Celia got to work looking for the supposedly rare medicinal herbs, and…</p><p class="calibre2">“…Fast and steady, uh Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“W-why do you look upset Celia?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was done in a few minutes.</p><p class="calibre2">“Did we help with completing this quest at all?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Let me think. Helvi defeated the boss of the group of bandits, we didn’t do anything when Theo was kidnapped…”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-no, you defeated monsters on the way, and all the bandits aside from their boss!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi could’ve done that on her own…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes… And Theo found the herbs quickly by himself.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Why are you feeling so down!?”</p><p class="calibre2">The main reason was, like they said, they could do nothing when Theo was kidnapped.</p><p class="calibre2">They were disappointed in themselves because they thought of Theo like a little brother, but failed to protect him even in the short period when Helvi was fighting.</p><p class="calibre2">“It was nothing for me, but that enemy was more than you could handle.”</p><p class="calibre2">He was on the weak side for a demon, but still a powerful opponent for humans.</p><p class="calibre2">Perhaps Xena and Celia could have beaten him in a fair fight, but not if he attacked while they were distracted, like he did when he took Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">“Lately I had been feeling like there weren’t many opponents that could fight us on equal terms. Who would’ve thought coming back to Nemophila would make me feel so weak?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Helvi is obviously really strong, but that boss was pretty strong too. And he got even stronger with that creepy arm.”</p><p class="calibre2">Even Helvi admitted that they were very powerful in that world, and the boss was also strong enough to oppose them.</p><p class="calibre2">However, the man that kidnapped Theo was a devil, not a human being. He was not of that world.</p><p class="calibre2">If strength was a pyramid, Xena and Celia would be on top, and Helvi would not even have a place in it.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi thought there was no reason to feel down, but in order for her to explain why, she would have to reveal herself as a devil.</p><p class="calibre2">She figured there would be no harm in telling them, or Fiore the receptionist for that matter, but surprisingly enough, Theo was not so sure.</p><p class="calibre2">(They wouldn’t be so sad if I told them Helvi is a devil… But when I think about it being our secret, and me being the only one to see that beautiful form… Uu… What should I do…)</p><p class="calibre2">A happy conflict, to Helvi at least, was happening within Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">(I-I’ll tell them eventually. Yes, but for now I want it to be our secret… If Helvi herself reveals it it’s fine but… Sorry Xena and Celia…)</p><p class="calibre2">If Theo did not want to say it, obviously Helvi would not say it either.</p><p class="calibre2">(Ah, I’m so happy Theo. That tiny possessiveness is so adorable…)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi smiled a little as she looked into his mind.</p><p class="calibre2">In the end, it motivated Xena and Celia to train more and become even stronger, so the result was not bad at all.</p><p class="calibre2"></p>
