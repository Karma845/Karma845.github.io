<h3>Chapter 36 &ndash; Horses</h3>

<p class="calibre2">The four left the guild and the town… Or at least that was the plan.</p><p class="calibre2">“We forgot the horses.”</p><p class="calibre2">It took a full day to reach the twin mountains, but that was on horseback. On foot it would take twice as long.</p><p class="calibre2">Usually they would rent a carriage to carry their luggage, but they had no need for a wagon this time, as their luggage was being kept high in the sky.</p><p class="calibre2">The four headed towards a stable that rented horses, and upon getting there, they found that there were exactly four available.</p><p class="calibre2">“Lucky! I was worried we wouldn’t find any.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Walking all the way over there would be tiresome, even empty-handed.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena and Celia, before the employee spoke to them with an apologetic tone.</p><p class="calibre2">“Three of the horses have been trained, but one is still a little wild… It hasn’t been ridden by anyone yet, so I recommend two of you ride on the same horse instead.”</p><p class="calibre2">This sparked Helvi’s interest.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. If that is the case, myself and Theo have no choice but to ride together.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was feeling a little vexed ever since the topic of horses had been brought up.</p><p class="calibre2">If they all rode their own horses, Helvi would be apart from Theo while they traveled, which meant no fooling around.</p><p class="calibre2">She was happy to hear they would have to share a horse, but Xena and Celia on the other hand…</p><p class="calibre2">“No, it’s fine, isn’t it”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it’s fine.”</p><p class="calibre2">They assumed the wild horse would not be an issue.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? No, hum, it is our horse, so we would like to refrain from having it being broken-in roughly…”</p><p class="calibre2">Looking at them, the employee misunderstood, and assumed they would be forcing the horse to do as they said.</p><p class="calibre2">“”C’mon, just show us. It will be alright.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, ahh…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena with a very nice smile, making the employee torn between being relieved and scared.</p><p class="calibre2">The employee took them to the back of the store, where the horses were grazing.</p><p class="calibre2">There were four in total, but one clearly stood out. Three were light brown, and one was black.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s this one… Uwah!”</p><p class="calibre2">The employee approached the black horse, and it responded with threatening noises and making it seem as though it was about to charge.</p><p class="calibre2">The panicked employee quickly stepped back and turned to Xena.</p><p class="calibre2">“As you can see, its training isn’t complete so it’s a little wild…”</p><p class="calibre2">“You weren’t kidding. It’s time to show off.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena, who instead of stepping forward, unexpectedly turned back and smiled.</p><p class="calibre2">“Go for it Theo!”</p><p class="calibre2">She called out to Theo, who was behind Helvi, and placed her left hand on her waist and pointed to the horse with her right, as if to say ‘charge!’.</p><p class="calibre2">“What are you doing…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo with a strained smile as he advanced towards the black horse, not seeming surprised that Xena called out to him.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you sure Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes Helvi, I think I’ll be fine.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi looked on with concern, as Theo advanced towards the horse that was still behaving in a threatening manner.</p><p class="calibre2">“A-are you sure? That horse is quite powerful, and can easily break bones with a kick…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo will be fine.”</p><p class="calibre2">As Xena and the employee talked, Theo approached the horse, and Helvi got ready to rip it apart if it showed any signs that it would hurt Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was now as close as the employee was. If the horse decided to charge, Theo would not be able to dodge it.</p><p class="calibre2">And then…</p><p class="calibre2">“There there. You’re a cute horse. Very good.”</p><p class="calibre2">The horse instantly turned docile towards Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">The threatening sounds stopped, and the head that was kept down the entire time was now rubbing against Theo, who gently caressed it.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-incredible… The horse was completely unmanageable, but in less than a second he…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The employee was shocked, but this was a sight that Xena and Celia were very used to seeing.</p><p class="calibre2">“Animals love Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. In a way, it’s like magic.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hahaha, you know I can’t use magic.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo as he laughed and continued to pet the horse.</p><p class="calibre2">Seeing this, Helvi snuck a sigh of relief.</p><p class="calibre2">She knew animals liked Theo, but not how much, and she would still be concerned even if she did.</p><p class="calibre2">(Still… A mere horse being pet so much by Theo…! Even I have not had my hair caressed like that…!)</p><p class="calibre2">Obviously, it was not enough for her to feel bloodlust, but she realized she would not be able to ride with Theo, now that it was obvious he could ride the black horse.</p><p class="calibre2">Seeing Theo continuing to caress the horse, Helvi thought to herself she would never be on good terms with it.</p><p class="calibre2"></p>
