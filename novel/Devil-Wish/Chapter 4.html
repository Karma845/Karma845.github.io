<h3>Chapter 4 &ndash; Name</h3>

<p class="calibre2">A few minutes after Theo’s successful proposal.“…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…”</p><p class="calibre2">Both were sitting silently on Theo’s bed.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo proposed without thinking, but he was a little stunned, and wondered if it was all just a dream.</p><p class="calibre2">His proposal was accepted, but Theo had no experience in matters related to love, and was completely clueless about what to do next, so he sat quietly.</p><p class="calibre2">Both peeked at each other occasionally, and their eyes met quite a few times. When they did, they would quickly turn their heads, as their faces immediately became red.</p><p class="calibre2">[This beautiful and cute person… My wife… I-is this really not a dream?]</p><p class="calibre2">[This boy… My husband…! Dammit, why am I so shaken by this boy? I feel no special power inside him or anything…!]</p><p class="calibre2">Eyes meet, heads turn…</p><p class="calibre2">This sequence repeated a few times, until Theo finally broke the silence.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum… Devil lady, what is your name…?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">There was a height difference between Theo and Helvi. Usually the boy would be taller than the girl, but in this case, it was the opposite.</p><p class="calibre2">This did not change when they were sitting, and Theo had to look up to look Helvi in the eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi had to look down to look at him, but the concerned tone he had when he asked the question struck a cord inside her.</p><p class="calibre2">[Dammit. Something is not right…!]</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi said her name, while trying not to let her feelings show.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi. Ah, my name is…”</p><p class="calibre2">He tried calling her by her name and, thinking he did not say his own, tried to introduce himself.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo Asper correct?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? Yes but… Did I say my name?”</p><p class="calibre2">“When we formed the contract, I obtained a lot of information about you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You did!? That’s amazing!”</p><p class="calibre2">Most would find this unnerving, but Theo reacted to this ability with pure admiration.</p><p class="calibre2">While looking at Theo’s face, Helvi thought about the information she received.</p><p class="calibre2">He was raised by an elderly couple, but they passed away, so Theo lived in that house alone.</p><p class="calibre2">Since he was alone and had no power or magic energy, he worked as a mercenary, but he was taken advantage of by people that looked down on him.</p><p class="calibre2">There was more, but this last thing irritated her.</p><p class="calibre2">[I know the names and faces of all the people that disrespected him. Just try insulting him again, and that will be an indirect insult to his wife and… Wife…!?]</p><p class="calibre2">One word was enough to dissipate the anger building inside her.</p><p class="calibre2">“What’s wrong Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo asked, thinking it was strange that her face suddenly became red.</p><p class="calibre2">“N-nothing. Don’t you usually go somewhere at this hour?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh… Ah! You’re right, I have to go to the guild!”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi let out a sigh of relief as she successfully changed the subject.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo did not notice this as he jumped up from the bed and hurriedly began making his preparations.</p><p class="calibre2">“You even know that Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I am a devil.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Awesome!”</p><p class="calibre2">“A-ah, thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo finished preparing, and made his way to the door.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-hum, do you want to come with me?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I would be bored sitting here by myself.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But you’ll draw a lot of attention, walking around town looking like that…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was a devil, and she had horns on her head and wings on her back.</p><p class="calibre2">There was no one in town, or perhaps the entire world, that looked like her.</p><p class="calibre2">People may not have jumped to the conclusion that she was a devil, but they would most certainly find it odd.</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re right. I’ll put these away.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi casually, before she snapped her fingers, and her horns and wings vanished.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? You can do that?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m a devil, of course I can do this much.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I don’t know a lot about devils…”</p><p class="calibre2">In any case, Helvi could go outside with no problem.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s go then.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes! Ah, hum, Helvi…”</p><p class="calibre2">“What?”</p><p class="calibre2">Right before she stepped outside, Helvi stopped when she heard her name.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo looked up at Helvi, slightly embarrassed and with his face turning red.</p><p class="calibre2">This made Helvi’s heart race, but she listened.</p><p class="calibre2">“You didn’t… Call me by my name even once…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, ah, I see.”</p><p class="calibre2">She said she knew it, but she did not remember actually using it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Is it difficult to say? I want you to call me by my name too…”</p><p class="calibre2">She was looking at him while she was listening, but had no choice but to turn away.</p><p class="calibre2">[Dammit. In this short amount of time how many times…]</p><p class="calibre2">She peeked at Theo, who looked up at her with an uneasy expression.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…! A-again please!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo…! That’s enough!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes! Thank you very much!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s face suddenly became bright again, but Helvi could not see it, as she was trying not to let her embarrassed expression be seen.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s not waste any more time and go.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes!”</p><p class="calibre2">The two people that had just become husband and wife headed towards the guild.</p></div>
