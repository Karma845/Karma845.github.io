<h1>Vol 3 Chapter 7.5 SS: Yui-chan's Love Consultation Room</h1>

<p><strong>[TN: The translation is continued from chapter 123 onwards. We shall be following the Light Novel.]</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello, Miyamoto-san. I have a quick question… Can I ask you?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One morning. I was overcome with drowsiness and crawled to the classroom after Kaede-neesan and Yoshizumi-senpai showed me their sweet scene of them going to school together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it? Could it be some kind of love counseling thing?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We became good friends, perhaps because we were seated in the same row behind one another and were on the same basketball team. Yasaka-kun was the exact opposite of the fearless Yoshizumi, he was a soft and gentle boy. If I were to use an analogy, I would think of it as a lion and a kitten. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked him with a quirk of my mouth as if I was teasing him, but he prefaced his question with, “Well, something like that… Does Nikaido-senpai have someone he likes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yasaka-kun I’m too stunned to say anything.” I exaggeratedly shrugged my shoulders. Maybe, one might be able to tell right away about Nikaido-senpai’s crush just by looking at her, right? Even so, Yasaka-kun has not been with Nikaido-senpai as much as I have, so I didn’t know how he could infer this much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I kind of have a guess. Isn’t that person Yoshizumi-senpai from the second-year group that Miyamoto-san always hangs out with during lunch breaks? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t hear it directly, but I’m sure it’s true. Because Nikaido-senpai’s face looking at Yoshizumi-senpai looks exactly like Kaede-neesan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Yoshizumi-senpai occasionally came to the gym to look for me and Nikaido-senpai while we were practicing after school, she looked very happy. The prince of Meiwadai was said to be handsome and even more popular with girls than boys, but to me, she looked more like a maiden in love just like Kaede-neesan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ever since I called Nikaido-senpai to the gymnasium for practice after school, I thought that was the case, but… I guess so.” Saying that Yasaka-kun dropped his shoulders in disappointment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve been stingy since this morning. Don’t get discouraged by assuming stuff by yourself! Besides, love isn’t about winning or losing!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But… from what I’ve heard from the soccer club, isn’t Yoshizumi-senpai amazing? It’s hard to believe that he’s one year older than me, isn’t it?” Yasaka-kun said with a wry smile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaede-neesan and Nikaido-senpai have told me many times how great (and cool) Yoshizumi-senpai was, and when I actually saw him with my own eyes, I was really surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve been practicing alone every day since you were in the first grade, right? I can’t do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The last scene of the ball game tournament. To be honest, Yoshizumi-senpai at that time made my heart flutter. If I hadn’t gone out with Kaede-neesan, I wouldn’t have known he was so cool. I could have even started a fan club.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I were to say something like this in front of Kaede-neesan, she’d probably start screaming, “I won’t let anyone take Yuuya away from me!” I’m sure she would be going berserk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not in love with Yoshizumi-senpai, just to be clear. If I were to use an analogy, it would be like watching an idol on the other side of the TV. His specs seem a cheat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s good at soccer and has a super cute girlfriend like Ichiyo-senpai, so he’s the main character of a romantic comedy novel.” Saying that Yasaka-kun slumped at my desk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were going to fall down, could you at least do that at your desk? It was a bother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Exactly. I told you to start talking and not get depressed on your own, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because… I don’t know if I’ll even have a chance with such a difference. How can I win against Yoshizumi-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…For me, Yasaka-kun. I don’t think love is about winning or losing. Do your best to get the person you love to turn their eyes on you… Even if the result isn’t good, your hard work is precious. I think so, and there might be some chance for one to fall in love with Yasaka-kun who is making an effort, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoshizumi-senpai may not have had that kind of intention, but Kaede-neesan said that she was attracted to Yoshizumi-senpai because she felt his dedication and focus on staying on the ground and continuing to kick the ball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s why, Yasaka-kun. If you want Nikaido-senpai to look at you, you won’t be fighting Yoshizumi-senpai, but you yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was talking pompously, but the source of this story was my mom and dad’s story of getting acquainted. When I asked Mama why she fell in love with Papa, she told me with a big smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A fight with myself… I never thought I’d be told such a thing during a love consultation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In other words, what I want to say is that people who are dedicated and do their best are wonderful! Young man, do your best!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hit Yasaka-kun with all my strength on the shoulder to inject him with spirit. I ignored his whining words, “Take it easy!?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got ready to prepare for class. Was the first-period mathematics? Was it just right for drowsiness awakening?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, Miyamoto-san.” Yasaka-kun mumbled while digging through his bag to prepare for class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I… I’ll try my best. I can’t go as far as Yoshizumi-senpai, but I’ll try my best.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, that’s what I’m trying to do. Keep up the good work, Yasaka-kun. If it’s okay with me, I’ll be happy to consult you at any time. I’ll give you a special reward, a bottle of juice during your lunch break.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahaha… That’s reliable. Then, I’ll be quick. Please tell me Nikaido-senpai’s birthday! Along with her favorite things!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was something for you to figure out, Yasaka-kun.</span></p>
