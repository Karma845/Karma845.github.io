<h3>Chapter 7 &ndash; Quest</h3>

<p class="calibre2">There was a little incident shortly after they arrived in the guild, but it was resolved without issue.</p><p class="calibre2">Perhaps it wasn’t without issue for Carl and his friends, but it was for Theo and Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“What kind of quests are you looking for today Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asked Fiore from the receptionist counter.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are there any easy quests?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I don’t think we have any today.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Sorry.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, no, it’s not your fault!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo became flustered and started waving his hands, to which Fiore smiled.</p><p class="calibre2">She was surprised when he suddenly brought a fiancee, but it really was the same old Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">Speaking of which…</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi, have you two been friends for a long time!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“W-we have…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m sure Theo was really cute back then! Do you have any stories to tell from that time?”</p><p class="calibre2">Other receptionists joined the conversation.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore was not the only one to witness the attempted kiss from earlier. In fact, Theo was the only one present to not realize it was a failed attempt.</p><p class="calibre2">“Stories… A long time ago, Theo tried to hide that he wet the bed. so his grandfather was very upset, and his grandmother comforted him while he was crying.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Kya! So cute!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Wai! How do you know that!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Because I am me.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi received information the moment the contract was formed, including fragments of information about things that happened in Theo’s past, particularly things that left a deep impression on him.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hahaha, did that really happen Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Uuu… I really didn’t want anyone to know about that…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi continued telling stories about Theo’s past to the receptionists, but Theo was too embarrassed to listen, so he focused on his conversation with Fiore.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore wanted to join her colleagues and listen to Helvi, but felt sorry for Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">“What kind of quests are available today? If possible, I want to do one by myself…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm, there is one to collect medicinal herbs, but it’s in an area with a high probability of monsters appearing.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Sounds hard…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it’s too difficult for you to do on your own.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo would probably lose even if he faced more than two goblins, the weakest of all monsters.</p><p class="calibre2">There was almost no way Theo could complete a quest that involved him going out on his own to territory where monsters appeared.</p><p class="calibre2">That is, if he was on his own.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, did you forget about me?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi slipped away from the conversation with the other receptionists, and turned back to address Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">“You know I will not send you out by yourself to complete a quest don’t you?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, but I don’t want to put you in danger so…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said a worried Theo, who had no idea how powerful a devil like Helvi was.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi continued speaking, while trying not to show how much his kindness made her heart race.</p><p class="calibre2">“You do know that I am, to put it mildly, the strongest?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? To put it mildly?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi turned to Fiore.</p><p class="calibre2">“I assume it will not be an issue if I accompany him.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, yes, no issue at all, but the reward will be the same.”</p><p class="calibre2">Usually, someone could accept quests by themselves, so the reward would not change even if more people accepted a quest together. Those people would then divide the reward.</p><p class="calibre2">“Then there is no problem. It all goes into the same wallet after all.”</p><p class="calibre2">But a husband and wife had no need to divide a reward.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I see. So which quest will you accept?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Give us the hardest one that is close enough for us to travel there and return in the same day.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Eh?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo, Fiore, and all the receptionists around them felt like they had misheard Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“What, did you not hear me?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I did, but are you sure?”</p><p class="calibre2">“H-Helvi it’s too much! We can’t do that by ourselves!”</p><p class="calibre2">Both Fiore and Theo raised concerns over tackling such a difficult quest, but Helvi looked at them with a firm expression, as if to say ‘it’s no problem at all’.</p><p class="calibre2">“So, what is your most difficult quest?”</p><p class="calibre2">“H-hum, it’s this one but…”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore picked up the document and started reading it.</p><p class="calibre2">“The objective is to take down the [Chimera], a monster that lives in a cave in a forest east of here…”</p><p class="calibre2">The chimera was a monster with a lion head, goat body, and poisonous snake tail.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not very violent tempered, and it would usually not attack unless provoked, but it would certainly kill anyone that upset it.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a big problem for the townspeople when such a dangerous monster moved so close to town.</p><p class="calibre2">They were expecting the country to do something about it, but it could not be easily defeated, so they were leaving it be for the time being.</p><p class="calibre2">“No no no! You really can’t do this!”</p><p class="calibre2">It was among the strongest monsters. Theo shook his head and tried to stop Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“What… That puny thing is your most difficult quest?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh…? Puny…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi spoke as if she were disappointed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fine, we will be accepting this quest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I really don’t think you should…”</p><p class="calibre2">“No need to worry, let us be on our way.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi took Theo by the hand, and made her way towards the exit.</p><p class="calibre2">Obviously, their hands were intertwined again.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ehh!? W-we’re really going Helvi!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo still wasn’t used to holding hands, but he had bigger things on his mind. After all, they were virtually heading towards certain death.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo tried to pull Helvi back, who turned and smiled.</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry, I am the strongest.”</p></div>
