<h3>Chapter 39 &ndash; To the Mountain</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Eating such a large bird in its entirety would be impossible, so they took just enough meat for lunch, and the rest…</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you going to leave it up there in the sky again?”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s an amazing way to preserve it…”</p><p class="calibre2">Preserving raw meat at normal temperatures would be dangerous, but the temperature was lower high in the sky, so it would keep while they traveled.</p><p class="calibre2">And thus, after Theo finished cooking, the four sat down in the grassy plain to have lunch.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm! It’s so good!”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena with a smile after her first bite.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo prepared something so good, it would normally be unthinkable to have the luxury of eating it while traveling.</p><p class="calibre2">They were a little uneasy at first, as they did not know what monster the meat came from, but it was soft, and delicious with the right seasoning.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s really good.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It really is delicious, but that is to be expected from Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was always complimented for his cooking, but still became happy and a little embarrassed every time he heard it.</p><p class="calibre2">This time, he put a little extra effort into it, since he was traveling with his wife.</p><p class="calibre2">His bag was heavy because he packed it with many things such as seasonings to make sure he could make the best food possible, but Helvi made it so carrying it would be no trouble at all.</p><p class="calibre2">(Helvi keeps helping me… I have to do my best to help her too…!)</p><p class="calibre2">Thought Theo… As Helvi peeked into his thoughts.</p><p class="calibre2">(This really does not count as me helping you… But if you want to do something for me, learn more about sexuality as soon as possible.)</p><p class="calibre2">She wanted to have their first experience together on their first night, but gave up after realizing just how unprepared and ignorant Theo was when it came to this particular subject.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, she was happy that they got to experience their first kiss instead.</p><p class="calibre2">(Even if he lacks knowledge, I could just lead him but… Theo is a man, and he should have pride as a man when it comes to this sort of thing. But Theo is so cute, maybe I should lead…)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi started picturing Theo on top trying his best to lead, and herself on top leading as tears formed in the corners of his eyes…</p><p class="calibre2">(I cannot abandon either option…! The latter one feels right, but the former has a wonderful gap…!)</p><p class="calibre2">It was still noon, and they were just having lunch, but such delusions already filled Helvi’s mind.</p><p class="calibre2">After they were done eating, they started cleaning up. They would have to be thorough, or they would attract monsters with keen sense of smell.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh. Eating something this good while traveling really is great.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I can’t stay motivated unless I eat something good.”</p><p class="calibre2">The limited rest one got during harsh travels was very precious, and the best way to recover one’s strength was to eat while resting.</p><p class="calibre2">If a meal felt insipid, it was not uncommon for one to not be at their best and run into trouble because of it.</p><p class="calibre2">Because of this, Xena and Celia were very glad to have Theo around to cook a delicious meal for them.</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you. Did you like it too Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Hn? Ah, yes, of course. Delicious.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was still lost in her imagination, but Theo’s voice brought her back to reality.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m so jealous of Helvi, being able to eat Theo’s food every day.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well yes, I am his wife after all.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi with confidence, but Theo was a little embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre2">He could not help but smile every time Helvi referred to herself as his wife.</p><p class="calibre2">It was hard to resist.</p><p class="calibre2">…Helvi said it precisely because she wanted to see that face.</p><p class="calibre2">“We eat a lot of good things in the capital too, but for some reason I can’t get Theo’s food out of my mind.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Maybe it’s easier to leave a lasting memory when we eat while traveling like this.”</p><p class="calibre2">They had eaten in expensive and popular restaurants in the capital, but it was Theo’s food they ate while traveling that left a lasting impression.</p><p class="calibre2">They were very happy they got to eat it again that day. They had dinner in Theo and Helvi’s house the previous night, but they really enjoyed eating it while on the road.</p><p class="calibre2">“D-don’t compliment me so much… It’s embarrassing…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo put his hands on his face to cool down his red cheeks, which struck a chord with the three women watching.</p><p class="calibre2">“I think we should get going.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena, as the four looked at the mountain before them, and the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">“I think it would be hard to keep riding the horses from this point forward.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re right… But I think it’s dangerous to just leave them here.”</p><p class="calibre2">They could not see a single monster, but monsters would usually appear.</p><p class="calibre2">Leaving three horses out in the open in a grassy plain was no different than leaving food for them.</p><p class="calibre2">“I will set up a barrier, so there is no need to worry.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Barrier… Helvi, how’s your magic energy? Usually people wouldn’t be able to maintain luggage in the sky or create a barrier to protect the horses, and even if they did, it would only last for a few minutes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But I can, because I’m the strongest. It will not be particularly difficult either.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I’m starting to think you’re not even human.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi did not react to these words, but Theo flinched.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What’s wrong Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-nothing at all!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was never a good liar.</p><p class="calibre2">Thankfully, while Xena and Celia did think that there was something odd about the way Theo was acting, they did not realize why.</p><p class="calibre2">“The barrier is ready. We can proceed.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi as a way to change the subject. She entered the forest, and the others quickly followed her.</p>
