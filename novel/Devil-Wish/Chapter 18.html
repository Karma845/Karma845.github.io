<h3>Chapter 18 &ndash; How are Babies Made?</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“Eh, it’s not a kiss? Then how do people make babies?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi tried to tell him the truth as best she could, because their future married life depended on it, but…</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, hugging naked…!? N-no way, that’s so embarrassing…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Putting what? Where?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, no eeh!? W-what…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">As they talked, Theo became more embarrassed and his face redder.</p><p class="calibre2">Was he imagining it in his head? He avoided looking at Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, he may have been curious, because he kept peeking at her face and chest, and started fidgeting with embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh… ahh kuh…!”</p><p class="calibre2">And as she watched this, Helvi became more excited. Every time Theo looked at her chest, a sweet shivering thrill ran through her body.</p><p class="calibre2">She felt wrong about the idea of assaulting him at this point, so she held back, but…</p><p class="calibre2">This was bad. It was very bad.</p><p class="calibre2">They were both sitting on the sofa, but Theo was curled up in the corner, trying to hide his face.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was sitting on the other end, trying not to assault him, but she was looking at Theo with slightly bloodshot eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">If someone were to look at them now, they would probably think Helvi was a sexual predator instead of assuming they were married, but Theo was the one that proposed, and they were indeed a couple.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi took a deep breath, and tried to calm herself.</p><p class="calibre2">She closed her eyes so as not to look at Theo, and quickly regained her composure.</p><p class="calibre2">(The idea was to initiate our first night, and have our first experience but… Looking at Theo, that does not seem possible.)</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was so shaken about finding out how babies are made, that Helvi could not simply say ‘how about we try it’.”</p><p class="calibre2">(Perhaps I should be content about meeting this cuteness, no, this cute husband.)</p><p class="calibre2">Thinking back, they only met that morning.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi felt like her marriage to Theo just sort of happened in the flow of the moment, but she was glad she made that choice. If this was not the case, she would not be granting her ‘first time’ to a man she just met.</p><p class="calibre2">(There is no rush, we will be together for dozens of years. I can take it easy and wait for Theo to be ready.)</p><p class="calibre2">Upon reaching this conclusion, she opened her eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was still embarrassed, and covered his face with his hands.</p><p class="calibre2">“M-me and Helvi naked… Ah… Ahh… No way…”</p><p class="calibre2">(Cute.)</p><p class="calibre2">She could not actually see his face, but could somehow feel his heart-melting expression.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi thought it was not that big of a deal not being able to do anything for the next few days or weeks, as long as she could see him like this.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you alright Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes… I mean, no. I’m so embarrassed I can’t look at your face…!”</p><p class="calibre2">(Too cute.)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi started thinking about assaulting him then and there, but shook off those feelings. Her resolve could not break just mere seconds after making the decision to wait.</p><p class="calibre2">It was probably only Theo who could make a devil’s heart waver so much. Even confusion magic that polluted the spirit could not move Helvi’s spirit at all.</p><p class="calibre2">“We should go to sleep. You said you prepared the bath right? Is it alright if I go in first?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, go ahead.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Please make sure you can look at me again by the time I get out.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi as she exited the living room and made her way towards the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre2">A bath had no meaning to a devil like her, because her body did not get dirty. Even if blood splattered on her, she would easily clean it with magic.</p><p class="calibre2">But Helvi enjoyed baths, just like a regular girl.</p><p class="calibre2">A devil could change their clothes at will, so Helvi did not take her clothes off, and simply vanished them and became naked.</p><p class="calibre2">She tied her long pure white hair so as to not let it get wet as she entered the bath.</p><p class="calibre2">She did not take showers. She did not like them, and they had no meaning.</p><p class="calibre2">As she entered the bath, she checked its temperature.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Just right. And it is big enough to stretch my legs.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">Helvi could comfortably stretch her long legs.</p><p class="calibre2">That was all she wanted, and she did not wish for extravagance. In fact, she would not be able to relax in a huge bath.</p><p class="calibre2">She entered feet first, and submerged herself up to her neck.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh… Good. It seems myself and Theo like baths the same temperature.”</p><p class="calibre2">It was only a tiny sign of compatibility, but it made her happy nonetheless.</p><p class="calibre2">This size used to be enough for her, but now she wished for a little more.</p><p class="calibre2">(I want to enter with Theo one day, so perhaps we need a bigger one.)</p><p class="calibre2">She thought as she enjoyed her bath.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-helvi is naked right now, taking a bath… No, that’s obvious but… So to make babies, I have to see Helvi naked… Uu…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, Theo’s imagination was embarrassing him even further, and the heat still hadn’t withdrawn from his face.</p></div>
