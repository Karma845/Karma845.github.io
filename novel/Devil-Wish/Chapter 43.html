<h3>Chapter 43 &ndash; Inside the Tent?</h3>

<p class="calibre2">It was completely dark. Even Xena and Celia could not see very well.</p><p class="calibre2">It was decided that the couple would stay in one tent, and the two partners in the other.</p><p class="calibre2">Usually, in such a situation, they would take turns staying awake and keeping watch, but Helvi set up a barrier around the tents, making that area 100% safe.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, Helvi, good night.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Sweet dreams you two.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Likewise.”</p><p class="calibre2">“G-good night…”</p><p class="calibre2">They said before going inside their tents.</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia were used to this, so they divided the small tent and each laid down in their own space.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn… Traveling with Theo again after so long is fun.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena as she stretched.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, and his food really is great. I was wondering if it would be as good as I remembered, but it turned out to be even better.”</p><p class="calibre2">More than a year had passed since the last time they ate Theo’s cooking.</p><p class="calibre2">They remembered it being absolutely delicious, and wondered if their expectations were unrealistic, but what they had surpassed those expectations.</p><p class="calibre2">That alone was worth coming all the way from the capital to see Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">They talked about their day as they changed clothes. Even they would not sleep in their combat gear.</p><p class="calibre2">“Remember when Theo complimented you? That was nice.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You were complimented too, weren’t you?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Not as much as you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo did compliment Xena a lot as she fought. The reason was simple, he liked the way she fought.</p><p class="calibre2">Xena enhanced her body with magic, but still fought empty-handed and defeated her opponents by overpowering them with pure force.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo thought it was cool. A boy like him admired that kind of raw fighting power, so he would get excited, and compliment her.</p><p class="calibre2">He also liked Celia’s magic and thought it was cool, but preferred Xena.</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s cute too, that pure feeling of admiration. It makes me really happy.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Maybe I should use flashier magic?”</p><p class="calibre2">Gravity magic was flashy in itself, but Theo had seen it countless times.</p><p class="calibre2">He was surprised by it at first, and did compliment her, but as he got used to seeing it, those compliments stopped coming.</p><p class="calibre2">To make matters worse, Helvi beat her at her own game, so her gravity magic had been surpassed.</p><p class="calibre2">“I have to develop new spells for Theo…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hahaha, sounds good. I think something that explodes would be flashy enough.”</p><p class="calibre2">The conversation suddenly stopped.</p><p class="calibre2">The forest around them was very quiet. All they could hear was the sound of insects from time to time.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Do you think they’re asleep?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo and Helvi were not too far away, but they could not hear anything coming from their tent.</p><p class="calibre2">“I guess. We walked a lot today, so I’m sure Theo is tired. As for Helvi… I don’t think this is enough to make her tired.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re right. She wasn’t out of breath for even a second.”</p><p class="calibre2">Both were sweaty and took heavy breaths as they walked up the mountain, but Helvi did not appear to be sweating at all.</p><p class="calibre2">“Celia… Do you want to take a peek?”</p><p class="calibre2">At the height of her curiosity, Xena proposed a reckless idea.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Xena, do you want to die?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No no, she won’t kill us… I think.”</p><p class="calibre2">“See, you know there’s that possibility. You almost died earlier didn’t you?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi did not play around when it came to Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I think just taking a peek is fine. It’s not like we’re taking Theo away from her.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Maybe.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What about instead of peeking, we just listen, and see if they’re doing it… We’ll be able to tell.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…”</p><p class="calibre2">They decided to go for it.</p><p class="calibre2">Despite what she said, Celia was also curious.</p><p class="calibre2">They sneakily exited their tent, approached the one next to theirs, and used all the experience they had acquired so far to suppress their presence, a tremendous misuse of their skills.</p><p class="calibre2">When they got close to the tent, they stopped and listened.</p><p class="calibre2">Inside the tent, they heard nothing, but now they were close enough to hear.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, Helvi… Hn, it feels good…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Both gasped and looked at each other.</p><p class="calibre2">What was happening inside the tent?</p><p class="calibre2">Neither knew, but both wanted to find out even more now.</p>
