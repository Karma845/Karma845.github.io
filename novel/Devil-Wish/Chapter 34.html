<h3>Chapter 34 &ndash; We Don’t Need to Prepare?</h3>

<p class="calibre2">They accepted the quest.</p><p class="calibre2">They were curious about the mountain where a devil supposedly lived, but that was it. They could dispatch any bandit they came across.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’re leaving today. Get food and stuff ready.”</p><p class="calibre2">“We’ll take care of all the things we need for camping, so we’re leaving the food preparations for you, Theo and Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">Since the quest would most likely take four days to complete, making sure they had enough food was the most difficult part. It only made sense to leave it to Theo and his wife, since Theo would be in charge of preparing meals.</p><p class="calibre2">“How much do we need?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, we need stuff like preserved foods so…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you have that at home?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I think we have enough food for four days. We have to pick carefully and pack…”</p><p class="calibre2">“That won’t be necessary.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi said they would not need to prepare anything. As expected, the other three looked confused.</p><p class="calibre2">“If you have what we need at home, our preparations are already complete. We won’t need to make preparations for camping either.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What do you mean? We’re going to have to spend three nights outside, you know?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. It’ll be rough if we don’t have what we need to camp.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It will be faster to just show you. For now, let’s return to Theo’s house.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi before exiting the guild, with the other three quickly following her.</p><p class="calibre2">Not preparing anything, including not making any preparations for camping was not normal by any means.</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia, who knew very well the importance of preparedness, doubted Helvi as they followed her.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo, who was also following her, spoke to Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum, Helvi…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry Theo, just leave it to me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, that’s fine but…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo moved to Helvi’s side, and peeked at her face, slightly embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s not my house, it’s our house.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…! A-ah, yes… We are going back to our house.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes!”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi corrected herself, and Theo had a full smile on his face.</p><p class="calibre2">After seeing this cute exchange happening right in front of them, Xena and Celia looked at each other with big smiles on their faces.</p><p class="calibre2">They arrived at their destination, but Helvi grabbed Theo’s shoulders before he could enter.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s a little dangerous, so stay behind me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo took a couple of steps back and positioned himself behind Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“If we have all the food we will need inside, we just have to do this.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi put out her hand and cast a spell, making the ground shake.</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia easily withstood it, but Theo stumbled, and hugged Helvi’s waist.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, s-sorry…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Don’t let go just yet.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes… Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo as his face became red.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi put on a mask of composure, but in reality she was very excited.</p><p class="calibre2">(Ah… Being hugged from behind…! These arms around my waist feel so nice and warm… You can keep hugging me forever…!)</p><p class="calibre2">She thought as she continued using her magic and the earthquake slowly intensified, until…</p><p class="calibre2">Their house was floating.</p><p class="calibre2">It did not leave the ground, rather the ground around it was floating with it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-is this gravity magic? You can lift a house this big?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said the two waiting behind them, with their eyes wide open.</p><p class="calibre2">Gravity magic was not just good for crushing things, it could also make things levitate. However, more precise control was necessary.</p><p class="calibre2">Celia could not even lift a person, at most she could do it to a short sword. Helvi on the other hand, easily lifted a house.</p><p class="calibre2">Even here, the difference in their power was as clear as could be.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, Helvi, are you actually…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo also did not think Helvi would lift the entire house, but soon caught on to what she was doing, and asked her with a smile.</p><p class="calibre2">“If we take the house with us, we can stay inside, and we won’t have to sleep outdoors. Perfect, isn’t it?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi with a self-satisfied look.</p><p class="calibre2">However…</p><p class="calibre2">“No, hum, Helvi… Part of the fun of traveling is staying in a tent.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes… Part of the fun will be gone if you bring the house.”</p><p class="calibre2">The two women objected.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmph. Do you agree Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes… Cooking in a restricted environment is part of the fun too…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm, I see. I have never ‘traveled’ so I had no idea. Let us leave the house here then.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi before gently putting the house back where it was.</p><p class="calibre2">“Sorry, but I think it’s for the best.”</p><p class="calibre2">“No problem.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But… It didn’t even cross my mind that you were thinking of taking the house with you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s right. I never even thought that would be possible.”</p><p class="calibre2">And then, they made their preparations normally, and started their trip.</p><p class="calibre2"></p>
