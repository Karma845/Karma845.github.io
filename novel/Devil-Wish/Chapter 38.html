<h3>Chapter 38 &ndash; To The Foot of the Mountain</h3>

<p class="calibre2">The four rode their horses across a grass-covered plain, and reached the foot of the twin mountain some time after noon.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh… I’m kind of tired already.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Me too…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena and Celia as they got off their horses.</p><p class="calibre2">Riding horses for so long made their backs hurt.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you alright Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi got off the horse first, and extended her hand towards Theo who, while a little embarrassed, grabbed it and safely landed.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s cuteness and Helvi’s coolness made this scene not feel unnatural at all, even though the genders were reversed.</p><p class="calibre2">This sort of fooling around and flirting happened the whole way there.</p><p class="calibre2">While they were riding their horses, Xena and Celia could not hear their voices, but they were sticking very close together.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm, so these are the twin mountains.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi hung on to Theo’s hand, and looked up at the mountain before her.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not very big, but had two peaks, and from top to bottom it was mostly covered in green, with little to no bare rock.</p><p class="calibre2">“I have never been to such a large mountain, although I have destroyed a few.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi, what are you talking about?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You can’t destroy the mountain, can you?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi, who exterminated most monsters in this continent long ago, destroyed more mountains than she could remember.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not a big deal to Helvi, who could cause natural disasters on her own, but it was a long time ago.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well then, shall we go in right away?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asked Helvi, to which Theo responded.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s already noon, so how about we stop here and eat?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh! I’ve been waiting for this!”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena was clearly very pleased to hear this, and while Celia did not show it as much, she also looked forward to enjoying Theo’s cooking.</p><p class="calibre2">However…</p><p class="calibre2">“Now… Did our things make it here in one piece?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena to Helvi, with doubtful eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">They did not need to rent a wagon, and minimized exhaustion because they did not need to carry all that luggage, but that would be for nothing unless Helvi brought it safely to their destination.</p><p class="calibre2">“I looked up out of curiosity but didn’t see anything. Are you sure it’s there?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I was thinking about it too. Are you sure it’s alright? I don’t even feel any magic.”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia was also suspicious, because Helvi did not make any gestures one would associate with casting a spell.</p><p class="calibre2">“It is all up there. I will bring it down now.”</p><p class="calibre2">As usual, Helvi snapped her fingers.</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed as though nothing happened, but after they looked up, they did see what appeared to be something coming down.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, it’s coming! …But isn’t it coming a bit too fast?”</p><p class="calibre2">The descending luggage moved faster than if it were only free falling.</p><p class="calibre2">“Wait wait! If it crashes at that speed…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The food and camping equipment inside would be obliterated.</p><p class="calibre2">They tried to stop her, but it was too late.</p><p class="calibre2">The luggage crashed into the ground at an incredible speed, causing a tremor… Or so they expected.</p><p class="calibre2">It stopped just before hitting the ground, stood there floating, and gently hit the ground a few seconds later.</p><p class="calibre2">“Use your common sense. It should be obvious that I would not simply let it drop at that speed.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re the last person I want to hear talk about common sense!”</p><p class="calibre2">Carrying luggage in the sky went well against what they considered to be common sense.</p><p class="calibre2">This time, Xena’s complaints were entirely valid.</p><p class="calibre2">“Only one descended. Is this the one with the food?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I packed this one. I’ll start cooking right away.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo opened the bag and took out the food and his cooking utensils.</p><p class="calibre2">He could not pack raw food, and opted instead for things like vegetables and rice.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm, it’s only vegetables… I’m sure it will be good because you’re the one cooking, but…”</p><p class="calibre2">“We could’ve gotten some meat if we encountered a monster on the way… But there weren’t any to be found.”</p><p class="calibre2">Even though they rode through the grassy plain for hours, they did not encounter a single monster, which was very rare.</p><p class="calibre2">Usually they would be happy about not having to stop for pointless fights, but this time they were a little disappointed about not being able to procure more food.</p><p class="calibre2">“Do we just need meat, Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I have seasonings, so all that’s missing is meat…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see, then… I killed a monster.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, you did…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Not ‘I will kill a monster’. She said ‘I killed a monster’.</p><p class="calibre2">They looked around, but there were no monsters to be found.</p><p class="calibre2">“What do you mean? Where is that…”</p><p class="calibre2">Half-way through Xena’s question, a strange noise could be heard from above.</p><p class="calibre2">When they looked up, they saw something bigger than before falling.</p><p class="calibre2">“You don’t mean…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I do not feel like stopping it before it hits the ground, so dodge it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Wai… No way!?”</p><p class="calibre2">It was falling straight towards Xena and Celia’s heads, so they scrambled to move out of the way.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, with a big thud, a huge bird hit the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">This monster that measured five meters in length would be more than enough for their meal.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… that scared me…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi! Can you please not do something so dangerous?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I would not have done it if I did not know you could dodge it.”</p><p class="calibre2">Normally, people would be surprised that someone effortlessly killed a monster that flew high above their heads, but the other three were not going to be surprised by such things anymore, and simply accepted it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, can you cook this?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I can, but I’ve never dressed such a big bird, so it will take some time.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I can help. I am good at this.”</p><p class="calibre2">And then, Helvi mostly used magic to dismantle the big bird, and it was ready to be cooked.</p><p class="calibre2">“Seeing those two work together is really charming… But what they’re doing kind of brings it down.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I really don’t think we’re going to be able to eat that entire bird. What are we going to do?”</p>
