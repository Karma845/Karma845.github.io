<h3>Chapter 16 &ndash; Time for 〇〇</h3>

<p class="calibre2">The trio finished eating the pudding Theo made. It was very sweet, just as Helvi liked it.</p><p class="calibre2">“It was really good Theo. The best I’ve ever had, no doubt about it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-you’re exaggerating…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m not, that’s the truth.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It was very good. Thank you Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you very much…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was embarrassed as the two complimented him. His face became red, but he was very happy.</p><p class="calibre2">The mood in the room was very calm and happy, as the two ladies drank black tea and watched that face.</p><p class="calibre2">By the time they finished drinking it, the sun had set and it was pitch black outside.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s already so late. What are you going to do Fiore?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn…”</p><p class="calibre2">When Fiore stayed in Theo’s house so late, she usually ended up sleeping there. It had happened dozens of times at that point, so Theo was past the point where it could be an issue, but Fiore was nervous every time.</p><p class="calibre2">There were only two beds, so she always fell asleep feeling disappointed as she saw Theo sleep.</p><p class="calibre2">The next day, the other receptionists would always ask if anything happened, but Fiore could never deliver the news they wanted to hear.</p><p class="calibre2">But now Theo had a wife, and Fiore peeked at her.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi had just finished putting away the cups, and turned around.</p><p class="calibre2">“I will take Fiore home.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, then I’ll go too…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Stay here and take care of the dishes and everything else. This is an important job as well.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright, understood. Take good care of Fiore.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, leave it to me.”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore was a little disappointed when it was decided she would not be staying over that night, but understood that it was only natural, since he now had a wife.</p><p class="calibre2">“Thank you for the meal Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Come back any time.”</p><p class="calibre2">And then the two women walked out into the night, illuminated only by the magic items that dotted the side of the road.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore peeked at Helvi, who was walking by her side.</p><p class="calibre2">It should be difficult to see in the dark night, but it was still clear as day how beautiful she was.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore was nervous as they walked, until she could no longer bear the silence and spoke.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-hum, Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What is it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I didn’t know he had a fiancee, and I stayed over in Theo’s house many times…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I know.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi, who received a lot of information about Theo when they formed their contract, already knew.</p><p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, Fiore felt as though her heart was about to stop.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I’m sorry, I won’t do it any more…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Why not? I see no issue with that.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? Really?”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore’s eyes were wide open in surprise. Everything Helvi had said and done led Fiore to believe she wanted Theo all to herself, and would never let another woman stay in his house.</p><p class="calibre2">“I show no mercy to those who would harm Theo. You saw, so surely you know this.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, I do.”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore remembered what happened earlier that day in the guild, when Carl tried to hit Theo, and his arm was cracked all over. She had no idea how Helvi had done it, but it was terrifying.</p><p class="calibre2">But the kiss attempt that followed was more vivid in her mind, and their faces became a little red as they remembered it.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-well there you have it. You two are friends, and I hope you can continue to be friends.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But I am his only wife. If you try to cheat… You know?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes… I do.”</p><p class="calibre2">Did Fiore imagine the flash of light in Helvi’s eyes as she said this?</p><p class="calibre2">As they approached Fiore’s house, a question popped into her head.</p><p class="calibre2">“Wait, so you’re saying I can stay in Theo’s house?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“So why couldn’t I stay tonight?”</p><p class="calibre2">This question made Helvi stop. They were right in front of Fiore’s house.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi…?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Fu, fufufu…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore thought it was strange how Helvi suddenly started giggling.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufu. Yes, you do not realize.”</p><p class="calibre2">“W-what?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Myself and Theo got married today.”</p><p class="calibre2">They did not deliver a marriage registration to an official office or anything, but to Theo and Helvi, they were as good as married.</p><p class="calibre2">“R-really?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, so… You know ?”</p><p class="calibre2">“What?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You don’t… Of course, you are still like a child.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Wha!? W-what do you mean!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“We were married today, which means…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi said it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Today is our 『first night』!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Wha..!”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore’s face was painted red.</p><p class="calibre2">“I will not allow anyone to bother us on our sacred 『first night』.”</p><p class="calibre2">A devil used the word sacred, but no one was around to point it out.</p><p class="calibre2">“F-f-irs…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore was struggling to say it. She had no idea that was why she was so determined to not let her stay the night.</p><p class="calibre2">But it was a very valid reason.</p><p class="calibre2">“And that is why you cannot stay tonight. I do apologize.”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-no… It’s fine.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Remember what you said to me about my first time? That is correct for now, but when we meet again tomorrow… I will not be the same as today.”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore could not fully comprehend what she was saying, but responded anyway.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-have fun.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, goodbye Fiore. See you tomorrow.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The white hair disappeared into the dark night, and all that was left was a dumbfounded Fiore.</p></div>
