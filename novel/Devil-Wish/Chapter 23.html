<h3>Chapter 23 &ndash; Designated Quest</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“Ah, welcome back Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">After finally being released from the barrage of questions from the receptionists, Helvi was greeted by Theo’s smile.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes, I’m back.”</p><p class="calibre2">It was Helvi’s first time being cornered by weaker beings, and she was mentally exhausted, but Theo’s words and smile completely blew that exhaustion away.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi laughed at herself, thinking about how simple she was, if such a thing was enough to make her happy.</p><p class="calibre2">“What did you talk about?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufu, girl talk. It was not something for a man like you to hear.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I see…”</p><p class="calibre2">She really could not speak of it. She talked about what happened that morning and the previous night in even more vivid detail than when she mentally communicated with Fiore.</p><p class="calibre2">She could see the receptionists looking their way and giggling, but she did not want to bother with it.</p><p class="calibre2">But…</p><p class="calibre2">(I have a bigger problem in mind. As I spoke and remembered what happened, I started feeling like indulging in Theo’s lips again…)</p><p class="calibre2">She looked at Theo’s face, and his soft lips.</p><p class="calibre2">“What is it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Nothing.”</p><p class="calibre2">If this was enough to make it so she could not contain herself, she would not be feeling good if she did not kiss him from that point forward.</p><p class="calibre2">That could not be… No, maybe that was not the case, but it seemed like it would cause a lot of problems.</p><p class="calibre2">(We will do it again when we return home, this time not for minutes, but for hours…)</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi, I want to accept this one. What do you think?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was lost in her pink colored thoughts, but quickly switched back when Theo spoke to her.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? Let me see… Medicinal herb picking? Is that all? I would have no trouble at all eliminating a more wicked monster you know?”</p><p class="calibre2">“But I would have!”</p><p class="calibre2">That quest was not available the previous day, and was freshly put out by a town’s pharmacy.</p><p class="calibre2">There were various pharmacists in town, but this was the first medicinal herb picking quest in a while.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s do this one. This is a designated quest for me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hou, for you Theo? Clearly from a discerning individual.”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-no way, that’s too much…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said an embarrassed Theo, but Fiore agreed with Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s right, most medicinal herb picking quests that come to the mercenary guild are designated quests for Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Is that so…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, many people have been helped by Theo’s careful picking, and we regularly receive quests like this.”</p><p class="calibre2">Just as Fiore said, Theo’s medicinal herb picking had a good reputation, and they received requests such as this numerous times.</p><p class="calibre2">Most people in the mercenary guild were proud of their strength, so they looked down on quests that involved delicate work.</p><p class="calibre2">It was very difficult for amateurs to evaluate medicinal herbs, and simply plucking them was out of the question. Both the leaf and root were needed, so it was necessary to pick them very well and carry them carefully.</p><p class="calibre2">It was for this reason that the mercenary guild had little interest in this sort of quest before Theo arrived, but they started coming in when Theo started completing them.</p><p class="calibre2">“If you can do them, does that mean they are safe?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm, they’re a lot safer than other quests because I don’t have to fight monsters, but leaving town is dangerous in itself. We never know when monsters might appear.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I have to hide, but they’re not that strong, so I can run away if they find me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“In that case, today you have no reason to run even if you are found.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes! Are you coming with me?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course. I am your wife.”</p><p class="calibre2">There was no way Helvi was going to refuse, but Theo looked up with concern in his eyes, so she stroke his head to reassure him.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-wife… T-thank you very much…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Y-yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was a little embarrassed to hear the word wife, and Helvi’ cheeks also became a little red.</p><p class="calibre2">They could hear shrill voices coming from receptionists in the back, but felt like acknowledging them would mean they won.</p><p class="calibre2">“So, are you taking it?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Fiore from behind the counter, who was feeling heartburn.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, yes, please!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Then I’ll handle the paperwork. Be careful out there.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, thank you very much!”</p><p class="calibre2">“See you later Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah. And there is no need to be concerned about Theo. I am the strongest.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi with a laugh, as she followed Theo to the exit.</p><p class="calibre2">After the two left, Fiore mumbled.</p><p class="calibre2">“…That Helvi sure is manly. Even if Theo was a girl and Helvi was a man, they would be right for each other.”</p><p class="calibre2">One of the receptionists happened to hear this, and told the rest, increasing their wild ideas… But that is a story for another time.</p></div>
