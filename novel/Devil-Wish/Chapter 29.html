<h3>Chapter 29: Perfect Match × 30 minutes</h3>


<p>On that day, Shigure and I came to the well-known electronics store Yodobayashi Camera, just the two of us.</p>



<p>Our purpose was to replace the rice cooker.</p>



<p>The battle-hardened veteran that we had been using since my mother was alive had finally been taken to heaven the other day, so we hurriedly came to appoint a successor.</p>



<p>By the way, from our home to the nearest Yodobayashi Camera, it’s five stations away on the express train, taking about thirty minutes. It’s not far, but it’s not incredibly close either.</p>



<p>Since this store also operates online, it seemed like we could easily handle it there, but Shigure wanted to go in person.</p>



<p>She said it’s because you can negotiate in person and get a cheaper price.</p>



<p>But… I wonder if it will really work out that well?</p>



<p>I’ve tried bargaining myself before, but I remember it usually ended up being around the same as the online price, taking into account the point redemption.</p>



<p>The price on a certain massive online marketplace seems to be like some kind of border.</p>



<p>If it ultimately won’t be lower than online shopping, considering the cost of the train fare and travel time to get there, the cost performance might actually be worse.</p>



<p>Especially in the middle of the scorching heat of mid-August. That’s why I was hesitant, but…</p>



<p>“Isn’t it because Onii-san has difficulty with interpersonal skills and is an introvert?”</p>



<p>Shigure said something incredibly rude.</p>



<p>Oh, really?</p>



<p>Well then, let me witness the extraordinary interpersonal skills of Shigure-san, who is the embodiment of social abilities.</p>



<p>And so, for such a reason, I am now observing from a distance as Shigure, probably negotiating with a store clerk of respectable age on the floor, haggles over the price.</p>



<p>I admit that I’m an introvert, but there’s a difference between admitting it to myself and affirming it when others say it. So, as compensation for damaging my honor, I made a bet with Shigure that if she couldn’t beat the Amazon price, including train fare and point redemption, she’d treat me to Starbucks on our way back.</p>



<p>Conversely, if she managed to beat the price, it’d be on me. Thus, I sent my cheers to the middle-aged store employee facing Shigure.</p>



<p>However…</p>



<p>“Just a little more, can’t you lower it by another five thousand yen?” (Looking up with pleading eyes)</p>



<p>“Y-Young lady, isn’t lowering a 20,000 yen rice cooker by 5,000 yen already quite a bit?”</p>



<p>“I want to treat my hardworking father to delicious meals every day. But we’re not well-off, and we can’t afford the quality rice… So if we’re getting a new one, I really want to get a good rice cooker, even just a bit… Is it really impossible?” (Softly taking the middle-aged clerk’s hand)</p>



<p>“~~~~! Fine! You win, take it, you thief! Your father must be really proud of having such a good daughter!”</p>



<p>Damn it.</p>



<p>“Alright, I win! Onii-san, it’s your treat for our 3 o’clock tea time.”</p>



<p>“Don’t mess with me! Isn’t this practically a honey trap or something?”</p>



<p>I protested to Shigure, who returned with a triumphant look, holding the purchased item in hand.</p>



<p>To that, Shigure pouted slightly in response.</p>



<p>“You really have no sense of propriety, Onii-san. Being like that isn’t cool, you know.”</p>



<p>“The starting point of this bet was supposed to be about our interpersonal skills. Using inherent skills like gender and looks would be a violation of regulations.”</p>



<p>“Ara. Ara-ara. Onii-san, does that mean you consider me beautiful?”</p>



<p>“… Well, that’s because it’s also my girlfriend’s face.”</p>



<p>I retorted to avoid giving Shigure any compliments directly.</p>



<p>“Hmm, but being beautiful is generally a disadvantage. It’s my theory that it only becomes an advantage if you have shameless interpersonal skills to exploit.”</p>



<p>“Hehe, is that so?” </p>



<p>“So, make sure to treat me on the way back.”</p>



<p>I am not convinced at all.</p>



<p>There’s no way being beautiful could be a disadvantage. </p>



<p>But arguing further wouldn’t be very manly, either.</p>



<p>…Well, thanks to Shigure haggling for the rice cooker, we saved some money in the household budget. As a gesture of appreciation, I guess it’s okay to treat her to Starbucks.</p>



<p>I convinced myself of that and gave my consent.</p>



<p>Then, I received the package containing the rice cooker from Shigure and headed towards the exit.</p>



<p>On the way, we passed by a display of glass showcases in the accessory corner.</p>



<p>“What are you looking at?”</p>



<p>“N-Nothing, really…”</p>



<p>Uh-oh. I unintentionally got distracted and stopped.</p>



<p>“Aren’t those women’s accessories? Ah, I see. Nee-san’s birthday is right after summer vacation starts.”</p>



<p>“W-Well, yeah.”</p>



<p>This is what “uh-oh” means.</p>



<p>…To be honest, I don’t really want to talk much about Haruka with Shigure. </p>



<p>It’s uncomfortable because I know how Shigure feels. </p>



<p>But Shigure, who has no idea about my awkwardness, keeps pushing for information.</p>



<p>“So, are you planning to give her jewelry as a birthday present?”</p>



<p>“…I haven’t decided yet.”</p>



<p>“But the fact that you stopped at this store means jewelry is one of the options, right?”</p>



<p>“It’s the obvious choice. Like a necklace or a ring…”</p>



<p>At this point, it would be awkward to forcibly change the topic. So, I resign myself and answer Shigure’s questions. </p>



<p>In other words, I’m struggling with what to give Haruka for her birthday.</p>



<p>It’s a once-a-year event, and it’s the first time I’m giving a gift to Haruka. Being conscious of it being the first gift, I want to give something memorable and special. </p>



<p>However, when I think about what would be memorable, my limited dating experience with Haruka becomes a hindrance, and I can’t seem to make a decision. In the end, someone like me can only rely on the classics. </p>



<p>But Shigure seems to disagree.</p>



<p>“Ehh… rings are no good, you know?”</p>



<p>“Is that… odd?”</p>



<p>“It’s not odd, but it feels too serious.”</p>



<p>Ugh… Well, I can’t say I entirely disagree.</p>



<p>Rings do have a unique sense of significance, but at the same time, they may feel too special. </p>



<p>After all, I’m just a high school student. But…</p>



<p>“I think it’d be better to go for something like a bracelet for accessories. Rings can be inconvenient to wear with uniforms or casual outfits. If it’s a natural stone bracelet, she could even wear it at school… Oh, wait a moment.”</p>



<p>Shigure stopped mid-sentence and signaled to pause.</p>



<p>“W-What is it?”</p>



<p>“Well… I was just thinking that if it’s Nee-san, she might actually be delighted with a ring.”</p>



<p>Yeah, that’s right.</p>



<p>Although it might feel too special for other girls, I think Haruka would be happy with it. At least, that’s what I, her boyfriend of a few months, believe. And it seems that Shigure, who has known her since birth, shares the same opinion.</p>



<p>“That’s right. A ring might be a good choice for Nee-san. I take back what I said earlier.”</p>



<p>“I see…”</p>



<p>In that case, it might be a good idea to go all out and get her a ring. </p>



<p>Of course, not from here; I should go to a department store where they can package it properly.</p>



<p>“By the way, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“As a matter of fact, Nee-san and I are twins.”</p>



<p>Huh?</p>



<p>“In other words, Nee-san’s birthday is also my birthday.”</p>



<p>“R-Right, it is.”</p>



<p>“As your cute and adorable sister, who selflessly serves you every day, don’t you have a present for me too?”</p>



<p>I see.</p>



<p>Well, I had a feeling the conversation would drift towards this topic. </p>



<p>It was one of the reasons why I didn’t want to discuss presents with Shigure. </p>



<p>And my response to this request is always the same.</p>



<p>“No.”</p>



<p>“Aww!”</p>



<p>“You see. Treating you to something on the way back is my present to Shigure.”</p>



<p>“Aww, come on! Onii-san, you’re being stingy! So stingy!”</p>



<p>Shigure’s eyes were moist with sadness. </p>



<p>Seeing that expression made my heart ache a little, but I held back from telling her the truth. The truth being, it’s about her birthday present.</p>



<p>Of course, I will prepare a gift. I never had the idea of not preparing one from the start.</p>



<p>Admittedly, giving Shigure a present right now might… well, it could deviate from my approach of not nurturing any romantic feelings towards her. But that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t give my sister a birthday present at all.</p>



<p>So, of course, I will give Shigure a gift. </p>



<p>However, I don’t want her to know about it beforehand. </p>



<p>It’s not as fun for the giver if it’s not a surprise.</p>



<p>“Oh, this bracelet is cute. Hey, hey, Onii-san, don’t you think it’ll suit me?”</p>



<p>“Hmm. It certainly does suit you. Go ahead and pay for it. I’ll wait here.”</p>



<p>“Uuu!”</p>



<p>“If you’re not buying it, I’m leaving.”</p>



<p>“Uuu!”</p>



<p>Ignoring Shigure’s whining like a spoiled child, I start walking. </p>



<p>Even after we entered the café later, Shigure continued to complain to me, saying, “Fine, whatever. You’ll be on a date with Nee-san on the actual day, and I’ll just celebrate alone with a whole cake,” sulking with her arms crossed.</p>



<p>..I feel a bit guilty, but that’s collateral damage. </p>



<p>I did check out that bracelet earlier. </p>



<p>I’ll secretly go back to buy it on another day.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“Wow, it’s really crowded…”</p>



<div><img><p></p>



<p>After Shigure had cheered up a bit by devouring three cakes on my dime, we left Starbucks and headed home. </p>



<p>But the time was exactly six in the evening.</p>



<p>The train platform was packed with salarymen returning from work and students on summer break.</p>



<p>We should have left a bit earlier… </p>



<p>Since I only take local trains to school, I was careless.</p>



<p>Thinking about how we’ll be jostled in this crowd for the next twenty or thirty minutes is pretty annoying.</p>



<p>Shigure felt the same, sighing deeply beside me.</p>



<p>“I really hate crowded trains.”</p>



<p>“Well, no one likes them, right?”</p>



<p>“It’s not like that. Remember, I mentioned earlier that being pretty can lead to unpleasant experiences. When I lived in Fukuoka, I had to commute on packed trains for quite a while, and sometimes it happened on those trains.”</p>



<p>“What? Ghosts?”</p>



<p>“Gropers.”</p>



<p>I was taken aback by her candid words.</p>



<p>After all, those words were so far from my reality as a guy who hardly had any female friends, and I had never even imagined something like that.</p>



<p>“G-Gropers? Did something happen to you?”</p>



<p>“Of course it did. I mean, look how cute I am. That day, I was feeling terrible from the morning— Ugh!”</p>



<p>As we continued our conversation, the flow of people started to move.</p>



<p>The train arrived, and its doors opened.</p>



<p>The people on the platform surged towards the open doors.</p>



<p>But naturally, the train was already occupied, and pressure came from all sides, turning the flow into a chaotic torrent.</p>



<p>In the midst of this, a middle-aged salaryman angrily pushed his way between Shigure and me.</p>



<p>Instantly, that candid word was repeated in my mind.</p>



<p>—Groper.</p>



<p>Unpleasant images associated with that word resisted against the current within me. </p>



<p>I pushed back against the salaryman trying to enter, making sure not to be separated from Shigure.</p>



<p>Then, pushed by the flow, I shoved Shigure against the side of the door opposite the one we’d entered and placed my arms against the wall, covering her.</p>



<p>Shigure blinked her eyes in surprise at my position.</p>



<p>“Eh? Onii-san, why are you pushing me against the wall?”</p>



<p>“It’s not that I mean to…”</p>



<p>However, being a perceptive girl she quickly realized my intention.</p>



<p>“Ah… could it be that you’re protecting me?”</p>



<p>“After hearing a story like that, I just acted on the spur of the moment…”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to take it so seriously. I’m quite strong, you know.”</p>



<p>“I know that, but… I know, but it’s still disgusting, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>I’ve never experienced being molested, so I can only imagine what it would be like. But the thought of being touched all over by some unknown old man makes my skin crawl. </p>



<p>Thinking that Shigure had been forced to go through such an unjust experience… It makes me furious.</p>



<p>It’s something I can’t forgive. I don’t want it to happen to her ever again.</p>



<p>It’s not a matter of Shigure being strong or used to it. </p>



<p>It’s that I hate it.</p>



<p>But with this position, even if there were a groper, he wouldn’t target Shigure. He’d have to reach in under my arm to touch her. </p>



<p>However…</p>



<p>“You’re kind, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>It’s a position I took instinctively to protect Shigure, but I hadn’t thought it through. </p>



<p>In this position… Shigure’s face ends up right in front of my eyes.</p>



<p>I can clearly see the irises of her large eyes, the trembling of her lips adorned with lightly colored lipstick for going out, the face of the girl I shouldn’t have fallen for but have.</p>



<p>It’s a distance where, if someone just slightly pushes my back, it would result in a kiss…</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>Wait a second, doesn’t this make me the molester!</p>



<p>Cornering Shigure against the wall, leaning over her, what was I even thinking? </p>



<p>That we could end up kissing?</p>



<p>I scolded myself for my foolish thoughts and closed my eyes, but…</p>



<p>“But with that posture, Onii-san, you can’t move anymore, can you? Is it okay? Being so defenseless in front of me.”</p>



<p>“Uh…!”</p>



<p>And then, it happened. </p>



<p>Shigure’s voice suddenly took on a mischievous tone.</p>



<p>Startled, I opened my half-closed eyes, and Shigure was lifting the corners of her mouth, showing me that wicked smile. </p>



<p>Then she softly touched my chest area with her fingertips.</p>



<div><img><p></p>



<p>“Do you know? Gropers tend to target those who seem weaker, those who appear unable to resist. It’s scary, isn’t it? Because… right now, Onii-san, you look very weak.”</p>



<p>“Hey, you…!”</p>



<p>Shigure’s fingertips twirl, drawing circles. </p>



<p>Her well-manicured nails, beautiful like pearls, scratch my skin through my thin summer clothing. </p>



<p>Ignoring my shivering from the ticklish sensation, Shigure’s fingertips change their movement from circles to an up-and-down scratching motion.</p>



<p>Scratch, scratch, slowly moving from my navel up to my chest, then slowly steering towards my right chest—wait, where is she planning to touch me with those fingers!?</p>



<p>“Just kidding. Ahaha, it was a joke.”</p>



<p>But the next moment, Shigure quickly removed her hand from my chest.</p>



<p>“Please don’t look so scared. I, a loving and well-behaved sister, would never play such a malicious prank, would I?”</p>



<p>“Y-you, look back on what you’ve just done and say that again…”</p>



<p>“Ah-ah, the train noise is so loud I can’t hear anything!”</p>



<p>Shigure feigns ignorance, after doing something inappropriate. </p>



<p>I feel pathetic for feeling even slightly sorry for such a thick-skinned girl.</p>



<p>“But seriously, this position isn’t very good, is it?”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“Because, you see, this kind of position, where it looks like you’re pressing me against the wall, might make people think you’re the molester.”</p>



<p>“… No, that’s unlikely. We’re the same age. Wouldn’t people normally think we’re lovers?”</p>



<p>“With Onii-san’s facial attractiveness score?”</p>



<p>“Don’t you have any compassion? I’ll cry, you know.”</p>



<p>“Besides, being mistaken for lovers would also be a problem, wouldn’t it? There might be classmates on this train.”</p>



<p>Ugh, she’s right.</p>



<p>This is the area around Seiun High School. It’s not impossible to run into acquaintances on the same train. </p>



<p>If we were just together, it could be passed off as a chance meeting. We’re not strangers to each other. In fact, I’ve brushed off acquaintances with that explanation before. But this position is certainly not good.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t be a topic of discussion if it were just me, who’s as inconspicuous as a ghost student, but being paired with Shigure, who’s popular in class for her beauty and friendliness, might turn it into a talking point. If it got back to Haruka, that would be a problem.</p>



<p>…However, the train is already packed. </p>



<p>I can’t change my position until some people get off.</p>



<p>W-What should I do?</p>



<p>As I was pondering, Shigure made a move.</p>



<p>“So, I’ll excuse myself for a moment.”</p>



<p>With those words, Shigure gently wraps her arms around my waist and leans into me. </p>



<p>The sudden closeness catches me off guard.</p>



<p>“W-What are you doing? Wasn’t it just a joke?” </p>



<p>“Calm down. If I hug you like this, no one will misunderstand, and no one can see my face.”</p>



<p>Whispering softly into my ear, Shigure lowered her head to rest her forehead against my shoulder.</p>



<p>It’s true; this way, we look like a couple, and Shigure’s face is hidden from view. But still,</p>



<p>“See? It’s all right like this.”</p>



<p>… No, it’s not all right. It’s not all right in a different sense. </p>



<p>Because this is almost like embracing.</p>



<p>Shigure’s breasts are pressed against mine, even squished against it. </p>



<p>We’re both dressed lightly for the summer heat, and I can feel the softness and warmth of her body, prodding the emotions I’ve decided to suppress within me. </p>



<p>My heart starts to pound wildly. </p>



<p>Surely… Shigure must be feeling it too.</p>



<p>That’s not good. She might realize my feelings. </p>



<p>So, it’s not good. It’s not good, but—</p>



<p>“…Ah, y-yeah. That’s true.”</p>



<p>Just as Shigure said, it’s not good to be seen like this by acquaintances.</p>



<p>Even in a crowded train where visibility is limited, there is still a chance.</p>



<p>If we can hide Shigure’s face, at least, it should prevent any misconceptions.</p>



<p>… So, I make excuses to myself. </p>



<p>It’s only for now.</p>



<p>It’s not because I want to embrace Shigure, not at all.</p>



<p>It’s not that I’ve lost to the feelings hidden within me, nor have I betrayed Haruka.</p>



<p>It’s just to prevent any misunderstandings until we reach the station.</p>



<p>Once I accept the situation… I notice something else amid the sound of my own heartbeat. </p>



<p>The sound of Shigure’s heart beating, transmitted through our pressed-together chests.</p>



<p>Thump, thump, a calm and gentle sound, unlike my own.</p>



<p>That sound stirs something within me.</p>



<p>… This is Shigure’s heartbeat. </p>



<p>A girl who became my sister through a series of coincidences, who has playfully toyed with me, yet supported me more than anyone else – the kind and lovely Shigure.</p>



<p>As I listened to that rhythm, the tension from earlier seemed like a lie, and I began to relax. </p>



<p>I felt at peace, and my heartbeat calmed down. </p>



<p>The calm beat melded with Shigure’s heatbeat, blending together. </p>



<p>It was incredibly comforting…</p>



<p>“… Should we just ride past the final stop like this?”</p>



<p>“You idiot…”</p>



<p>But I can’t help feeling regret at my response. </p>



<p>Truly, it was an inexplicable situation.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“It’s so hot…”</p>



<p>Shigure, upon returning home, said with an exasperated voice.</p>



<p>Well, even with the air conditioning on, if you were hugging each other on a packed train, it’s bound to feel like that.</p>



<p>“I’ll go take a shower first.”</p>



<p>“Hey, that’s unfair. I’m sweaty too. All because of you.”</p>



<p>“Do you want to go in together again, wearing swimsuits?”</p>



<p>“No, we won’t. How am I supposed to wash myself? Hurry up and get done with it.”</p>



<p>“Alright,” Shigure lazily responded, and closed the curtain that acted as a room divider.</p>



<p>Soon, the sound of clothes rustling filled the air. </p>



<p>…It was a dangerous sound.</p>



<p>To avoid getting distracted, I turned on the TV and picked up my smartphone.</p>



<p>That’s when I noticed a LINE notification.</p>



<p>The sender was… Takeshi. </p>



<p>One of my male friends. Takeshi, the gym junkie, had posted in a group with Tomoe Wakabayashi, another male friend, and me. The content was—</p>



<p>Takeshi: “Hiromichi, it’s sudden, but can you take my shift the day after tomorrow?”</p>



<p>I work part-time at the same drugstore as Takeshi. </p>



<p>I’m off the day after tomorrow and have no plans. </p>



<p>I could swap shifts, but I decided to ask why.</p>



<p>Hiro: “What’s up?”</p>



<p>Takeshi: “New training equipment is being delivered to our club tomorrow. I’ve been called by the senior to help with the installation. Can’t say no to a senior’s orders.”</p>



<p>I see. A very athletic-club-like reason.</p>



<p>I’ve never been in a club, so this could be my bias talking. </p>



<p>As long as it’s not for some trivial reason like wanting to hang out, it should be fine.</p>



<p>Hiro: “It was from noon the day after tomorrow, right? I got it.”</p>



<p>Takeshi: “I owe you one!”</p>



<p>Hiro: “Buy me a juice during our next break.”</p>



<p>Takeshi: “Consider it done. We have chocolate and strawberry flavors. Which one do you want?”</p>



<p>Hiro: “That’s definitely protein, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>Thinking that I don’t need it, I wrote down the shift change into my smartphone’s calendar so I wouldn’t forget. While I was doing that, another notification from Takeshi came in.</p>



<p>Takeshi: “By the way, do you use Instagram, Hiromichi?”</p>



<p>Hiro: “You mean the photo-sharing app? Do you think I’d use such a normie app?”</p>



<p>Takeshi: “Well, it’s not your style.”</p>



<p>Hiro: “Just so you know, you’re on this side too.”</p>



<p>Takeshi: “What are you talking about? I use it.”</p>



<p>Wait, seriously? This is news to me. And quite surprising. </p>



<p>I thought that app was only for girls and scrawny college students with feminine faces and mushroom-like hair.</p>



<p>Tomo: “Takeshi keeps a training diary on it, complete with half-naked pictures.”</p>



<p>As I was surprised, Tomoe, who must have just noticed the conversation between Takeshi and me, chimed in.</p>



<p>It seems Tomoe knew about it. </p>



<p>Well, Tomoe is likely to use it—mostly for socializing with girls. </p>



<p>But a training diary?</p>



<p>Hiro: “Who even looks at that?”</p>



<p>Tomo: “He has about 50,000 followers, last I checked.”</p>



<p>Takeshi: “It’s increased to 70,000 now.”</p>



<p>Hiro: “You’re kidding me…”</p>



<p>Tomo: “Well, Takeshi’s muscles are quite impressive. They’re actually eye-catching.”</p>



<p>Seventy thousand people want to see this guy’s muscles on that mainstream app? It was a world I couldn’t comprehend.</p>



<p>Takeshi: “Anyway, who cares about me?”</p>



<p>Oops, we did get off-topic.</p>



<p>Why did he even bring up Instagram in the first place?</p>



<p>I waited for the next message from Takeshi, and then—</p>



<p>Takeshi: “More importantly, do you know that Saikawa is currently a hot topic on Instagram, Hiromichi?”</p>



<p>An unexpected name came up. Saikawa—that’s the last name of my girlfriend, Haruka. </p>



<p>What does it mean that Haruka is trending on Instagram?</p>



<p>Tomo: “Ah, you went and said it. I kept quiet because I thought it might make Hiro unnecessarily anxious. He wouldn’t know since he doesn’t use Instagram.”</p>



<p>Hiro: “What’s going on? Explain.”</p>



<p>Takeshi: “I don’t know the details. I just happened to see a trending picture of Saikawa on the Instagram home screen and was surprised. The photo was really well-taken, so I thought I’d let you know if you weren’t aware.”</p>



<p>“Trending” means something like gaining popularity.</p>



<p>I get that much since it’s a term I hear on Twitter, the only social media I actually use. </p>



<p>But what does it mean to “trending” on Instagram? More importantly, why is Haruka a topic of discussion there?</p>



<p>I can’t grasp the situation. </p>



<p>Tomoe then offered some additional explanation.</p>



<p>Tomo: “You know the drama club had a summer camp, right? The club president posted photos from that time on their own account.”</p>



<p>Ah, I see. </p>



<p>Tomo’s words reminded me of an album Haruka showed me when she came over to my house.</p>



<p>Tomo: “Among those photos, there’s one miraculous shot where Haruka looks incredibly beautiful. That photo is super popular right now. Phrases like ‘Who is this beautiful girl?’ and ‘So cute!’ have generated nearly a million likes.”</p>



<p>“A million?!”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but blurt it out.</p>



<p>I don’t know the user base of Instagram, and since I don’t use it, I don’t know the standards either. However, it’s clear that having a million people react positively to one person is no small matter.</p>



<p>But still…</p>



<p>Hiro: “Why is this even happening? I mean, Haruka is cute, but she’s just an ordinary student. She’s not a celebrity or an idol. Why is she getting so much attention?”</p>



<p>Tomo: “Well, you see, the drama club’s president is a high school student and also an author. Plus, she’s really pretty, so she already had a massive following. Probably about 30 times more followers than Takeshi.”</p>



<p>For me, who has fewer than 10 followers on Twitter, it’s a world too different to even imagine.</p>



<p>Tomo: “Because the account already had many followers, and the photo was picked up by external blogs that summarize hot topics, it’s not just confined to Instagram anymore. Phrases like ‘Once in a millennium beauty appears!’ are floating around.”</p>



<p>Takeshi: “But the photo is actually really good. You’d be missing out if you don’t see it as her boyfriend.”</p>



<p>I know. I’ve seen it. Probably. </p>



<p>It must be that captivating picture Haruka showed me, the one that captured her in a moment before a performance. </p>



<p>It was a photo where cuteness and dignity coexisted. </p>



<p>That must be the one that’s the talk of the town.</p>



<p>I see. Now I understand why Tomoe was being considerate. </p>



<p>It’s true, knowing that a massive crowd is flocking to a photo of my girlfriend does make me feel a bit complicated. I wonder if there might be people hitting on her in the comments.</p>



<p>However, while it’s not the most pleasant feeling, I can’t say I’m overly concerned.</p>



<p>I mean, I myself ‘like’ photos of cute animals or impressive images on Twitter. It’s mostly a reflexive action, without much thought behind it. Isn’t it the same for those million people on Instagram?</p>



<p>Besides, even if there are some people who fell for Haruka after seeing that photo and are genuinely hitting on her, Haruka isn’t the type to be pleased with that. </p>



<p>She’d only feel annoyed by sweet words from men who know her only through an online photo. So, why not let people be enthralled by the photo? </p>



<p>It’s a show of generous spirit.</p>



<p>Hiro: “In short, my girlfriend is awesome!”</p>



<p>Takeshi: “Exactly, you traitor. I won’t forgive you.”</p>



<p>Hiro: “If Takeshi has that many followers, can’t you find one or two girlfriends from there?”</p>



<p>Takeshi: “Don’t be ridiculous. Meeting someone online can be scary.”</p>



<p>Hiro: “Then what’s all that muscle for?”</p>



<p>Tomo: “…Hmm. I was worried that hearing this might make Hiro anxious about various things, but it looks like my concerns were unnecessary.”</p>



<p>Certainly… if this had been a little while ago, I might have felt differently.</p>



<p>I remember being quite shaken when Haruka got hit on during our beach camping trip.</p>



<p>But now, Haruka has even told me she wants to marry me.</p>



<p>Seeing the immense trust she has in me, I can’t bring myself to doubt it.</p>



<p>Haruka loves me, and that’s why I can’t betray her.</p>



<p>As I was reminding myself of this, Shigure finished her shower and came out.</p>



<p>I turned off my smartphone’s screen and went into the bathroom to take my turn.</p>



<p>By the time I was rinsing off in the shower, I had lost all significant interest in the viral commotion.</p>



<p>It’s just an uproar on the internet, irrelevant to our reality. It has no impact on our future. </p>



<p>At least, that’s what I thought. </p>



<p>But it didn’t take long for me to realize how wrong that assumption was.</p>
