<h3>Chapter 29 &ndash; Difference in Power</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“I’ll go next.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, go ahead.”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia stepped forward, and started preparing her magic.</p><p class="calibre2">She just fired a powerful spell, so she would have to build up enough magic energy to fire again. Usually Xena would buy time, but not this time.</p><p class="calibre2">However…</p><p class="calibre2">“If you’re as strong as you say, can you wait until I get my most powerful spell ready?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Celia, as she raised the corners of her mouth in provocation.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufu, fine. I am in a good mood, so I will wait for you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Good…”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia was sure she would wait, but the confident way in which she said it annoyed her.</p><p class="calibre2">(You’re in for a surprise…!)</p><p class="calibre2">Celia thought as she earnestly gathered magic energy. The spell Celia wanted to use was difficult, and required a lot of magic energy, but it was also very strong.</p><p class="calibre2">No monster would get hit by it and survive, but she saw Helvi’s fight with Xena, and how she was completely unscathed, so she assumed even an attack like this would not kill her.</p><p class="calibre2">“Xena, there’s no problem right?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I think so. I can’t imagine Helvi dying to that attack.”</p><p class="calibre2">Even her partner said so.</p><p class="calibre2">She had no choice but to believe, and attack with all she had.</p><p class="calibre2">“Here I go Helvi. Do your best not to die.”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia put her hands forward and fired.</p><p class="calibre2">“Crush! Gravity!”</p><p class="calibre2">Gravity magic.</p><p class="calibre2">It mattered little how hard or big the opponent was, they would be crushed by gravity dozens of times stronger than normal.</p><p class="calibre2">Any monster would be crushed to death.</p><p class="calibre2">Celia had never used it against a human. Not only was it hard to use, but it would certainly reduce the other person to a piece of meat.</p><p class="calibre2">But…</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm, gravity magic. I did not expect anyone in this era to be able to use it.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi stood still as if nothing happened.</p><p class="calibre2">“No way…! It hit…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it did. My body weight is currently around a hundred times more than normal. Of course, I will not say the exact number in front of Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia knew she performed her magic well, and seeing as Helvi said she was a hundred times heavier, she herself also knew she was being affected by it.</p><p class="calibre2">So why was she still standing there, as if nothing happened?</p><p class="calibre2">“You seem surprised to see I have not been defeated, Celia. The answer is simple, it was not powerful enough.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-you’re fine with a hundred times your body weight…?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You would need at least a thousand to make me drop to one knee.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Fu, fufu…”</p><p class="calibre2">Surprisingly, it was Celia who laughed.</p><p class="calibre2">A thousand times was simply impossible. Gravity magic had never reached that level.</p><p class="calibre2">Usually, a fight would be over in a second after she cast this spell, but she had been holding it for several dozens of seconds, and her magic energy was depleted.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh, ahh… It’s no good, I can’t fight.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Me neither. After seeing that, I realized we can’t win.”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia kneeled while breathing heavily, and Xena threw her hands in the air, admitting defeat.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm, I did not have much chance to attack… Allow me to finish this, and punish you at the same time.”</p><p class="calibre2">“D-don’t hurt us too much…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I would not call this painful, rather, you will just suffer a little.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi snapped her fingers, and her two opponents got down to their hands and knees.</p><p class="calibre2">“Guh…! Eh, this is…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-you can use gravity magic too…?”</p><p class="calibre2">It was very difficult to use, and most could not handle it, but Helvi cast it without even needing the time to gather magic energy.</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-you really are as good at magic as you say…”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia could not control her gravity magic, and would most likely kill anyone she would target with it, but Helvi on the other hand, made it so it was only strong enough to make them drop to their hands and knees.</p><p class="calibre2">The difference in their magic ability was very clear.</p><p class="calibre2">“T-this is rough you know…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s alright, I am holding back enough to not break your bones. Bear with it for a few minutes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi while laughing… And the gravity on Xena’s side became stronger.</p><p class="calibre2">“Guhe…! W-why…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I will not let you escape even if you try to make yourself stronger with magic. Be thankful that you made yourself heavier.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Guh. I really can’t move…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Even though she cast steel magic and was trying her hardest to stand up, there was just barely enough pressure to keep her down.</p><p class="calibre2">“Is it over Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes Theo. As you can see, it was an overwhelming victory for me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-Theo, help…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo… I used all my power on that spell… This is going to kill me…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said the two face down, as Theo got closer.</p><p class="calibre2">They thought for sure the kind-hearted Theo would save them by asking Helvi to stop, but…</p><p class="calibre2">“B-bear with it a little more.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh… W-why…”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s your punishment for p-picking a fight with my wife all of a sudden…”</p><p class="calibre2">Everyone was surprised to hear this, and Helvi’s warface disappeared completely.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, but Helvi… Can you make it a little weaker… Hnn!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was feeling more aggressive, probably because she had just finished fighting, and stole Theo’s lips right in front of the other two.</p><p class="calibre2">For the next several minutes, the gravity crushing the two women showed no signs of weakening.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p>
