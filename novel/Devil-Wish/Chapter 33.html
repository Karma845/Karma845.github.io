<h3>Chapter 33: Intertwine × Sisters</h3>

<p>“Haa… such an ugly, tear-streaked face…”</p>



<p>It was 10 o’clock at night, the time when the crowds returning from the fireworks show had all but disappeared. </p>



<p>On the way home from the nearest station, after buying some sweet bread for breakfast at the convenience store and leaving the shop, Shigure sighed deeply while looking at her cellphone’s selfie camera at the entrance.</p>



<p>“It’s just that I can’t help crying, I can’t laugh at you, Onii-san, either.”</p>



<p>In fact, Shigure’s eyes were swollen, and her eyes were bloodshot. But I didn’t think her face looked ugly at all.</p>



<p>“Ah, there’s a bruise on my neck. You were a bit too aggressive, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>“I-It’s not just my fault.”</p>



<p>I retorted to Shigure who protested with a sulky look. It was mutual in that respect.</p>



<p>After that… it surprised even me, but we continued to kiss and hold each other without growing tired of it, doing this and that, until we realized it had gotten so late.</p>



<p>“Really. How much do you love me, huh?”</p>



<p>“Mmm, about ten times more than you love me, Onii-san, I’d say lightly.”</p>



<p>“Hmph… that’s not true.”</p>



<p>“Eh, but I think there’s about that much difference in the number of times we’ve said we love each other.”</p>



<p>Well, that is indeed true. It’s something I feel a bit guilty about.</p>



<p>“But, this kind of thing should be about quality, not quantity. From now on, from now on.”</p>



<p>“Hmm~.”</p>



<p>As I said this, Shigure gave a meaningful smile, clinging to my arm.</p>



<p>“So, I can expect that quality once we get home, right?”</p>



<p>“Heh… once we get back?”</p>



<p>“Oh my? Are you already satisfied, Onii-san? I’m nowhere near satisfied, not in quality or quantity.”</p>



<p>While provocatively speaking, Shigure pressed her body against my arm.</p>



<p>The soft sensation pushing against me brought back the excitement from earlier.</p>



<p>I felt just as unsatisfied as she was.</p>



<p>The place and the preparations hadn’t been right this time. So, that’s it. Despite all our flirting, we hadn’t done the essential thing yet.</p>



<p>“It seems I like you more than you like me, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>“I-I’m not satisfied yet either! Not at all! You better be ready when we get home!”</p>



<p>“Fufufu. I’m expecting that bravado to last until the end♪”</p>



<p>Shigure tightened her grip on my arm with a squeeze. </p>



<p>Her determination not to let me go was clear.</p>



<p>…It seems Shigure had already flipped her switch completely. </p>



<p>And… so had I.</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>What would happen if we returned to our empty house in this state?</p>



<p>…We’d do it. Probably, no, definitely. There was no room for doubt.</p>



<p>Because right now, I really, really want to be intimate with Shigure.</p>



<p>Looking back, I may have never felt this kind of emotion towards Haruka. </p>



<p>It’s not that I disliked Haruka or anything like that. </p>



<p>Men are often said to love sex, that it’s natural for them to be lecherous, or that they are more irresponsible than women. Haruka once lashed out at me, accusing my feelings of being purely physical, but she didn’t understand.</p>



<p>Frankly, men can be scared too.</p>



<p>Scared, because… it’s not that simple to just want to do it, to go through with it.</p>



<p>At least, I feel that way.</p>



<p>The thought always crosses my mind. As a mere student, is it right to be so irresponsible? Not considering the future. Not treasuring her. Just a bastard looking for a physical relationship──</p>



<p>But overcoming such thoughts, the reason I can feel the desire… is none other than because I truly believe that Shigure herself wants it.</p>



<p>Because she has been expressing her love to me without a doubt, all this time.</p>



<p>If Shigure wishes it, then I want to respond with everything I can do.</p>



<p>Because that’s the only way to bring a feeling that can’t promise eternity closer to forever.</p>



<p>As I entertained these thoughts, our house came into view.</p>



<p>My whole body began to sweat with tension.</p>



<p>Every creak of the rusted, hole-ridden iron staircase made my heart beat faster.</p>



<p>And as we went up to the second floor──</p>



<p>“Hiromichi-kun!!”</p>



<p>I froze at the voice of someone who shouldn’t be here, who shouldn’t be sitting in the shadow of the roof in front of the door.</p>



<p>“You finally… came back…”</p>



<p>“Haru… ka…?”</p>



<p>Why was Haruka in front of the house?</p>



<p>She should have been at a meeting with someone from the entertainment industry today, yet here she was, late at night. </p>



<p>The confusion was so overwhelming that I could hardly speak.</p>



<p>On the other hand, upon seeing me, Haruka:</p>



<p>“…Um, I… I…!”</p>



<p>She tried to say something with a tearful voice that was shaking with sobs.</p>



<p>Looking at her, Haruka’s face was a mess, as if she had been crying for hours.</p>



<p>She was always so cheerful.</p>



<p>I knew immediately that something had happened. </p>



<p>But,</p>



<p>“Huh…?”</p>



<p>Before she could speak of that something, she noticed the presence of Shigure standing beside me. Haruka’s expression fell away from her face.</p>



<p>“Why… why is Shigure with Hiromichi-kun…?”</p>



<p>Thus, our story accelerates.</p>



<p>Toward an ending that was all too clear.</p>



<p>Yes, it was clear.</p>



<p>There could be no cheerful, happy ending for the love between me and Shigure.</p>
