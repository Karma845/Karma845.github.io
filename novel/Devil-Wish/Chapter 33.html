<h3>Chapter 33 &ndash; Objective of the Quest</h3>

<p class="calibre2">After the three met up with Theo again, they listened to Fiore as she explained the quest.</p><p class="calibre2">Far away from the town, there were two mountains that were just barely visible. Since they were almost exactly the same height, they were named Twin Mountains.</p><p class="calibre2">The objective of this quest was to deliver two types of rare medicinal herbs. One could be found on the summit of one mountain, and the other on the other mountain.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, we really need Theo for this one.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. We wouldn’t even be able to tell which herbs to bring, let alone how to pick them.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia had a very good grasp on Theo’s abilities, and knew that he could not be outdone when it came to the medicinal herb picking quests that the mercenary guild received.</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo while smiling and trying to hide his embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre2">Seeing this, both lightly pat his head.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, can we?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You were doing it before you asked, were you not?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hahaha, sorry, I forgot.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Me too.”</p><p class="calibre2">Both had completely forgotten they needed Helvi’s permission to touch Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">However, Helvi decided to let it go, since they stopped before she could stop them.</p><p class="calibre2">(I want to pat him too…)</p><p class="calibre2">(You can, as long as it stops at patting.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Ueh!?)</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore suddenly heard Helvi’s voice in her head, responding to her thoughts.</p><p class="calibre2">(D-don’t just read my mind all of a sudden!)</p><p class="calibre2">(I have been reading it all this time.)</p><p class="calibre2">(That’s even worse!)</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore tried to think back to what she had been thinking, and concluded she was probably in the clear.</p><p class="calibre2">(We did kiss this morning. Very passionately as well.)</p><p class="calibre2">(…It’s no use.)</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore slumped forward upon receiving a response to something she thought for a split second.</p><p class="calibre2">She continued explaining the quest.</p><p class="calibre2">There were two notable things to be keep in mind about these mountains.</p><p class="calibre2">First, there were the bandits that lived in the mountain to the right, who had been causing considerable damage. They attacked anyone regardless of age or gender.</p><p class="calibre2">They were one of the reasons for this quest to be unfulfilled.</p><p class="calibre2">“There’s people like that out there?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I didn’t know.”</p><p class="calibre2">The mercenary guild had received this quest half a year ago, meaning the pair that left for the capital a year ago did not know about these bandits.</p><p class="calibre2">“That will not be a problem. I am here after all.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, and we’re here too. Although I think Helvi can deal with them on her own.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I don’t think she’ll need our help.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi completely overwhelmed the pair whose strength was well known even to nobles in the capital.</p><p class="calibre2">Surely some bandits would not be enough to even slow her down.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I’m not worried about the bandits either, but…”</p><p class="calibre2">What worried Fiore was the summit of the mountain to the left, and the rumors of the devil that had settled there.</p><p class="calibre2">“Devil…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Whispered Theo as he peeked towards Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia did not notice this, and only smiled sarcastically at what Fiore said.</p><p class="calibre2">“Devil… That sounds scary, and fishy.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Do devils even exist? They probably meant that it’s as strong or as scary as a devil.”</p><p class="calibre2">Devil.</p><p class="calibre2">Much like the Chimera, it had been known as a legendary being for generations.</p><p class="calibre2">The legend told that long ago, long before the creation of most countries that were around in Theo’s time, a devil exterminated most monsters in the world.</p><p class="calibre2">Most people did not believe this. After all, there were still many, many monsters around.</p><p class="calibre2">This was why unlike the Chimera, the existence of beings known as devils was seen more as something that would appear in a fantastical story than reality.</p><p class="calibre2">However, they were very real, and one stood right next to Xena and Celia.</p><p class="calibre2">She had not told anyone, but Helvi was indeed a devil.</p><p class="calibre2">The previous night, after Xena and Celia left, she let out her horns and wings.</p><p class="calibre2">Remembering what happened next made Theo’s face feel a little warm, before he told himself it was not the time to be thinking about such things.</p><p class="calibre2">(The word devil is used as a figurative expression to describe something scary and strong, but the real thing…)</p><p class="calibre2">No one knew how many devils there were, but if there really was a devil living on the mountain to the left, it would have probably been as strong as the one Theo had summoned to be his wife.</p><p class="calibre2">(Is what Theo is thinking, but I wonder…)</p><p class="calibre2">Thought Helvi as she read Theo’s thoughts.</p><p class="calibre2">She had been alive for a long, long time, but she had never heard of any devils besides herself.</p><p class="calibre2">She had heard of monsters being called devils by humans, but she found them to be incredibly weak compared to her.</p><p class="calibre2">She was convinced that the same thing was happening this time as well.</p><p class="calibre2">(Even if it is real, I am the strongest, and I will not let it put a single scratch on Theo.)</p><p class="calibre2">Theo looked up with a concerned expression, but Helvi reassured him with a smile and a pat on the head. He could not help but be fixated in this tender smile.</p><p class="calibre2">Seeing Theo’s face become red, Helvi thought of something, and communicated with Fiore directly through her mind.</p><p class="calibre2">(Fiore, I want you to promise something.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Y-yes, what is it?)</p><p class="calibre2">(Never, no matter what, tell Theo I can read minds.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Eh? Why?)</p><p class="calibre2">(If you do, he will stop telling me these pure and adorable things straight through his mind, and I very much enjoy seeing this.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Y-yes… Alright.)</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore promised, although she was not sure she understood.</p><p class="calibre2"></p>
