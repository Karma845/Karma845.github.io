<h1>Chapter 11: Side Story: The Prince Receives a Confession</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikaido’s POV</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few days have passed since summer vacation. On this day as well, I had been regular for the basketball club practice since the morning. I can’t just get excited about my trip to Okinawa and slack off on club activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of the ball bouncing and the voices of the club members echoed through the heated gymnasium. Since the tournament is so close, everyone is so serious that it’s hard to believe it’s a friendly match. This year, with the addition of Yui-chan, they are probably hoping that they will be able to make it through the regional tournament. I am one of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for your hard work! You worked up a good sweat today too! Drinking soda after a hard workout is the best!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While talking like a middle-aged man, Yui-chan gulps down the soda she bought. Even after the day’s practice, the sun still hadn’t set so it was hot. Yet, it was a little better to be outside because I was exposed to the breeze directly as compared to the overheated gymnasium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though you’re sweating so much, Nikaido-senpai still smells as good as you did in the morning. Could you tell me your secret?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not like I’m doing anything special. The deodorant I use is the same as Yui-chan’s. I wonder if it’s just your imagination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh… I wonder if Nikaido-senpai is in the same race as Kaede-nee. Even if she doesn’t do anything special, she’s beautiful. Her boobs get bigger, she loses weight. God is so unfair!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan curses as she sips the soda again. It seems that half of her complaints are due to resentment about her breasts. I wish I could be like Kazuha-san. Then by now—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nikaido-senpai, thank you for your hard work at practice!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? Ah, Yasaka-kun. Thank you for your hard work. How do you find the experience of your first summer? Are you enjoying it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Yui-chan’s classmate, Yasaka-kun, who pulled me up from my thoughts, which seemed to be sinking forever. He looks like a puppy as he runs towards me with a friendly smile. I also have a younger brother who is in junior high school, so I just want to take care of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha… I want to enjoy it to the fullest, but lately, I’ve been practicing hard before the tournament…and when I get home, I’m in a rush. Actually, I want to go out and have more fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry to hear that, Yasaka-kun. Nikaido-senpai and I will be relaxing on a trip to Okinawa starting next week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The secret trip to Okinawa was suddenly revealed. Hearing this, Yasaka-kun dropped the bag he was wearing on his shoulder. His face seemed to be devoid of any spirit, are you okay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Miyamoto-san. Did you say you were going to Okinawa with Nikaido-senpai? Does that mean Nikaido-senpai will be wearing a swimsuit?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As Yasaka-kun imagined, it’s not just Nikaido-senpai, Kaede-nee, Otsuki-senpai, and of course, I’ll be in a swimsuit too! What do you think? Aren’t you jealous?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don’t want to see Miyamoto-san in a swimsuit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about my body, you jerk!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Yasaka-kun hadn’t said anything like that, he was unreasonably attacked by Yui-chan’s bag in the face. But for him, the pain seemed to be no more than a mosquito bite. As he took Yui-chan’s hand, he was breathing heavily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m asking you to do me the favor of a lifetime, Miyamoto-san. No, Miyamoto-sama. Please take a photo of Nikaido-senpai in a swimsuit! Thank you very much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, Yasaka-kun. These things are meaningless in front of the person herself, don’t you think? I’m still embarrassed to wear a swimsuit in front of Yoshizumi. I’m still wondering what I should do concerning that, but I honestly don’t want to be photographed and have that in the hands of a third party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exactly. That’s what you’re not good at, Yasaka-kun. Instead of wanting a photo, you should invite Nikaido-senpai to the pool, to the beach, to a summer festival, or anything else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute, Yui-chan. Why would Yasaka-kun invite me? Even if he invited me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right…if you ask me, Miyamoto-san is right! It’s better to see the real thing than to see it in photos!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yasaka-kun looked like he was in a blind spot, but I think it would be more fun if he went with Yui-chan and his classmates instead of inviting me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. If I’m going somewhere with someone, like going to the beach or a summer festival, I want to go with Nikaido-senpai and no one else!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yasaka-kun said that while looking straight at me with his face turning bright red. So why do you want to go with me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe. I look like an intruder, so please excuse me. You two should take your time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, wait a minute— Ah…already. You’re running away fast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, Yui-chan turned into the wind and ran away. Sighing, I timidly turned my attention to Yasaka-kun and found that his expression remained serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nikaido-senpai…I told you before, right? The reason I chose Meiwadai High School was because I admired you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, that’s what he said. Just when Yasaka-kun was about to tell me the reason he admired me, Yui-chan had come so I couldn’t listen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I remember you saw them playing when you came to tour the school, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, but I admired Nikaido-senpai’s appearance after the game. In that game, Meiwadai High School was completely defeated. Everyone else was smiling and cheering for you but Nikaido-senpai wasn’t smiling. You were the only one who was biting your lips in frustration.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The match that Yasaka-kun saw was a memorable one for me as well. Well, if anything, what happened after this match is more deeply etched in my mind as a memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“While everyone was accepting defeat, the sight of only one person being regretful was so fleeting, yet so cool… It was love at first sight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“—What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What did he just say? Is it love at first sight? Before I could ask him back, he spoke smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why I liked Nikaido-senpai even before I entered the school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the setting sun behind him, Yasaka-kun said with a gentle smile on his lips but with a serious look in his eyes. My body and mind froze at this sudden confession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yasaka-kun…I…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why I’d be happy if we could go somewhere during summer vacation! Well then, Nikaido-senpai. Thank you for your hard work today!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, Yasaka-kun ran away from me like a gale. I was left alone and looked at him in a daze.</span></p>
