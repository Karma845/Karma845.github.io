<h3>Chapter 11 &ndash; Taste</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“So…? How does it taste…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo fearfully peeked at Helvi’s face.</p><p class="calibre2">His cheeks were flushed and his forehead was sweaty.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… It is great.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi as she continued to eat the food presented to her.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s unsure expression turned into a bright one, and he wiped away the sweat that had become hot due to the fire he was using to cook.</p><p class="calibre2">“Great! This is the meat and potato stew that grandma taught me! It has a lot of meat and a strong flavor, but I’m glad you like it!”</p><p class="calibre2">“It really is good. I could eat this every day.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi said with a smile as they ate the miso soup they made together.</p><p class="calibre2">It was the best smile she had on her face since coming back to this world.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo stopped eating and was completely entranced looking at her. His face became red for a different reason than earlier.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What is it Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, no… I was just thinking that you really are beautiful…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Wha…!”</p><p class="calibre2">It was Helvi’s turn to blush.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo had never really had a girlfriend before, and had no idea how to compliment a woman, so all he could do was say what was on his mind.</p><p class="calibre2">But Helvi read his heart. She was not reading it all the time, but after reading it once, she knew his heart was pure and he did not lie, and because of this, Theo saying how he felt in such a direct way had an immediate effect on her.</p><p class="calibre2">The room became silent, and neither touched their food.</p><p class="calibre2">They were sitting facing each other. They looked at each other, and saw the other’s face become red…</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufu…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Haha…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Both started laughing.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let us eat.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">It was different than the usual fooling around. The atmosphere around them was not unlike a happy family’s.</p><p class="calibre2">After they finished eating, they washed the dishes together.</p><p class="calibre2">“Like this?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes!”</p><p class="calibre2">A devil like Helvi had never done housework, so it was her first time washing dishes.</p><p class="calibre2">She was clumsy at first, but soon got used to it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Here.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo cleaned with a sponge, and passed them to Helvi so she could wipe away the water.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a smooth operation, and it ended in no time. Both took a deep breath.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh… It’s still lunch time, but I’m tired…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you? Ah, because you worked so hard cooking?”</p><p class="calibre2">“That too, but that Chimera…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Did you do anything to make you tired? The way I see it, you just went there and came back.”</p><p class="calibre2">“The way there was very mentally taxing.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was sure that the monster was unbeatable, and that they were facing certain death.</p><p class="calibre2">In reality, Theo did nothing, and he really just went there and came back.</p><p class="calibre2">When they approached the sleeping Chimera, he really thought he was about to die, and he saw his grandparents waving beside it.</p><p class="calibre2">He was not physically tired, but mentally, he felt as though he died once that day.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. I’m sorry. Would you like me to take away your exhaustion?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, take away my exhaustion… Like with a massage?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Something like that. Lie down.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo laid face down on an old sofa, and Helvi straddled him.</p><p class="calibre2">“Am I too heavy?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No. No problem.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmph, you were supposed to say I am light.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, s-sorry. I didn’t mean to say you were heavy but I could deal with it…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“I understand, there is no need to become so flustered. That just arouses more suspicion.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo became embarrassed and frustrated by his responses but above him, Helvi happily smiled.</p><p class="calibre2">She welcomed this behavior, as it meant that he was not used to going out with girls.</p><p class="calibre2">She was using magic to make her body lighter, so there was no way Theo would find her heavy. She simply wanted to see Theo become flustered.</p><p class="calibre2">(Ah… Cute cute. Showing me that unguarded back… A few thousand years ago that would have been enough for me to die right here. It feels harder than I thought on my butt…)</p><p class="calibre2">Theo could not see it, but Helvi had a pretty dangerous expression on her face,</p><p class="calibre2">Her face was red, the corners of her mouth were rising, and she could not stop grinning.</p><p class="calibre2">Her eyes looked like ones of a beast chasing its prey.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi? Are you going to give me a massage…?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Ah, yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi just barely managed to hold something back, and stopped herself from drooling.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m rolling up your shirt.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, ah, yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi exposed his back, and placed her left palm on it.</p><p class="calibre2">And then…</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… It feels like my body is getting warmer from the back. It’s nice…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo with a listless voice, as he felt the strength slipping out of his entire body.</p><p class="calibre2">“I can manipulate and stimulate the magic energy in one’s body. One wrong move and you would explode, but I can heal you in this manner without letting such a thing happen.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh… It feels nice…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh, did you not hear me?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo did not hear the incredibly frightening words that came out of Helvi’s mouth, and she continued.</p><p class="calibre2">“Nfuu, ah, ahh… Hnn…”</p><p class="calibre2">(Why are you moaning…! Do you wish me to attack you…!?)</p><p class="calibre2">With her hand still placed on Theo’s back, Helvi started writhing, but no one was there to see it.</p></div>
