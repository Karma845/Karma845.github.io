<h3>Chapter 19 &ndash; After the Bath</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Helvi got out of the bathtub, snapped her fingers to get rid of the moisture, and the water on her body and her slightly wet hair was completely gone. She looked as though she did not take a bath at all.</p><p class="calibre2">This was simple for her, so she did not need to go out of her way to use a towel.</p><p class="calibre2">Her clothes also appeared when she simply wished for it. Since she was going to sleep, she put on a black negligee, which exposed her cleavage and, since it was short, her beautiful legs as well.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a very provocative image for Theo, who only started having sexual thoughts that day.</p><p class="calibre2">(If this excites him even a little bit, I’ll be happy.)</p><p class="calibre2">She was doing it on purpose.</p><p class="calibre2">She left the bathroom and headed towards the living room, where Theo sat on his heels.</p><p class="calibre2">Was he trying to purify his mind?</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, I’m back. The bath was very good.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, y-yes, that’s great. Then it’s my turn.</p><p class="calibre2">When he looked at what Helvi was wearing, his eyes were wide open with surprise, before he quickly turned away.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo stood up, passed right by Helvi, and left the living room, but she noticed something. Helvi’s kinetic vision could not be compared with the average person’s, so there was no way she would miss it.</p><p class="calibre2">(…It’s bulging…!)</p><p class="calibre2">To be more precise, it was that spot on a man.</p><p class="calibre2">When Theo passed by Helvi, his cheeks were red, he was hunching forward, and he was trying to hold it back with his hands.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi stood still until the sound of Theo’s footsteps became distant and she heard the door close.</p><p class="calibre2">(What was that what was that!? Was that it!? Theo’s mind started racing and made it get up…! Ah, cute, too cute…! I want to gobble him up right now…!)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi laid on the sofa and started squirming.</p><p class="calibre2">She was sitting at first, but decided it was easier to smell Theo’s lingering scent from this position.</p><p class="calibre2">Looking at it from the outside, she was simply a pervert.</p><p class="calibre2">(Can I endure and have patience? In a way, this is torture. Placing such deliciously ripe fruit in front of me, and telling me I cannot eat it…)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi usually had not much need for patience, which was obvious considering she was a demon.</p><p class="calibre2">(I decided I would… But this is not easy at all. At some point I am going to lose it and attack him. I need to vent somehow…)</p><p class="calibre2">And then, she heard the bathroom door open. It seemed Theo was getting out.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi thought it was fast. Was Theo too quick to get out of the bath, or did she spend longer than she thought squirming? No one knew.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh… It’s late.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo entered the living room, drying himself with a towel. He had no way to instantly dry himself like Helvi, so his hair was still rather wet.</p><p class="calibre2">His charming black hair seemed even fresher when wet</p><p class="calibre2">He was wearing the pajamas he had worn for many years, and since it was loose around the neck, Helvi could peek into his chest.</p><p class="calibre2">(Kuh… Is he inviting me!?)</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was not like Helvi, and was not doing so purposefully at all, but this lack of awareness made him more vulnerable.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s eyes would not miss it.</p><p class="calibre2">Every opening. Every time Theo moved, a new opening appeared for Helvi to peek at, obviously in a sexual sense, not in a combat sense.</p><p class="calibre2">(I can’t take it…)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi casually got up from the sofa, approached Theo, and grabbed his shoulders.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-What is it? Are you feeling sick?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was confused at first, but he became worried about her health, and looked up at her with concern.</p><p class="calibre2">Perhaps it was only because he had just taken a bath, but he smelled nice.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s kiss.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…What?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo asked, but he heard very well.</p><p class="calibre2">“K-k-kiss?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Is that a problem?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi could not control herself, and pressed him.</p><p class="calibre2">She did not press him very hard, but the difference in height and strength meant Theo started moving back.</p><p class="calibre2">“T-that… Babies…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I told you did I not? It is impossible to make babies by kissing.”</p><p class="calibre2">“R-really? So the stork…?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Will not come. I guarantee it.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo kept walking backwards, until he hit a wall.</p><p class="calibre2">With Theo’s back against a wall, Helvi placed her left hand next to his face.</p><p class="calibre2">If the receptionists from the guild were present, they would be in hysterics about this so called ‘kabedon’.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo, embarrassed, looked down, but Helvi grabbed his chin and pulled it up, forcing him to look her in the eye.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Can we?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, h-hum…”</p><p class="calibre2">His eyes went left and right. He looked up, and with cloudy eyes said…</p><p class="calibre2">“…You want to kiss me…?”</p><p class="calibre2">These words obliterated Helvi’s reasoning power.</p></div>
