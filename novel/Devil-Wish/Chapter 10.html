<h1>Chapter 10: The Reward For Your Hard Work Is A Sweater That Slays Virgins</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the final exam, I ranked fifth in my grade. The highest ever, since I entered high school and due to this I was able to enter summer vacation in my best mood. We decided to go on a trip to Okinawa in early August to avoid the Obon holiday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TN: Obon or just Bon is a Japanese Buddhist custom to honor the spirits of one’s ancestors. ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s still about a week left, but I need to start packing slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m glad that Yuya-kun is looking forward to the trip to Okinawa, but I have to reward him for ranking higher than the last test of his first year!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede smiles like a little devil charming people. She doesn’t think of smart things at times like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m happy enough with that feeling, so it’s fine, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I considered showing off the swimsuit I bought the other day ahead of time, but I figured the ocean would be a good location for that, so I gave this reward a lot of thought.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is that so? Are you completely ignoring the fact that I’m holding back? Of course, I’m happy to be rewarded for my hard work, but please refrain from giving me a massage in a school swimsuit. That was too stimulating for a healthy high school boy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry. I thought you would say that since you’re like a little bird. Yuya-kun, so I prepared something different this time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede puffs out her chest with a smug look on her face. Does that mean it’s the same as or better than a school swimsuit? It seems scary beyond expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, Kaede. I think I don’t need a reward…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe. Can you say the same thing after I announce what the reward is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede gave me a fearless smile, and an electric current ran from my spine to my brain. I have high hopes whether I agree or not. What on earth did you prepare, Kaede?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuya-kun is getting excited too. Now, please wait a moment while I prepare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, Kaede left the living room. My state of mind alone is that of a poor herbivore captured by the king of beasts. Even if I run away, I will be eaten easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Calm down. Calm down, me. Remember what you’ve been through. Every time someone tries something, it’s always in the bath.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The surprise attack when she showed off her natural appearance in a bath towel, and the time when she gave me a massage in a swimsuit, both happened in the bath. But this is my first time in the living room. If that were the case, there would be no more sensational appearance than at that time. As I said this to myself, I took deep breaths over and over again to calm my pounding heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About five minutes later, I heard the sound of the door opening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for waiting, Yuya-kun! This is your reward!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Kaede!? Are those clothes by any chance—!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. This is the popular ‘virgin-slaying sweater’’!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Warm gray high-neck knit sweater. It’s sleeveless and has a sensational design, but that’s not the true value of this equipment. What is truly frightening is the bold O-shaped space that spreads across the chest. As a result, most of Kaede’s voluptuous fruits are exposed, and you can easily imagine their fluffy texture without even touching them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, the length is perfect, barely concealing the forbidden flower garden, and generously showing off her slender, supple, and lustrous legs that are worthy of being a national treasure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It may be out of season, but if you just wear this one, it’ll be cool and perfect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she spun around on the spot, Kaede’s pure and beautiful back caught his eye. The ribbon string hanging loosely around her waist makes her look cute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether I look from the front or the back, there’s nowhere to look. I couldn’t deflect and was glued to Kaede.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re smart, Yuya-kun, so I’m sure you’ve noticed that I’m not wearing any under this right now. That’s why it’s so hot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t need that information, I didn’t want to hear it! In fact, it’s obvious from the O-shaped space that she’s not wearing a bra, but she isn’t even wearing her underwear underneath?! That’s not good, Kaede!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe! What’s the matter with you? Why are you being silent, Yuya-kun? Your eyes are also twitching, aren’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, no…because Kaede’s outfit is too…like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gravure idols in magazines run away barefoot, but if she stands in front of me wearing sensual clothes that arouse my lust, I’ll forget what she’s saying, let alone how she’s breathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unaware of me, Kaede slowly approached me and sat on my lap while I was sitting on the sofa, putting her arms around my neck and straddling me a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bought it because I wanted Yuya-kun to be happy with it. What do you think? Does it suit me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, of course…it suits you so well it’s almost scary. Thanks to you, I’m struggling to stay sane.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m glad to hear that. Hey, Yuya-kun. Did you know there’s another way to wear this virgin-slaying sweater?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede whispers sweetly in her ear while licking her tongue. Is there another way to wear it? What does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wear it with the front and back reversed. I put the open back side in the front and just hid the important parts with ribbon strings. What do you think? Don’t you think it’s more provocative?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She bit my earlobe, and I twisted my body and let out a silent scream. At the same time, I ruminate over Kaede’s words in my head and visualize them. It was a figure that was as close to naked as possible, but more glamorous than naked. If you are approached in such a manner—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Will Yuya-kun’s inner wolf wake up? But it seems like it’s enough as it is now. I think it’s time for one more push.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the sofa, where there is no escape, the tightness of the two mounds increases as if they are pressed against each other. The comfortable temperature and soft, squishy texture stimulate my brain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Yuya-kun. It’s okay if you don’t hold back and eat my fruit. Would you like to see if it’s soft and sweet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──────!!??”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is truly the devil’s temptation. It’s the devil’s hammer that annihilates the angel who pleads with him that he must take care of Kaede-san with one blow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“K-Kaede…I…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Or, Yuya-kun, would you rather have the deep, sweet, adult kiss that you didn’t have at the hot springs that time? Even when you took a bubble bath, you lost consciousness during the most important part, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Spring break a few months ago. At the inn where we greeted Kaede’s parents, Kaede and I took a bath together. There, Kaede asked me to have an adult kiss with her, but Kaede was so beautiful and bewitching that I unconsciously lost consciousness. Are you trying to get revenge for that time?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rather, it’s because it’s now. Besides… I’m working hard too, you know? That’s why I want a reward for that. Hey, it’s okay, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Kaede slowly brings his face closer to her while whispering that she didn’t hear the answer. Just when I was about to accept her sweet temptation───</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">~Chime! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chime rang to announce the arrival of a visitor. Who could it be?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I apologize for the trouble I have caused you.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The visitor was Miyamoto-san. And in his hand, for some reason, was a folded candy. He bowed deeply when he opened the door, apologizing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede, by the way, had changed from her sweater to the clothes she was originally wearing. Of course, I’m not going to respond to her in that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard the story from my daughter Yui. It seems that I did something that disturbed you all…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Miyamoto-san heard from Yui-chan that she was going on a trip to Okinawa with us. We didn’t mind, we thought it would be nice to make things more lively, but Miyamoto-san seemed to be bothered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m really sorry…that my daughter didn’t read the situation and insisted on going with you when you all were supposed to be making memories with your schoolmates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please raise your head, Miyamoto-san. We’d rather Yui-chan come with us. Isn’t that right, Yuya-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kaede is right. Instead of being a nuisance, Yui-chan’s presence makes the place more lively, so much so that we’d rather ask her to come with us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s the case, that’s fine, but…I also heard that she will tag along with the two of you. I’m worried that she’s causing trouble for you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe. Don’t worry, Miyamoto-san. Even though we’re together, it’s just the way to the station, and it’s lively and fun. Isn’t that right, Yuya-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kaede is right. We don’t mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan is like a little sister to Kaede. That means she’s like a little sister to me too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. I am relieved to hear you both say so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, don’t worry. So please don’t be too angry with Yui-chan, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will take good care of that… If I stay any longer, I will be disturbing the two of you. I apologize for the late visit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a deep bow, Miyamoto-san left. I thought Miyamoto-san’s parenting policy was a little too strict. He was going out of his way to apologize for something that was of no concern to us. Not to mention he brought sweet candy with him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can’t be helped. It’s not as bad as Yuya-kun, whose parents suddenly disappeared one day and left him with only debts, but I heard that Miyamoto-san also went through quite a hard time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I learned that my parents disappeared, leaving me with debts, I was surprised, saddened, and unspeakably lonely. But Kaede helped me before I was trapped by it, so I am able to live happily now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It seems that Miyamoto-san has been with my family ever since my grandfather. He has been loyal to my family. I think that’s why he couldn’t stand to be there when he thought his daughter Yui-chan was causing trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t have to worry about it,” Kaede said with a wry smile. That’s right. As those involved, we don’t think of Yui-chan as a nuisance. Miyamoto-san’s worries were unfounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuya-kun thought the same thing, so I was relieved. And…haha. I’m also happy to be able to live with Yuya-kun like this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede jumps into my chest vigorously with a plop. I wish she would stop the sudden dive since it’s dangerous, but such complaints quickly fizzle out before the feel of Kaede’s soft fruit and her comforting scent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, let’s get back on track and continue where we left off! Tonight is the night I will break Yuya-kun’s stronghold!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, my rational mind has come to its senses now. I’m going to get ready for bed, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh no! I’m not going to let you do that.</span></p>
