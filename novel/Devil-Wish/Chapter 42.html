<h3>Chapter 42 &ndash; Tent</h3>

<p class="calibre2">For dinner, Helvi brought down the bird that she hunted.</p><p class="calibre2">Although they were having the same thing they had for lunch, it tasted completely different thanks to Theo’s expert seasoning, so they did not mind eating the same thing again.</p><p class="calibre2">With their stomachs full, it was certain they would have a good night’s sleep, but then…</p><p class="calibre2">“We only have two tents. Do you mind sharing one, Helvi and Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was completely unprepared for Xena’s question.</p><p class="calibre2">“M-me and Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">They lived under the same roof, but never shared the same bed.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi wanted to sleep with him, but Theo was embarrassed. He assumed they would be sleeping separately that night, as usual.</p><p class="calibre2">“Can’t the three of you sleep in one tent…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo felt bad about wanting to hog one tent, but also felt it was the least stressful option.</p><p class="calibre2">“The tents aren’t that spacious, so they’re just right for two people.”</p><p class="calibre2">But Celia’s response shattered Theo’s hopes.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not like Theo detested the idea of sleeping together or anything, it was just that he felt he had to prepare himself mentally and sort out his feelings first.</p><p class="calibre2">(S-sleeping in the same tent as Helvi all of a sudden…! I’d be too nervous to sleep…!)</p><p class="calibre2">As Celia said before, the tents were not very spacious. If one of them rolled over in their sleep, their bodies would touch.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was the type that rolled over in his sleep a lot.</p><p class="calibre2">He could hold her hand, but the thought of touching anything else…</p><p class="calibre2">Theo peeked over at Helvi’s body, and his face immediately felt warmer.</p><p class="calibre2">(Uu… I really can’t…!”)</p><p class="calibre2">Theo tried to hide face by facing down, and since it was already dark, Xena and Celia could not see it.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi however, could not only see his face, but also read his mind.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What’s wrong Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Nothing.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi turned away, as Xena was close enough to perhaps be able to see her face becoming red, even though it was dark.</p><p class="calibre2">(Ah, cute…! It’s alright Theo, you can touch. It matters little if it is intentional or not. Actually, I would be happier if it was intentional… Wait, I could touch him and act as though it was an accident…!)</p><p class="calibre2">Both husband and wife’s faces were red, but for very different reasons.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, do you have a problem with sleeping with Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-no, not a problem…! I-it’s just embarrassing…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright. Then how about you sleep with us, like we used…”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena suddenly stopped, as she felt something cold on the back of her neck.</p><p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Helvi’s index finger was touching it. It was just a finger, but to Xena, it felt like an unsheathed blade.</p><p class="calibre2">“You better get ready for what comes next if you finish that sentence.”</p><p class="calibre2">These were the words that were whispered to Xena.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo and Celia could not hear them. but Celia could more or less guess what was said.</p><p class="calibre2">However, only the one to whom those words were meant could feel how terrifying they were.</p><p class="calibre2">“J-joking aside, you really should sleep with Helvi! Absolutely! You’re married, so it really is a no-brainer!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Hmph, yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi took her finger off Xena’s neck, who finally let out a sigh of relief as she watched Helvi move towards Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I guess…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, can you sleep with me?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, hum, but I move a lot in my sleep…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo embarrassingly, and Helvi did her best not to say that just made things better for her.</p><p class="calibre2">“…I do as well, so we are the same.”</p><p class="calibre2">When Helvi slept, she did not move a single centimeter, but if she said the opposite… It would be easier to create ‘accidents’.</p><p class="calibre2">“A-alright then…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufu, you are too nervous, Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I mean…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi moved closer to Theo’s face, and whispered.</p><p class="calibre2">“We could even sleep in the same bed every night from now on.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s face was completely red, and Helvi looked forward to going to sleep that night with extreme excitement.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I thought I was about to die…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“What are you doing? You know you shouldn’t upset her.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’ve never felt so close to death… I think I saw my parents waving at me from heaven.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Your parents are alive, aren’t they?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, that’s right, they are.”</p><p class="calibre2">Behind Helvi and Theo, the two women talked about Xena’s near-death experience.</p>
