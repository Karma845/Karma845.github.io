<h3>Chapter 60 &ndash; Gold and Dust</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Helvi said no without a second thought, and the devil man was lost for words.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-why…? If your memories are back, you should know that hell is much better than this world, and devils are several degrees above lowly humans!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hm, yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">In the past thousands of years, Helvi came to understand very well how weak humans were.</p><p class="calibre2">They were most definitely weaker than devils, and while there were some stronger ones such as Xena and Celia, the vast majority was even weaker than the lowest class of devils.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, many were fools, such as the mercenaries that belittled Theo, and were too self-centered to see the true nature of things.</p><p class="calibre2">The organizations known as countries were also deeply flawed.</p><p class="calibre2">People with no talent or ability rose to the top simply due to their bloodline, and many oppressed the population.</p><p class="calibre2">Thinking about it this way, it was obvious that a place like hell where power was enough to rise to the top was much better.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi had the power to annihilate royalty and nobility even if they all attacked her at once.</p><p class="calibre2">So why would she refuse to return?</p><p class="calibre2">The devil man could not comprehend it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Is it that small human? Someone as powerful as…”</p><p class="calibre2">The man suddenly stopped talking, as Helvi stuck her foot in his throat as he still kneeled, and swung it.</p><p class="calibre2">“If you were human you would be dead, but I see it is fine, since you are a devil.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Gah…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">The man’s neck was barely still attached, but since he was a devil, he did not die. With some time, it would regenerate.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi cleaned the man’s blood off her foot with magic.</p><p class="calibre2">“I could not care less how much you want me to return to hell and be king.”</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed he truly worshiped her and wanted her to be his king, but…</p><p class="calibre2">“You insulted and hurt my husband, and I will never forgive you. I have never been so furious.”</p><p class="calibre2">Although her expression was blank, the man was hit with intense bloodlust.</p><p class="calibre2">He could not move a single finger. His regeneration stopped and blood flowed freely from his neck, but he had no time to even feel pain.</p><p class="calibre2">His plan to convince Helvi failed the moment he thought to kidnap and kill the person that formed a contract with her, and his fate was sealed when he made the assumption that a devil like Helvi could not seriously love that human.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-why him… Why so much…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">But still, he could not help but find it strange.</p><p class="calibre2">From his point of view, the peak of power and a boy with no redeeming qualities could not be farther from a good match.</p><p class="calibre2">“You are brave to be saying that, although I can read your mind anyway.”</p><p class="calibre2">The man unconsciously insulted Theo further in his mind, making her even angrier.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, Theo is weak, even compared to other humans.”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-then…!”</p><p class="calibre2">For devils, power was everything.</p><p class="calibre2">Even when picking a romantic partner, it was only natural to go after someone strong.</p><p class="calibre2">If someone as strong as Helvi went to hell, she could surround herself with the strongest men around.</p><p class="calibre2">“I have not even the slightest interest in that. I see no point in surrounding myself with people weaker than me.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi responded coldly as she peeked into the man’s heart.</p><p class="calibre2">“But if that’s the case, that boy…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The man failed to finish his sentence once again, this time because his throat was burned with magic.</p><p class="calibre2">His vocal cords were burnt and he could not breathe, let alone speak.</p><p class="calibre2">“…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Do not speak any further, you’re annoying. You will say nothing more until you die.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi as she looked down on the man rolling on the ground while grabbing his throat.</p><p class="calibre2">“You, or rather, other devils besides myself would not understand. In front of Theo… I become just a woman.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s fury subsided a little.</p><p class="calibre2">Her face became a little red, and a happy, gentle smile could be seen on her face.</p><p class="calibre2">“Being the king of hell has no value in comparison to Theo’s cuteness. Gold and dust become the same. Theo’s cuteness is worth more than gold, and becoming the king of hell is like dust to me in comparison.”</p><p class="calibre2">If Theo was there, he would surely be troubled by Helvi comparing him to gold or becoming king of a world.</p><p class="calibre2">Surely he saw himself beneath all of it.</p><p class="calibre2">But to Helvi, Theo stood above all of it.</p><p class="calibre2">Even Helvi herself was a little surprised by how big of a being he had become inside of her, although she was not the least bit bothered by it.</p><p class="calibre2">(I was never this crazy about something, even when I was in hell. Theo… I…)</p><p class="calibre2">She stopped, as she figured she should say it to him directly.</p><p class="calibre2">She held back those happy feelings, and looked at the trash in front of her.</p><p class="calibre2">The man’s throat was almost healed, so Helvi burned it again.</p><p class="calibre2">“…!!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Did you think I would let it heal if you stayed quiet? Do you think I will let you go?”</p><p class="calibre2">Devils were living beings.</p><p class="calibre2">No matter how strong they were, and even though they could regenerate, they could still die.</p><p class="calibre2">The man would accept death if it meant Helvi would be king, but that would not be the case. All that remained was the despair of death.</p><p class="calibre2">“It is very fortunate that I recovered my memories of hell, because it means I also remember hell’s torture techniques. I will show you true hell. Do not think you will die easily.”</p><p class="calibre2">When the man looked up with his face painted with fear, he saw a real devil.</p><p class="calibre2"></p>
