<h3>Chapter 17 &ndash; First night?</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“Ah, welcome back Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I’m back Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">When Helvi returned, Theo was still washing dishes, which was only natural, considering how much food he made.</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you need my help?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I’m almost done.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo washed the last plate, dried his hands, and turned around.</p><p class="calibre2">When he did so, he was a little surprised to see Helvi right next to him.</p><p class="calibre2">He looked up and saw her slightly red face, and she placed her hand on his cheek.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi? What is it?”</p><p class="calibre2">She caressed his cheek, and it tickled a little, so he lightly flinched.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-hum…”</p><p class="calibre2">When that hand was reaching the neck… Helvi pulled back.</p><p class="calibre2">“…I-I apologize for doing that suddenly. There was water on your cheek.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, I get it. Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo thanked Helvi, who said yes in return and turned away, which Theo thought was strange, but then remembered something.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, the bath isn’t ready. I’ll go do it now, just wait a second.”</p><p class="calibre2">He said before leaving the living room.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Ahh…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi sighed as she saw him leave.</p><p class="calibre2">“How should I approach this ‘first night’?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was impatient. After all, she said all that to Fiore, but…</p><p class="calibre2">It was her first time experiencing such a ‘first night’, and what was to happen on this night was going to be a first for both of them as well…</p><p class="calibre2">(Hold on. This is Theo’s first time right…?)</p><p class="calibre2">No one knew about her better than herself, so she could say with confidence that this was her first time, but she had no guarantee that the same could be said for Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">(Remember all the information you received when the contract was formed!)</p><p class="calibre2">This information was important. If it was not Theo’s first time… She would not do anything in particular, but deep down she would be sad.</p><p class="calibre2">She nervously dug for information inside Theo’s memories…</p><p class="calibre2">(Nothing. Great…)</p><p class="calibre2">She breathed a sigh of relief as she wiped away her cold sweat.</p><p class="calibre2">She found no information about a ‘first time’ inside of Theo’s memories.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi received information about memories that left a deep impression on Theo, and if Theo did have a ‘first time’, its memories would certainly be there.</p><p class="calibre2">(But now a new problem arises..!)</p><p class="calibre2">Theo Asper, fourteen.</p><p class="calibre2">Had almost no sexual knowledge!</p><p class="calibre2">It may seem obvious because he lived with an elderly couple, but it was still too little.</p><p class="calibre2">(Could it be that he never even had his… semenarche..!?)</p><p class="calibre2">It seems he did when he was thirteen, but it happened while he was asleep and he did not know what happened.</p><p class="calibre2">He simply thought he had wet the bed, and it was an embarrassing memory for him.</p><p class="calibre2">(This is bad… I had no idea Theo’s sexual knowledge was so lacking.)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi had no experience at all, but she did have knowledge. Theo on the other hand, had neither.</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed impossible for such a pure couple to have its ‘first night’.</p><p class="calibre2">“What now…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi thought and thought, and eventually made a decision.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi, the bath is ready.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo returned to the living room, and Helvi grabbed his shoulders.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, w-what?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo looked at her with surprise, and she said…</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s study!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…What?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi pushed Theo down to the sofa. He was too taken aback to resist, but a question mark popped on top of his head.</p><p class="calibre2">“Study what?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You’ll see.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi crossed her arms in front of Theo and moved back and forth, wondering where to start.</p><p class="calibre2">“I know… First of all, do you know how babies are made?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, b-babies?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s face was red, and he turned away after peeking at Helvi’s face.</p><p class="calibre2">He then put his hands between his thighs and started fidgeting.</p><p class="calibre2">(What is this reaction? Cute… No, wrong… Well no, it is not wrong, but now is not the time. Does this mean the answer is yes? But that is not the impression I got from looking into his memories…)</p><p class="calibre2">Theo hesitated, but responded.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-well, when a man and a woman get married they k-k-kiss and then ten months later the stork comes…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo said with his face completely red, while peeking at Helvi’s lips.</p><p class="calibre2">Who would have thought he was so convinced such superstition was real?</p><p class="calibre2">(Theo is so cute, fidgeting while looking at my lips…)</p><p class="calibre2">Thought Helvi while looking at Theo, escaping reality for a little bit.</p></div>
