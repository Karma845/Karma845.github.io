<h3>Chapter 5 &ndash; Fiance</h3>

<p class="calibre2">No one remained indifferent before this beautiful woman.</p><p class="calibre2">As her long white hair lightly danced in the wind, a captivating aroma filled the air around her.</p><p class="calibre2">People passing by were first captivated by her appearance, and as they passed by her, her scent made them turn around and look back.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi fascinated everyone around her just by walking, including Theo, who was walking alongside her. Unbeknownst to him, his fascination was being returned.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was so entranced by this scent and her elegance, that he failed to realize he had grabbed her hand, and thus did not notice how soft it was.</p><p class="calibre2">This however did not go unnoticed by Helvi, who was having her fill of the feeling of his hand.</p><p class="calibre2">[Kuh, why is this boy’s hand so soft… Is it even smoother than mine!?]</p><p class="calibre2">“Is the guild this way Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asked Helvi, trying not to let it show on her face what she was thinking.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Ah, eh, sorry, what?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I asked if the guild is this way.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, yes, it is!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo snapped out of his daze and answered the question.</p><p class="calibre2">He had been walking without thinking, but he was so used to going to the guild that it was not a problem.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? Ah, sorry!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo realized he was holding her hand, and let go immediately.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah…”</p><p class="calibre2">“It was rude to hold your hand so suddenly. Sorry.”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-no, it’s fine. I mean…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi looked a little sad about letting go of that warmth and softness and Theo, who was looking directly at her, noticed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum… Do you want to hold hands?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Y-yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">This time they held hands with their fingers intertwined, like lovers usually do.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi, your hand is so warm and soft.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-is it…”</p><p class="calibre2">This time Theo was aware that he was holding her hand, and told Helvi how he felt. Helvi had to try her hardest not to smile.</p><p class="calibre2">[Yours is softer and warmer… It would be so much easier if I could just say that! Dammit! Why are you so sincere? It’s embarrassing…!]</p><p class="calibre2">The innocent couple made its way to the guild.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a little bigger than most buildings, and the entrance was always open, so anyone could enter.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo went inside, with Helvi following closely behind.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi! This is the adventurer guild!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hou, I see.”</p><p class="calibre2">It was her first time inside the guild, but she did have the information she received from Theo. Helvi looked around to confirm if said information was correct.</p><p class="calibre2">There were the counters, the wall where quests were affixed, and…</p><p class="calibre2">[It’s them.]</p><p class="calibre2">Various tables, and a group of three people sat at one of them.</p><p class="calibre2">They were looking at her, completely stunned, but that mattered little to Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">She glared at them with bloodlust in her eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Is it getting cold?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Is it? I don’t know…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Nevermind that. Look at that girl…”</p><p class="calibre2">They were entranced by Helvi, and weren’t experienced enough to feel this bloodlust in the first place.</p><p class="calibre2">[I will let them be for now, but if they get in the way…]</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi! Let’s go to the counter!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? Ah, yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi stopped thinking about it, and followed Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo saw Fiore, and sped up a little as he approached her, still holding hands with Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“Good morning!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, good morning Theo. Who… Is this woman…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore inquired about the mysterious beautiful woman.</p><p class="calibre2">They had known each for two years, but Fiore heard nothing about Theo being acquainted with such a beautiful woman.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, hum…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo tried to explain, but obviously, he could not say she was a devil.</p><p class="calibre2">He did not know what to say, and Helvi stepped in.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s a pleasure to meet you miss Fiore. My name is Helvi, and I am Theo’s… <em class="calibre3">fiancee</em> .”</p><p class="calibre2">“F-fiancee?”</p><p class="calibre2">That word shocked Fiore, and the other receptionists around them.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was a little surprised as well, but stayed quiet, since Helvi was playing along.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s face became a little red as she continued.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I assume you know that he was raised by an elderly couple?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, I do but…”</p><p class="calibre2">“My parents were their friends, and our marriage was arranged a long time ago.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was surprised by how quickly Helvi came up with this story. Obviously, this backstory was a fabrication, but it felt natural.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. You could’ve told me about this, Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahaha, sorry…”</p><p class="calibre2">It wasn’t true, so there was no way he could have talked about it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Miss Fiore, please don’t blame Theo, he forgot about it until recently.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. Please, call me Fiore.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright, you can call me Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">The two ladies smiled at each other.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was happy that Fiore, who was always looking out for him, and his wife Helvi were getting along.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hey hey hey! Did I just hear someone say she’s that weak coward’s fiancee!?”</p><p class="calibre2">One of the three people waiting for Theo said loudly.</p><p class="calibre2">The trio had grins on their faces, but Helvi looked at them with a cold, sharp glare.</p></div>
