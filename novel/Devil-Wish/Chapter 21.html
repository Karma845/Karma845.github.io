<h3>Chapter 21 &ndash; Morning</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Next morning.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo woke up a little later than usual, and hurriedly got ready and started making breakfast.</p><p class="calibre2">The cause of this was, of course, the events from the previous day.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo thought back to it, and his face became red and his heart started racing.</p><p class="calibre2">Looking at Helvi’s face so closely, and being kissed so lustfully…</p><p class="calibre2">“Eek…!”</p><p class="calibre2">He was distracted, and suddenly felt pain running through his thumb. He looked at it, and saw he had lightly cut it with a knife.</p><p class="calibre2">He put his thumb in his mouth and licked the blood.</p><p class="calibre2">He accidentally cut his finger because he was distracted thinking about weird things. His grandmother always told him to be careful while cooking.</p><p class="calibre2">But no matter how much he tried, he could not get what happened the previous day out of his head.</p><p class="calibre2">Having his thumb in his mouth, made him remember having Helvi’s tongue inside it.</p><p class="calibre2">(Helvi’s tongue was softer and warmer… No, stop! Get a hold of yourself…!)</p><p class="calibre2">He told himself, and tried to continue cooking, but was startled when he heard the door to the living room open.</p><p class="calibre2">He looked in its direction…</p><p class="calibre2">“Good morning Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">And was Helvi, not in her sleep-wear, but instead looking as she did when they met.</p><p class="calibre2">This also meant her horns and wings were visible.</p><p class="calibre2">“G-good morning Helvi. Hum, your wings and horns are showing.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? Ah, they must have come out while I slept. I was sound asleep.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see…”</p><p class="calibre2">Seeing her demon-like features, Theo was once again fascinated by her beauty.</p><p class="calibre2">Looking at him, Helvi somehow figured out what was happening.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Do you like horns and wings?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh!? Ah, no, sorry, I was staring…”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I have no problem with that. So, what do you think?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi asked while moving her wings slightly, and Theo responded honestly, even though he was embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum, it’s not like I like horns and wings, it’s just that you look so beautiful… I couldn’t look away…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I-I see. S-so, should I let them out when we are alone?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes…”</p><p class="calibre2">“V-very well. It is my dear husband’s request, so I will do so.”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you very much.”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, if this much is enough to make you happy, I am happy as well.”</p><p class="calibre2">Both faces were red, and both looked downwards a bit, but the corners of their mouths pointed up, as they thought about what was next.</p><p class="calibre2">(I get to see this form when we’re alone… An Helvi only I know…)</p><p class="calibre2">(Starting the day like this… Too cute.)</p><p class="calibre2">Both were passionate even when the day had just begun.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi raised her head first, and noticed something was off.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, did you cut your thumb? You’re bleeding.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, I did. I’ll get a band-aid later.”</p><p class="calibre2">“There is no need for that.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi approached Theo, grabbed his injured hand, and put his thumb in her mouth.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh!? H-Helvi…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was surprised and excited, and felt a sharp sensation on his thumb.</p><p class="calibre2">His thumb was licked quickly by Helvi, who then stepped back.</p><p class="calibre2">Obviously, the blood that was licked off was not there anymore, but neither was the cut.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh… It’s gone?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo stared at his thumb, which looked as though it was never cut at all.</p><p class="calibre2">“I healed it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you very much!”</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed Helvi healed it with magic. It was Theo’s first time receiving healing magic.</p><p class="calibre2">He was impressed by how incredible Helvi was, but was also interested in where his thumb had been.</p><p class="calibre2">It was still a little wet from being inside of Helvi’s mouth.</p><p class="calibre2">(W-what do I do…!? I feel bad about wiping it, but I can’t leave it like this…)</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was a little shaken as he looked at his finger, and once again, Helvi realized what was going through his mind, and laughed a little.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufu, you can put it back in your mouth if you want.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh!? No, I mean, no way…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo did not have the courage to do that, especially in front of Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">As Helvi was amused by Theo’s agitation, she picked up a towel and wiped his finger for him.</p><p class="calibre2">“Is this better?”</p><p class="calibre2">“S-sorry…”</p><p class="calibre2">“No problem. But I want you to thank me for healing your wound.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, what should I do?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asked Theo, to which Helvi responded by closing her eyes and leaning forward.</p><p class="calibre2">“I demand… A good morning kiss.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi wanted to remain cool as she said this, but was embarrassed in the end.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh!? G-good morning kiss?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was even more embarrassed, and got excited looking at the beautiful face and the lips in front of him.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, should I lean forward a little more?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi bent her back a little, putting her lips at the same height as Theo’s.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now, my husband. Give me my good morning kiss.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Y-yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">As his face became completely red, Theo strongly closed his eyes and moved in to kiss Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">And then their lips met… Or at least they should have. It was his first time initiating a kiss, so he misjudged the distance and missed, kissing her cheek instead.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… S-sorry.”</p><p class="calibre2">It felt different from the previous day, and Theo realized his mistake.</p><p class="calibre2">He was embarrassed, his face became even redder, and he was even more agitated.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fu, fufufu… It’s alright, thank you. That is a very good reward.”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-that’s great.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was relieved to hear this response, but felt a little pathetic about her having to cover for him in this manner.</p><p class="calibre2">He was a little sad, but then…</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Eh?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s lips suddenly touched his.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a light and quick kiss, and Theo was completely taken aback.</p><p class="calibre2">“Next time, do it like this, my husband.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said a smiling Helvi. Theo’s day had just begun, but he was once again captivated by her.</p></div>
