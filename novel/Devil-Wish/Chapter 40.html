<h3>Chapter 40 &ndash; First Battle on the Mountain</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Some time after they stepped foot on the mountain, they encountered two giant monsters called Black Bears.</p><p class="calibre2">The length of their bodies easily exceeded four meters, and they were vicious beasts that would set themselves upon any human they found.</p><p class="calibre2">It was said that any regular person who encountered them should prepare themselves for death. They could easily outrun any person with their giant bodies.</p><p class="calibre2">It would be hard to deal with one, but two stood before them.</p><p class="calibre2">Usually, when someone found this monster they would go around it, trying not to let it see them. Even someone with relative faith in their strength could very easily lose.</p><p class="calibre2">But…</p><p class="calibre2">“I haven’t seen one of those Black Bears in a while.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I remember eating one of those, but the meat was hard and not good to eat at all.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Weaklings.”</p><p class="calibre2">Three of them seemed unfazed by these monsters, and carried on like normal.</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia thought back to other times when they met the same type of monster, and Helvi was completely uninterested.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-it’s alright, right…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo knew he would be alright with the other three around, but still stood behind Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">If he was alone, he would be doing his absolute best not to let the monsters find him.</p><p class="calibre2">The black Black Bears suddenly spotted them, and got up on two legs and let out a loud voice.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eek…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo hid behind Helvi with tears welling up in his eyes upon seeing these monsters that were over twice his height.</p><p class="calibre2">(Ku…. Cute…!)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s face became a little red as she looked at Theo, who was grabbing her clothes, perhaps unconsciously.</p><p class="calibre2">(They deserve a thousand deaths for scaring Theo, but I do thank them for showing me this.)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi felt bloodlust towards these opponents she felt no interest in before, but was grateful at the same time.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’ll take care of this.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Just watch, Helvi and Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">The two women stepped forward, and each faced one Black Bear.</p><p class="calibre2">The first ones to move were Xena and the Black Bear facing her.</p><p class="calibre2">The Black Bear raised its right arm and swung it down at Xena. Its arm was as thick as a tree trunk, and its swing carried a lot of force.</p><p class="calibre2">A normal person would be blown away for sure, and perhaps even die instantly, but Xena did not dodge this attack, instead casually blocking it with her left arm.</p><p class="calibre2">Her feet sunk into the ground slightly, showing the actual power behind this attack. However, Xena could easily take it with her steel magic.</p><p class="calibre2">The Black Bear seemed surprised about not finishing her off with one strike, but quickly attacked again with its left arm, swinging it sideways at Xena’s torso.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yoisho!”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena lifted her right leg, and repelled the monster’s attack with a kick, which made the monster stumble backwards.</p><p class="calibre2">Despite the monster’s arm being covered with hair and full of fat, it was fractured.</p><p class="calibre2">The Black Bear was overpowered, and its left arm was broken, but perhaps due to its wild nature, it showed no fear and attacked once again.</p><p class="calibre2">This time it opened its mouth hide, probably to bite Xena.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes yes little bear.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena swung her right fist and punched the monster as it approached her.</p><p class="calibre2">Her punch hit it on the left temple, and sent its big body flying with enough force to break trees in its path.</p><p class="calibre2">The Black Bear laid face down, completely motionless.</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright. I’m done!”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena as she turned around and showed Helvi and Theo a peace sign.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmph, surely that much is nothing.”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-that was great Xena!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yay!”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena looked happy to be complimented by Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">“It was too slow. Do it quicker.”</p><p class="calibre2">Next to Helvi stood Celia, who had already finished her fight, and sighed.</p><p class="calibre2">Celia’s fight lasted only a moment.</p><p class="calibre2">The Black Bear tried to lift its right arm to attack… But could not, because it had been cut and was falling to the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">The monster then tried to use its left arm, only to realize it was no longer there.</p><p class="calibre2">Before the monster could decide what to do next, its head was separated from its body.</p><p class="calibre2">All of it was caused by Celia’s wind magic.</p><p class="calibre2">Normal magic would be unable to penetrate a Black Bear’s body, but Celia easily cut it.</p><p class="calibre2">Normal people would be unable to stop a Black Bear’s attacks, but Xena easily blocked them and finished it with one hit.</p><p class="calibre2">They could not beat Helvi, but they were among the strongest in that world nonetheless.</p>
