<h3>Chapter 22 &ndash; Return</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, they had breakfast and headed towards the guild.</p><p class="calibre2">As they were leaving, an embarrassed Theo made a decision.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-Helvi…!”</p><p class="calibre2">He called out to Helvi, who was leaving first.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What is…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hnn…!”</p><p class="calibre2">He waited for her to turn around, and kissed her. This time Helvi did not lean forward, Theo stretched his back.</p><p class="calibre2">It may have seemed more difficult than before, seeing as Theo had to do it exactly as she turned around, but he hit her lips perfectly.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-how was it? D-did I do it well?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was embarrassed, and his head was facing down, but he peeked up to try to see Helvi’s reaction.</p><p class="calibre2">“~~!”</p><p class="calibre2">As she looked at this, it was Helvi’s turn to be captivated.</p><p class="calibre2">(Cute cute cute…! How could it be? He got one over on me, a devil. I froze when I saw his face so close, and he kissed me unexpectedly…! How marvelous…!)</p><p class="calibre2">The actual kiss only lasted a second, and Helvi barely felt it, but what happened before and afterwards was sublime.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi knew that Theo was thinking about how to kiss her back as he was having breakfast, but she made sure not to read his thoughts.</p><p class="calibre2">The way he was trying to do it without Helvi finding out was adorable, and the fact that he was thinking so hard for her sake made her very happy.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, she did not think he would do it so soon.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, l-let’s go…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo awkwardly to Helvi, who looked at him without saying a word.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">He was grabbed by the shoulder, turned around, and his mouth was sealed.</p><p class="calibre2">Suffice to say, they arrived at the guild later than they intended.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, g-good morning Theo and H-Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Fiore to the two who arrived a little later than usual.</p><p class="calibre2">The moment Fiore laid eyes on them, her face became a little red.</p><p class="calibre2">“Good morning Fiore.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Good morning Fiore.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo responded energetically, and Helvi a little awkwardly.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are there any quests I can do ?”</p><p class="calibre2">“There are plenty today. Here are the quest forms.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Thank you very much.”</p><p class="calibre2">He was handed several quest forms to read carefully and pick from.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore and Helvi did not speak, but their eyes met.</p><p class="calibre2">(Can you hear me Helvi? You can, can’t you?)</p><p class="calibre2">(…I can.)</p><p class="calibre2">They were not speaking, but instead communicating inside their heads.</p><p class="calibre2">(So, how was last night? Your first night I mean…)</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore had been curious about this ever since Helvi talked about said ‘first night’. In fact, she was so curious that she could not sleep, and was late for work that day.</p><p class="calibre2">Now that they were face to face, she had to ask.</p><p class="calibre2">(D-did you do it?)</p><p class="calibre2">(…Did what?)</p><p class="calibre2">(Y-you don’t know what I’m talking about!? You know, in bed…)</p><p class="calibre2">(Ahh… We did not.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Eh…? you didn’t?)</p><p class="calibre2">(Yes, we did not, or rather, could not.)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi explained the reason why, primarily Theo’s lack of sexual knowledge.</p><p class="calibre2">(I-I see… Theo is so pure…)</p><p class="calibre2">(This goes beyond pure. I did not expect his complete lack of ulterior motives to be such a problem…)</p><p class="calibre2">(I-I see. So Helvi, do you want to do it…?)</p><p class="calibre2">(I do, right away. Compliment me for not assaulting him yesterday.)</p><p class="calibre2">And then, Helvi went into detail about what happened the previous night. Obviously, she did not vocalize it.</p><p class="calibre2">(Y-you kissed like that…)</p><p class="calibre2">(Yes, and it was great. We arrived here late because we were kissing before leaving as well.)</p><p class="calibre2">(I-is that why you’re late…)</p><p class="calibre2">As they talked inside their heads, Helvi was called by another receptionist.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum, Helvi, come here for a second.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What is it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“There is something I want to ask.”</p><p class="calibre2">Behind this receptionist were other receptionists, waiting with amused looks on their faces.</p><p class="calibre2">(Ah… I’m sorry.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Why?)</p><p class="calibre2">(I told them about your first night with Theo.)</p><p class="calibre2">(What are you spreading around…)</p><p class="calibre2">It was rare for Fiore to be late to work, so she was bombarded with questions when she arrived.</p><p class="calibre2">They were especially curious because they knew she went to Theo’s house the previous day.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore was cornered, and that is when she told them.</p><p class="calibre2">Because of this, the other receptionists were anxiously waiting for Theo and Helvi to arrive.</p><p class="calibre2">“Can we talk about what happened last night?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes, I understand. I will be right back Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, alright.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was a little confused as he saw the receptionists take Helvi with them.</p><p class="calibre2">“What does everyone want to ask me? Fiore?”</p><p class="calibre2">“W-who knows?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Fiore with a slightly nervous smile.</p></div>
