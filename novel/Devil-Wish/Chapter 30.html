<h3>Chapter 30: Unexpected X Cinderella</h3>

<p>An ordinary girl becomes a princess overnight. </p>



<p>Such a plotline has been overused in fairy tales. </p>



<p>By the time one turns 17, whenever they come across such stories, they tend to view them as childish, or just too convenient.</p>



<p>It’s because they’ve come to know, firsthand, that life doesn’t offer such convenient turnarounds.</p>



<p>Yes, I thought I knew that.</p>



<p>But perhaps, in thinking so, I was the child all along.</p>



<p>The buzz on the internet didn’t matter to me. While I remained optimistic, reality started to accelerate. </p>



<p>The whole uproar initially started among Instagram users and soon spread to major forums.</p>



<p>From there, it was summarized by major blogs and spread far and wide. </p>



<p>The topic began trending on Twitter and other social media platforms, until eventually…</p>



<p><em>“Hiromichi-kun. Guess what? I’m going to be on TV!”</em></p>



<p>She was featured on a local TV show as the town’s talked-about beautiful drama club member. </p>



<p>All this happened in just a little over a week since I first became aware of the uproar. </p>



<p>It truly felt like a Cinderella story, like I was being told a fairy tale. </p>



<p>But on second thought, I remembered seeing numerous news stories about celebrities being ostracized because of a single misstep on the internet.</p>



<p>So, it’s only natural that the opposite can happen too.</p>



<p>Maybe this is the power of social media, which allows countless people to interact at the literal speed of light.</p>



<p>However, I couldn’t keep up with this otherworldly speed of unfolding events. </p>



<p>As I watched my girlfriend on TV alongside the drama club’s famous leader, who was already renowned as a top high school author, I felt as if Haruka had become an inhabitant of a distant world, different from where I lived. I was overwhelmed by a sense of unease.</p>



<p>People who had never known about Haruka before were now eagerly reaching out to her.</p>



<p>These hands, which had once only been virtual on the internet, were now audaciously grasping her, pulling her in all directions. </p>



<p>I couldn’t help but wonder… Will they take her to a world out of my reach?</p>



<p>But every time such a thought crossed my mind, I shook my head, pushing the anxiety away. </p>



<p>I kept reassuring myself. </p>



<p>“It’s okay,” I’d say. </p>



<p>No matter how people’s perception of her changed, Haruka would remain the same.</p>



<p>No matter who reached out to her, she wouldn’t be swayed and leave my side.</p>



<p>With this brave face, my thoughts wandered. </p>



<p>I looked at the red circle marked on the last week of summer vacation on the calendar, the day of the fireworks festival we promised to go on a date.</p>



<p>I believed that once I saw Haruka’s radiant smile, unchanged like the sun, all my foolish anxieties would surely vanish. </p>



<p>Holding onto that belief, I eagerly awaited the day.</p>



<p>And then… the morning of the fireworks festival finally arrived.</p>



<p>x x x</p>



<p>“Hmmmm…”</p>



<p>On the day of the fireworks festival date, I had been staring at the small mirror in the kitchen since noon. </p>



<p>More specifically, I was glaring at the plain, unimpressive face reflected in it.</p>



<p>Seriously, what’s with this dull face? </p>



<p>It might not have any distinct flaws, but it also lacks any unique features or charm. </p>



<p>In a word, it’s generic. Definitely not the face of a protagonist.</p>



<p>On the other hand, my girlfriend is now a minor celebrity. In just these past two weeks, she went from being the subject of a single photo to being featured as a Cinderella story on a TV talk show. </p>



<p>Ever since she was introduced on local television as the beautiful high school actress working under a famous young writer, the buzz around her seemed to have grown even more intense.</p>



<p>I wish I could at least measure up a little. </p>



<p>With that thought, I had spent nearly an hour trying on different outfits and adjusting my hairstyle, attempting to look more like a protagonist. But…</p>



<p>“You’re wasting your time with these pointless efforts again, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>I agree. To be honest, I too felt like I was making a pointless effort.</p>



<p>Or should I say, it feels like a last-ditch struggle, a futile resistance.</p>



<p>I probably should have at least gone to a hair salon. </p>



<p>I really struggled with that decision. I thought about going, but salons can be intimidating, right? </p>



<p>I’ve never been to one. I heard it’s the kind where you need to book in advance with some charismatic stylist, and they might turn you away if you don’t.</p>



<p>It seems like a lot of fuss just for a haircut. </p>



<p>Anyway, while I was hesitating like this, the day of our date arrived.</p>



<p>“No matter how much you try to cover up at this point, it’s not going to make much difference. Just give up and eat your lunch already.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, yeah, I get it.”</p>



<p>Shigure, who was already seated at the dining table, said in a scolding tone.</p>



<p>Reluctantly taking my eyes off the mirror, I complied. </p>



<p>Today’s lunch was Cold Ramen(Hiyashi Chuka).</p>



<p>The red of the tomatoes, the yellow of the eggs, and the green of the cucumbers — the vibrant and appetizing colors tempted my appetite. </p>



<p>Taking a bite, the sourness of the soup clinging to the noodles tantalized my taste buds, followed by the rich aroma of the sprinkled white sesame seeds, making it delicious.</p>



<p>“Speaking of which, they reached out to me for an interview on this program, via Nee-san,”</p>



<p>While I was pondering over the best timing to eat one of the three tomato slices, Shigure, gazing at the daytime talk show streaming in the background, mentioned this. </p>



<p>It was the same show that had featured Haruka in a regional segment. </p>



<p>This was news to me, and I was taken aback.</p>



<p>“Seriously? Why?”</p>



<p>“Well, of course, it’s because I’m her twin sister. ‘The girl from the miraculous photo has an identical twin,’ sounds like a potential headline, doesn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Did you accept the interview?”</p>



<p>“If I had, I’d be on the screen right now. Why would I willingly be consumed as someone’s entertainment? It’s ridiculous.”</p>



<p>Shigure remarked with a clear lack of interest.</p>



<p>For an average person like me, the mere idea of a TV interview would be nerve-wracking. But Shigure’s audacious and unfazed demeanor was so characteristically her. </p>



<p>Her refusal to be swayed by others’ judgments was almost admirable.</p>



<p>“But I’m a bit surprised that Nee-san was cooperative enough with this uproar to even set up an interview for me.”</p>



<p>“Maybe she felt embarrassed to be interviewed alone and thought of involving Shigure.”</p>



<p>Given Haruka’s shy nature, that seemed plausible.</p>



<p>Shigure seemed to agree, nodding, “That’s probably it.” </p>



<p>But she continued,</p>



<p>“However, I don’t think that’s the only reason. Maybe Nee-san sees this as an opportunity.”</p>



<p>“Opportunity? For what?”</p>



<p>“A chance to enter the entertainment industry. She seems to enjoy acting, after all.”</p>



<p>E-Entertainment industry? I recall her mentioning something about a photo shoot or gravure earlier.</p>



<p>“You say that so casually, but it’s not an easy world to enter just because one photo went viral. I might not know much, but still…”</p>



<p>“True, in terms of lasting in the industry, it’s not easy. But, for getting a foot in the door? This could be enough. Our mother, who’s now your mother too, was scouted when she was working part-time at a cafe. Don’t you think Nee-san has a bit more prestige than that? She’s already made her TV debut, even if it was on a local program.”</p>



<p>That could be the case, but…</p>



<p>“…Just the other day she herself said going professional was out of the question.”</p>



<p>“People’s views can change as their circumstances do, right? Nee-san might be shy, but the fact that she’s involved in the drama club, which draws attention, shows how passionate she is about acting.”</p>



<p>…Maybe Shigure has a point. With all the buzz, it does seem possible.</p>



<p>But admitting to that possibility felt extremely unpleasant. </p>



<p>It’s a bit abstract, but it felt like Haruka would become distant, somehow.</p>



<p>“What will you do, Onii-san? If Nee-san debuts as an idol, and they impose dating restrictions on her, telling her to break up with you? Imagine stern-looking old men in suits visiting this house, pressuring her to leave you. …Or would you switch to me? After all, our faces are the same.”</p>



<p>“Don’t talk nonsense…!”</p>



<p>Provoked by Shigure’s annoying insinuations, I unintentionally snapped at her.</p>



<p>“Even if, by some chance, Haruka becomes a celebrity, it doesn’t mean we’d break up like that. Haruka would never agree to such nonsense, you idiot!”</p>



<p>“Geez, scary! Don’t yell like that. It was obviously a joke. I’ve known my sister longer than you have. I know she’s not that kind of person.”</p>



<p>Shigure puffed out her cheeks in apparent annoyance, as if she had merely been playing around. </p>



<p>While she’s to blame for making baseless comments, my reaction was undeniably over the top.</p>



<p>Remember the absolute trust Haruka has in me.</p>



<p>There’s no way Haruka would ever leave me.</p>



<p>Even if we haven’t progressed beyond kissing, as long as she keeps smiling at me, I’ll believe in Haruka. That’s what I decided. So, these absurd anxieties will undoubtedly disappear after our date today.</p>



<p>As I was reassuring myself, the smartphone on the table rang, signaling an incoming call. The name displayed was…</p>



<p>“It’s from Haruka.”</p>



<p>“I’ll lower the TV volume.”</p>



<p>After thanking Shigure, I picked up the phone. </p>



<p>Maybe she’s confirming our meeting place for later? </p>



<p>Thinking this, I pressed the call button.</p>



<p>“Hello? What’s up?”</p>



<p><em>“Ah, Hiromichi-kun. Are you still at home?”</em></p>



<p>“We’re meeting in the evening, right? What’s this about?”</p>



<p><em>“…Actually, I’m coming to your house right now.”</em></p>



<p>Huh?</p>



<p>“Ehhhh!? Y-you’re coming over here!?”</p>



<p>Taken aback by the unexpected statement, my voice rose in a near-scream. </p>



<p>Hearing this, Shigure looked just as shocked.</p>



<p>“Why? Wait! Our meetup was at the station at 5 PM, right?”</p>



<p><em>“Yes, but there’s something important I want to talk to you about right now. I felt it wouldn’t be right over the phone… So, can I come over?”</em></p>



<p>This can’t be happening!</p>



<p>It really can’t be!</p>



<p>Because Shigure is here in the house.</p>



<p>And unlike her last visit, I haven’t made any preparations.</p>



<p>There’s no time to hide Shigure’s belongings now.</p>



<p>Desperately suppressing the urge to scream, I responded to Haruka.</p>



<p>“No, wait! Now’s not a good time! The place is a mess, seriously! It’s not in a state to invite anyone over!”</p>



<p><em>“Ahaha. Just as Shigure mentioned. Your place was unusually tidy when I last visited. But I really don’t mind, you know? Our clubroom is way messier.”</em></p>



<p>“No, it’s not about you minding it, I do! And how close are you? Are you right in front of the house or something?”</p>



<p><em>“Nope, I just arrived at the station.”</em></p>



<p>O-okay! If that’s the case…</p>



<p>“Then wait there for me! I’ll come to you!”</p>



<p><em>“Ah, you don’t have to do that. It’s my fault for dropping by unexpectedly.”</em></p>



<p>“It’s fine! Ah, right! Lunch, I was planning to go to Saizeriya near the station for lunch, right now! So, please wait there!”</p>



<p><em>“…Okay. Sorry for this sudden request.”</em></p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it. Just go in and wait! And don’t move from there!”</p>



<p>After emphasizing that she shouldn’t move, I hung up.</p>



<p>“Sorry, Shigure…! Haruka’s at the station…!”</p>



<p>“I see. She couldn’t wait until the evening, huh? Must be urgent. I’ll clean up what we’ve started eating. You can go.”</p>



<p>“Thanks! I owe you one!”</p>



<p>Expressing my gratitude with a bow to the understanding Shigure, I hurriedly dashed out of the house. </p>



<p>With all the running, the hair I had carefully set was now a mess.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>When I entered Saizeriya, Haruka was seated in a spot visible from the entrance. The moment she saw me, she waved energetically.</p>



<p>“Hiromichi-kun. Over here!”</p>



<p>“Sorry for making you wait.”</p>



<p>“No worries. I just came here on my own, after all.”</p>



<p>Haruka’s apologetic expression was half-hidden by a mask.</p>



<p>“Haruka… did you catch a cold?”</p>



<p>“No, this isn’t because of a cold. Remember how I appeared briefly on TV recently? Since then, I’ve been a little conscious of people’s stares.”</p>



<p>I sighed in relief. The date I had been looking forward to, which might be the last memorable one of this summer, being canceled due to a cold would be no joke.</p>



<p>“Well, only our schoolmates really noticed.”</p>



<p>“You’ve become quite the celebrity, haven’t you?”</p>



<p>“Oh, stop teasing!”</p>



<p>Yet, Haruka didn’t seem too bothered. I wondered if it was because of what Shigure had said. </p>



<p>…No, stop, stop. I didn’t want to touch upon any topic that could dampen the mood when I finally got the chance to be with Haruka.</p>



<p>“But I was surprised when you suddenly said you were near my house.”</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry. And on top of that, I called you out.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it. Have you ordered yet?”</p>



<p>Having received Haruka’s response that she hadn’t and anything was fine, I ordered some fries to share and drinks. </p>



<p>Afterwards, to steer the conversation away from any distressing topics and towards the wonderful day at hand, I turned my attention to Haruka.</p>



<p>“I’m really looking forward to the fireworks festival. I heard there are going to be a lot of food stalls there. I want to try various foods, so I guess I should go light on lunch. Haruka, do you have a favorite stall?”</p>



<p>“Um, I… I like candy apples…”</p>



<p>“That’s very festive. As for me, I’m all about the grilled squid. You rarely see whole squids outside of festivals. But I don’t just want to eat; I also want to try shooting games. Haruka, have you ever tried shooting games? I’ve actually never done it.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>…Huh? Haruka’s response seemed off. She had gone silent.</p>



<p>I tried to gauge her expression, and she looked somewhat uncomfortable. </p>



<p>Could she really be feeling unwell?</p>



<p>But before I could ask what was wrong, Haruka, with a determined expression, looked up.</p>



<p>“Hiromichi-kun. I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>She apologized to me again. </p>



<p>Was she that bothered about summoning me all of a sudden?</p>



<p>“I told you I’m not mad. Our plans were for the evening, but now they’ve been moved up. It means we get to spend more time together. I consider that a stroke of luck.”</p>



<p>“That’s not it.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“The reason I came today… is because I wanted to ask if we could reschedule our date for tonight.”</p>



<p>Eh…?</p>



<p>“W-Why? Why all of a sudden…?”</p>



<p>“…Yesterday, the club president told me that the producer working on her movie became interested in me because of that photo incident. He invited me to join them for a meeting tonight.”</p>



<p>“A… producer?”</p>



<p>“Yes, a producer is someone who organizes the production of movies or dramas. The president told me it would be good to meet him if I’m interested in the world of acting. So… I want to go there today.”</p>



<p>She wants to go there…?</p>



<p>But then, what about our date? </p>



<p>Ah, so she’s asking to reschedule. </p>



<p>Still, this sudden change of plans at the last moment…</p>



<p>“H-Haruka, didn’t you say you weren’t considering going pro? That it was just a hobby, even if you weren’t that good?”</p>



<p>“…Yes, I said that. I felt that way. But the truth is, I’ve always admired it. I think I mentioned before, my mom was an actress. When I was little, she appeared in dramas. She was only a supporting role and never became famous, but she looked so cool and beautiful on TV.”</p>



<p>I remember hearing about this when we first started dating.</p>



<p>“I was drawn to that sparkling version of my mom, and I started acting to get closer to it. With a lot of practice… I managed to catch the club president’s attention, got chosen as the lead for the cultural festival, and now a movie producer wants to meet me. It’s like a dream, right?”</p>



<p>Haruka’s tone became increasingly passionate. </p>



<p>Correspondingly, her apologetic expression from earlier gradually shifted to the serious one she often wore during club activities—much like the one in that now-famous photo.</p>



<p>“I think I’m using up all the luck I have in my lifetime right now. That’s why I want to do everything I can at this moment. Otherwise, I think I’ll have immense regrets. The kind that lasts forever. We can always reschedule our date, but adults are busy. If I miss this opportunity, someone like me, who’s just a junior to the club president, might never get a chance like this again. So… I’m really sorry for the sudden change, but can we reschedule tonight’s date? Please.”</p>



<p>Haruka clapped her hands together and bowed deeply to me.</p>



<p>…I understood Haruka’s feelings well.</p>



<p>Certainly, when I was shown that photo, I never anticipated the commotion it would cause.</p>



<p>For Haruka, the one in the center of it all, it must have been an even bigger shock.</p>



<p>An unexpected opportunity to get closer to the world she aspired to. Such an unbelievable chance might never come again in her lifetime. </p>



<p>She would naturally want to give it her all when the opportunity arose.</p>



<p>And I knew just how seriously Haruka committed herself to her club activities.</p>



<p>During this summer vacation, a time when most second-year high school students would be engrossed in love and leisure, Haruka had dedicated almost all her time to club activities.</p>



<p>Even our dates usually consisted of doing homework together after meals.</p>



<p>Now, many people are starting to notice and take interest in Haruka as she earnestly pursues the dream she’s held since childhood. </p>



<p>It seems Haruka’s hard work is about to bear fruit. </p>



<p>That’s truly something to be happy about.</p>



<p>Of course, it’s disappointing to have a long-awaited date suddenly canceled, but that’s something I could endure on my own.</p>



<p>As Haruka said, we can always have our date on another day. </p>



<p>Today is an important day for her. As her boyfriend, it’s my role to support her efforts. My answer was clear.</p>



<p>“No.”</p>



<p>Though I was sure of my response, the words that came out of my mouth were the exact opposite.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“Eh…?”</p>



<p>Haruka’s eyes widened in surprise at my rejection. </p>



<p>On the other hand, I was equally stunned by my own words. </p>



<p>What am I saying? Idiot. Correct it right now.</p>



<p>“No. I mean, I made plans with you first.”</p>



<p>But the words I thought rationally didn’t come out. </p>



<p>Only my childish emotions ran ahead.</p>



<p>“I was really looking forward to going to the fireworks festival with just the two of us. Sure, we might be able to have our date another day, but the fireworks are today. …Please reschedule that meeting instead.”</p>



<p>Idiot. Stop it. What are you being so selfish for?</p>



<p>A wave of self-loathing crashed over me for my thoughtless insistence without considering Haruka’s feelings. </p>



<p>Still, I couldn’t stop myself, even though I knew saying such things would trouble her.</p>



<p>“I see… You were looking forward to it that much… Yeah, I was too… But…”</p>



<p>Haruka looked very troubled in response to my refusal. </p>



<p>My selfishness was causing her distress. </p>



<p>The realization stung.</p>



<p>See, I told you so. </p>



<p>It’s all your fault, Hiromichi. What a narrow-minded boyfriend you are. </p>



<p>Can’t even support your girlfriend’s aspirations. You’re the worst. </p>



<p>Correct yourself now.</p>



<p>…But no matter how much I berated myself, I couldn’t muster the words to correct what I said.</p>



<p>I just stared at Haruka, struggling with her feelings, hoping she would say, “You’re right. Our date is more important,” in her usual cheerful voice. </p>



<p>However,…</p>



<p>“Ah, I’ve got an idea! How about we go to Disneyland together tomorrow?”</p>



<p>“You mean… in Tokyo?”</p>



<p>“Yes! We can get up early, take the train, and play until it closes. They have fireworks every evening, so we can watch them together there!”</p>



<p>That’s not it.</p>



<p>“W-wait… that’s so sudden… and there’s the travel expense…”</p>



<p>“It’s okay! As an apology for today, I’ll cover our transportation costs for tomorrow. I got paid for an interview I did recently, so I can easily afford it. I do have club activities tomorrow… but I’ll ask the club president for a day off. That way, instead of just spending the evening together like today, we can have a full day date. What do you say?”</p>



<p>That’s not what I meant, Haruka.</p>



<p>…I don’t really care about the fireworks. I’m not interested in them at all. </p>



<p>And whether our date is today or tomorrow, either is fine.</p>



<p>I just… I just wanted you to choose me.</p>



<p>Lately, I’ve felt like Haruka has been drifting away, and I’ve been feeling lonely. I fear she might become too distant.</p>



<p>…If I laid out all my feelings, would Haruka reconsider? </p>



<p>Would she give up everything she’s built up until now and this life-changing opportunity that just landed in front of her and choose me?</p>



<p>…I don’t know. I can’t trust Haruka that much. </p>



<p>What if, just what if, after pouring out all my feelings… she still doesn’t choose me──</p>



<p>“Alright, then… let’s go! A Disneyland date!”</p>



<p>“Yes! Ehehe, I’m so excited. Going to Disneyland with someone I love has always been a dream of mine. It looks like our end-of-summer date is going to be wonderful.”</p>



<p>“I’ve only been once when I was a kid, so I’m looking forward to it. It’s not the kind of place you often go to without a girlfriend, after all.”</p>



<p>I’m such a coward, always hesitant. </p>



<p>Even after putting Haruka in a tough spot by revealing my feelings, I pull back halfway. </p>



<p>How irrational is that.</p>



<p>If I was going to hesitate, I should’ve cheerfully agreed to reschedule from the start. </p>



<p>Why can’t I… control my own feelings?</p>



<p>On the other hand, after hearing my approval, Haruka’s apologetic expression transformed into a delighted smile.</p>



<p>“Sigh… I’m so glad… that you understand, Hiromichi-kun. When the club president invited me today, she told me it was last minute and that if I had other plans, I could prioritize them. I initially thought of declining. But… I believed Hiromichi-kun would support my dream.”</p>



<p>“…Well, I know how hard you’ve been working in the club, Haruka.”</p>



<p>“Ehehe, thanks. I’m lucky to have such an understanding boyfriend.”</p>



<p>…Is that how it looks? Do I seem like I’m okay with it?</p>



<p>I’m surprised I can even fake a smile so well.</p>



<p>Shigure always teases me, saying whatever’s on my mind shows on my face.</p>



<p>Do I appear to you, Haruka, as someone who can just laugh it off when our eagerly awaited date is suddenly cancelled?</p>



<p><em>“What Nee-san sees is the Onii-san from our childhood, from our elementary school days. She’s still in love with the Onii-san who was innocent and pure, who didn’t understand the distinctions between a boy and a girl, a time when emotions were boundless. Therefore, she doesn’t realize… the immense effort it takes for Onii-san to forgive Nee-san. She believes it’s a given and doesn’t grasp the preciousness of that gesture.”</em></p>



<p>I couldn’t help but recall Shigure’s words from the other day.</p>



<p>Those words I had dismissed seemed to weigh heavily on me now. </p>



<p>Haruka, who should be close by, felt so distant.</p>



<p>Hey, Haruka.</p>



<p>Do you truly see the person I am right now?</p>



<p>…But perhaps, the same could be said for both of us.</p>



<p>After reuniting in high school, we started dating immediately upon Haruka’s confession. </p>



<p>We never showed each other how much we’d changed since elementary school.</p>



<p>Maybe… we’re just indulging in convenient illusions about each other. </p>



<p>Merely two people, in very different, distant worlds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>After settling the bill, Haruka said she had to prepare and go home. </p>



<p>I didn’t have the energy to ask her to stay. </p>



<p>We quickly parted ways, and I headed straight home.</p>



<p>“Eh!? Onii-san!?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I’m back.”</p>



<p>“No, you’re not supposed to be home yet. Weren’t you supposed to be on a date until tonight?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, right…”</p>



<p>Now, how should I explain this?</p>



<p>It’s not something I should hide, but I don’t want to reveal that I’m feeling down. </p>



<p>To be honest, it’s embarrassing.</p>



<p>It’s hard for me to admit that she didn’t choose me over her dreams and wishes.</p>



<p>If she had said she wanted to break up because she wanted to become a celebrity, it would be natural for me to feel down.</p>



<p>But this was just a reschedule. </p>



<p>Haruka had been considerate enough to do her best to accommodate me.</p>



<p>I know that. </p>



<p>Yet, here I am, wanting all of Haruka, and feeling possibly resentful that she didn’t give me that. </p>



<p>I feel pathetic, petty, and small-minded. I’d rather die than let anyone else know how I’m feeling. </p>



<p>So, I forced a bright tone and spoke.</p>



<p>“I heard she’s meeting someone who’s making a movie with the head of the drama club. And that’s happening tonight, so she rescheduled.”</p>



<p>“…Huh?”</p>



<p>“She got interested after that viral incident. It’s surprising how things are falling into place. Haruka might really debut, just like Shigure said.”</p>



<p>“So, are you saying Nee-san canceled on you to go meet that person?”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s not like she canceled. She just rescheduled. We’re going to Disneyland tomorrow, from opening to closing. It’ll be way more fun than watching the local fireworks.”</p>



<p>I tried to hide my petty jealousy and the fact that I was feeling down. </p>



<p>Shigure then said,</p>



<p>“Hmm. Nee-san would do that, huh?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>She muttered something while looking down, but her voice was too soft and her face was hidden by her bangs. </p>



<p>I wonder what she just said.</p>



<p>Just as I was about to ask, Shigure looked up with a mischievous smile which made me swallow my words.</p>



<p>…I had a bad feeling. When she smiles like that, nothing good ever happens.</p>



<p>“So, Onii-san, you’re free today, huh? You wouldn’t make any other plans on the day you’re supposed to have a date with Nee-san, right?”</p>



<p>Shigure’s sudden high energy put me on edge.</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah… What about it?”</p>



<p>“Then let’s go to the fireworks festival together.”</p>



<p>So that’s where she was going with this. But no, I didn’t want to do that.</p>



<p>“…I’m not going. Why should I go with you when I’m not even going with her?”</p>



<p>“Because I’m Onii-san’s cute, adorable little sister. I want to see the fireworks with my beloved Onii-chan. You’ll grant your sister’s wish, right?”</p>



<p>Shigure looked up at me with puppy eyes and begged, “Please?” </p>



<p>But I absolutely did not want to go.</p>



<p>If I went to the festival with Shigure instead of Haruka, I knew I would feel terrible. </p>



<p>Seeing Shigure, who looked so much like Haruka, would only make me think about Haruka and feel depressed.</p>



<p>I would wonder why Haruka wasn’t there with me, and I would harbor negative feelings towards both Haruka and Shigure. </p>



<p>And I would end up hating myself even more.</p>



<p>I already knew that. There was no way I wanted to go to an event that would make me feel that way.</p>



<p>“No. Think about it. The fireworks festival is in the Seiun students’ area. And it’s the climax of the summer, so there’s bound to be people from school there. We’ve only told the teacher about us becoming siblings, so it would be troublesome if someone saw us together. I can’t take that risk.”</p>



<p>Usually, when we bumped into classmates while out and about, we could just say it was a coincidence. But being together at the fireworks festival was a different story. </p>



<p>Especially after my plans with Haruka fell through. If Haruka heard about it, it would be hard to make excuses. </p>



<p>I came up with a plausible reason to refuse, and Shigure seemed to understand, nodding her head in agreement.</p>



<p>“Hmm, that’s true, there might be a risk.”</p>



<p>“Right? So──”</p>



<p>“But if you refuse, I’ll immediately tell Nee-san about our relationship. How about that?”</p>



<p>Haa!?</p>



<p>“Onii-san, sometimes you don’t really understand your position, do you? I hold a significant weakness of yours. If I feel like it, I can easily destroy your relationship with Nee-san. There was never any freedom of choice for you, Onii-san. Today, I’ll make sure you understand that thoroughly, so prepare yourself, Onii-san♪”</p>



<p>As Shigure grinned maliciously, there was nothing I could do but give up. In the end, this little devil had complete control over my fate.</p>



<p>And so, instead of going to the fireworks festival with my girlfriend, I ended up going with her little sister.</p>
