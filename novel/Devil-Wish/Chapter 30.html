<h3>Chapter 30 &ndash; Self-restraint?</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“G-geez! Helvi! T-that kiss was too much! Restrain yourself a little, please!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was mad, but the other three couldn’t help but feel soothed as they watched him.</p><p class="calibre2">His face was completely red, but it had more to do with embarrassment than anger.</p><p class="calibre2">The way he would get embarrassed while trying to raise his voice in anger made it so he was not the least bit frightening. In fact, the other three could not help but find it adorable.</p><p class="calibre2">“Xena, Celia, are you alright? You were hit by that magic for a while.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I’m fine. Thanks for your concern.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Me too… Still, I’m glad she can control that magic even while kissing you. I was worried she would lose control and flatten us.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That much is no trouble at all.”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia was the only one who realized how strange it was.</p><p class="calibre2">She now fully understood that there was no way they could ever defeat her.</p><p class="calibre2">“What are you Helvi? It’s very odd for someone as strong as you to not be well known.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s right. Even we’re strong enough for nobles to ask us to escort them.”</p><p class="calibre2">They were part of the mercenary guild, but these two were known for their strength, and would receive many named quests. They were famous for being hired by nobles from the royal capital.</p><p class="calibre2">“I believe I told you. I am Theo’s wife.”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I heard that, but it doesn’t explain your strength.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I believe I told you. I am the strongest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That doesn’t explain anything either, does it?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi halfheartedly dodged the question, and the other two did not press further.</p><p class="calibre2">Many people in the mercenary guild did not like to discuss their circumstances.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was not part of the guild, but knew she should not reveal to other people she was a devil.</p><p class="calibre2">Afterwards, it was decided that they would all go to Theo’s house.</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia were staying in an inn, but they were all going to have dinner together.</p><p class="calibre2">They were buying ingredients on the way, and…</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi, what do you want to eat today?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well… Yesterday we had meat, so I suppose fish would be good.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright. Are you two fine with fish too?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo and Helvi walked side-by-side, and Xena and Celia walked behind them.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was fairly knowledgeable about the shopping street, and bought fish and vegetables.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, that looks heavy. Let me carry half.”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, it’s fine. I’m used to it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…You’re using both of your hands. We cannot hold hands like this.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi while turning away, as her cheeks became red.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh… Ah, that…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hurry.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, thank you…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi carried the ingredients with her left hand, and stretched her right arm towards Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Alright.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo grabbed her hand as they continued walking.</p><p class="calibre2">With both of their faces turning red, they made their way home in silence, perhaps because they felt awkward.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo’s one thing, but why is Helvi’s face turning red just from holding hands after she kissed him like that?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Who knows? I guess people like us who’ve never had a boyfriend just don’t get it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t say that Celia, you’re making me sad.”</p><p class="calibre2">Looking at those two from behind was causing more damage than the battle itself.</p><p class="calibre2">After arriving at their destination, the four had dinner. Theo prepared fish, just as Helvi requested.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn… It was great. Your cooking really is the best, Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. It’s so much better than the nutritional supplements we have while camping.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course, it is Theo after all.”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo blushed and smiled as the three complimented him and watched him trying to hide his embarrassment by eating faster.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo I want seconds! It’s so good I could eat it all!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Can I have more too Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, of course.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo stood up and grabbed the rice bowls, feeling happy that they liked his food so much.</p><p class="calibre2">“Aren’t you going to have seconds Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">“If you don’t, we’ll eat everything.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said the two while grinning. Since they were mercenaries, they needed a lot of nutrition, and ate more than most people despite their slim bodies.</p><p class="calibre2">They challenged Helvi, feeling like they could win this one.</p><p class="calibre2">Their provocation was not the least bit subtle, but Helvi could not back down, since it involved Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fuh, fine. Theo, I will also have more.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, but you don’t have to feel like you have to force yourselves.”</p><p class="calibre2">And then, the eating contest began.</p><p class="calibre2">However, there was a limit to how much food they had, since Theo did not cook with that in mind.</p><p class="calibre2">They put out not only what Theo had cooked for that night, but also what they had preserved for the following days.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a race to see who could finish quicker, and in the end…</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I can’t eat any more…”</p><p class="calibre2">“S-she actually beat the two of us together…”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena and Celia, stretched out on the sofa.</p><p class="calibre2">“It was all very good Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi, who was still sitting in her chair, and was wiping her mouth with a paper napkin that she seemingly got out of nowhere.</p><p class="calibre2">The winner was clear.</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-you can eat that much, Helvi? Does that mean you didn’t have enough yesterday?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asked Theo, after seeing Helvi comfortably eat five times what she had the previous night.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi peeked towards the pair that could not move from the sofa, approached Theo, and whispered in his ear.</p><p class="calibre2">“A devil like myself has no such things as an empty or full stomach. In reality, I do not need to eat.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I see.”</p><p class="calibre2">Needing things such as food and shelter was a fate that humans could not escape, but a devil like Helvi was a different story.</p><p class="calibre2">However, she could eat for her own pleasure, if she so desired.</p><p class="calibre2">“But I do know what is tasty, and I very much enjoy your cooking. Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s lips gently pressed into Theo’s cheek. What she truly wanted was for them to press into Theo’s lips, but she was restraining herself at Theo’s request.</p><p class="calibre2">“…! Thank you…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s cheeks became red after being gently kissed.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p>
