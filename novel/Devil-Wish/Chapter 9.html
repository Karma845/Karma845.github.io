<h1>Vol 3 Chapter 9: Boldly choosing a Swimsuit (Part 1)</h1><div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The six of us arrived at a large shopping mall where we bought a present for Kaede-san. The location where Rika-chan got lost during spring break. It was close to the school, had a wide selection of goods, and even had a game arcade, so it was the perfect place to stretch our legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, I would like to check out the swimsuits right away, but first we have to eat! They say you can’t fight if you’re hungry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These words felt exaggerated to me. It was like we were going to war, but if I said anything, Otsuki-san would definitely stare at me with her demonic expression, so I kept it in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right. It’s going to be a long race from here on out, so we need to replenish our nutritional needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede-san clenched her fists tightly as if to inspire herself. They often said that shopping for girls was a long process, but how long did they plan to spend deciding on a single swimsuit? Yeah, that was another thing I couldn’t talk about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm… Which one is the best? They’re all cute, but will I be able to find one that suits me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikaido groaned as she stared at her phone. Nikaido had been like this the whole way here. I guessed from the glimpse of the screen that she was researching this year’s swimsuit trends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know what you’re worried about, but I’m sure Nikaido will look good in any of them, so don’t worry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is that so? I wonder if I can find a cute swimsuit that suits me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was foul to ask in such a tearful voice, Nikaido. Was your usual prince missing on a trip or something?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s it. If you insist that much, I’ll help you out too. I don’t know if it’ll be helpful, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Choosing a swimsuit for Kaede-san is a definite matter. In the meantime, I can also help Nikaido choose her swimsuit if she wants. Even if it was on the side of that, helping one person or two people was the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Then I guess I’ll take your word for it. Fufu, choose a swimsuit that suits me, Yoshizumi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikaido’s expression brightened as she gave me a fresh smile, and I was unexpectedly struck by it. If Kaede-san’s smile was like a benevolent sun that brightly illuminated the world, Nikaido’s smile was like a golden moon in a clear and tranquil night sky. They were contrasting, but what they had in common was that they were both beautiful and cute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuya-kun, please help me choose a bathing suit, too! I’ll get sulky if you keep staring at Nikaido-san!” Kaede-san tugged at my sleeve, interrupting my thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Ah, I know, Kaede-san. I’ll help you out. But please make sure it’s a normal one, okay? Don’t choose something too tight, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry. I’ll choose a swimsuit that’s cute and will make Yuya-kun thrilled. Or does Yuya-kun prefer a school swimsuit? He was very happy when I gave him a massage in the bath…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sto──────p! No more of that, Kaede-san!” I shouted in a panic, but it was already too late. Kaede-san’s comment had firmly reached Otsuki-san’s ears, and her eyes began to sparkle with curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kaede-chan, let’s listen to that story in detail and carefully over lunch, shall we?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like a famous detective chasing down a suspect, Otsuki-san zipped up to Kaede-san. If this were a drama, the suspect would be on the scene trying to escape,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe… it was the same school swimsuit I used to wear in junior high school, so it was a little tight and embarrassing, but I was happy that Yuya-kun was pleased with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This culprit did not run away, but rather wiggled his body and said so a little shyly. Yeah, you did mention you were light-mouthed toward me, but Kaede-san was a little too light-mouthed, wasn’t she?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh…that’s surprising. I didn’t know Yuya had a hobby like that,” Shinji said as if he was impressed and patted me on the shoulder. What was with that meaningful expression? It was irresistibly annoying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me tell you something, how would Shinji react if Ootsuki-san suddenly appeared in front of him wearing a school swimsuit? Would he remain calm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a foolish question, Yuya. If Akiho-san appeared in front of me wearing her junior high school swimsuit, my consciousness would ascend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji gave a crisp wink and thumbs up. Yes, he said it with his chest out and a cool gesture, but the line was just too uncool. Well, it was only natural that even Shinji would be affected when approached by Otsuki-san, who had bigger fruits than Kaede-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wish I had as much as Kazuha-san. My mom is big too, so one day I will too…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, what are you talking about, Nikaido-senpai. You’re on Kaede-neesan’s side, aren’t you? I’m going to beat you up, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pretended not to hear as Nikaido compared her own chest with Kaede-san’s and Ootsuki-san’s before muttering pathetically while Yui-chan plunged in with tears of blood. If I could, I would run away right now.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t do it, Akiho! Forgive me no more! It’s really embarrassing!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh… why do you hate it? Once in a while is fine! Give up and accept my ah, Shin-kun!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you ask me what in the world was happening, all I could answer was, as one could see, the couple of bakappuru (stupid couple) were in their bakappuru element in the family restaurant where they entered to fill their bellies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a big smile on her face, Otsuki-san thrusted a pancake at Shinji to feed him. I clasped my hands together inwardly, feeling sympathy for my best friend, who was looking at me for help with a red face. It was karma. It was his punishment for laughing at Kaede’s pampering and my trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Kaede was asked by Otsuki-san to film the exchange between the two of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. So this is the power of the first generation bakappuru of Meiwadai High School? I had indeed misjudged. This is a level comparable to Kaede-neesan and Yoshizumi senpai…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan ate her pasta with an impressed look on her face, while Nikaido drank her iced coffee, shrugging off her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be called a ‘bakappuru’ (stupid couple). Or rather, Yui-chan, are you saying that Kaede and I are on the same level as this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I ordered the hamburger steak for lunch. Eating at a place like this was still expensive and I felt sorry for the restaurant, but Kaede’s homemade food tasted better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, in Yoshizumi-senpai’s case, the two of them are still better because they are flirting with each other everywhere. On the contrary, that’s the only difference.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nikaido-san, you’re saying that Kaede and I are a better couple than you? Do you honestly not understand that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? What are you saying, Yoshizumi? You and Hitotsuba-san are more than just a couple, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nikaido-senpai is right. You look like you’re different, but Yoshizumi-senpai and Kaede-neesan are pretty much the same, you know? They’re already famous among the first-year students, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They shrug their shoulders at the same time. While me, Nikaido and Yui-chan were having a casual conversation like this, Shinji and Ootsuki-san’s marital comedy continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… Aren’t you ashamed of yourself, Akiho? If it’s just the two of you, I can’t believe you’re doing this in front of everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well…, something like seeing Kaede and Yoshi making out every day has paralyzed your senses, so we’re not embarrassed at all, isn’t that it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. That means it’s Yuya’s fault. Oh, Hitotsuba-san. Can you at least do me a favor and stop taking… pictures?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede, who had already finished her lunch, pointed the camera lens of her phone at Shinji and Otsuki-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ufff… Don’t worry, Higurashi-kun. I didn’t take any pictures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede, I wouldn’t trust you one bit when you say ‘Please rest assured’ with an evil smile on your face. As evidence of that, Kaede raised the corners of her mouth, “Please don’t worry. I’ve taken a video of you and Akiho-chan having fun together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, she pronounced his death sentence. At that moment, Shinji’s expression became like Munch’s cry. I should have come to that possibility when I didn’t hear the sound from the shutter. Unfortunately, she had already captured Otsuki-san feeding you several times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuya! You knew that Hitotsuba-san was filming the video! And yet you didn’t tell me, that’s just too much!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahahaha. Otsuki-san said that too, right? Once in a while, it’s good to flirt to your heart’s content. It’s called Bureikoh, Shinji-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TN: Bureikoh – a position where you can speak and act freely without considering the pressure and authority of others.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Putting aside whether it’s the right way to use Bureiko, I don’t want you to flirt to your heart’s content, Yoshizumi,” Nikaido sighed as if she had enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I like it. I wish Kaede-neesan had fed me too. She used to do that for me a lot in the past.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan, who finished her large bowl of pasta while complaining, began to eat the parfait she ordered as an after-meal dessert. There weren’t many girls for whom the phrase ‘another stomach for sweet’ fit so well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yui-chan has always been a good eater. And yet her body shape hasn’t changed, so I envy her,” Kaede said with a bitter smile, while Yui-chan blurted out, staring off into the distance with her highlight-less eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve got the same small body shape no matter how much I eat anyway. Unlike Kaede-neesan and Otsuki- senpai, I can’t have a nice body.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan sighed loudly and chewed on her parfait with a big mouthful. Nikaido sitting beside her nodded her head as if to comfort the cute junior. No, no, no, Nikaido-san, if anything, you were also a girl on Kaede’s side, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because among the boys, Kaede, Nikaido, and Otsuki-san were secretly called the three most beautiful girls in Meiwadai. Compared to Kaede and Otsuki-san, who were overwhelmingly popular with the boys, Nikaido enjoyed wide popularity among both men and women and the fact that she received more Valentine’s Day chocolates than she could hold in February was proof of that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nikaido-senpai is also just like Kaede-neesan, right? There are many girls who fell in love with Nikaido-senpai at first sight at the ball game tournament the other day! Also, Nikaido-senpai has a big enough chest too! In other words, she’s my enemy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan, who was howling, was sadly the slowest to develop among the members. However, it was not that she had the body of a toddler, it was just that compared to Kaede and the others, she was the most stunted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t cry, Yui-chan. I’m sure you’ll be just like Kaede someday!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaah! Yoshizumi-senpai is the worst! I’m so hurt, so I’ll order this special pancake as Yoshizumi-senpai’s treat! I’m sorry…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Yui-chan! Are you still going to eat them? Or rather, could you please stop trying to order the expensive ones!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, Yuya-kun. I can’t defend you this time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede gave up on me, and I had to buy Yui-chan a pancake that cost nearly 1,000 yen. It was too painful an expense for me, as I was having a hard time finding the money to pay for it.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After an unexpected splurge, today’s main event was about to begin. The big battle to conquer summer. Let us not let our guard down, let us not be complacent, and let us make a spirited choice. Otsuki-san was exaggerating as we were just going to buy swimsuits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What nonsense! Listen, Yuya-kun. This is the big game of a lifetime! Whoever controls the swimsuit selection will control the summer!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right, Yoshi! In order to enjoy the Okinawa sea to the fullest, you have to get into that shape! That’s the reason why I’m coming, Shin-kun!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Otsuki-san, breathing hard, took Shinji’s arm and forced him into the swimwear section. It was almost as nerve-wracking for us boys to enter the brightly skin-colored store, which was mostly occupied by female customers, as it was to go to the lingerie section. I’d never been there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Yuya-kun. I also need some new underwear, so will you go with me to look at some after this? I’d like Yuya-kun to help me choose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m definitely not going to pick out underwear, even if it’s swimsuits, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just passing by that corner alone made me nervous, but going in there with them and choosing one was a hardship. I mean, I really wanted to run away from even the swimsuit selection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akiho, please don’t pull my arm! I mean, do we really have to be together? Me and Yuya will be waiting outside, so I think it would be more fun for the four of us to go see the show!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji was resisting desperately before the entrance, but Otsuki-san gave him a big smile that made him say whether or not he wanted to, “I want Shin-kun to choose me, and I want Kaede and Ai-chan to see Yoshi too! Or what is it, Shin-kun and Yosshi are small boys who can’t listen to a maiden’s healthy request? If that’s the case…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. All right, Akiho. I’ll go, I’ll go with Yuya, don’t pull me! Come on, everyone, let’s go!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh! A couple of idiots walked enthusiastically into the store, raising their fists in the air. Well then, I’m going to help Kaede choose a swimsuit. I held out my hand toward Kaede. With a slight blush on her cheeks, Kaede-san took my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph. I’m looking forward to seeing what kind of swimsuit Yuya-kun will choose for me. I can tell Yuya-kun’s taste in bed… from this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, there was no point in rephrasing it. I intertwined my fingers and squeezed them together while muttering in my mind that I would do my best to choose a swimsuit as Kaede’s boyfriend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe. Let’s go then. Cute or sexy? I’m okay with either one!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes. First, let’s see what kind of things are available and then we’ll decide. Come on, Nikaido, stop looking at your phone, and let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to Nikaido, who was still checking trends on her phone at this stage of his life and beckoned her over. She replied absent-mindedly taking my hand and squeezing it, wondering what I was thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“───!!!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede opened her mouth wide like Munch’s cry in surprise, I stiffened not knowing what had happened, and Nikaido’s face turned red like a boiled egg after exactly three seconds from her stunned face not understanding what she had done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gosh, sorry Yoshizumi!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikaido defended herself while flapping her hands. Yeah, she was in an interesting state of panic, even though I was surprised, but I guess it was a subconscious reaction because I called out to her while she was eagerly looking at her phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, well, never mind. Otsuki-san might start a commotion, so let’s go quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm, yeah… I’m sorry about it, Kaede-san. That, I didn’t have any other intention, or this is more like an accident, I didn’t want to get between Yoshizumi and Kaede-san!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, Nikaido entered the store as if to escape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The girls in my class are all calling Nikaido-senpai a prince, but seeing her like that, she’s more of a novice maiden, isn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan said with a face like a hunter who had discovered the true identity of a rare beast. Yes, that was right. Yui-chan was right, everyone called Nikaido a cool girl or a Takarazuka-type girl, but she also has a side that liked cute characters, so if that part of her became known, she would become more popular, wouldn’t she?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s what’s called ‘gap moe’. Hmmm… With such a strong hand, how come… I’ll have to ask him directly to confirm this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mumbling something incomprehensible to herself, Yui-chan followed Nikaido. She was a busy girl, wasn’t she?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s time for us to go too, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Etto, Yuya-kun. I’ve decided. Let’s go for the sexy swimsuit. I won’t lose!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede suddenly started to burn with a fighting spirit. No, who would you say you were going to compete with? In my opinion, Kaede was the best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I got myself back on track to choose Kaede’s swimsuit, but Kaede took me by the hand and brought me to a corner with an agitated collection of things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm… This is troubling… Which one do you think is better, Yuya-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede held up two swimsuits for me to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One was a one-shoulder bikini. The shoulders were boldly exposed, so Kaede’s beautiful skin like fresh snow was generously shown off while adding sexiness to it, which would surely increase her attractiveness. The fluffy design and pink color of this bikini definitely suited Kaede’s figure and provided her with a cute look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other was a halter-neck bikini. The cross straps emphasized her cleavage, and the back ribbon boldly revealed her backside. However, while the upper part of the bikini was designed to make the wearer look like a charming adult woman, the lower part was a flared skirt that gave the wearer a cute, girlish look, creating a dangerous imbalance. The color was pure white, perfect for Kaede’s skin. It would also go well with her tanned skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmmm. In terms of Yuya-kun’s reaction, this white swimsuit looks better, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh… Well, I certainly like that one better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This back ribbon is also cute, and this one is designed to be enjoyed whether Yuya-kun is standing in front or behind!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, you can enjoy Kaede’s sexiness whether she was standing in front or behind, so my heart was never going to stop pounding! That was not what I meant…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, the white one was boldly exposed only on the back, but it was no problem to just put a cardigan or something over the top, and I think doing so would add to the mature and sexy woman feel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong with you suddenly shutting up, Kaede? Did I say something weird?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no… I was just a little surprised that Yuya-kun was thinking that much after what you said. I see, adult-type sexy. I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mmmm, Kaede placed her hand on her chin and started wondering about her action. As for me, I thought I had given her the best advice I could, so I’d leave the final decision to her. Now, what about the prince?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… Yoshizumi. Just the right place. This swimsuit was recommended to me by the clerk, what do you think?”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikaido seemed to have been looking for me and found me immediately. The swimsuit that the clerk had recommended to her was a denim bikini. The white background with aqua-blue floral patterned lace made her bosom look gorgeous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast to the cute frontal view, the back of the swimsuit was exposed, which made Nikaido, who was fit and healthy from her basketball training, look even more beautiful. The denim material was also perfect for Nikaido, who was known as a prince. A professional’s choice was indeed perfect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, how is it? I think it’s a little gaudy for me, but I’ve never worn… one with lace before. Hitotsuba-san would perhaps be a good choice for this but for me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Nikaido were a puppy, she would droop her ears and tail right now. In fact, I even had a vision of her looking depressed like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think that swimsuit looks good on you. The denim is cute, of course, and the floral lace is pretty, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Can I wear a cute swimsuit like this too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it obvious? Maybe you’re forgetting yourself because everyone is calling you cool or prince, but Nikaido is cute enough, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was more, she was even called one of the three most beautiful girls in Meiwadai along with Kaede and Otsuki-san. Nikaido may look like a prince, but in reality, she was a maiden with an eye for all things cute. When she sent me a selfie of herself holding up the otter mug I gave her for White Day, along with a message of thanks, I was unexpectedly touched. So she should have some confidence!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo, if Yoshizumi says that much, I think I’ll go with this one… Is there anything else I should buy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like I told Kaede, I think you should have something to wear like a coat. We won’t be able to stay in just our swimsuits during the break. We’ll have to protect ourselves from the sun. I’m also going to wear a shirt or something too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you say so. Yeah, I’ll go look for some more then. Thanks, Yoshizumi!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Humming in contrast to Kaede, Nikaido went to ransack the store again. I guess my part in this was complete now. Let’s see how Otsuki-san and Shinji were doing, just to tease them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hey Shin, how about this? Don’t you think this frilly thing is cute? And it’s off-the-shoulder and sexy, too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ummm, yeah. I think it’s nice, but don’t you think it’s a little too mature for Akiho? I don’t think you should display all of your shoulders… How about this one-piece dress? I think it’s cute, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? I want to be taller once in a while, too! Oh, Yoshi, you’re in the right place! What do you think of this swimsuit?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The color of the swimsuit that Otsuki-san was trying on as she approached me was a bright wine red. It was a one-color, simple flared bikini with a mature look. The flare made her fruits that surpassed Kaede’s stand out even more voluptuously. Furthermore, the off-the-shoulder design exposed both shoulders, which added a bold and sexy touch to Otsuki-san’s cuteness. In other words, the conclusion was…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine, isn’t it? Both the burgundy color and the off-the-shoulder look good on Otsuki-san. Well, as for Shinji, I’m sure he’s worried about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? What are you worried about, Shin-kun? Oh, maybe you’re thinking that if I wear a cute swimsuit, someone will pick on me or something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Otsuki-san looked Shinji up and down with a devilish smile on her face. My instincts warned me that I would be in trouble if I stayed here any longer, though, “Of course, I’d be worried! It’s the swimsuit I didn’t get to see last year! And it’s not just a regular bikini, it’s a cute, frilly, off-the-shoulder, adult-like swimsuit! I’m sure she’s going to attract guys!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hey, Shin-kun. Your voice is too loud…” Otsuki-san flinched at Shinji’s unusually loud voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure Yuya would understand. On the one hand, you’re happy and excited when your lover wears a bold swimsuit, but you’re also worried that it would attract strange insects, right? Akiho, Kazuha-san, and of course Nikaido-san and everyone else. They are beautiful and cute, so I’m sure there will be a crowd of people… Yuya and I won’t be able to protect them…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He said it quickly, and his shoulders slumped as if he was about to fall to his knees on the spot.  It was not often that this guy exploded with so much emotion, but I understand the feeling painfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph. It’s okay, Yuya-kun, Higurashi-kun. The place where we are staying is a private beach, so the number of guests is limited.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaede approached us with those words. Nikaido and Yui-chan followed behind her. Apparently, all three of them had decided on their swimsuits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a private beach owned by my family. Even if there are other people there besides us, there will be no strange people, and it’s impossible to break in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan said with a smug look on her face. The two of them were family friends. I’d visited them many times, so I knew them pretty well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s all enjoy swimming in the crystal clear, jewel-like blue ocean! Is there anything else you want to do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After this, we discussed our plans to enjoy Okinawa to the fullest besides swimming in the sea. This summer was going to be very lively and fun. But I had no way of knowing that a disturbance awaited us during the summer vacation, which was supposed to be a fun time.</span></p>
