<h3>Chapter 9 &ndash; Detention</h3>

<p class="calibre2">The name of the town where Theo lived was Nemophila, and its east gate was in disarray.</p><p class="calibre2">A certain soldier keeping watch in a high position spotted a large monster far away.</p><p class="calibre2">Its appearance matched the rumored Chimera, and the soldier went to inform the others as fast as possible.</p><p class="calibre2">They grabbed all the armament they could, and went out to confront it, not knowing how long they would be able to hold it back.</p><p class="calibre2">But… What they saw was the body and detached head of the Chimera floating in the air, and a woman and a boy below them.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi and Theo were surrounded by the many soldiers guarding the gate.</p><p class="calibre2">You would think they would be detained on the spot, but most of the soldiers knew Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">But then…</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, why are we being detained?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi without even trying to hide her irritation.</p><p class="calibre2">The two were taken to a cell in the gate.</p><p class="calibre2">Usually they would be handcuffed, but the soldiers knew Theo, and did not find it necessary.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a good decision, since Helvi would have reacted violently had they tried.</p><p class="calibre2">“They want us to stay here while they check to see if that’s the real Chimera.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Then why are they treating us like this…”</p><p class="calibre2">They were not handcuffed, but there were five soldiers inside the cell, and more than ten waiting just outside.</p><p class="calibre2">A soldier would leave and a new one would come in periodically, and Helvi and Theo sat on simple chairs.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-it will be over soon.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was used to unfavorable treatment, and did not even see this as unpleasant, and while usually Helvi did not get angry so easily, she thought that being made to wait there was unfortunate.</p><p class="calibre2">[And here I thought I was going to eat Theo’s cooking… I cannot eat here, and I cannot even fool around with Theo with all these soldiers watching…]</p><p class="calibre2">Being stopped there irritated her quite a bit, and she unintentionally glared at the soldiers in the cell.</p><p class="calibre2">The soldiers were fearful of holding them there.</p><p class="calibre2">Since quite a few knew Theo, they knew very well that he was not capable of defeating a Chimera, so the problem was Helvi, who sat next to him.</p><p class="calibre2">The way she glared at them made them feel as though their hearts were going to stop beating.</p><p class="calibre2">They kept rotating the soldiers inside the cell because Helvi’s glaring was making them feel sick.</p><p class="calibre2">A while later, there was a little commotion outside, and someone new entered.</p><p class="calibre2">“Excuse me mister Theo and miss Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">A man with a small mustache, and a rough looking body and face entered. He looked downwards at Theo and Helvi, who were still sitting down.</p><p class="calibre2">“I have something to ask…”</p><p class="calibre2">The man started speaking, but…</p><p class="calibre2">“Your head is too high, kneel.”</p><p class="calibre2">As soon as Helvi said this, the man and the soldiers around them put their knees to the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">They could not withstand the crushing pressure coming from above.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-what is this…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I am manipulating gravity to put pressure above your heads. I can turn you into a clump of flesh if I use my full power, so be thankful that I am holding it back to simply make you kneel.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi while crossing her legs and looking down at the man.</p><p class="calibre2">“I am not going to let you talk down to us after making us wait for so long. Speak, but know your place.”</p><p class="calibre2">The man could not even raise his head to look at Helvi, but still, no matter how much he hated it, he understood that the woman in front of him was above him.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi snapped her fingers, and the pressure disappeared.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now, you can talk to us while kneeling, or you can bring a chair, your choice.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Hey you, bring me a chair.”</p><p class="calibre2">The soldiers hurriedly brought a chair, while Theo looked on in shock.</p><p class="calibre2">[Theo is so cute with his round eyes wide open, unable to follow what is happening…]</p><p class="calibre2">One person softened after looking at Theo.</p></div>
