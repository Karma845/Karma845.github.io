<h3>Chapter 28 &ndash; Start the Fight</h3>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Friendship × Temptation</h2>



<p>Even though I have a girlfriend, I find myself liking another girl.</p>



<p>That’s something only a scumbag would do.</p>



<p>If it were the me from earlier this spring, I would have undoubtedly declared that.</p>



<p>…No, I still believe I’m a scumbag.</p>



<p>But I never expected that I would become that scumbag myself.</p>



<p>Honestly, I never saw it coming.</p>



<p>Anyway, there’s no way I can let Haruka know about these feelings.</p>



<p>I have to keep them hidden in my heart and somehow digest them.</p>



<p>As long as I don’t show them on the surface, it shouldn’t be considered cheating.</p>



<p>I’ll keep it within my heart and crush it.</p>



<p>After all, I don’t hate Haruka or anything.</p>



<p>But… it wasn’t as easy as I thought.</p>



<p>I realized that in the evening after Haruka had gone home.</p>



<p>It was when we finished dinner, and Shigure said this.</p>



<p>“I’ll take a bath first.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>And now, I find myself listening carefully to the sounds coming from the bath where Shigure is.</p>



<p>Sounds of pouring hot water and the sound of placing the washtub.</p>



<p>The sound of water overflowing from the bathtub.</p>



<p>Those sounds convey the reality that Shigure is just a door away, naked and without a lock, and my heart starts pounding.</p>



<p>…Yes, that’s right.</p>



<p>I’m living alone with Shigure under the same roof.</p>



<p>The time I spend with Shigure, compared to the time with my girlfriend Haruka, is tens or even hundreds of times longer.</p>



<p>In such an environment, trying to suppress my feelings for Shigure in my heart, isn’t the difficulty level way too high?</p>



<p>Just to clarify, I am trying my best, you know.</p>



<p>Even now. I’m not eavesdropping because I want to.</p>



<p>If I were to compare it, it’s like when a random song phrase starts playing in your mind and you can’t stop it, and it loops endlessly. I think everyone has had that kind of experience. It’s similar to that. To the point where I can’t do anything about it, my auditory sense is completely captivated.</p>



<p>I’ve tried berating myself, saying, “Don’t do something creepy!” and attempted to focus on my studies, but the notebook spread out on the table remains blank. It’s as if I can’t concentrate at all.</p>



<p>“…!”</p>



<p>And then, with a click, the sound of the door opening sent my nervousness and excitement to their peak.</p>



<p>A curtain hung in front of the bathroom door to create a changing area. From the small gap beneath it, Shigure’s white feet peeked out.</p>



<p>There is no longer even a door between us.</p>



<p>There is only a slightly thick cloth.</p>



<p>Ignoring the voice of reason that says, “Don’t look, don’t look,” my gaze is irresistibly drawn to Shigure’s white feet peeking from about five centimeters below the curtain.</p>



<p>Cute toes. Beautiful nails. A slightly blushing heel.</p>



<p>Every time they move a little, my body heats up, sweat pours out, and my throat becomes dry.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry for going ahead of you, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>Eventually, the curtain opens, and Shigure comes out dressed in a cool sleepwear combination of a light blue camisole and white hot pants.</p>



<p>It’s one of Shigure’s classic outfits.</p>



<p>So I’ve seen it countless times, nothing new.</p>



<p>And yet, my consciousness is drawn to it.</p>



<p>Her flushed face after getting out of the bath.</p>



<p>Her wet and disheveled hair clinging to the forehead.</p>



<p>Thin clothing to endure the tropical night in our house without air conditioning.</p>



<p>It’s a side of Shigure that only I know, unimaginable to those who only know her at school.</p>



<p>It’s so captivating…</p>



<p>“Hmm? Is there something on my face? I just washed it.”</p>



<p>Shigure’s big round eyes reflect my dumbfounded gaze as I stare at her after her bath.</p>



<p>Startled, I instinctively looked away.</p>



<p>“N-No! It’s nothing…!”</p>



<p>What an idiot I am, getting so captivated…!</p>



<p>“Well, then, I’ll take a bath too. It was hot today, so I sweated a lot, Ahaha.”</p>



<p>“…Sure, take your time.”</p>



<p>I close the curtain, as if escaping from Shigure’s gaze.</p>



<p>I discard my clothes, enter the bathroom, and close the door.</p>



<p>Leaning against the door, I let out a heavy sigh.</p>



<p>“…I’m too flustered, seriously.”</p>



<p>Until yesterday, I never paid this much attention to Shigure taking a bath or her appearance after the bath.</p>



<p>But now, even the tips of her toes make my heart race.</p>



<p>Where did all the experience I’ve gained as her “brother” over the past few months go?</p>



<p>…But, while lamenting that fact, in a way, this is only natural.</p>



<p>I mean, not too long ago, I didn’t have a girlfriend, and I hadn’t even held a girl’s hand since entering middle school.</p>



<p>Just talking to girls made me tense up, and I was so conscious of being of the opposite sex that I ended up maintaining an unnatural social distance. Although I tried to be a gentleman, from an outsider’s perspective, I was overly conscious to the point of being creepy. That’s the kind of person I used to be.</p>



<p>As someone like me, being under the same roof with Shigure, a girl who is a beauty from every angle, and casually bantering with her, enjoying meals together, and even sleeping side by side, I probably justified it by thinking, “I get nervous because Shigure looks so much like Haruka.” I just put a stop to my thoughts in that area.</p>



<p>But now, I can no longer see Haruka in Shigure.</p>



<p>Shigure is Shigure, and she can’t be seen as anyone else.</p>



<p>She is a girl overflowing with a charm that resembles Haruka but is completely different.</p>



<p>In this state, I can’t even meet her gaze anymore.</p>



<p>It’s like the gold plating has worn off.</p>



<p>With no more excuses, my raw humanity is being tested, and I guess this is just what I am.</p>



<p>But…</p>



<p>“…I shouldn’t let that show on the surface…”</p>



<p>What happened earlier was really not good.</p>



<p>Not only getting captivated by Shigure after her bath, but my reaction afterward was the worst.</p>



<p>I was a nervous wreck, suspiciously so.</p>



<p>There’s a feeling that sprouted within me, a feeling that Haruka must never find out. </p>



<p>But Haruka isn’t the only one who should never know about this. It’s also Shigure.</p>



<p>Because Shigure is dangerously in love with me. …It might sound conceited to say that, but it’s the truth, considering how much Shigure has shown her feelings towards me.</p>



<p>So if Shigure were to find out that I’m conscious of her in the same way, she would probably become unstoppable. It would be a reproduction of that beast-like kiss that erased my first kiss. This house would turn into a savannah.</p>



<p>Therefore, I must thoroughly avoid situations like that.</p>



<p>I can’t afford to be flustered like earlier.</p>



<p>I have to hide the fact that the gold plating on my heart has worn off.</p>



<p>I’ll try to spend my days as usual.</p>



<p>Now, let’s wash my face and change my mindset.</p>



<p>I pick up the washtub to scoop up water.</p>



<p>“…!”</p>



<p>But then, it hit me.</p>



<p>Just a few minutes ago, Shigure was soaking in this very bathtub.</p>



<p>“…No, no, no. That’s exactly the kind of thing I shouldn’t be thinking about, damn it.”</p>



<p>It’s just the water that Shigure bathed in, that’s all.</p>



<p>Am I a pervert? I don’t have that kind of fetish.</p>



<p>I’ll ignore it and splash the water as usual. Splash, splash.</p>



<p>We’ve been living together for months now!</p>



<p>I scold myself. But…</p>



<p>“W-Well, maybe I’ll just take a shower today. Yeah. It’s hot…”</p>



<p>I’m pathetic.</p>



<p>Can I really keep hiding my feelings for Shigure like this?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>In the end, I finished bathing with just a shower and stepped out of the bathroom.</p>



<p>After changing clothes, I headed to the refrigerator and took out some barley tea to quench my dry throat, which was worsened by unnecessary tension.</p>



<p>While doing so, Shigure, who had been watching TV in the living room, called out to me.</p>



<p>“Onii-san, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>Moreover, with a mischievous smile that felt very Shigure-like.</p>



<p>…Yeah. It definitely can’t be anything good. </p>



<p>While feeling an unpleasant certainty, I replied as usual, conscious of my everyday demeanor.</p>



<p>“Hm? What is it?”</p>



<p>Then, Shigure patted her thighs lightly and said,</p>



<p>“Come sit on my lap. I’ll clean your ears for you.”</p>



<p>“H-Ha!? W-Why!?”</p>



<p>W-What’s with this sudden request?</p>



<p>Moreover, can I even do something so embarrassing?</p>



<p>“I-I don’t need that. It’s something couples do.”</p>



<p>“Oh, come on. It’s not like that at all. My mom used to do it for me, and I’ve done it for Nee-san too.”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s different between girls.”</p>



<p>“Between girls… Hey-hey, Onii-san. What are you thinking, getting all dirty-minded over ear cleaning? If we’re family, it’s normal to do it, right?”</p>



<p>Shigure laughed with a teasing tone. </p>



<p>Uh, maybe I was overreacting a bit? </p>



<p>If we were close, maybe siblings would do it too.</p>



<p>#imgtag</p>



<p>But, but… Shigure’s outfit is so revealing, probably to stay cool in the tropical night. </p>



<p>Her pure white and beautiful thighs are exposed. Putting my cheek on them… that’s definitely lewd!</p>



<p>If I do something like that, I’ll definitely start liking Shigure again. </p>



<p>I think such lewd things are not right!</p>



<p>“Sure, I’ve had my mom do it for me when I was a child, but that’s a story from the past. I’m old enough to clean my own ears, you know.”</p>



<p>“Then I’ll blackmail you. If you don’t want Nee-san to receive a picture of Onii-san’s ugly sleeping face, behave and come sit on my lap quietly.”</p>



<p>“Wha!?”</p>



<p>Shigure smirks and shows me the unflattering picture of me sleeping that she took with her smartphone. When did she…!</p>



<p>“I want to clean Onii-san’s ears. So, Onii-san’s opinion doesn’t matter. Come on, it’s fine, right? Or Nee-san would be so surprised, you know?”</p>



<p>“You always resort to these things…!”</p>



<p>“Even though I said I would stop blackmailing you, Onii-san wasted that opportunity. In that case, I don’t need to hold back, do I? Hmm, I wonder if Nee-san would be pleased with the drooling side of yours instead?”</p>



<p>“Fine! I get it! Now delete that picture right away!”</p>



<p>The consequences of not being able to reject Shigure immediately became apparent. </p>



<p>Shigure began using that fact as her justification.</p>



<p>In reality, if this weakness is brought up, there’s no way I can resist.</p>



<p>Yes, I’m left with no choice but to do as Shigure says and lay my head on her thighs. </p>



<p>Those thighs that are as white and soft-looking as freshly peeled boiled eggs.</p>



<p>Ugh…</p>



<p>Idiot, stop fluttering with excitement.</p>



<p>I’m not doing this because I want to. </p>



<p>I’m being coerced into it and reluctantly accepting the lap pillow.</p>



<p>It’s to protect my relationship with Haruka. It’s to avoid making Haruka sad.</p>



<p>Yes, this lap pillow is for Haruka’s sake. </p>



<p>Absolutely, it’s not because I want it to happen.</p>



<p>So, I won’t be happy just because it’s bothersome.</p>



<p>Absolutely not. I won’t feel good at all.</p>



<p>I repeat these words to myself, creating excuses, justifications, and theoretical defenses to protect my heart like barricades. </p>



<p>Then, with maximum effort, I maintain composure and make a casual remark like, “If you’re going to do it, do it properly.” I gently place my head on Shigure’s thigh, making it obvious that I’m calm and composed.</p>



<p>In an instant, the barricades I meticulously built are shattered.</p>



<p>Ah, ah, ah~~~</p>



<p>This… this is bad.</p>



<p>What is this incredibly pleasurable sensation?</p>



<p>It’s as soft as it appears, yet not excessively so. It has a firm elasticity that properly supports me. </p>



<p>The smoothness of her skin feels so good against my cheek that it’s as if there are no pores at all. </p>



<p>But what’s really dangerous is… the warmth.</p>



<p>It’s absolutely amazing.</p>



<p>The comforting warmth that can only be felt from another person’s skin, their flesh. Perhaps it’s because Shigure just took a bath, but the clean scent of soap and the faint aroma of sweat mix together perfectly, creating an intoxicating aroma that rises…</p>



<p>“Now, I’ll insert the earpick, so please stay still.”</p>



<p>“…!”</p>



<p>And then, the final blow came.</p>



<p>Shigure inserted the earpick into my ear. </p>



<p>A tingling sensation penetrated my ear, invading the depths of my body.</p>



<p>Unpredictable stimulation caressed a part of me that was far more sensitive than my skin.</p>



<p>It was a completely different sensation from when I clean my ears myself, and I couldn’t help but shiver.</p>



<p>Ah… This is no good. I clearly understand that this is wrong.</p>



<p>Because it feels good. It feels too good. </p>



<p>I… I’m falling for Shigure at an incredible speed. </p>



<p>It’s dangerous. If this continues…</p>



<p>“Alright. Now, Onii-san… can’t escape anymore.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Wait a minute.</p>



<p>My mind feels hazy, and I almost missed what she just said. </p>



<p>What did she mean by “can’t escape anymore”? </p>



<p>What is that unsettling phrase?</p>



<p>“Hey, just now—”</p>



<p>“Ah. Don’t move. See?”</p>



<p>“—Uh…!”</p>



<p>The curved part of the earpick scratched the delicate membrane of my ear, creating a ticklish and stimulating sensation. </p>



<p>It was a reminder of how defenseless I was at that moment. </p>



<p>Because right now, I couldn’t even move my neck.</p>



<p>In other words, it meant that no matter what Shigure did, I couldn’t escape…</p>



<p>“You see? It’s dangerous, so please stay still. That’s right, just stay there… and cooperate with my interrogation, okay?”</p>



<p>“I-I-interrogation!?”</p>



<p>With those ominous words, the sweet excitement from before turned into a chilling sensation.</p>



<p>The fact that I couldn’t even turn my head to see Shigure’s expression intensified the feeling of dread.</p>



<p>“Hehe. There’s no need to be so scared. I just have something I want to ask you, Onii-san. But if I asked normally, it seemed like you could escape, so I went through this little trouble.”</p>



<p>“W-What’s up with that…? What do you want to ask me that you went through all this trouble for…?”</p>



<p>“Why didn’t you push me away earlier this afternoon?”</p>



<p>My blood ran cold in an instant. </p>



<p>Because that question, if it weren’t for the earpick lodged in my ear, I would have run away without a second thought. It was the last thing I wanted to be asked right now.</p>



<p>“I thought I made an attractive proposition for Onii-san, who loves Nee-san so much. I didn’t intend to make difficult demands. I just asked you to make a small, simple gesture of extending your elbow, and you could have ‘started over’ with Nee-san. Didn’t you say you wanted to ‘start over’? So, hey? Why didn’t you?”</p>



<p>…!!!</p>



<p>C-Calm down! </p>



<p>I need to stay composed! Don’t let the panic show on my face. Don’t let it reflect in my attitude.</p>



<p>I desperately remind myself. </p>



<p>Because if it’s known that I… that I’ve fallen for Shigure herself, not as a replacement for Haruka, it’s the end.</p>



<p>If that happens, it’s… I’ll be attacked, just like that night of the first kiss. I have to come up with some excuse that Shigure can accept and divert the situation.</p>



<p>“…You… fell in love with me, or something like that.”</p>



<p>“~~~!!!!”</p>



<p>W-Wait… Does this mean it’s over?</p>



<p>Because her tone has changed from a question to a statement. </p>



<p>It’s oozing with conviction. There’s no insurance to protect me from this point onward.</p>



<p>No, wait, hold on. Why am I giving up so easily?</p>



<p>It’s true that Shigure may have some level of certainty. </p>



<p>But the fact that she’s trying to draw out my words means it’s not absolute yet.</p>



<p>Maybe. Probably. Let’s go with that! </p>



<p>So don’t give up. I need to come up with a believable excuse that can make it seem like I didn’t reject Shigure because I’ve fallen for her. Come on, I can do it! It’s time to put my brain, which I’ve studied so hard, to work now!</p>



<p>“Hmm? Why are you staying silent? Could it be that your earwax is blocking your ears and you can’t hear my voice? Well, then I’ll have to clean it thoroughly, even in the inner parts.”</p>



<p>Uh, ah! No, no! It’s no good. </p>



<p>Being touched inside my ear with precise timing and force distracts me from my thoughts!</p>



<p>“You’re flinching. Your eyes are squinting. Onii-san, you look like you’re feeling good.”</p>



<p>“~~~,”</p>



<p>The sweet pain-like stimulation of being toyed with inside my ear, the warmth of Shigure’s thigh, and the sweet scent wafting from there all make my head feel hazy.</p>



<p>“Onii-san, you know? Earlier, I said I invited you for ear cleaning to hear what you had to say, but the truth is, I wanted to do something like this for you even without a reason.”</p>



<p>Lost in the comfortable drowsiness, my consciousness becomes scattered, and I no longer want to think about anything…</p>



<p>“You know, there are many things I want to do for you, Onii-san. I want you to know how much I love you. I want to become even closer with you. …If you feel the same way and that’s why you didn’t reject me, I want to hear it from your own mouth. Then we can become even closer.”</p>



<p>My foggy thoughts are being filled with a viscous poison flowing from my ears. </p>



<p>The sweet, sweet poison seeps into my brain.</p>



<p>“Onii-san. Don’t you want to be ‘close’ with me?”</p>



<p>So it was a verb… Being “close,” being intimate with Shigure.</p>



<p>It has an incredibly lewd resonance. </p>



<p>And yet, that’s precisely why… it’s an irresistibly attractive sound.</p>



<p>Of course, I don’t want to be close with just anyone. </p>



<p>But with Shigure, precisely because she’s Shigure… even I…</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>…If, if. If I were to nod now, would we really become close? </p>



<p>In this small house where there are no barriers or locked doors to separate us.</p>



<p>When I become honest with the affection she directs at me. It feels so blissful to imagine, but…</p>



<p>“…That’s not… possible.”</p>



<p>I said it as if squeezing the words out. </p>



<p>What made me say that was the smile I saw on Haruka’s face earlier. </p>



<p>Don’t betray that smile. Don’t make her sad. </p>



<p>No matter how drawn I am to Shigure, I am Haruka’s boyfriend.</p>



<p>“The reason I didn’t push you away earlier… It was just because I was afraid I might accidentally hurt you. There’s no deeper meaning to it. It’s a misunderstanding on Shigure’s part.”</p>



<p>“…I see. So that’s how it is. Too bad.”</p>



<p>Shigure said with a disappointed tone in response to my answer, and she gently pulled out the earpick. </p>



<p>It may have been a flimsy reason, but it seems I managed to deceive her. </p>



<p>I heaved a sigh of relief and…</p>



<p>“Even so, I still love you, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>In an instant, I nearly cried out at the breath that brushed against my ear accompanied by a whisper.</p>



<p>Startled, I lifted my face, and Shigure smiled brightly as she said, </p>



<p>“Okay. Now, turn around so I can clean the other side.”</p>



<p>…Did Shigure really not notice my true feelings?</p>



<p>Nothing can be discerned from her smile that seems to accept everything about me. </p>



<p>The only thing I understand is that she loves me. </p>



<p>That’s the only thing that… painfully comes across.</p>



<p>Despite my dishonest lies and selfish words, her affection remains unwavering, always by my side.</p>



<p>The intensity of that devotion stirs something deep in my heart, something I had decided to wither away.</p>



<p>Once again, I thought to myself. </p>



<p>Can I really let these sincere feelings wash over me while suppressing the budding emotions for Shigure deep within my heart?</p>



<p>To be honest, I felt completely and utterly incapable of doing so.</p>
