<h3>Chapter 6 &ndash; Urge to Kill</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Theo was a little surprised when they spoke and looked their way.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… Carl.”</p><p class="calibre2">It was the leader of the party that periodically accepted quests with Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">Most parties would expel him and never work with him again, but this one was different. He was expelled by them countless times, but when they needed him, they would call him again. The pay never matched the work he did, and Theo did not see them as the kind of people he wanted to work with.</p><p class="calibre2">“It never even crossed my mind that a guy like you could be the fiance of a beauty like that! Right you guys?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah, she’s wasted on you!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Seriously!”</p><p class="calibre2">Said the three men, paying no heed to the people around them.</p><p class="calibre2">If they looked around for even a second, they would see Helvi, Fiore, and the other receptionists intensely glaring at them.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was not good at dealing with them, so he did not know what was going on around them either.</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-you’re right, she’s way too good for me…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yeah! So…”</p><p class="calibre2">Carl put his arm around Theo, his weight pressing down his small body, and whispered quietly enough for the others to not hear.</p><p class="calibre2">“Lend us that woman.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“It can just be one night at first. We always take you with us on quests, right?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Carl while grinning. The other men were also grinning, surely thinking the same thing.</p><p class="calibre2">Carl spoke too quietly for Fiore to hear… But more than loudly enough for a devil like Helvi, and an urge to kill welled up inside her.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-Helvi…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s expression remained unchanged, but there was an intense pressure coming from her.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore knew it was not directed at herself, but could not help but be afraid.</p><p class="calibre2">[Ah… It has been a while. It truly has been a while since I have felt an urge to kill from the bottom of my heart… Damn you.]</p><p class="calibre2">Surely, a devil like Helvi had killed hundreds of humans, but only a few were killed because she truly wanted them dead.</p><p class="calibre2">Most were humans that summoned her through a contract, and were killed as a result of its terms. Helvi felt no emotion towards them.</p><p class="calibre2">Was she really that upset because a feeble human was trying to violate her?</p><p class="calibre2">No, that was not it.</p><p class="calibre2">[Humiliating my Theo…?]</p><p class="calibre2">The Theo that formed a contract with her.</p><p class="calibre2">Her… Husband.</p><p class="calibre2">[I will kill you all.]</p><p class="calibre2">Theo and the trio were completely oblivious to what Helvi was thinking, and continued their conversation.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, hum…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah? Do you have a problem with that? Think of it as thanks for all we’ve done for you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo did not feel like there was much to be thankful for, and after the way they treated him, it was only natural. But they were much stronger than him, and there was no way he could oppose them.</p><p class="calibre2">That was why he followed them on quests even though the pay was small, but this time…</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I’m sorry, but I can’t do that.”</p><p class="calibre2">He took Carl’s arm off him, and lowered his head.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah? Are you serious?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I am! I absolutely can’t do that!”</p><p class="calibre2">He had been putting up with a lot, but now it was causing Helvi a tremendous amount of trouble.</p><p class="calibre2">And…</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi is my w-wife! I won’t let anyone have her!”</p><p class="calibre2">He reached deep inside his heart and rejected the proposal.</p><p class="calibre2">There was no way he could pretend to be alright with this, and he did not want to do it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah!? Who do you think you are!? You know you’re gonna pay for that right!?</p><p class="calibre2">Carl was enraged at Theo’s impudent answer, and taking his arm off himself.</p><p class="calibre2">He hated nothing more than to be looked down upon by people lower than him.</p><p class="calibre2">He raised his arm, and swung it down at Theo, who thought he was about to get hit, so he closed his eyes and lifted his arms to try to protect himself as best he could.</p><p class="calibre2">“Gah…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The impact did not come, no matter how much Theo waited, and Carl groaned as if a monster had hit him.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo slowly opened his eyes, and what he saw was…</p><p class="calibre2">“Ih… Aaaaaah….!? M-my arm…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Carl’s right arm was bent in an unnatural way.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not just bent, there were protrusions coming from the elbow that were visible even through clothing.</p><p class="calibre2">Perhaps it was bone piercing the skin.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo and the three men had no idea how this happened and who had done it.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore was close, and while she did not know how it happened… She somehow knew who did it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now that is my husband.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? Helvi!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was looking at Carl’s arm in blank amazement, and was hugged from behind by Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">Her voluptuous chest pressed against his back, and a sweet aroma reached his nostrils.</p><p class="calibre2">“I am so happy you spoke like that for my sake.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? I didn’t do anything…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo tried to deny it, but Helvi placed her index finger on his lips.</p><p class="calibre2">“I have fallen in love with you all over again, Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi…”</p><p class="calibre2">He felt her eyes on his head, turned around to look at her, but it was as though he was being sucked in by her pupils. He could not say anything.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi smiled, but on the inside, her feelings were in disarray.</p><p class="calibre2">[Aah cute cute…! I was really happy when you said that Theo…! Those big, round, pure eyes… That feeling in my finger touching your lips… I might just eat you up right now…]</p><p class="calibre2">She was controlling herself because there were people watching, but were they in Theo’s room, and she would have certainly stolen his lips.</p><p class="calibre2">[Wait, why does a devil like myself have to hold back? It would be a waste to hold back in face of such delicious looking fruit…]</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi retracted what she thought a few seconds ago, looked at Theo’s lips and…</p><p class="calibre2">“Did you do this!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“There’s no way a kid like Theo can do this!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Look at what you did to my arm… Damn you, get ready for… Eek!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Carl yelled the best he could while fighting through the pain, but he was unable to speak the moment he faced Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">The dilated pupils glaring at Carl said it all.</p><p class="calibre2">Speak any further, and I will kill you.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eek…!?</p><p class="calibre2">“H-hey Carl!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Where are you going!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Carl instinctively felt death, and lost his will to fight. All he could think about was running away from that place, and the other two quickly followed suit.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-hum, thank you very much, Helvi!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo seemed to suddenly realize what position he was in, and stepped away from Helvi as his face turned red.</p><p class="calibre2">He could not hear the slightly sad voice that came out of her mouth.</p><p class="calibre2">[Damn, I missed my chance because of them… No, I am his wife, there will be plenty of chances in the future. Next time, surely…]</p><p class="calibre2">Theo had no idea what Helvi was thinking.</p><p class="calibre2">“T-that really scared me…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore was watching closely when Helvi pressed herself against Theo, and with her cheeks turning red, she tried to control her rapidly beating heart.</p></div>
