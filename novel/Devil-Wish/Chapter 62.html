<h3>Chapter 62 &ndash; Horse Ride Home</h3>

<p class="calibre2">After spending half a day coming down the mountain, they made their way towards where they left the horses.</p><p class="calibre2">Thanks to Helvi’s barrier, the horses did not escape or were attacked, meaning they were right where they left them.</p><p class="calibre2">It was getting dark, so they decided to camp for the night and make their way back in the morning.</p><p class="calibre2">After an uneventful dinner, which included a monster attack that none of them found particularly noteworthy, they set up their tents and went to sleep.</p><p class="calibre2">A lot happened that day, so Helvi once again gave Theo a massage.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn, Ahn, It feels, nice…”</p><p class="calibre2">(Yes Theo, let me hear more…)</p><p class="calibre2">(Do it more on that spot Helvi. He let out a really nice voice.)</p><p class="calibre2">(You two…)</p><p class="calibre2">Theo made the same sounds as usual, which pleased the two sitting outside.</p><p class="calibre2">This time Theo did not return the favor with a massage of his own, and the pair outside returned to their tent.</p><p class="calibre2">The next day, the four got on their horses, ready to return to Nemophila.</p><p class="calibre2">There were three horses, but only one was capable of carrying two people. Only Theo could hold the reins to this unruly horse, so obviously on the return trip…</p><p class="calibre2">“Can I get closer Theo? I might fall otherwise.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Thank you. Is this good? Am I in the way?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…! I-it’s fine…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi sat behind Theo, not sideways as she did before, instead opting to straddle normally.</p><p class="calibre2">When she got close to Theo from this position, the back of his head hit her voluptuous chest.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was opposed to this on the way there, as he would be too embarrassed, but since he said he wanted to do something to thank Helvi for helping him many times during the trip, she received permission to ride in this manner.</p><p class="calibre2">However, while Theo was embarrassed, he certainly did not dislike this. He was a man after all, and being so close to the person he liked made him happy.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, he was too happy, too embarrassed, and all too aware of how red his face was as his head and back pressed against Helvi’s soft body.</p><p class="calibre2">Seeing Xena and Celia looking on from the sides only served to make him more embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi, don’t you think that’s a bit much?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, poor Theo… In more ways than one.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi had no intention of listening to either of them, and instead stretched her arms forward and put her hands over Theo’s, so both could hold the reins. This made them stick even closer together.</p><p class="calibre2">“This is my reward, so you have no right to meddle. Just sit there and suck your thumbs.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Muu, not fair.”</p><p class="calibre2">“We want some too.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was too embarrassed to pay attention to what they were saying.</p><p class="calibre2">He had no sexual knowledge before he met Helvi, and could not stay calm when a woman was sticking so close to him.</p><p class="calibre2">And since he had been discovering his sexuality recently, that was all he could think about in a situation like this.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What is it Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-nothing…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo knew he should sit straight to improve his balance, but that meant his back would be pressed against Helvi’s body.</p><p class="calibre2">Also when a certain ‘thing’ happened to a man, they would usually lean forward to conceal it.</p><p class="calibre2">As Theo leaned forward, the area of his back that was in contact with Helvi also decreased.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Is sticking together that bad…”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-no, that’s not it…!”</p><p class="calibre2">It was hidden from Helvi, since she was behind him, but the two looking on from the sides could see ‘that’ very well, and looked on with shock.</p><p class="calibre2">They felt bad for Theo, so they looked away, only peeking occasionally as they said something about it to Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi, hum, don’t you think you should hold back a little?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m sure Theo… Wouldn’t have a problem with that, right? So you should give him a little more space…”</p><p class="calibre2">Their vague words only made Helvi understand even less.</p><p class="calibre2">“What are you two talking about? I just said I have no reason to listen to you did I n…!”</p><p class="calibre2">As Helvi said this, she leaned forward to once again stick close to Theo, when she saw it.</p><p class="calibre2">It was her third time seeing it, but she was still not used to it.</p><p class="calibre2">She let go immediately, as her face became just as red as Theo’s.</p><p class="calibre2">“…I-I’m sorry Theo. Should I sit sideways again?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes, I’m sorry.”</p><p class="calibre2">A lot happened before they could really depart, but Helvi ended up making her way back sitting sideways, just as she did on the way to the mountains.</p><p class="calibre2"></p>
