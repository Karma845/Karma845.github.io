<h3>Chapter 31: </h3>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Frustration × Summer Festival</h2>



<p>In the end, I was forcibly dragged out by Shigure to the fireworks festival.</p>



<p>Before the sun had even fully set, the riverbed which served as the venue was already lined with numerous food stalls, and crowds of people had gathered.</p>



<p>Small children. Families. Groups of friends of the same age. And… men and women who seemed to be couples. </p>



<p>Everyone looked happy.</p>



<p>Seeing that… my mood grew even gloomier. </p>



<p>Originally, today, I should have been here with Haruka, enjoying it just like that—</p>



<p>“Whoa!?”</p>



<p>Suddenly, Shigure yanked on my arm, and I nearly stumbled over.</p>



<p>“What are you doing?”</p>



<p>“What are you doing standing in the middle of the crowd like that? Come on, let’s go to the stalls quickly.”</p>



<p>“I get it, I get it, so stop pulling me!”</p>



<p>Somehow, Shigure was more insistent than usual today. </p>



<p>Was she really that fond of festivals?</p>



<p>“Wow, this view brings back memories. This fireworks festival has always had a lot of stalls, hasn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Maybe it’s the last chance to earn something for the season. For the stall owners, at least.”</p>



<p>“I see. Clearing out stock, huh… Ah! Look over there, Onii-san!”</p>



<p>Shigure pointed to one of the lined-up stalls. </p>



<p>A red tent with ‘Apple candies’ boldly written in black.</p>



<p>“Apples candy! There are apple candies!”</p>



<p>“Well, of course, they’d have something as standard as apple candies. What are you, a kid?”</p>



<p>“You’re not fun at all. Are you an old man or something? I love apple candies. Let’s go buy some.”</p>



<p>Apple candies, huh? I don’t really like them much because they’re hard to eat.</p>



<p>Ah… now that I think about it, Haruka mentioned at lunch that she likes apple candies. </p>



<p>I wonder what she’s doing right now…</p>



<p>Maybe she’s out eating with some big shot from the movie industry.</p>



<p>If she gets on their good side… could she really make her movie debut? </p>



<p>How did things get to this point in just a little over two weeks? </p>



<p>As I was lost in thought, Shigure abruptly tugged at my arm again.</p>



<p>“Whoa!”</p>



<p>“Come on, let’s go!”</p>



<p>“No thanks, I don’t want any. You go on by yourself.”</p>



<p>“That’s not going to work. I can’t buy them without you, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Why not?”</p>



<p>“Because I didn’t bring my wallet today.”</p>



<p>“Haaaa!?”</p>



<p>I don’t understand.</p>



<p>She was the one who suggested we come, so how could she forget her wallet?</p>



<p>“I know you’ve been saving a lot in your wallet for your date with Nee-san. Today, we’re going to use all of that to have fun.”</p>



<p>So she didn’t forget—it was intentional. I shook off Shigure’s arm, who was now smiling mischievously.</p>



<p>“Cut it out! Why should I have to treat you!?”</p>



<p>“What’s the problem? It’s the money from the date that got canceled anyway.”</p>



<p>“It’s not canceled! It’s rescheduled! Didn’t I just tell you we’re going to Disneyland tomorrow? I’m obviously going to use my money there. If you don’t have money, we’re going home!”</p>



<p>Why do I have to be dragged to a festival I didn’t want to come to in the first place and then get fleeced for money on top of it? I’m not up for this. </p>



<p>I was about to turn on my heel and leave, but then—</p>



<p>“Uncle, two of these please!”</p>



<p>Shigure, despite not having money, was ordering apple candies at a stall. </p>



<p>You’ve got to be kidding me.</p>



<p>“The person over there, my boyfriend, will pay.”</p>



<p>“Onii-san, that will be four hundred yen.”</p>



<p>Oh, man… Seriously, this girl? </p>



<p>It’s the first time I’ve ever seen someone so shamelessly mooch off someone else’s money as if it were nothing.</p>



<p>I wanted to ignore her, but since she dragged me by the arm to the front of the stall, pretending not to know her is difficult.</p>



<p>I begrudgingly pulled out my wallet.</p>



<p>“Haha. You’ve got a clever girlfriend there.”</p>



<p>“She’s not my girlfriend. She’s my sister.”</p>



<p>“Mmm, cold and sweet—just right. Here, a present for Onii-san.”</p>



<p>“It’s my money, though!”</p>



<p>What present.</p>



<p>I snatched the apple candy as if I was taking back what was mine.</p>



<p>“That’s it, we’ve bought something and that’s the end of it. If you’ve got no money, then we’re just killing time here until the fireworks start.”</p>



<p>“Ah, look Onii-san, there’s a shooting gallery. I’ve never tried it before, I want to give it a shot.”</p>



<p>“Would you listen!?”</p>



<p>“I’m going to play for a bit.”</p>



<p>“I’m not paying!”</p>



<p>“Uncle, one plate please. The bill goes to my boyfriend over there.”</p>



<p>Oh, come on!</p>



<p>What’s with Shigure today, anyway?</p>



<p>She’s twice as pushy and cheeky as usual, leaving me utterly taken aback. Was she always the type to mooch off others like this?</p>



<p>I can’t really remember. The most I remember is her asking for birthday presents.</p>



<p>But what’s gotten into her today?</p>



<p>…Well, whatever her intentions may be, I won’t pay a cent more. </p>



<p>I pretend to be a stranger, dodging the shopkeeper’s gaze as he looks for the “boyfriend.” Since Shigure went to the stall alone this time, I doubt I’ll be implicated.</p>



<p>“Miss, who’s your boyfriend?”</p>



<p>“Oh, just a moment, please. I’ll show you a picture. Look, here’s my boyfriend’s sleeping face. Cute, isn’t it? Oh no, my hand slipped, and the photo got attached to an email going to Nee-san. What should I do?”</p>



<p>AAH!?</p>



<p>That’s how far she’d go! She would stoop to that level!</p>



<p>Faced with Shigure’s threats, dangling life-and-death power over me, I had no choice but to submit. Damn, I’m really regretting not pushing her away when I had the chance.</p>



<p>“That will be three hundred yen for one plate.”</p>



<p>And it’s expensive!</p>



<p>Three hundred yen for five cork bullets!</p>



<p>Reluctantly, I hand over the money to the vendor and glare at Shigure as she picks up the rifle for the shooting game.</p>



<p>“…I had no idea you were so reckless with money.”</p>



<p>“Oh, hardly. I would never waste my own money like this.”</p>



<p>That’s even worse.</p>



<p>Maybe I should downgrade her birthday present…</p>



<p>“Well then, fufufu, I wonder whose forehead should I put a hole in?”</p>



<p>Oblivious to my frustration, Shigure happily scans for her prey.</p>



<p>Then, her eyes light up with joy as she spots a stuffed animal a size larger than a softball sitting modestly on the prize shelf.</p>



<p>“Ah, this one’s cute. Look, that pink one shaped like an egg!”</p>



<p>“…It’s got a unique design. What kind of creature is that?”</p>



<p>It resembled a bear, or perhaps a rabbit… Moreover, its body was pink. On its head, it’s wearing something like a construction site helmet. </p>



<p>It must be some character, I suppose. </p>



<p>As Shigure says, it indeed possesses a peculiar charm.</p>



<p>But can a cork bullet really knock down a stuffed animal?</p>



<p>“I’ve heard that these games are rigged so that you can only win the cheap prizes.”</p>



<p>“Fufu. Onii-san, you are deeply suspicious, aren’t you? It’s a fun fireworks festival and they deal mostly with children. No decent adult would cheat so blatantly.”</p>



<p>Confident in her words, Shigure stands at the long table set up to prevent one from getting too close to the prize shelf (about three or four meters away from the prizes), and aims the gun.</p>



<div><img><p><br /></p>



<p>Then, she pulls the trigger.</p>



<p>From the formidable-looking gun, a cork bullet is launched with a comically cute sound. </p>



<p>But the cork, lacking rifling and weight, does not fly straight. </p>



<p>The first and second shots miss the stuffed animal entirely, simply flying past the prize shelf. The third and fourth shots do hit the doll, but it doesn’t budge, and the cork is simply deflected. The fifth and final shot—hits a small red box of “vinegared kelp” placed right next to it, and knocks it over.</p>



<p>“Congratulations, a big hit. Wow, to hit such a small target, Miss, you must be a sniper.”</p>



<p>“Onii-san, shooting games… they’re a lot like life, aren’t they?”</p>



<p>“And how is that?”</p>



<p>“We keep accumulating things we don’t need, while the things we truly want remain out of reach.”</p>



<p>“That’s why I told you to stop. These games are set up so you can only win the cheap prizes.”</p>



<p>But the old man running the shop raised his voice at our exchange.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, you two. Don’t say such bad things about the place. My family has been running this shooting gallery since my grandfather’s father’s time. We don’t do any cheats. Our prizes fall down all the time.”</p>



<p>“Really? But when I hit them, they didn’t move at all…”</p>



<p>Hey, Shigure-san, could you please stop being so chummy with someone who looks like they’ve got tattoos peeking out from the gaps in their clothes? </p>



<p>As I’m getting jittery, the old man lets out an exaggerated sigh.</p>



<p>“The way you’re shooting is all wrong, Miss. Move aside a bit.”</p>



<p>The old man takes the cork gun in hand, rises from his metal chair, and stands next to Shigure. </p>



<p>Up to this point, his actions mirror those of Shigure before. </p>



<p>But what comes next is different. </p>



<p>The old man places one hand on the long table, using it as a pivot to lean forward significantly. He then extends the arm holding the gun, bringing the muzzle as close to the edge of the prize shelf as possible. The distance from the gun’s muzzle to the prize is likely less than a meter.</p>



<p>With careful aim, he pulls the trigger.</p>



<p>“There!”</p>



<p>“Ah!”</p>



<p>The cork fired from such a close range hits the top of a toy train box, one size larger than the stuffed animal Shigure aimed for, knocking it off the shelf.</p>



<p>“See? It falls over, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s not fair! Is it really allowed to lean forward and stretch out your arm like that!?”</p>



<p>“It’s fine if the shop owner does it, so there’s no mistake.”</p>



<p>Seriously? Is that really allowed?</p>



<p>I had a much cooler image of shooting games, but their secrets to success are surprisingly pragmatic.</p>



<p>“Want to try again?”</p>



<p>“No, we’re good…”</p>



<p>“I’ll do it!!”</p>



<p>“Brother, that’ll be three hundred yen.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Somehow, I’m starting to get annoyed. </p>



<p>I mean, I’ve been nothing but a wallet this whole time.</p>



<p>It seems Shigure is seriously intent on blowing through my date money prepared for Haruka’s sake. </p>



<p>Well, I’ve worked a lot of part-time jobs over the summer break, so I’m not exactly strapped for cash. It’s not a big deal to treat Shigure here, but… more than the amount of money, it feels like I’m wasting time and opportunities, things that can’t be recovered.</p>



<p>So, I said to the shopkeeper.</p>



<p>“Two plates, please. I’ll play too.”</p>



<p>“Oh. That’s the spirit, boy. That’s how a boyfriend should be. Join forces with your girl and give it your all.”</p>



<p>“She’s not my girlfriend.”</p>



<p>I receive my share of shots.</p>



<p>That’s right. If I’m going to be fleeced anyway, just watching is silly. I might as well play too. I had wanted to try shooting anyway. </p>



<p>After all, guys just naturally get excited at the sight of guns and swords, even knowing they’re toys.</p>



<p>“…heavier than I thought.”</p>



<p>But when I took the cork gun, I was surprised by the unexpected weight. I had assumed it would be a flimsy, plastic toy, but the cork gun, with real wood at the grip, was the real deal.</p>



<p>“Ahh. The shots don’t fly straight to where I aim at all.”</p>



<p>While I was closely examining the gun, Shigure began her second shot. Even mimicking the shop owner and leaning in to shoot, this time the prize wasn’t grazed at all. The shots gathered around the prize, but each one frustratingly missed the mark.</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Hmm, I see. I think I’ve got it now. </p>



<p>I glanced briefly at the shop owner who had returned to his chair.</p>



<p>He was crossing his arms, a sly grin on his face.</p>



<p>…I get it now, Shigure was set up.</p>



<p>Leaning in, shooting from as close to the prize as possible. </p>



<p>The old man’s demonstration, at first, seemed logical, but with the gun being this heavy, it changes things. </p>



<p>With such a hefty gun, there’s no way to keep a steady aim with one arm fully extended. Unless you have arms like logs, like the old man’s.</p>



<p>In other words, that technique he showed us won’t work for us. </p>



<p>He showed us a useless strategy and then took more money for another round. He doesn’t share the important tips. </p>



<p>Indeed, it’s quite like life.</p>



<p>I tried to imitate the owner’s method, but the barrel wobbled too much, and I couldn’t aim properly. Four out of five shots were wasted, and while the last shot, fired from a more reasonable position like Shigure’s first attempt, did hit the stuffed animal, it was too weak to knock it down.</p>



<p>Back to square one. It’s truly futile. A waste of both time and money. The smart thing would be to acknowledge my foolishness in getting caught up in this and just leave.</p>



<p>But──,</p>



<p>Now that I realize I’ve been played, the idea of walking away as a loser is irritating. I find myself not wanting to go back empty-handed no matter what.</p>



<p>“Hah, both of you failed, huh? Are you giving up now?”</p>



<p>“Old man, two more plates.”</p>



<p>“Eh, Onii-san, aren’t you the type who shouldn’t be allowed to gamble?”</p>



<p>I might be. </p>



<p>But… it wasn’t like I didn’t have any plan. I push one of the two plates I received toward Shigure.</p>



<p>“You’re shooting too.”</p>



<p>“Eh, no, I think I’m good…”</p>



<p>“It’s fine. There’s a chance we can win. Probably.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>I nod.</p>



<p>“Imitating that old man is why we fail. With our strength, there’s no way we can shoot like that and keep the barrel stable.”</p>



<p>“The gun is quite heavy.”</p>



<p>“If the barrel wavers, the already erratic cork won’t hit the target. Securing it is what matters most. So,”</p>



<p>Leaning over the long table, I switch the gun from my right hand to my left. Instead of extending my left arm, I fold it to tighten my armpit, pulling the gun close to my body.</p>



<p>“Hold the gun close to your body like this, and grip the part in front of the trigger with your dominant hand. This should reduce the shake when you pull the trigger and stabilize the aim…!”</p>



<p>That’s the theory.</p>



<p>I trust my plan and pull the trigger.</p>



<p>The cork hits the stuffed animal just as I aimed.</p>



<p>But──</p>



<p>“Ah! So close!”</p>



<p>Even though I was leaning forward, I was shooting with the gun pulled close to my body, so distance was still the issue.</p>



<p>The cork slightly shook the stuffed animal that hadn’t budged before, but it wasn’t enough to knock it down.</p>



<p>“We probably need more power. Should we start working out now?”</p>



<p>“Don’t be stupid.”</p>



<p>I dismiss Shigure’s foolish comment. </p>



<p>Lacking power was part of the plan. That’s why I got two plates.</p>



<p>“Shigure. We’re going to shoot at the same time.”</p>



<p>“Ah, oh! I see! We’re compensating for power with numbers! But, is that really okay?”</p>



<p>“The old man said it himself, ‘teamwork is key.’”</p>



<p>If the old man says NO now, we’re out of luck. </p>



<p>So, I bluff with all I’ve got. </p>



<p>Then, the old man shows his white teeth with a smile.</p>



<p>“Can’t say for other places… but here, it’s been allowed since my grandfather’s time.”</p>



<p>Alright. Thanks, old man.</p>



<p>“That’s the plan. Let’s synchronize our breathing, Shigure.”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>Having gotten his word, we aim at the same prize together. </p>



<p>From this point, it’s pretty much a given. </p>



<p>The size of the stuffed animal is just a bit larger than a softball.</p>



<p>Even with corks, hitting it with two shots at the same time should be enough to knock it backward. </p>



<p>Once it falls back, its own weight will pull it off the prize shelf.</p>



<p>“Yay!! We did it! Onii-san, that was amazing!”</p>



<p>“Congratulations.”</p>



<p>The old man hands the prize to the delighted Shigure and says,</p>



<p>“At first, I thought you were just a boyfriend who couldn’t hold a candle to her, but you’re quite the quick thinker, aren’t you? A man who uses his head will earn a good living in the future. Make sure you keep a good hold of him, Miss.”</p>



<p>“Yes, I’ll keep him captive if I have to.”</p>



<p>No, she’s not even my girlfriend, to begin with.</p>



<p>“Look, look, how cute!”</p>



<p>Shigure ties the won stuffed animal to the belt loop at her waist and flaunts it to me.</p>



<p>I wanted to tease her about acting like a child, but seeing the genuinely happy expression on Shigure’s face, I didn’t feel like poking fun.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Onii-san. You were really cool.”</p>



<p>“Uh…”</p>



<p>Being praised so unabashedly, my cheeks grow warm.</p>



<p>…What am I even doing?</p>



<p>This is just like a date.</p>



<p>I was supposed to be here at the fireworks festival with Haruka, but here I am with—</p>



<p>“Let’s go get some cotton candy next. Cotton candy!”</p>



<p>But before I could ponder any further, Shigure grabs my hand and pulls me toward the next stall.</p>



<p>“Still planning on mooching, huh…”</p>



<p>“Of course. I have no intention of cooking dinner tonight. If Onii-san doesn’t eat something, he’ll miss a meal too.”</p>



<p>…She’s really something else.</p>



<p>Well, I guess I have no choice but to go along with it.</p>



<p>I’m at her mercy, and… I don’t want to skip a meal either.</p>



<p>“Then we’ll also buy some yakitori later.”</p>



<p>“That sounds great. Delicious!”</p>



<p>And so, we spent our time playing at the stalls until the fireworks started, fretting over ring tosses and cutouts, walking around eating things like cotton candy and grilled squid that we normally wouldn’t, and before we knew it, it was time for the fireworks to begin.</p>



<p>But the moment we climbed up the embankment where the fireworks were visible, I felt an urgent need to pee and hurried off to the restroom, leaving Shigure to save our spot.</p>



<p>The women’s restroom had a line, but fortunately, there wasn’t much of a wait for the men’s. </p>



<p>After relieving myself, I returned to the embankment to search for Shigure among the crowd. It was difficult to find her among the families and couples, but she spotted me and waved me over.</p>



<p>“Onii-san, over here, over here.”</p>



<p>“Did I make it back in time for the fireworks?”</p>



<p>“Yes. Just in time.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Where’s the yakitori I left with you?”</p>



<p>“Onii-san, you’re so silly. It’s a bird, so of course, it flew away.”</p>



<p>“Ah, right… …”</p>



<p>…Really?</p>



<p>“Ah, Onii-san! It’s starting!”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>I was on the verge of an epiphany, but any train of thought was obliterated by the roar and the brilliance of light. </p>



<p>On the bridge crossing the riverbank, flowers of light blossomed in the cloudless night sky, one after another, like bouquets unfurling.</p>



<p>It’s beautiful.</p>



<p>I sincerely felt that way.</p>



<p>I didn’t expect to feel this way, not at all.</p>



<p>I was certain I would regret coming here. I was supposed to be at this fireworks festival with Haruka, and I thought that going with Shigure would only amplify the frustration, that I couldn’t possibly enjoy it.</p>



<p>But now, I find myself… genuinely having a good time.</p>



<p>I’m even glad I came.</p>



<p>That’s… thanks to Shigure. Getting swept up in her antics made me feel like I’d be missing out if I didn’t have fun, so I threw myself into the festivities without reservation.</p>



<p>The gloominess I felt during the day has significantly lightened.</p>



<p>Well, my wallet has also gotten significantly… no, considerably lighter because of it. </p>



<p>I’m not sure if I should feel resentful or grateful.</p>



<p>With these thoughts, I turn to look at Shigure next to me.</p>



<p>Our eyes meet.</p>



<p>She was not looking up at the fireworks but staring at me, and she smiled with what seemed like relief.</p>



<p>“I’m glad. You look like you’re genuinely having fun, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>“‘Genuinely having fun’, what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>



<p>“Because when you came back home in the afternoon, Onii-san, you had such a terrible look on your face.”</p>



<p>Her words make me catch my breath.</p>



<p>Because… I hadn’t meant to show that side of myself to Shigure.</p>



<p>I didn’t want her to see that kind of weakness.</p>



<p>But,</p>



<p>“What are you talking about? Sure, it was a bummer to reschedule at the last minute, but in exchange, we’re going to Disneyland tomorrow, right? That’s got to be way more fun. It’s actually a better deal when you think about it.”</p>



<p>“Is that why you had such a tearful look on your face, because you couldn’t see it that way?”</p>



<p>Shigure’s eyes, as she said this, were infinitely direct, reflecting only me—just me.</p>



<p>“Onii-san, you wear your heart on your sleeve. I can’t just leave you alone. Seeing you with that face…”</p>



<p>In her gaze, there was no crowd, no starry sky, no fireworks—just me, as I am right here, right now.</p>



<p>The good, the bad, the weak—everything as it is.</p>



<p>“…Heh, lie all you want. You just wanted to play around with my money.”</p>



<p>“Ahaha, did you find me out? These festival stalls are definitely best enjoyed with someone else’s money. Three hundred yen for five corks. I could never spend that from my own wallet—it feels too foolish.”</p>



<p>“There you go, showing your true colors so quickly…”</p>



<p>My attempt at bravado falters, words tangling at the end.</p>



<p>I can’t manage to retort properly to Shigure, who jests so easily.</p>



<p>Because… I can tell that her wanting to take advantage was a lie.</p>



<p>She had noticed everything.</p>



<p>Noticed and was trying to cheer me up.</p>



<p>Haruka hadn’t even noticed.</p>



<p>“Ah, …uh…”</p>



<p>“Onii-san…?”</p>



<p>“It’s nothing, just—”</p>



<p>Deep inside, in the most profound depths, my heart trembles.</p>



<p>It’s a shake that is big enough, strong enough to shake my whole body, unstoppable even if I tried to suppress it.</p>



<p>I realized it was dangerous.</p>



<p>I shouldn’t let it overflow, I thought.</p>



<p>But—</p>



<p>“Uh, ugh… Uhh~~~!!”</p>



<p>“O-Onii-san!?”</p>



<p>Something warm surged up from the depths within me.</p>



<p>Unstoppable, it overflowed as tears and sobs.</p>



<p>The love for Shigure that I had kept hidden and resolved to quash swelled up from my heart.</p>



<p>At my disgrace, Shigure was surprised… but then she quickly embraced me gently.</p>



<p>As if to hide my shame from the eyes around us.</p>



<p>Her soft fragrance and gentle warmth enveloped me, and in that warmth, I remembered the night of the camp.</p>



<p>Shigure had supported me then, too… she had protected me.</p>



<p>She really always cared for me, probably more than anyone else in this world… far more than Haruka.</p>



<p>And yet, I—</p>



<p>Why can’t I… when I’m in the deepest pain, and she always surrounds me with her love, return my true feelings to her?</p>



<p>Why am I only allowed to stifle this overwhelming affection that now threatens to burst out as a scream?</p>



<p>That was something I shouldn’t think about.</p>



<p>A regret that was utterly forbidden.</p>



<p>But, I couldn’t help thinking.</p>



<p>Why, why, why…</p>



<p>Why didn’t I meet Shigure before I met Haruka?</p>



<p>Maybe at this moment, this very instant, my first love had… ended.</p>
