<h3>Chapter 31 &ndash; First Trip in a While</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia rested on the sofa, unable to move due to how full their stomachs were.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Those two really do look like husband and wife.”</p><p class="calibre2">“They don’t look like husband and wife, they are.”</p><p class="calibre2">They said as they watched Theo and Helvi wash dishes together.</p><p class="calibre2">Every time one handed a plate to the other, their eyes would meet and they would smile.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“It was kind of a shock coming back and seeing that Theo got married all of a sudden. We’ve always treated him kind of like a little brother.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">They were in a party together more than a year ago.</p><p class="calibre2">At the time, they were too strong to fit into other parties, and let Theo join theirs temporarily because they felt sorry for him, as no one else would take him.</p><p class="calibre2">However, they soon discovered that even though Theo could not fight, he was perfect at every other task. When they set camp, he would boil medicinal herbs he picked on the way and treat light wounds, and make delicious meals with limited ingredients.</p><p class="calibre2">Even tough jobs would become less unpleasant with Theo around.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… My life’s plan has changed.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What are you talking about?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I wanted to take Theo with us to the royal capital to live with us. He could take care of our housework, but we would take him with us if we accepted a job that would take more than a day to complete. That way he could cook for us on the road.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…That sounds nice.”</p><p class="calibre2">But it did not become reality.</p><p class="calibre2">“Who would’ve thought he had a fiancee?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I know right? I had no idea.”</p><p class="calibre2">The idea that they were engaged for years was a lie told by Helvi, but they had no way of knowing that.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now that I think about it, it never seemed like Theo ever looked at us as ‘women’ does it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Don’t remind me.”</p><p class="calibre2">They always slept in separate tents at first, but there were times when they slept in the same one, as they became closer.</p><p class="calibre2">They did think about attacking Theo at some point, but the mood never felt right, and tried to tempt him once, without success.</p><p class="calibre2">They were sad about their lack of charm, but in reality Theo was simply too ignorant about this sort of thing to understand what was happening.</p><p class="calibre2">The party was disbanded when they accepted a quest in the royal capital, and decided it was too dangerous to take Theo along.</p><p class="calibre2">Although heartbroken, the pair started working in the capital, until one day when they realized they did not have any quests to do, and decided to go visit Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">“But I’m glad to see Theo so happy. It seems Helvi is very nice to him too.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it’s very clear that they love each other.”</p><p class="calibre2">At the time, there were many marriages of convenience or scams related to marriage. This combined with Helvi’s beauty made them doubt her sincerity at first, but…</p><p class="calibre2">Looking at them washing the dishes, they realized their fears were unfounded.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Do you think they did it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Did what?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You know…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Why would you think I know the answer?”</p><p class="calibre2">They were looking at the corridor that led to the bedrooms.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi looks like the aggressive type. I’m sure they did it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Didn’t they say they only got married yesterday? That means last night was their first…”</p><p class="calibre2">“They’re doing it. No doubt about it.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia let their imaginations run wild, while talking quietly enough for the other two to not hear.</p><p class="calibre2">In reality, Helvi and Theo spent their first night sleeping in separate beds, after an intense first kiss.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“How long are you two going to stay in this town?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asked Theo, who was drying his hands after finishing washing the dishes.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn!? Ah, hum… About a month, unless there is an urgent quest.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Celia, before Xena, seemingly remembering something, stood up while saying ‘I know’.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, let’s accept a quest together for old time’s sake! I don’t think there will be any difficult ones, but let’s pick a nice one!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? Are you sure?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course! Right Celia?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I would love to travel with you again Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia were excited.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo also wanted to accept a quest and travel with them again, like in the old days.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re coming too, right Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asked Theo, expecting a yes.</p><p class="calibre2">The other two were also not thinking about leaving Theo’s wife behind.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes Helvi, come with us! I’m sure it will be fun!”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m sure we’ll be safe from anything if you’re with us.”</p><p class="calibre2">The two wanted to get along with Helvi, and ask her all sorts of things, primarily about her night with Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes. If Theo is going, I will go as well.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi read their thoughts. In fact, she read their minds when they were letting their imaginations run rampant, and knew exactly what they were thinking about.</p><p class="calibre2">She felt being asked questions about this sort of thing was bothersome, but…</p><p class="calibre2">(I don’t want to put a cloud over Theo’s happy face.)</p><p class="calibre2">She knew how happy Theo was about accepting a quest with Xena and Celia again.</p><p class="calibre2">If Theo wished to go alone with them, she would willingly accept, but instead it seemed the thought never even crossed his mind.</p><p class="calibre2">(Yes…! I get to travel with Xena and Celia and Helvi too! It’s my first time going somewhere with Helvi, so I’m really excited! I have to do my best with the meals and stuff…!)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was very happy about all the joy in Theo’s heart.</p><p class="calibre2">She was not feeling too pleased about the prospect of being bombarded with questions, but thought it was more than worth it if she got to go with Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">And thus, they decided to look for a quest that would take more than a day to complete.</p>
