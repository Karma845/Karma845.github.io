<h3>EX1: The Cruelty of Trust</h3>

<p>After parting ways with Hiromichi-kun, I hurried back home to start getting ready. </p>



<p>Although I still had ample time before my meeting with the club leader, I couldn’t afford to be late. I needed to give myself enough time to prepare.</p>



<p>What should I wear for the occasion? </p>



<p>The people I would be meeting work in the film industry. My mother used to be a celebrity, so I had been invited to parties with these kinds of people as a child. Everyone was always dressed glamorously. </p>



<p>If I wanted to break into that world, maybe I should also wear something flashy and not be embarrassed about it. If I dress too plainly, they might be disappointed despite their initial interest.</p>



<p>But even though I was invited, I am just an add-on to the leader.</p>



<p>The purpose of today’s meeting is to discuss the film adaptation of the leader’s award-winning novel. I am just tagging along. </p>



<p>Wearing something too showy might actually give off a bad impression.</p>



<p>After much deliberation, I decided to wear my school uniform. </p>



<p>The uniform is a form of formal wear for students, so at least it wouldn’t be a breach of manners.</p>



<p>I changed into my uniform, put on a light makeup, and left the house. </p>



<p>I arrived at the station platform, where we were supposed to meet, an hour early and waited for the leader.</p>



<p>I scanned the crowd for her, and after several minutes, a beautiful woman with a hint of sadness in her eyes, wearing a stylish blue one-piece dress and noticeable tear bags, walked through the gate. </p>



<p>There she was.</p>



<p>“Leader! Over here!”</p>



<p>“Oh, sorry. Did I keep you waiting? …Ahaha. A school uniform, huh? You’re really giving it your all.”</p>



<p>“Is it strange?”</p>



<p>“No, not at all. It’s a great ‘selling point.’”</p>



<p>“‘Selling point’?”</p>



<p>“I mean it’s a unique feature. No one else is wearing a blazer, that’s for sure. It will definitely leave an impression.”</p>



<p>I see…</p>



<p>That’s a relief. It wasn’t a mistake then.</p>



<p>“Thank you for inviting me today, Leader.”</p>



<p>“No, no. I just played the intermediary. I wasn’t really keen on it, to be honest.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Because Haruka-chan is a rough diamond I found. It doesn’t feel good when others suddenly notice its value and try to get their hands on it.”</p>



<p>It made me happy to hear the leader say that.</p>



<p>The fact is, she is a rather intimidating person.</p>



<p>True to her own sense of aesthetics and unafraid to be blunt,</p>



<p>she had not even looked my way during my first year.</p>



<p>I’m sure it wasn’t out of malice, but simply because she didn’t see me back then.</p>



<p>So, to be recognized by such a fearsome person has genuinely become a source of confidence for me.</p>



<p>“In fact, I’ve been getting lots of scout offers from the industry in my account.”</p>



<p>“That’s… news to me.”</p>



<p>“It’s not really worth talking about. Most of them are pretty useless. We’ve been filtering them all out here. There were even some offers that seemed like they must be from shady idol agencies, and I could only think they were actually for AV.”</p>



<p>“Huh, A-V?”</p>



<p>“I’m actually curious and wouldn’t mind trying it out once myself, but I definitely wouldn’t recommend it to my juniors.”</p>



<p>“Um, A-V? What is that?”</p>



<p>When I asked about the unfamiliar term, the leader’s eyes widened as she stared intently at my face.</p>



<p>“Haruka-chan, you don’t know what AV is!?”</p>



<p>“Um, sorry. Is it an abbreviation for something?”</p>



<p>“Nnnn!”</p>



<p>“L-Leader!? What’s wrong!? Are you feeling okay!?”</p>



<p>The leader suddenly twisted and groaned. As surprised as I was, I reached out to help,</p>



<p>“Wait! Right now, inside me, there’s a struggle between the desire to preserve your unblemished purity and the urge to throw all the filth at you!”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>The leader held me back with her hand while saying things I didn’t quite understand, taking several deep breaths.</p>



<p>“Whew… I’ve calmed down.”</p>



<p>She seemed to have regained her composure. I wonder what that was all about.</p>



<p>“Well… As for AV, you should ask your boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“Hiromichi-kun knows about it?”</p>



<p>“He might even have some.”</p>



<p>“Really? I’ll ask him on our date tomorrow!”</p>



<p>I thought it was some kind of industry jargon, but it seemed to be common knowledge that even Hiromichi-kun knew about. I felt a little embarrassed by my ignorance.</p>



<p>“Well… going back to our conversation, I’ve been ignoring all those dodgy offers and offers from uncertain sources. But this time, it was a request from the people who are making my movie. I thought that ‘P’ wouldn’t exploit Haruka-chan as a raw gem, and if you’re interested in the world of acting, there’s no harm in meeting them. That’s why I invited you. I was a little surprised that Haruka-chan was so keen though.”</p>



<p>“…Yes, I might be getting a little greedy.”</p>



<p>I’ve always thought of acting as a hobby, nothing more. </p>



<p>But now, being lifted up by all these incredible coincidences, even being interviewed on TV, and being asked to meet the people who are making a movie, I realized something. </p>



<p>Saying that acting is just a hobby was a defensive line to avoid challenges and protect myself. The truth is, I wanted to make acting more than just a hobby for myself, just like my mom used to be on TV. </p>



<p>So, I decided to do everything I can.</p>



<p>“I do think that I’ve gotten a bit carried away just because a photo I took happened to go viral…”</p>



<p>“No, no, that’s not true at all. It’s luck when an opportunity comes your way, but it takes courage to reach out and grab it. Haruka-chan, you had the courage. There’s no need to be embarrassed about that.”</p>



<p>“Leader…”</p>



<p>“But it’s also true that it’s just one photo that caused a stir. The ability to make the most of the opportunity you’ve courageously seized is a different kind of strength. Just give it a try. They’re not scary people, after all.”</p>



<p>“Yes! I’ll do my best.”</p>



<p>At that moment, the announcement for the train we were supposed to take started playing. </p>



<p>Hearing that, the leader got up from the bench, saying, “let’s go.”</p>



<p>But then she frowned at the crowdedness of the arriving train.</p>



<p>“Uhyaa… The platform and the train are both super crowded. There are a lot of people wearing yukatas too. Is there a festival or something today?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, today is the day of the Tsurumigawa fireworks festival.”</p>



<p>“Heh, didn’t know about that.”</p>



<p>“Leader, have you ever been? The scale isn’t that big, but there are all sorts of food stalls, and it gets lively every year.”</p>



<p>“I’m not a fan of crowds. But you should’ve just turned me down and enjoyed the festival with your boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“Ah… I was actually supposed to do that…”</p>



<p>I hesitated for a moment, guiltily feeling the weight of canceling on him last minute.</p>



<p>“Huh? Huhh? Could it be… you had plans with your boyfriend?”</p>



<p>“Yes, but it’s fine. I spoke to him during the day and had him reschedule.”</p>



<p>“Eh… but… really…?”</p>



<p>Suddenly, the leader covered her mouth with her hand and made a troubled face.</p>



<p>“Leader? What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Well, I was just thinking that since I’ve led Haruka-chan astray, I’ll have to go to her boyfriend’s place as soon as school starts and prostrate myself naked in apology.”</p>



<p>“No, it’s fine! I wanted to prioritize this, so I chose this. And Hiromichi-kun, he said he’d support me when we talked!”</p>



<p>Yes. Hiromichi-kun understood me.</p>



<p>We had properly talked things through, so there was no need for the leader to apologize. </p>



<p>But the leader looked at me with somewhat sad eyes and said,</p>



<p>“Hmm… It’s not my place as an outsider to say this, so I’ll only say it once. If you don’t understand how much patience was in that ‘support,’ then you two might not last much longer.”</p>



<p>“Eh…?”</p>



<p>What does that mean?</p>



<p>Not last much longer… Does it mean our relationship won’t last long?</p>



<p>But why?</p>



<p>We talked it through, and Hiromichi-kun was okay with it.</p>



<p>The date was only moved back by one day.</p>



<p>That’s all.</p>



<p>Why is the leader making such a big deal out of it?</p>



<p>Perhaps writers, like her, tend to let their imagination run wild, even from the most trivial things.</p>



<p>But it feels slightly unpleasant, as though that imagination belittles the kind Hiromichi-kun.</p>



<p>As if Hiromichi-kun would get angry over something like that.</p>



<p>“The train’s here. Let’s go.”</p>



<p>But before I could argue back, the leader had already started walking.</p>



<p>And from that point on, she never mentioned that fantasy again.</p>
