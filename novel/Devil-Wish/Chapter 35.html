<h3>Chapter 35 &ndash; Luggage?</h3>

<p class="calibre2">After getting the camping equipment ready, Xena and Celia returned to Theo and Helvi’s house.</p><p class="calibre2">“Taking the house with us would draw a ton of attention anyway. It’s big.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena as she looked at the cracks formed when the house lifted off the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">The backpack on her back looked heavy, but she walked as though she was carrying nothing.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Just imagine how funny it would be for us to walk around with a house levitating behind us.”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia also carried something big, although not as heavy looking as Xena’s.</p><p class="calibre2">A lot of luggage was necessary to camp while on the road.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, are you still not done preparing the food for the trip?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena entered the house and looked around, but saw nothing that resembled what she was looking for.</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I’m done.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Then where is it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“How do I put this…”</p><p class="calibre2">Rather than answer, Theo looked at Helvi, before Xena and Celia did the same.</p><p class="calibre2">“Where is it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, you’re just in time. Go outside and put down your luggage.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rather than answer their questions, Helvi gave them instructions.</p><p class="calibre2">They found it odd, but went outside and put their luggage on the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">“Like this?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena asked Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, good.”</p><p class="calibre2">“So what are you…”</p><p class="calibre2">Before Xena could finish her question, she felt something emerging behind her.</p><p class="calibre2">When she turned around, she saw their luggage floating.</p><p class="calibre2">“You asked me how I intended to carry the house with us. The answer? Like this.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi before Xena and Celia’s luggage shot up into the sky.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not long until even Xena’s sharp eyes lost sight of it.</p><p class="calibre2">“E-eh!? W-why!? Where!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-is this gravity magic too… I-incredible!”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia let out a strained laugh as she looked at the sky, not quite taking in the reality that her luggage had just flown away.</p><p class="calibre2">“Calm down you two. Your luggage is simply high above the clouds, and I can bring it back any time I want.”</p><p class="calibre2">“R-really?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. It’s so simple, I could leave them there forever if I so wished. This way you won’t have to carry heavy luggage on your backs.”</p><p class="calibre2">Both let out a sigh of relief.</p><p class="calibre2">“G-great. It really scared me when they flew into the air like that.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes. Did you do the same thing with the food?”</p><p class="calibre2">“She did. I was really surprised too when I saw it take off…”</p><p class="calibre2">In the end, they were grateful for not having to carry their luggage.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi would have to continue using magic to keep it in the air, but this much barely put a dent on her magic energy.</p><p class="calibre2">“So it wouldn’t be a funny sight even if you did bring the house with us.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I feel like the sight of us watching the house fly into the sky would be pretty funny too…”</p><p class="calibre2">It sounded like it would have been a bigger shock than watching their heavy luggage fly away.</p><p class="calibre2">Now that their preparations were completed, they made their way to the guild to report their departure, but did so empty handed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum, what about your luggage?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I sent it flying.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Uh?”</p><p class="calibre2">For Fiore, who had no idea what was going on, it was a natural question, but Helvi’s answer answered nothing.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo then gave her a good explanation of what happened, and Fore understood.</p><p class="calibre2">“As expected from you Helvi… Still, I was more surprised when you defeated the Chimera.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Neither was particularly difficult.”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore’s smile twitched as she heard Helvi describe these feats that were impossible for a regular person as being easy.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh!? You defeated the Chimera!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia were shocked to hear what Fiore said.</p><p class="calibre2">They heard rumors that the Chimera had been defeated, but few people actually knew who did it.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes, I did. But keep your voice down.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, s-sorry. If no one’s talking about the person that did it, that means you’ve been keeping it a secret, right?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena looked around while covering her mouth.</p><p class="calibre2">Fortunately, there were not many people around, so no one heard her except for the other receptionists, who knew that Helvi and Theo accepted the quest to defeat the Chimera.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. Then there really was no way we were ever going to win against the one that defeated a monster like that Chimera.”</p><p class="calibre2">Even if they were the strongest in this world, they were not conceited enough to believe they could defeat the Chimera.</p><p class="calibre2">They would certainly lose against such a beast, so obviously they could never beat the one that defeated it.</p><p class="calibre2">“I feel like we’ll be safe no matter what if Helvi is with us. Bring on those bandits and that devil!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it looks like it’s going to be easy.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said the two women as they headed towards the exit.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi and Theo, be careful not to get hurt.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes! I’ll do my best!”</p><p class="calibre2">Responded Theo with a very nice smile.</p><p class="calibre2">He was about to run towards the exit, but stopped, looked back, and stretched his arm towards Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-Helvi… Let’s go…!”</p><p class="calibre2">It was the first time Theo took the initiative to hold hands with Helvi, and his face was a little red.</p><p class="calibre2">This struck a chord within Helvi, although she did not show it, and simply grabbed his hand.</p>
