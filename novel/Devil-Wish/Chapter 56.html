<h3>Chapter 56 &ndash; Conclusion, and…</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“I am the peak, not someone indulging in power given to him. Know your place.”</p><p class="calibre2">As the boss heard this, he remembered that being, who he never saw, but heard.</p><p class="calibre2">“I will give you power, and in return you will kill that demon.”</p><p class="calibre2">The moment he heard this, his left arm dropped down in front of him.</p><p class="calibre2">He looked up, but saw nothing. It was as though it materialized out of thin air.</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems it was your dominant hand. I can make it stronger and reattach it. Should I?”</p><p class="calibre2">The strange voice felt as though it was whispering near his ear.</p><p class="calibre2">To the boss, this was a very attractive offer.</p><p class="calibre2">However…</p><p class="calibre2">“Who the hell are you? I’m not accepting anything unless you show yourself.”</p><p class="calibre2">There was no way he was not going to doubt an offer that was too convenient and too good to be true.</p><p class="calibre2">He left the arm where it landed, and continued cautiously looking around.</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course. You are particularly intelligent among even humans, so I figured you would say that.”</p><p class="calibre2">At the same time, something else appeared before the boss.</p><p class="calibre2">The boss felt humiliated about not being able to sense what appeared in front of him, but was shocked by what he saw.</p><p class="calibre2">“You…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“This is me. So? Will you accept my offer?”</p><p class="calibre2">The boss started thinking. He remembered something he heard long ago, and asked a question.</p><p class="calibre2">“If I accept your offer, what are you going to want from me?</p><p class="calibre2">The being in front of him snickered.</p><p class="calibre2">“You catch on quickly. But like I said, what you are going to give to me is that demon’s life. Your life has no value to me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I don’t like the way you said that… But it’s fine. I’ll take that offer.”</p><p class="calibre2">And then, the boss received tremendous power.</p><p class="calibre2">His left arm was strong. With that left arm, he was sure he could beat the girl with the tough body and the magic girl.</p><p class="calibre2">However, for some reason, he was not sure he could beat the one in front of him, Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m the strongest!!”</p><p class="calibre2">He yelled as he kicked the ground and ran forward, as though he was trying to shake off the uncertainty in his heart.</p><p class="calibre2">He swung his left arm at Helvi with enough strength to completely shatter the cave wall where he rested previously.</p><p class="calibre2">A hit like this would surely be enough to kill even the girl with the tough body.</p><p class="calibre2">As he was about to make contact, he thought for sure Helvi would not be able to defend against it, but…</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s in the way.”</p><p class="calibre2">The boss could not see Helvi, due to his arm blocking his vision, but suddenly, he could see her perfectly.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah…?</p><p class="calibre2">The reason was simple, his left arm had been swatted away like a fly.</p><p class="calibre2">Such a simple action snapped that powerful left arm upwards, and although the action itself was simple, the same could not be said for the impact it caused.</p><p class="calibre2">Perhaps Helvi had hit close to his wrist, because it was broken.</p><p class="calibre2">The thick muscles and bones did little to prevent this.</p><p class="calibre2">However, the left arm healed itself. The broken bones quickly mended themselves.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ha, haha! This left arm is the best!”</p><p class="calibre2">He wasted no time striking at Helvi again, with all his weight and all his strength.</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you want to compare our strength? Very well, you should know how weak you are.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi also stuck out her left fist, however, she did not pull her arm back, and only used enough strength to take down that left arm.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, it vanished.</p><p class="calibre2">“Gah…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">The boss was blown away, unable to withstand the impact and rolling on the ground for a few meters before stopping.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ih…! Ah…! Why…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">The boss’ left arm was gone again, but it was not cut off like before. It vanished without a trace.</p><p class="calibre2">It was supposed to be so powerful, and yet it was blown away by a light punch from Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“I could have held back a little more. I have not swung my fist in a while, so I accidentally used too much strength.”</p><p class="calibre2">The boss felt even more despair, as he heard Helvi approaching.</p><p class="calibre2">He looked up at her from the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">“What are you…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“I told you, I am the peak. Your delusions of being the strongest are so severe, they are not funny.”</p><p class="calibre2">At this point, the boss knew he would not defeat her,</p><p class="calibre2">He did not know about her being the peak and whatnot, but he did understand his hopes of winning were gone.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now answer my question. Who gave you this power and that left arm?”</p><p class="calibre2">The boss felt there was no reason to resist, and answered truthfully.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, I don’t really know either… Kuh… Gaha…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The boss started speaking, but suddenly found himself in too much pain to continue.</p><p class="calibre2">He rolled on the ground in pain… And stopped.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi, what happened to him?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asked Xena as she approached from behind.</p><p class="calibre2">“…It seems he was killed by someone.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. It looks not unlike a death by poison magic.”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia approached the boss’ corpse and examined the magic energy.</p><p class="calibre2">“So that’s a thing… What was that arm anyway?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was also curious about this.</p><p class="calibre2">She felt a presence when they reached the mountain.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a little close to…</p><p class="calibre2">“…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was lost in thought, when she suddenly noticed something, and raised her voice higher than ever since she was summoned by Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">There was panic on her face, and a desperation never before heard in her voice.</p><p class="calibre2">“Where is Theo!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia were surprised to hear Helvi yelling, but quickly realized what she meant and started looking around.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, why…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“He was right here…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo, who was standing right behind Xena and Celia, was nowhere to be found.</p><p class="calibre2"></p>
