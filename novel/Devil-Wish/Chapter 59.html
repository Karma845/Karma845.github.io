<h3>Chapter 59 &ndash; Memories of Hell</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“You should be king, and rule over hell.”</p><p class="calibre2">The devil man had an intoxicated smile on his face, even as blood dripped from his mouth as a consequence of his overuse of teleportation.</p><p class="calibre2">He seemingly gave up on trying to escape, and got down on both knees.</p><p class="calibre2">“King? Hell? What are you talking about?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was confused.</p><p class="calibre2">She had been alive for thousands of years, but still did not know what that word meant.</p><p class="calibre2">But for some reason, she felt this was not the first time she heard it.</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems you do not remember, but that is only natural. Your memories of hell have been sealed.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hou, sealed? By whom?”</p><p class="calibre2">She did not ask how or anything of the sort.</p><p class="calibre2">Sealing memories was near impossible for humans and regular devils, but it was simple for Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“By royalty and nobles currently ruling over hell. They feared your strength, as someone who could single-handedly destroy hell.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi destroyed the world’s ecosystem a long, long time ago, and even then she did not use her full power.</p><p class="calibre2">Had she done so, the planet itself might have been destroyed.</p><p class="calibre2">“The nobles and royalty worked together to seal your memories.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmm, I see.”</p><p class="calibre2">Nobility and royalty, who were powerful even among devils, had no choice but to work together to seal her memories.</p><p class="calibre2">“You should be ruling over hell! Please return!”</p><p class="calibre2">The man bowed his head while still kneeling.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi read his mind, and saw he was sincere, and truly respected her.</p><p class="calibre2">“Undoing the seal may be difficult… There are many more who think you should be king, but it will be impossible even with their help.”</p><p class="calibre2">Over a hundred members of royalty and nobility worked together to seal her memories.</p><p class="calibre2">Thousands, or even tens of thousands of regular devils would be unable to undo the seal.</p><p class="calibre2">“But even without those memories, you are still very powerful…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Hmm, I see.”</p><p class="calibre2">The man still had his head close to the ground, and could only see her feet.</p><p class="calibre2">All he could do was pray that Helvi agreed to return to hell with him.</p><p class="calibre2">“First I will have to know more about the present condition in hell, how large of a world it is, and what kind of place it is.”</p><p class="calibre2">The man felt relieved.</p><p class="calibre2">He realized he did simply state his wishes, and explained next to nothing.</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes, allow me to go into detail…”</p><p class="calibre2">Before the man could continue, Helvi spoke over him.</p><p class="calibre2">“So first, I will regain my memories.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ah…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Before the man could process what he heard, Helvi lightly placed her right hand on her temple.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, a violent feeling magic energy dominated the area.</p><p class="calibre2">The devil man was unable to even stay close to her, and was blown away dozens of meters.</p><p class="calibre2">“…So this is the seal on my memories.”</p><p class="calibre2">She looked into her own mind, and saw it.</p><p class="calibre2">Up until that point, Helvi had no reason to think her memories had been sealed.</p><p class="calibre2">There was no way she was going to undo a seal she did not know existed, but it was a different story if she knew about it.</p><p class="calibre2">“W-wait! If you force it, it will kill you…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The man came crawling back, and screamed as he realized what Helvi was doing.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a seal that only devil nobles and royalty could do.</p><p class="calibre2">It should be impossible for a single person to undo a seal created by the combined efforts of such powerful people.</p><p class="calibre2">If she did attempt it, her brain would boil and evaporate in a second.</p><p class="calibre2">“Do not underestimate me. I know nothing of devil royalty and nobles, but I am the peak.”</p><p class="calibre2">The amount of magic energy she pumped into her brain could easily destroy the world.</p><p class="calibre2">And then… The wind coming from Helvi settled down, and stopped.</p><p class="calibre2">“M-miss Helvi…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was not moving. Her eyes were still closed, and her hand was still on her temple.</p><p class="calibre2">The man approached her, but he had pretty much given up.</p><p class="calibre2">There was no way someone would survive having so much magic energy sent to their brain.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… I finally found you and… What a foolish thing to…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Who are you calling foolish, trash?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi kicked away the man in front of her.</p><p class="calibre2">He flew away hundreds of meters, even though for Helvi it was nothing more than a poke.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hm, I remember. It was quite an exciting and enjoyable seal, although it pales in comparison to a kiss from Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">The man once again approached Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">The last attack broke bones and destroyed organs, but he still had an insane smile as he got closer.</p><p class="calibre2">“M-miss Helvi…! The combined efforts of royalty and nobility were so easily…! You truly deserve to be king!”</p><p class="calibre2">Although she continuously called herself the strongest, it was still unimaginable.</p><p class="calibre2">The man could not be happier to be wrong. This being the man worshiped could easily massacre the nobility and royalty of hell.</p><p class="calibre2">“If your memory is back, there is nothing more to be sad about! Let us return to hell and…!”</p><p class="calibre2">The image of hell popped into Helvi’s mind.</p><p class="calibre2">It was an over ten thousand year old image, but it was a clear one.</p><p class="calibre2">Ruling over hell really may have been more enjoyable than using her strength to rule over the world where she currently lived, but Helvi’s answer was…</p><p class="calibre2">“No way, trash.”</p><p class="calibre2">A negative one.</p><p class="calibre2"></p>
