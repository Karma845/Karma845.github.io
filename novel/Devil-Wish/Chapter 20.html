<h3>Chapter 20 &ndash; First Kiss</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“Ah…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo let out a sound, as Helvi’s beautiful face got closer, but he soon found himself unable to speak.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hnn…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Their lips overlapped, and Theo closed his eyes. He felt something softer than he could ever have imagined touching his lips.</p><p class="calibre2">His mouth was being covered from above.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn, ah…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo did not think to breathe through his nose while kissing, so he struggled to suck in air through his mouth.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi, who had her eyes open, saw the whole thing.</p><p class="calibre2">She pat herself on the back for making the correct decision to not close her eyes, as she knew for sure she would see something cute.</p><p class="calibre2">(Cute cute cute. Theo is so cute with eyes completely shut. It’s so soft. Theo is so cute trying to breathe through his mouth.)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s breathing became heavy as she watched, so she pulled her face back.</p><p class="calibre2">When she did so, Theo leaned forward, as if implying that he wanted to keep kissing.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah…”</p><p class="calibre2">And when their lips separated, Theo let out a sad sigh and looked up, showing a lonely expression.</p><p class="calibre2">(Ah… Geez, Theo… Do you want me to assault you so badly?)</p><p class="calibre2">“Breathe through your nose Theo… We can do it for longer that way.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Helvi, while their faces were close enough for their noses to touch.</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo responded while looking at Helvi, completely fascinated.</p><p class="calibre2">As he thought about being able to do it again, he looked happy and his cheeks became red.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, their lips became one.</p><p class="calibre2">This time Theo made sure to breathe through his nose.</p><p class="calibre2">Because of this, and the close proximity of their faces, they breathed each other’s air.</p><p class="calibre2">(Sweet… Not just his mouth, even his breath is tasty…)</p><p class="calibre2">As she inhaled Theo’s breath, Helvi’s breathing became even heavier.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo also thought about his breath becoming heavier, and both probably thought about each other’s sweetness and tastiness.</p><p class="calibre2">Up until this point, they were only pressing their lips, but Helvi started using her tongue.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hnn…! Fuahn…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was surprised at first about this strange thing invading him, but accepted it.</p><p class="calibre2">In fact, he wrapped his own tongue around it.</p><p class="calibre2">The way their tongues connected was awkward, but they were completely entranced, indulging in their kiss.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s tongue entered Theo’s, but at some point, Theo’s entered Helvi’s mouth.</p><p class="calibre2">That tongue wrapped around her tongue and mouth, both gently and aggressively.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… Muhn…”</p><p class="calibre2">Even as he let out anxious sounds, he didn’t stop moving his tongue.</p><p class="calibre2">Their stances were completely different from when they started.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi had her left hand on the wall, and her right hand on Theo’s chin, but now, her left arm was around Theo’s neck, and her left hand was grabbing his left shoulder strongly.</p><p class="calibre2">Her right arm was around his waist, pressing him closer.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo had no idea where to place his hands when they started kissing, but now his arms were around Helvi’s neck, hugging her while they kissed.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi knew he was doing so unconsciously, and it made her even dizzier with cuteness.</p><p class="calibre2">(You’re so cute Theo… I just want to have you right here…!)</p><p class="calibre2">She thought kissing would satiate her lust, but it only made it stronger.</p><p class="calibre2">…A few minutes later, maybe dozens of minutes…</p><p class="calibre2">The second kiss finally ended, and their lips separated.</p><p class="calibre2">Both were breathing heavily.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was either excited, or perhaps just needed oxygen, and was breathing very fast.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi could stop breathing for dozens of minutes at a time, so she was clearly just excited.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh, ahh… Helvi…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s face was red, and his eyes were spinning.</p><p class="calibre2">Even though they just kissed, Helvi felt like assaulting him, but held back.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh, ahh… How was it Theo? Kissing… Me?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It felt… Very good…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see…”</p><p class="calibre2">Their faces were still very close, and Theo looked away in embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi felt like kissing him again, but felt like she would not be able to stop herself if she did.</p><p class="calibre2">“We should go to bed soon. You’re going to the guild early again tomorrow, aren’t you?</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, y-yes, that was the plan.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Can I use your grandparent’s bed in the room next to yours?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No problem, but I haven’t cleaned it in a while, so it’s dusty…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’ll do it with magic, don’t worry.”</p><p class="calibre2">She needed to get away as fast as possible, or she would be unable to stop herself.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi tried to go into the other room quickly, but felt something holding her back a little.</p><p class="calibre2">When she turned around, she saw Theo grabbing her negligee.</p><p class="calibre2">“Is there a problem?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, hum…!”</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed Theo grabbed it without thinking, and quickly let go.</p><p class="calibre2">He looked down, and flusteredly said.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I just grabbed it because I felt lonely. Sorry…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Kuh…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi grabbed her chest, feeling like her heart stopped and was about to explode.</p><p class="calibre2">Once she made sure it was moving, she let out a sigh of relief.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi, a devil, faced death for the first time.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi approached him once again, put her hand on his chin, and lifted it.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo said ‘ah…’, and she lightly kissed him.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Is this alright?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…A-again.”</p><p class="calibre2">After a dozen more kisses, each went into a separate room.</p><p class="calibre2">Suffice to say, both had trouble falling asleep.</p></div>
