<h3>Chapter 44 &ndash; Inside the Tent…</h3>

</h1><p class="calibre2">“Ah, Helvi… Hn, it feels good…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Both gasped and looked at each other, barely able to stay silent.</p><p class="calibre2">What they just heard turned their faces deep red.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, there… Hn… Ah…!”</p><p class="calibre2">They could faintly hear Theo’s voice, and it sounded much, much more erotic than usual.</p><p class="calibre2">They could not speak, but after spending so many years together, they could communicate without words.</p><p class="calibre2">(See? I knew it!)</p><p class="calibre2">(Y-yes…)</p><p class="calibre2">(Just like I imagined, Helvi is taking the lead…!)</p><p class="calibre2">(T-that’s what it looks like, but I think the other way around would be more exciting…)</p><p class="calibre2">(That’s just your tastes speaking.)</p><p class="calibre2">(N-no…)</p><p class="calibre2">How they could say so much without using words truly was a mystery.</p><p class="calibre2">(I-I want to peek… I wonder what it’s like in there.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Don’t do that. You’ll get caught.)</p><p class="calibre2">(You can peek.)</p><p class="calibre2">(See, even she says… Eh?)</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p><p class="calibre2">Celia let out a surprised voice, but managed to stay quiet enough for only Xena to hear, and frantically sealed her mouth with her hands.</p><p class="calibre2">(D-did you say that Xena?)</p><p class="calibre2">(I didn’t… Didn’t it sound like Helvi?)</p><p class="calibre2">(Yes, it was my voice.)</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia looked at each other, and opened their eyes wide with surprise.</p><p class="calibre2">They looked around, but did not see Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">(I am speaking directly to your minds.)</p><p class="calibre2">(D-does a spell like that even exist!?)</p><p class="calibre2">(…Incredible.)</p><p class="calibre2">(I think it is also incredible how you communicate with no words without being able to speak directly to each other’s minds.)</p><p class="calibre2">By peeking into their minds, she could tell they truly understood what the other was trying to say.</p><p class="calibre2">They used some hand signs, but not a single word, so Helvi was surprised to see they could still hold a relatively complex conversation.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn, ahh…! Ahh…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia were intrigued by Helvi’s magic, but found the noises coming from the tent to be more interesting.</p><p class="calibre2">Their faces were red all the way up to their ears.</p><p class="calibre2">(Helvi, can you do that while speaking to us? You really are an incredible technician…!)</p><p class="calibre2">(Xena stop it! Helvi, stop paying attention to us and focus on Theo…!)</p><p class="calibre2">(…It seems you are having fun with your intense delusions.)</p><p class="calibre2">They could hear Helvi sighing. They did not know why, but had little time to think about it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn, ah, it feels good…! Ah, there, a little harder…!”</p><p class="calibre2">In their minds, they were vividly picturing a naked Theo, and Helvi doing this and that to him. Obviously, Helvi could see everything that was going on in their minds.</p><p class="calibre2">(…Stop it you two, you are making me really want to do it. Look inside and stop your fantasies.)</p><p class="calibre2">(R-really? I think it’s enough if we just stay here and listen.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Y-yes. I don’t want to disturb a husband and wife’s business too much.)</p><p class="calibre2">(If that truly was what was going on, I would not let you stay out there. Look inside, but be careful not to let Theo notice.)</p><p class="calibre2">With their faces red, both nodded and made their way to the entrance of the tent without making a sound. They peeked through a gap and…</p><p class="calibre2">They were so excited they felt as though their hearts would jump out of their mouths, and what they saw… Was Helvi straddling Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">‘They really are doing it!’ they thought, but upon closer inspection, they noticed both were wearing clothes.</p><p class="calibre2">For a second they wondered if they could be doing it with clothes on, but that did not seem to be the case.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was lying face down, when they expected to find him face up with Helvi on top.</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed as though Helvi simply had her hand under his shirt and was pressing his back.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn, ah… It feels good…”</p><p class="calibre2">The hand underneath Theo’s shirt was clearly not moving, but his whole body was visibly relaxed, and he moaned with pleasure.</p><p class="calibre2">Could it be that Theo’s erogenous zone was on his back…!?</p><p class="calibre2">(Of course not. What are you thinking?)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s voice echoing inside their minds quickly dispelled this idea.</p><p class="calibre2">She then explained to them that she was just manipulating magic energy to give Theo a massage.</p><p class="calibre2">(Eh, so it’s possible to massage someone like that? Celia, do that to me later.)</p><p class="calibre2">(No way. I’ve never even heard of manipulating the magic energy inside someone’s body like that. If something goes wrong you’re going to end up exploding.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Ueh!? R-really? That sounds really dangerous!)</p><p class="calibre2">Manipulating the magic energy inside someone’s body was clearly very difficult, if someone as good as Celia declared it to be impossible for her.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was probably the only one in this world who could not only do this, but also use this technique to perform something as delicate as a massage.</p><p class="calibre2">(I could easily do it, but I should not. If Celia makes proper adjustments you should not explode, although your internal organs will be in tatters.)</p><p class="calibre2">(Oh my, was that a compliment? Thank you. Well then Xena, let’s give it a shot. Apparently you won’t explode.)</p><p class="calibre2">(But I’ll still be on a tightrope between life and death won’t I!?)</p><p class="calibre2">The three women talked directly into each other’s heads…</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn… Ah… Ah…!”</p><p class="calibre2">While Theo was completely surrendered to Helvi’s massage.</p>
