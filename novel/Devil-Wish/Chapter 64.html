Chapter 64 &ndash; Surname</h1><p class="calibre2">After finishing their meal, they washed the dishes together.</p><p class="calibre2">“Did that devil have a name?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was a little curious, and wanted to stop calling him devil, as Helvi was a devil as well.</p><p class="calibre2">“He probably had none.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? He didn’t?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Devils have social classes, and someone as weak as him most likely had no name.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see.”</p><p class="calibre2">Obviously Helvi did have a name, as she was the strongest among devils.</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you have a surname?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, just like most devils.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo stopped washing dishes.</p><p class="calibre2">“Then…”</p><p class="calibre2">His face was red all the way up to his ears.</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you want to use mine? Asper…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi also stopped.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’re husband and wife, and since you don’t have one… If you want…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo looked down as he waited for her response.</p><p class="calibre2">However, since said response did not come, he tried to peek upwards…</p><p class="calibre2">But the scenery around him suddenly changed. It felt as though he was floating for a second before he fell on something soft.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh… B-bed…?”</p><p class="calibre2">Judging by the feeling on his back and the furniture he could see around him, he could tell he was in his bedroom.</p><p class="calibre2">He was lying on his back, with Helvi hanging over him.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufu. Fufufufu…”</p><p class="calibre2">The lights were off, and he could not see her face.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-Helvi…?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I cannot… Anymore… Theo…”</p><p class="calibre2">When Theo’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, he saw Helvi’s face completely red and an almost predatorial glint in her eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">“I cannot hold back any longer. It is all your fault Theo. I have been trying so hard to contain myself after you showed me that earlier today.”</p><p class="calibre2">Perhaps it was because they were home, or perhaps because she was so excited, but she let her wings and horns out.</p><p class="calibre2">Those wings clung to Theo, as though they were caressing him.</p><p class="calibre2">“And now you said that to me… I simply cannot…”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi snapped her fingers and the clothes covering her voluptuous body disappeared.</p><p class="calibre2">At that moment, Theo’s face was so red it seemed to be ablaze.</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh!? H-Helvi, what…!?”</p><p class="calibre2">“We are doing it Theo. I am at my limit.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi’s long, slender fingers lightly grabbed Theo’s nether region.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“I thought it was too soon, but I cannot… I am sorry Theo, but it will be alright. I will make sure you feel good.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi whispered into Theo’s ear, as her lewd breathing became heavier.</p><p class="calibre2">Even Theo knew what was happening.</p><p class="calibre2">“I told you that when you make a deal with a devil, the devil takes something important from you… I will take your chastity.”</p><p class="calibre2">Who could reject the person they love as they whisper such a thing close to their ear?</p><p class="calibre2">Theo felt it was important, but he also had no problem giving it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum… It’s my first time.. .So please be gentle…!”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo as he looked up at Helvi with his face fully red, and tears in the corners of his eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi…”</p><p class="calibre2">They said each other’s names and kissed, signaling it was about to begin.</p><p class="calibre2">◇ ◇ ◇</p><p class="calibre2">The sun was up by the time it was over.</p><p class="calibre2">Both were wearing nothing and were under the same blanket.</p><p class="calibre2">The mood was quiet and peaceful, the complete opposite of what was happening just before.</p><p class="calibre2">They looked at each other and smiled.</p><p class="calibre2">“We did for a long time.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes… I was entranced.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo hid under the blanket all the way up to his nose, but still looked Helvi in the eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">Perhaps crossing this line made him a little more resistant to embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre2">“I was also too entranced. Was I too harsh on you Theo? I know I was forceful.”</p><p class="calibre2">“N-no, you weren’t! I… Felt really good!”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Fufu, I see. I felt very good as well.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi held back the throbbing those words caused her, grabbed Theo by the waist, and pulled him closer.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-Helvi, your chest, is hitting me…”</p><p class="calibre2">“You were just touching it. Surely this much is no problem?”</p><p class="calibre2">“T-that’s because… I was so absorbed…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was still embarrassed, even though he was grabbing and sucking them while they were doing it.</p><p class="calibre2">With his face red, he looked straight into Helvi’s face, trying not to look at them.</p><p class="calibre2">It was a rather innocent reaction, considering what they had just done.</p><p class="calibre2">It begged the question, who was the real devil? Helvi, or the one who made a devil like her fall in love from the bottom of her heart?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi… Can you say that again?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Say what?”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi had a good idea of what he meant, but played dumb.</p><p class="calibre2">Just as she expected, Theo’s face turned red again, and he seemed a little mad or anxious.</p><p class="calibre2">“…You’re kidding? What you said… A-about me …!”</p><p class="calibre2">He stuttered, unable to say it.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi figured she was being too mean, and gave him a kiss filled with love.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo was a little surprised, but soon did the same.</p><p class="calibre2">He had mostly been on the receiving end, but Helvi was pleased to see him becoming more assertive.</p><p class="calibre2">After their lips separated, Helvi said what she had thought all this time but was too embarrassed to say.</p><p class="calibre2">“I, Helvi Asper, love you, Theo Asper.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo felt as though he would cry of happiness, and responded with a broad smile.</p><p class="calibre2">“I… Love you too, Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">And thus, they confirmed their love.</p><p class="calibre2"></p>
