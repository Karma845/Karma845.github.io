<h3>Chapter 27: Cold Sweat X Meetup</h3>


<p>Haruka is coming to my house.</p>



<p>I panicked, wondering why this is happening so early.</p>



<p>That’s a given.</p>



<p>Shigure is also living in this small house with me.</p>



<p>There are too many things that need to be hidden.</p>



<p>How careless of me. Since we are couples, it is bound to happen at some point, I should have considered it earlier and thought of a way to deal with it.</p>



<p>But now, even if I regret it, it is already too late.</p>



<p>Of course, I could have refused.</p>



<p>But it was hard for me to say no to Haruka when I’ve been to her house so many times.</p>



<p>Especially after such a quarrel.</p>



<p>I didn’t want to give the impression that I was avoiding Haruka because of that incident.</p>



<p>Plus, I believe that this visit is a goodwill gesture from Haruka.</p>



<p>She probably wanted to reconcile with me, and that’s why she made this proposal. I don’t want to ignore her feelings.</p>



<p>So in the end I readily agreed to Haruka’s visit.</p>



<p>However, there is someone I need to ask for cooperation in advance.</p>



<p>That person is Shigure.</p>



<p>Haruka is coming to visit this weekend, which means Shigure has to stay away from home at all costs.</p>



<p>The question is, will the current Shigure be willing to accept that?</p>



<p>This seems to be a huge obstacle for me.</p>



<p>But…as it turns out, my fears were unfounded.</p>



<p>The next morning, when I explained the details to Shigure when I woke up, she agreed to cooperate with me without any qualms.</p>



<p>Not only that, she even helped me hide her personal belongings.</p>



<p>I guess she doesn’t like causing her sister any grief, despite being mean, she would never do anything to hurt someone.</p>



<p>So on the day of Haruka’s arrival.</p>



<p>After seeing Shigure off early in the morning, I cleaned my room frantically like a dishwasher.</p>



<p>After all, the living room is where I live.</p>



<p>As we spend most of our time in this room, things that we don’t want to show inevitably fall out.</p>



<p>Things like…… tangled hair.</p>



<p>I found three of them even though I had vacuumed them out.</p>



<p>I was really surprised to find these strands of hair in the most unexpected places.</p>



<p>A while ago, I saw one on the top of the lamp.</p>



<p>I wondered how it managed to get to such a place. According to some theories, it was the work of a spirit or the effect of quantum teleportation.</p>



<p>But frankly speaking, it’s okay if Haruka sees my hair, because at worst I’ll just be embarrassed. The real concern is Shigure’s hair.</p>



<p>All I have told Haruka is that I live with my father.</p>



<p>If a woman’s hair, no matter how long it is, happens to be found in such a house, that’s a big problem.</p>



<p>I have to eradicate every single strand of her hair. </p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>However, what the hell am I doing?</p>



<p>When I crawled all over the floor desperately trying to make up lies to Haruka like this, I felt so pathetic about myself. I can’t believe I’m trying so hard to hide something from my girlfriend.</p>



<p>If only I hadn’t hidden it from Haruka in the first place, if only I had told her the way I initially intended to… </p>



<p>“NO, STOP, STOP.”</p>



<p>I am such an idiot.</p>



<p>If I did that, as Tomoe pointed out, then Haruka would have to endure the situation of her boyfriend living in the same house with her sister who looks exactly like her.</p>



<p>That would be simply an act of throwing the burden onto Haruka in order to eliminate my own guilt.</p>



<p>Not doing that was the only justification for hiding this situation.</p>



<p>Yes, there was no mistake in the decision itself. It was the right decision.</p>



<p>What’s wrong is that after that, I did something stupid that made me hide this relationship not only for Haruka’s sake but also for my own.</p>



<p>It’s all because of my vulnerabilities: when Haruka rejected me and I leaned on Shigure… </p>



<p>“──!”</p>



<p>And right when my hands stopped out of anguish and regret.</p>



<p>The sound of a bell announcing the presence of a visitor came from the front door.</p>



<p>I looked up at the clock and saw that it was 11 o’clock, the time we had agreed on.</p>



<p>Haruka was here.</p>



<p>“… There’s no point in regretting Hiromichi Sato.”</p>



<p>I can not talk to Haruka about what I have done.</p>



<p>Haruka is still dealing with the fact that her parents had an affair and divorced.</p>



<p>What would happen if I told her the truth about my relationship with Shigure? She would never forgive me.</p>



<p>I was never in love with Shigure, I was always looking at Haruka through Shigure. I leaned on Shigure to stay in love with Haruka.</p>



<p>But I know that’s a shitty excuse, and Haruka will never understand it.</p>



<p>Like what Shigure said, it’s a mistake that can’t be undone.</p>



<p>If it can’t be undone, I’ll have to take this secret to my grave.</p>



<p>But first, I have to make it through this day!   </p>



<p> ×　×　×</p>



<p>As I opened the door, Haruka was there as expected.</p>



<p>“Hi…!”</p>



<p>“Hello. Hiromichi-kun.”</p>



<p>“Did you have any trouble on your way here?”</p>



<p>“No. Not at all.”</p>



<p>Haruka gave me a smile. She was dressed in a black live shirt with a passion-pink print and a pair of shorts, a casual summer outfit.</p>



<p>Her slender legs were breathtakingly beautiful.</p>



<p>She had a bag from the supermarket in front of the station. I wonder if she brought some snacks.</p>



<p>“I haven’t seen you since that day. It’s been a while since we’ve seen each other like this.”</p>



<p>“… Ah.”</p>



<p>“Thank you for forgiving me after I said those horrible things to you.”</p>



<p>“No, I was the one at fault. I acted out of impatience, ignoring Haruka’s feelings and trying to force my own feelings on you.”</p>



<p>I knew why I was impatient at that time.</p>



<p>It’s because of my weak self.</p>



<p>I was anxious when I saw her getting picked up at the beach.</p>



<p>I was afraid that an average high school boy like me would not be able to keep Haruka, who has the beauty of a model, tied to me.</p>



<p>It was this anxiety that made me feel rushed for a deeper relationship with her.</p>



<p>My worries, impatience, and skepticism were the things that drove me crazy.</p>



<p>Haruka was probably disturbed by the whole thing.</p>



<p>“I thought it was necessary to prepare for something like that, but it’s not something we should be thinking about right now. It’s just a matter of time until we grow up and get married, and then we can think about it together.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I knew that if I told you, you would understand!” </p>



<p>Haruka smiles at my words, her smile brighter than a thousand suns.</p>



<p>She had complete trust in me.</p>



<p>Even though I had done such a terrible thing, Haruka still believed in me.</p>



<p>I’m glad…</p>



<p>Now, even if we would not do more than kiss for years to come, if she can stay next to me with this smile, that’s enough for me to believe that she really loves me.</p>



<p>“Well then, I just want to make sure, but you haven’t eaten yet, right, Hiromichi-kun?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I was thinking of going out for ramen with you.”</p>



<p>“No worries. I’ll cook for you today, so let me use the kitchen.”</p>



<p>She raised the poly-bag she had brought with her.</p>



<p>It seems she had brought a lot of things to cook with.</p>



<p>Having my girlfriend’s home-cooked meal for the first time.</p>



<p>Naturally, I welcome such a thing.</p>



<p>“I’m looking forward to Haruka’s cooking. Do you cook a lot?”</p>



<p>“Nn. Not much really. But I’ll put a lot of love into it.”</p>



<p>Haruka lifts her arm to make a pose.</p>



<p>I can feel the Meshimazu flag, but honestly, I’m just happy that she’s willing to serve me a meal.</p>



<p>[TN: Terrible cooking flag]</p>



<p>Because of that, anything she serves today will taste better, I’m sure.</p>



<p>“Besides, we have a proper cooking teacher today, so you can count on us.”</p>



<p>If that’s the case, I’m even more relieved. I’m looking forward to lunch now.</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>……?</p>



<p>No, wait a minute.</p>



<p>Did you just say something strange, Haruka?</p>



<p>A culinary teacher? A teacher?</p>



<p>Who the hell is that? There’s only me and Haruka here──── </p>



<p>“Hee— So this is where Hiromichi-san lives!”</p>



<p>The next moment, I was so startled by the voice that came from behind Haruka that my heart almost jumped out of my mouth.</p>



<p>The voice sounded just like Haruka’s.</p>



<p>A person with the same voice as Haruka, who calls me ‘Hiromichi-san’.</p>



<p>There’s only one person in this world who can do that. The only person I don’t want to see right now.</p>



<p>And then… that very same person came up the stairs and appeared in front of me.</p>



<p>“The (retro) old fashioned atmosphere is nice. It looks like it’s going to be full of spiders and civets, though.”</p>



<p>“Shi, shi, Shigure—ee!?”</p>



<p>“Hello. It’s been a while since the sea camp. Long time no see, Hiromichi-san.”</p>



<p>Eh, wha, wha, wha, why?</p>



<p>Why is she here, eh, eh, eh, eh?</p>



<p>The unexpected situation had me gasping like a fish washed up on shore.</p>



<p>When Haruka saw my reaction, she tilted her head.</p>



<p>“Eh? Hiromichi-kun, is it possible that Shigure hasn’t told you anything? Shigure said she’d contact you herself.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I’m sorry. I wanted to see Hiromichi-san’s surprised face, so I didn’t call him. Tehe”</p>



<p>“No, you shouldn’t have done that!” </p>



<p>When Haruka heard this, she looked upset and apologized to me.</p>



<p>“S-sorry, Hiromichi-kun. I wasn’t very confident in my cooking, so I asked Shigure, who is a good cook, to help me out… But if you don’t like having Shigure in the house, I’ll ask her to leave.”</p>



<p>“Eh— That’s not true. Because we’re very good friends. He wouldn’t do something so “cruel” as to turn me away now, right, Hiromichi-san?”</p>



<p>Her usual teasing and that gaze…</p>



<p>That’s where the threat comes in.</p>



<p>Is she planning to follow Haruka into the house?</p>



<p>No, Impossible! Absolutely not! It’s too dangerous!</p>



<p>But…</p>



<p><em>“If you refuse me, I’ll tell Nee-san about everything you’ve done up until today, everything you’ve been keeping from her.”</em></p>



<p>If I refuse, you never know what she’ll do!</p>



<p>Gu, uuuuuu…!</p>



<p>“Ah, right… I don’t mind,  but it’s not like we know each other… enough for a home visit.”</p>



<p>“Hmph— Thanks for having me.”</p>



<p>Eventually, under the pressure of Shigure’s gaze, I let her in.</p>



<p>“Yaa,” Shigure gave me a really mean smile.</p>



<p>The warm feelings brought in by Haruka’s smile were quickly replaced by the pain that churned my stomach.</p>



<p>I wonder what’s going to happen to me now.</p>



<p>×　×　× </p>



<p>“Sorry for the intrusion!”</p>



<p>“Thanks for having me!”</p>



<p>Haruka and Shigure walked through the narrow corridor from the front door into the living room, which was my room. </p>



<p>“Fu—n. So this is Hiromichi-kun’s room. Ehehe. I’m a bit nervous.”</p>



<p>“Why are you nervous?</p>



<p>“Because it’s the first time I’ve been in the room of a boy my age… But it’s so tidy. I was under the impression that a boy’s room would be messier, but yours is so clean.”</p>



<p>“Nee-san, you’re mistaken, a boy’s room can’t be this clean in general. He must have cleaned it so well that not a single hair remains, just to welcome you. Those dust clothes left out to dry are the very proof of Hiromichi-san’s hard work.”</p>



<p>You knew because you were watching the whole time. How shameless!</p>



<p>“Is that so? You don’t have to be so careful. Compared to our club room, any room is usually clean.”</p>



<p>“It’s not as simple as that. Because you see, we’re all at that age. There must be one or two things that he doesn’t want you to see. For example, behind this suspiciously closed door…” </p>



<p>“…? O, Oii!?”</p>



<p>Wait, stop, that’s your room!</p>



<p>All of Shigure’s personal belongings that have been removed from the living room and kitchen are packed in there.</p>



<p>Shigure doesn’t have much of a hobby like other girls, but even so, there are many items that can be easily identified as women’s belonging at a glance.</p>



<p>If Haruka were to see them, she’d definitely…!  </p>



<p>“Shigure, don’t go around people’s houses without permission! If you trouble Hiromichi-kun, I will get angry!”</p>



<p>“Oka—y!”</p>



<p>Shigure pulled back from the sliding door after being scolded by Haruka.</p>



<p>Then she stuck out her tongue at me as if to say she was kidding.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry Hiromichi-kun! For Shigure’s teasing.”</p>



<p>“No… it’s fine, Haruka, you don’t have to apologize for it. It’s my dad’s room and it’s a bit of a mess, so please don’t open it.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Got it.”</p>



<p>“If it’s just that, then let’s check inside!”</p>



<p>You little…</p>



<p>What exactly do you want? You idiot!</p>



<p>Nothing could be worse than having Shigure while Haruka is in this house.</p>



<p>Does that mean, you never intended to help me in the first place…?</p>



<p>Then what are you going to do from here? Are you going to reveal everything to Haruka? Or are you just having fun messing with me?</p>



<p>Seriously, I don’t know what’s in her mind.</p>



<p>Anyway, right now I can’t trust Shigure.</p>



<p>I’ve to keep an eye on her.</p>



<p>I told them to wait while I brought coke for the three of us onto the table I had prepared beforehand.</p>



<p>Then we had a short chat.</p>



<p>We talked about how we were spending our summer vacation, how our homework was going, and so on. </p>



<p>During this time, I kept an eye on Shigure’s movements.</p>



<p>If she makes any suspicious movements, I’ll be sure to respond immediately, with a strong sense of urgency.</p>



<p>However, that was a bit excessive.</p>



<p>“Um, Hiromichi-kun…”</p>



<p>“Hmm, what is it?”</p>



<p>“Are you still concerned about Shigure? You’ve been staring at her since a while ago.”</p>



<p>“Buha”</p>



<p>“Mou— You shouldn’t do that Hiromichi-san. You have a girlfriend like Nee-san and yet you’re still ogling at her sister.”</p>



<p>Even though you know why I can’t take my eyes off you…</p>



<p>You sure enjoy making fun of me. Damn you.</p>



<p>“It’s not like that. I’m just not used to having two girls in my house.”</p>



<p>“True, you don’t seem to be popular, Hiromichi-san.’</p>



<p>“Stop it!”</p>



<p>“That’s not true. I love you, Hiromichi-kun.”</p>



<p>Ah, she’s an angel…!</p>



<p>“I’ve always wanted to ask you this, but you two met in elementary school, right?”</p>



<p>“Oh, yeah. We were the only fourth-graders in the nursery school.”</p>



<p>I answered, bracing myself for this devil’s sudden change of subject.</p>



<p>“I’ve heard that Nee-san liked Hiromichi-san since then, but did you also have an interest in Nee-san at that time?”</p>



<p>“That’s…”</p>



<p>“I don’t think so. Because I was so shocked about my mom and dad back then, I was dark and not cute at all…”</p>



<p>Haruka looks down in embarrassment.  </p>



<p>Maybe she was ashamed of herself at that time.  </p>



<p>Well, my impression of Haruka is indeed very different now than it was then.</p>



<p>When she was in nursery school, Haruka was the kind of girl that everyone would want to avoid.</p>



<p>But,</p>



<p>“I don’t know if I was in love with her.</p>



<p>But that didn’t mean she wasn’t cute.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“I don’t think that smile of yours changed much, Haruka. I remember how I liked messing around with you just to see your smile… Now that I think about it, maybe I just didn’t know about romantic feelings and I might have liked Haruka back then too.”</p>



<p>If I had been a little older, I would have seen Haruka in a more favorable light as the opposite sex. But if I was aware of it, I might have been too embarrassed to talk to her.</p>



<p>When I answered, Haruka’s cheeks flushed red with a smile. How cute!  </p>



<p>Shigure on the other hand murmured, “How nice!”</p>



<p>“I was also depressed at that time, but no one was ever kind to me. I envy Nee-san for meeting Hiromichi-san.”</p>



<p>“Shigure…”</p>



<p>I see. I’m sure Haruka wasn’t the only one who was shocked when her parents divorced, I wonder if there was a time when Shigure was as depressed as Haruka was then.</p>



<p>Knowing the Shigure of today, I can’t imagine it at all.</p>



<p>As I was thinking about it, Shigure came up to me, rubbing her knees, and asked,</p>



<p>“Hey, Hiromichi-san. If it was me you met at the nursery school, would you have been friends with me?”</p>



<p>“Of course…”  </p>



<p>Since we get along. I was about to answer that immediately, but my thoughts caught up with my senses just in time.  </p>



<p>I wondered if I could get along with Shigure, this annoying girl, if we met in elementary school.</p>



<p>Hmmm…</p>



<p>“That’s impossible! We wouldn’t have gotten along!”</p>



<p>“Eh— why?”</p>



<p>“Because you’re so mean!”</p>



<p>That’s right. The reason why I was friendly with Haruka was because she was such a pure girl.  </p>



<p>I loved Haruka’s innocent smile, so I tried my best to see more of it.</p>



<p>I doubt if I could have done it for Shigure’s mean smile.</p>



<p>“Uu— that’s my way to show affection!”</p>



<p>“The more we get to know each other, the meaner you get. That kind of twisted love is too much for a schoolboy to take in.”</p>



<p>I wanted to shake her by the shoulders and tell her to stop her intimidation.</p>



<p>And then Shigure sulked by puffing up her cheeks.</p>



<p>“Hmph! Fine. I don’t need Hiromichi-san to comfort me, I have karate.”</p>



<p>“So, you’ve been doing karate, Shigure?”</p>



<p>“I started because I was frustrated.”</p>



<p>“I see. Well, if you’re into sports, you can forget about the bad stuff.”</p>



<p>“No. I thought hitting someone would make me feel a little better.”</p>



<p>The motive is terrible. Too evil.</p>



<p>“I like hitting people, but since I didn’t want to be hit, I acted cute so that my seniors would cut me some slack.”</p>



<p>“Don’t use debuffs in karate.”</p>



<p>“But if they get hurt, I will treat them properly. I would press on their head and cheek and say, ‘pain-pain, go away.’ Then they were all more than happy to let me hit them again.”</p>



<p>“I’m now afraid of that elementary school girl. Probably a lot of people’s sexuality has been distorted, because of you.”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s how karate helped me get back on my feet. So I have no use for you, Hiromichi-san. Beh!”</p>



<p>“And Haruka was still very cute even while depressed.”</p>



<p>Seriously, I don’t know why she can’t be more calm and shy like Haruka.</p>



<p>And while I was wondering,</p>



<p>Haruka exclaimed in surprise.</p>



<p>“Heh— You two sure are close!”</p>



<p>“Eh? Close, you mean Shigure and me?”</p>



<p>“Yes. Because seeing the two of you talking side by side feels natural. And also, you’re physically close.”</p>



<p>Now that you mentioned it…</p>



<p>Our shoulders were unexpectedly touching while we were arguing. </p>



<p>This is the normal distance between us at home, but kind of unnatural to Haruka who is unaware of the situation.</p>



<p>Oh god! I made a terrible mistake.</p>



<p>Because I hadn’t been to school for a while during the summer vacation, and since we were at home all the time, I ended up talking to her as usual.</p>



<p>Haruka might’ve been thinking I was acting weird?</p>



<p>Anyway, I have to make a follow up…  </p>



<p>“M-my bad! Sorry for ignoring you even though it’s your first time coming to this house.”</p>



<p>“No. You don’t have to apologize. Actually, I’m happy since you listened to my request about being friends with Shigure. Thank you.”</p>



<p>“A-ah, sure!”</p>



<p>Rather than being uncomfortable with the distance between us, Haruka seemed happy and had a carefree smile on her face.</p>



<p>I mistook her for an angel. In reality, she’s a goddess.</p>



<p>What can I say, she probably never thought of teasing and deceiving people in her entire life.</p>



<p>“… Nee-san really trusts Hiromichi-san a lot!”</p>



<p>On the other hand, her sister Shigure puckered her lips in boredom at Haruka’s completely unfazed appearance.</p>



<p>How can someone end up like this after sharing blood with this goddess in the closest way possible?</p>



<p>“Nee-san, aren’t you anxious because I’m on good terms with Hiromichi-san?”</p>



<p>“Hm? Why?”</p>



<p>“We’re twins, you know. We have the same face, hair, voice, and everything. Wouldn’t you be more worried if your sister was getting along with your boyfriend? What if he cheats on you?”</p>



<p>What an in-depth thing this girl just said!  </p>



<p>I panicked. But Haruka,</p>



<p>“Hahaha!”</p>



<p>She simply brushed it off as if she heard a funny joke.</p>



<p>“There’s no way I’d think that. Shigure and Hiromichi-kun would never do that. Shigure worries about strange things sometimes.”</p>



<p>“How could you be so sure—!”</p>



<p>“Because Hiromichi-kun is my Prince, you know.”</p>



<p>“Cough!”</p>



<p>“P, Prince, you say…”</p>



<p>I coughed involuntarily.</p>



<p>Shigure’s cheeks twitched as well.</p>



<p>But Haruka was serious.</p>



<p>“That’s right. He saved me when I was all alone in grade school, accepted my confession after we met again in high school, and has been taking good care of me ever since. My prince, who is very strong and kind, accepted all of my weaknesses. I can’t imagine that such a Hiromichi-kun would cheat on me, let alone with my sister of all people.”</p>



<p>At that moment, “Ugyabii!” I almost fell back, screaming like a monster.</p>



<p>There’s so much difference between what Haruka believes about me and what I actually am that I felt like being crushed by guilt.</p>



<p>Maybe my girlfriend is too great of a goddess.</p>



<p>“Now that’s enough of me, what about you, Shigure? It’s been a few months since you moved here. Have you found a boyfriend?”</p>



<p>“… No, unfortunately.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see. So do you have a type of boy you like? Tell me. We never talked about this stuff when I was a kid, so I’d like to hear about it.”</p>



<p>“Nothing much. As long as he eats my food saying it’s delicious and holds my hand when I’m anxious, I don’t want anything more than that.”</p>



<p>“Hee— you’re not as greedy as I thought.”</p>



<p>“… Why do you say so? I know that I’m being more than a little greedy. Don’t you agree with me, Hiromichi-san?”</p>



<p>… Don’t look at me like that.</p>



<p>And stop poking my thighs under the table…!</p>



<p>I mean, talking about love with these two is like running full speed through a minefield.  </p>



<p>I need to change the topic right now!  </p>



<p>“Ah, by the way, Haruka, you were at the club’s training camp the other day. How was it? Did you have fun?”</p>



<p>“It was fun, but… it was a lot of work. We practiced from six in the morning until ten at night. That’s right. Do you want to see the pictures that the director uploaded?”</p>



<p>“Yes-yes, please show it to me!”</p>



<p>“Hold on a second. I’m not used to Insta…”</p>



<p>After saying that, Haruka struggled a bit while scrolling through the app, and then showed it to us.</p>



<p>On the screen of “Instagram,” an image-sharing app used by all the young people (it’s been on my phone since I bought it, but of course I’ve never touched it), there were countless photos of the drama club members.</p>



<p>Relieved that I’ve successfully diverted the conversation, I scroll through the album, looking for a picture of Haruka, since I’m not interested in pictures of anyone other than her.</p>



<p>In one picture she was sweating so much while practicing.</p>



<p>In other, she was slumped down and exhausted.</p>



<p>In another, she was posing with other club members.</p>



<p>There were many different pictures of Haruka there.</p>



<p>But in one of them in particular, which was probably taken before practice…</p>



<p>I felt a strong attraction to the picture of Haruka in her jersey with her hair tied back.</p>



<p>She wasn’t looking at the camera, nor was she smiling and posing.  </p>



<p>But with those serious expressions, and the reflection of the light making her eyes shine like burning a fire… she looks stunning! </p>



<p>I fell in love with her again. Well, I’m already in love with her, but now it’s doubled with both of her cute and cool sides.</p>



<p>“Hee— Nee-san, you look so pretty!”</p>



<p>When Shigure complemented the same photo as I do,</p>



<p>I was relieved that I wasn’t the only one who found this photo so attractive.</p>



<p>“Ahaha. It’s true, but only the picture is good. After this, the teacher got mad at me because I messed up my dialogues. Then the director showed me this picture, laughing at me and saying that I’m the kind of actor who only looked good in photos.”</p>



<p>“Hmm… But being photogenic is also a good talent. See, you can make a debut in acting like mom did when she was a gravure idol.”</p>



<p>“No way! Absolutely not! I indeed started acting because of inspiration from mom, but I’m just a lousy actress. I can’t be a professional. And I’d die of embarrassment if I do g-gravure! Absolutely impossible!”</p>



<p>I was inwardly relieved when Haruka denied modeling.</p>



<p>Because as a boyfriend, that’s a sensitive topic.</p>



<p>I want to see Haruka’s gravure pictures, but I don’t want anyone else to see it. I want to keep it all to myself.</p>



<p>And maybe it’s because of that relief.  </p>



<p>The moment I get distracted, my stomach starts growling.</p>



<p>“Fufu… Boyfriend-san, it looks like your stomach can’t be satisfied with just souvenir stories.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I’m sorry, Hiromichi-kun, for chatting so long. I’ll make lunch soon.”</p>



<p>“I’ll help.”</p>



<p>Following Haruka, Shigure also stood up.</p>



<p>I tried to help them, but Haruka refused, saying that she wanted Hiromichi-kun to have her home-cooked meal.  </p>



<p>Well, if that’s the case, I guess I’ll wait outside of the kitchen.</p>



<p>I sat down and looked at the two of them, who looked the same.</p>



<p>And then,</p>



<p>Haruka, who was taking out ingredients and other things from the bag she brought with her, shouted.</p>



<p>“Aaaaah!”</p>



<p>“What’s the matter, Nee-san?”</p>



<p>“I forgot to buy grated cheese… Do you have cheese in this house, Hiromichi-kun?”</p>



<p>“Uh, let’s see…”</p>



<p>Grated cheese?</p>



<p>I don’t know if we have it.</p>



<p>Because Shigure is the one who manages the whole kitchen.</p>



<p>I asked Shigure with a glance, and she understood immediately and shook her head slightly. </p>



<p>“I’m sorry. I don’t have any cheese right now.”</p>



<p>“I see… —Okay, I’ve decided. There was a convenience store right down the street, so I’m going to run and get some.”</p>



<p>“Since you’re treating me, I can at least go that far.”</p>



<p>“No, let me go… This is my way of apologizing for that day. I’ll be relying on Shigure for cooking, so I think I can do this much myself! I’ll be back soon, just wait for me!”</p>



<p>After saying that, Haruka ran away with a dash.</p>



<p>There was only me and Shigure left alone in the room.</p>



<p>xxx</p>



<p>(ED: Haruka calling Hiromichi was pretty cringe. And this ending is an obvious setup for some chaos, mostly for MC. Author really hates him)</p>



<p>Haruka left, leaving me and Shigure at home.</p>



<p>This was my chance to ask… why Shigure had come back.</p>



<p>I questioned her immediately,</p>



<p>“What do you want, Shigure?”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>She asked back with a cutesy puzzled expression.</p>



<p>She looked at me as if saying, “Did I do something wrong?”</p>



<p><em>Don’t play dumb with me. You know exactly what I’m talking about.</em></p>



<p>“Why did you come back? Didn’t I tell you that you’ve to stay out of the house since Haruka was coming? But you came back moreover with Haruka, why? I thought you were going to help me!”</p>



<p>“Yes, I did. That’s why I came here to help you out.”</p>



<p>“For what reason?”</p>



<p>“You’re not thinking clearly. I’ve been living in this house for several months now. No matter how many of my personal belongings you hide or how much you clean, you can’t erase my presence, as in my odour, from this house.”</p>



<p>“I sprayed the deodorizer yesterday…”</p>



<p>“Yes. But we’re so used to the smell of this house that we won’t be able to tell if that’s enough.”</p>



<p>“Hmm…”</p>



<p>“The odour of men and women are completely different from each other. What would Nee-san think if she smelled a woman other than herself in your house, where you are supposed to be living alone since your father has to move out?”</p>



<p>… That definitely will not be good for me.</p>



<p><em>I see, so if Shigure stays here with Haruka, she won’t get any strange thoughts.</em></p>



<p>So, Shigure was actually trying to help me…?</p>



<p>“Well, that’s just a pretext. In reality I was just annoyed that Onii-san and Nee-san were having fun without me, so I came to interfere.”</p>



<p>“You’ve revealed yourself.”</p>



<p>“It’s because I’m interested in you. I’m curious as to how the person who asked me to hold him is going to present himself as a boyfriend to my sister.”</p>



<p>“Ugh…”</p>



<p>I groaned as she kicked me where it hurts the most.</p>



<p>… Well, yeah, I guess that was really thoughtless of me.</p>



<p>This debt to Shigure is taking its toll on me. Even if I were to complain about her threats, it would not be justified if I were the cause of it.</p>



<p>Just what am I supposed to do?</p>



<p>While I was troubled, Shigure became strangely serious and said,</p>



<p>“… But I don’t think you should stay with her any longer.”</p>



<p>That tone was the coldest I’ve ever heard from her.</p>



<p>It was so cold that it froze my thoughts.</p>



<p>“Nee-san doesn’t really love you, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>I was quite upset with her statement.</p>



<p>Not that I believed what she just said. No way!</p>



<p>The reason I was so upset was the change in Shigure.</p>



<p>Shigure has been expressing her affection for me in various ways, but she has never done anything to denigrate Haruka to make herself look good. But now, her voice was clear and filled with hostility towards Haruka.</p>



<p>What exactly happened to her?</p>



<p>Puzzled, I responded with a denial. As Haruka’s boyfriend, I couldn’t just ignore it.</p>



<p>“T-there’s no way! Haruka loves me. She doesn’t doubt me in the slightest after what I did to her!”</p>



<p>“Indeed, that was a great deal of trust. My sister loves a strong and reliable prince who accepts everything including what is wrong in her… He is completely a different person from the Onii-san I know!”</p>



<p>“That’s because… I’m not living up to her expectations!”</p>



<p>“No, you’re wrong.”</p>



<p>With a crisp, confident tone, Shigure interrupted me.</p>



<p>“Nee-san doesn’t actually look at you, Onii-san. Because what she sees is your past self, when you were in elementary school. She is still in love with the you of the past, when you had no knowledge of man and woman, when you were pure and innocent without any restrictions to your emotions.”</p>



<p>“…!?”</p>



<p>“So that person can’t see how much effort it took when you forgave her. She takes it for granted without even realizing how precious you are.”</p>



<p><em>There’s no way that can be possible, right?</em></p>



<p>I thought of many things to assure myself, but I can’t say anything else.</p>



<p>As I choked on my words, Shigure continued, in a warm voice that was different from the cold tone she had been using,</p>



<p>“I pity you Onii-san, you’re not the strong prince that Nee-san spoke of. You are a very vulnerable, sensitive, and weak person. But because you are weak, you try hard to be strong. You’re kind and try as hard as you can to be honest with others. I like such an Onii-san. Much more than Nee-san does, I’ll always—”</p>



<p><em>Forever, I’ll always love you…</em></p>



<p>Shigure said, staring into my eyes.</p>



<p>Everytime she kissed me, she always looked at me with those eyes that were so full of love and affection that they could burst into tears anytime soon.</p>



<p>I was always overwhelmed when I looked into those eyes.</p>



<p>The amount of feelings that were put into them.</p>



<p>The unfathomable depth of love inside that drowns me just by looking into them.</p>



<p>And I couldn’t help but think…</p>



<p>I had never seen such deep love from Haruka.</p>



<p>Shigure’s feelings for me were perhaps even greater than Haruka’s.</p>



<p>But…</p>



<p>“Please stop.”</p>



<p>It was so vast, so deep, and so serious that I couldn’t respond.</p>



<p>How am I supposed to respond to those feelings…</p>



<p>I couldn’t, because— I’m already in a relationship with Haruka.</p>



<p>“I know how you feel, Shigure… It doesn’t matter how stupid or insensitive I am, it’s too obvious. I’m aware of it. But… I don’t like to hear you belittle Haruka.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>“It’s true that Haruka overestimates me. That’s what I think too. But… whatever the reason, Haruka loves me. There were times when I had doubts, but not anymore.”</p>



<p><em>As long as she smiles at me, I’ll never doubt her again.</em></p>



<p>“Even after knowing how you feel, I wonder with what face should I make a request, but… I want to respond to Haruka’s feelings. So please don’t threaten me again, and don’t try to ruin our relationship.”</p>



<p>“Please,” I added, bowing my head once more.</p>



<p>I was being selfish and a coward.</p>



<p>Because I lied to Haruka and rejected Shigure’s feelings.</p>



<p>I didn’t mean to do this. But I regretted the moment I stepped out of line.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean I can’t be honest now.</p>



<p>That’s why I requested— begged in front of Shigure.</p>



<p>For my twisted reasoning and emotions, I begged her to help me hide this pathetic side from Haruka.</p>



<p>“You really do love her, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>Seeing me like that, Shigure said a few words.</p>



<p>She sounded dumbfounded, yet determined over something.</p>



<p>“I understand. I’ll listen to your wish, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>“Y-you’re telling the truth?”</p>



<p>“Yes, but under one condition.”</p>



<p>I was relieved to know that she finally understood my feelings.</p>



<p>“Eii” But all of a sudden, Shigure wrapped her hands around my back and hugged me.</p>



<p>“Gyuu♪”</p>



<p>“Hey! You idiot! Get off me, Shigure! What if Haruka comes back…!”</p>



<p>“Fufu, that’s no good. No matter how dull Nee-san is, if she sees her sister and her boyfriend hugging each other, she wouldn’t be able to keep her mind off of it. You’ll be in big trouble, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>“If you know what you’re doing, get off me…!”</p>



<p><em>Damn you, I thought you were going to listen to me!</em></p>



<p>I put my hands on both of Shigure’s shoulders to shove her off.</p>



<p>That’s when she said,</p>



<p>“If you push me off now, I will take that as your final answer, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>“… What?”</p>



<p>“I will accept the fact that Onii-san loves only one person in this world, that is Nee-san. I will never threaten and never show you love more than how much a sister should. In other words, you must put all your strength into your hands to push me away from you as a condition for me to grant your wish, Onii-san.”</p>



<p><em>It’s not difficult, you know?</em> Shigure looked up at me from my chest and smiled.</p>



<p>I was at a loss for words…</p>



<p>It was not because the conditions were difficult.</p>



<p>No matter how experienced Shigure was in martial arts, there is a clear difference in arm strength between a man and woman.</p>



<p>If I were to push hard with these hands, I could easily shove her off.</p>



<p>…As she said herself, the condition was surprisingly simple.</p>



<p>But why would she make such a suggestion?</p>



<p>That’s what I don’t understand.</p>



<p>Because I can’t let Haruka see me like this, I have no choice but to get her off me before Haruka comes back. It’s inevitable for me to choose that. Even though Shigure knows that, why did she…?</p>



<p>It’s not like there’s any merit in it for Shigure to abandon her love for the inevitable.</p>



<p>“What are you thinking? Before, you told me you wouldn’t let me return to Haruka.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t understand, because I knew how serious her feelings were.</p>



<p>Shigure nodded in affirmation of my confusion.</p>



<p>“Well, yeah, I feel like an idiot for doing so. It’s true. But… Onii-san, that night you held my hand the whole time…”</p>



<p>“…!”</p>



<p>“You could have threatened me back, but you didn’t. You stayed next to me until morning, and that made me… very happy. I felt bad for being so selfish.”</p>



<p>There was no hint of goofiness in her eyes as she faintly smiled.</p>



<p>We’re family. We see each other every day.</p>



<p>It was clear from her face that,</p>



<p>She wasn’t lying.</p>



<p>I understood that if I push her away, she’ll keep her promise for sure.</p>



<p>“If I refuse… will you give up on me, Shigure?”</p>



<p>“I wonder. I’ll make an effort to do so, but it may get dragged a bit. But I suppose that should not concern you, Onii-san.”</p>



<p>“Concern… you say!”</p>



<p>“It doesn’t matter. Because I don’t care about Nee-san anymore.”</p>



<p>Shigure dismissed my lame attempt to be concerned.</p>



<p><em>“When I took Onii-san’s lips for the first time, I thought. As long as I could tell you how I felt, I don’t care how things would turn out with Nee-san. I had stopped caring about Nee-san, whom I loved so much.</em></p>



<p><em>And such a strong desire would’ve split your world in half, between the “only one” and the “other one”. That’s what my love for you was.</em></p>



<p><em>So, please let me know, Onii-san. If you really love Nee-san, no matter how much I try, I’ll be just a substitute for her, and I can only be the ‘other one’ for you.”</em></p>



<p>In the end Shigure added “please” murmuring like a mosquito, then rested her forehead on my chest.</p>



<p>After that, she stayed silent..</p>



<p>×　×　×</p>



<p>What should I do?</p>



<p>Upon Shigure’s proposal, I find myself frozen with my hand resting on her shoulder.</p>



<p>Shigure’s leaning force is weak, and the arm wrapped around my back holds only enough strength to lightly stroke.</p>



<p>If I were to lightly push this slender shoulder with some force, Shigure’s body would easily yield.</p>



<p>But if I do that, Shigure will give up on me.</p>



<p>Even if I can’t accept it, I have to keep it in my heart and behave as her brother.</p>



<p>…Is that really a good thing?</p>



<p>Knowing the strength of Shigure’s feelings, I can’t help but hesitate.</p>



<p>However,</p>



<p><em>“The intense obsession splits one’s world into ‘only one person’ and ‘everyone else.’ That is what love is, isn’t it?”</em></p>



<p>Those were the words Shigure said earlier. I believe they are true.</p>



<p>To love someone means to choose only one person.</p>



<p>Who that “only one” is is a given.</p>



<p>And that ‘only one person’ has already been determined since the moment of Haruka’s confession.</p>



<p>By simply exerting a little force right now, many problems could be resolved.</p>



<p>Shigure would no longer blackmail me, and I could start over with Haruka.</p>



<p>Moreover, this is something we cannot avoid in order to start over as siblings.</p>



<p>Instead of being endlessly tossed around by an unattainable love, I should provide a clear answer and return to being just siblings. Isn’t that also for Shigure’s sake?</p>



<p>Of course, I might not be able to sort out my feelings right away.</p>



<p>But I won’t just leave Shigure’s anguish unattended either.</p>



<p>Shigure has helped me a lot until now. Without Shigure, I might not have been able to love Haruka. I will definitely repay that debt. I will never let Shigure feel lonely. I will continue to cherish Shigure as my sister, even more than before. I swear to do that.</p>



<p>So… I applied a little bit of pressure to the fingertips resting on Shigure’s shoulder.</p>



<p>As if grasping her shoulder.</p>



<p>In that instant,</p>



<p>“…!”</p>



<p>Shigure’s body trembled ever so slightly.</p>



<p>It was a momentary tremor, a single breath’s worth.</p>



<p>Shigure quickly concealed that tremor.</p>



<p>But… it was enough to blow away the deceit I had been spouting.</p>



<p>For Shigure’s sake.</p>



<p>I always think about what’s convenient for myself.</p>



<p>What have I been seeing in Shigure’s eyes all this time?</p>



<p>There’s no way she would be happy to discard such feelings.</p>



<p>I hate it when she trembles like this.</p>



<p>And yet, Shigure is giving me the chance to ease my burden.</p>



<p>Shigure… has always been like that.</p>



<p>When we first met, she guided me, a socially awkward roommate of the opposite sex.</p>



<p>During the camping night, she stayed by my side when I was about to fall apart.</p>



<p>And even when I begged Shigure to help me forget about Haruka the other day, she was there for me…</p>



<p><em>“Even if I were to do something, Onii-san won’t be able to forget Nee-san. It’s not just because we’re twins. It’s because Onii-san is someone who can’t be disloyal to others. Nee-san is at fault. You’re not. She’s someone who can’t simply accept and separate things like that. She’ll surely regret it. Later on, she’ll blame herself and suffer much more than now.”</em></p>



<p>At that time, Shigure could have fulfilled her desires without saying unnecessary things.</p>



<p>But she didn’t do that.</p>



<p>Shigure knows that I am weak, so she treats me with utmost care, making sure I don’t get hurt, making sure it doesn’t pain me.</p>



<p>She values my feelings above her own emotions to the point where she can declare that the relationship with her sole sister doesn’t matter at all. She thinks of me more than anyone else.</p>



<p>Pretending to be clever, pretending to be cunning, but deep down, Shigure is kinder than anyone else.</p>



<p>When I think about that fact again, my heart tightens with pain.</p>



<p>…Why is it like this?</p>



<p>Why does Shigure love me so much?</p>



<p>And why am I not embracing Shigure with both of these hands instead of pushing her away?</p>



<p>…If, yes, if this is purely a hypothetical scenario,</p>



<p>If I hadn’t met Haruka,</p>



<p>Would I have been able to respond to this pure love that goes on endlessly?</p>



<p>Because of meeting Haruka, I…</p>



<p>“…!”</p>



<p>Hey, stop it! What am I even thinking?</p>



<p>What’s the point of entertaining meaningless ‘what if’ thoughts?</p>



<p>What I should be doing right now is not that.</p>



<p>What I should be doing now is rejecting ‘everyone else’ for the sake of ‘only one person,’ Haruka.</p>



<p>There is nothing else. There can’t be.</p>



<p>If I just exert a little bit of force, it will come true.</p>



<p>With no more threats from Shigure, no more temptations or affections directed at me, I can restart with Haruka without hesitation.</p>



<p>I can start “true love.” Isn’t that exactly what I wanted?</p>



<p>Now, push! Push and choose! “Only one person” for me!</p>



<p>That’s the best option. The answer I should choose as Haruka’s lover and Shigure’s brother. I understand. Ah, I understand! So why…?</p>



<p>“~~~~~!”</p>



<p>I can’t push.</p>



<p>No strength fills the hand grasping Shigure’s shoulder.</p>



<p>Something within me resists my attempt to exert force.</p>



<p>“I’m home!”</p>



<p>In the midst of this, how much time has passed?</p>



<p>The front door opens, and Haruka’s voice reaches my ears.</p>



<p>Haruka has returned.</p>



<p>This is bad.</p>



<p>If she sees this scene, everything will be over.</p>



<p>But even though I know that, I… still couldn’t move.</p>



<p>It was Shigure who moved.</p>



<p>While Haruka was taking off her shoes at the entrance, Shigure gently released her hand from behind my back and distanced herself from me.</p>



<p>Then she lifted her face that had been lowered all this time.</p>



<p>“Alright. Time’s up ♡”</p>



<p>That expression was her usual, mischievous smile.</p>



<p>As if saying, “I got you.”</p>



<p>But… She couldn’t hide the redness in the corners of her eyes.</p>



<p>Seeing that expression, I understand everything.</p>



<p>Why… there’s nothing else.</p>



<p>There’s only one reason why I couldn’t move.</p>



<p>I… regretted it. Regretted the fact that this affection wouldn’t be directed towards me.</p>



<p>Just by exerting a little less force than opening the door, I could have started over with Haruka,</p>



<p>I should have wanted that,</p>



<p>But I couldn’t choose ‘only one person’ as my lover anymore,</p>



<p>Because I had fallen in love with Shigure.</p>



<p>x x x</p>



<p>Oh no. </p>



<p>Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.</p>



<p>I didn’t know.</p>



<p>I never realized I had such an obsession with Shigure.</p>



<p>Cold sweat keeps pouring down my back, uncontrollable.</p>



<p>Since when?</p>



<p>At least on that day when Shigure’s first kiss was overwritten, I still had a choice.</p>



<p>I like Haruka more than Shigure.</p>



<p>But today, I can’t say that anymore.</p>



<p>I missed the chance to start over with Haruka, who should have been my “only one,” cherishing the affection from Shigure, who I can’t respond to and don’t deserve.</p>



<p>How did it come to this?</p>



<p>When did it turn out like this?</p>



<p>Endless questions whirl around in my head.</p>



<p>“Hiromichi-kun?”</p>



<p>“Huh!?”</p>



<p>Someone calls out to me like that.</p>



<p>I raise my head in surprise and see Haruka’s worried face.</p>



<p>“W-what’s wrong, Haruka?”</p>



<p>“…You’ve been looking troubled for a while. …Wasn’t it delicious?”</p>



<p>Her words make me remember.</p>



<p>That I’m now experiencing for the first time being served homemade cooking by my lover.</p>



<p>And yet, I’ve been mechanically consuming the prepared dish without truly savoring it, my mind elsewhere. What have I done?</p>



<p>“N-No, it’s not like that! It’s incredibly delicious! Look!”</p>



<p>Pushing aside the doubts and unease swirling in my mind, I taste the dish placed in front of me.</p>



<p>The Neapolitan spaghetti that Haruka made had a rich tomato flavor with a strong accent of bitter bell peppers, precisely the kind of seasoning I love.</p>



<p>“The bell peppers have a nice crunch and a pleasantly bitter taste. It’s seriously amazing!”</p>



<p>“I-I’m glad. I was getting worried that it didn’t suit your taste.”</p>



<p>“No, it was so delicious that I was completely absorbed in it.”</p>



<p>To think I was silently devouring such a delicious homemade dish.</p>



<p>I feel dizzy from my own confusion.</p>



<p>Did I manage to hide it somehow?</p>



<p>When I sneak a glance,</p>



<p>“It’s thanks to Shigure. Thank you.”</p>



<p>Haruka expresses gratitude to Shigure, who sits next to her, twirling pasta with a fork.</p>



<p>“Eh? Shigure?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Shigure told me that Hiromichi would appreciate bell peppers cut into chunky slices rather than thinly sliced, to bring out the bitterness and texture.”</p>



<p>“You mentioned at school before that you like bell peppers, Hiromichi-san.”</p>



<p>Saying that, Shigure raises her index finger to her lips.</p>



<p>A secret gesture.</p>



<p>“Ah, yeah… I think I mentioned it.”</p>



<p>“That’s nice. You two are in the same class, after all. It’s a little frustrating to think that Shigure knows things about Hiromichi-kun that I don’t.”</p>



<p>“Fufu. Maybe someday I’ll know more about Hiromichi-san than Nee-san does.”</p>



<p>No, that’s not it. I haven’t talked about these things at school.</p>



<p>It must be something she observed and understood from our regular meals.</p>



<p>For the sake of serving me delicious food.</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Why now, and why did I start questioning such obvious things?</p>



<p>There are too many moments that come to mind.</p>



<p>I like a girl who likes me.</p>



<p>A girl who tells me she loves me and does various things to express it.  </p>



<p>Moreover, she’s incredibly adorable. There’s no way I wouldn’t fall for someone like that.</p>



<p>In reality, I’ve felt my heart race for Shigure many times throughout my life.</p>



<p>I’ve been using the excuse that it’s because Shigure is the twin sister of my girlfriend, attributing all those fluttering feelings to that, but I’ve taken Shigure’s kindness for granted without thinking.</p>



<p>As a result, my heart was unknowingly invaded.</p>



<p>By the poison called love that Shigure kept pouring into me.</p>



<p>And now, in the end, I’ve become someone who thinks it’s messed up to lose Shigure’s affection, even though I have Haruka as my girlfriend. What a pathetic situation.</p>



<p>Moreover, the fact that I couldn’t choose Haruka brings forth an even more despicable and terrible question, one that leads to a chain reaction.</p>



<p>That question is—</p>



<p>“Ah, Hiromichi-kun, Hiromichi-kun!”</p>



<p>“W-What?”</p>



<p>“You have sauce on your cheek. Let me wipe it off for you.”</p>



<p>“N-No, it’s fine!”</p>



<p>At that moment, as if being repelled, I pulled away and escaped from Haruka’s outstretched hand.</p>



<p>“I-I can do that myself.”</p>



<p>“Hahaha, yeah, you’re right. You’re not a child. Sorry.”</p>



<p>“No, thanks for telling me…”</p>



<p>While expressing my gratitude, I wiped off the sauce from my cheek, and… I felt a chill.</p>



<p>It was towards my own feelings for taking that action.</p>



<p>I… didn’t want to show it.</p>



<p>That affectionate interaction that would clearly portray me and Haruka as a couple, right next to Shigure.</p>



<p>In other words, that despicable and terrible question from earlier, it’s this.</p>



<p>Right now, I’m torn between Haruka and Shigure, wondering which one I truly like—</p>



<p>N-No! Stop it! Stop it, you idiot!</p>



<p>I desperately shake off the thoughts that arise in my mind.</p>



<p>Thinking about this is already beyond reason!</p>



<p>Admittedly, I do have feelings for Shigure as Shigure.</p>



<p>I have to acknowledge that. I have no choice.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t change the fact that I’m Haruka’s boyfriend.</p>



<p>She trusts me enough to call me her prince.</p>



<p>Betraying that would be something inhumane!</p>



<p>“Uh, hey Haruka!”</p>



<p>“Hm? What is it?”</p>



<p>“Do you know that there’s a fireworks festival at Tsurumi River on the last weekend of summer vacation?”</p>



<p>“Of course, I know! I go with my friends every year. By the way, we used to go with Shigure too, remember? The four of us as a family. Do you remember?”</p>



<p>“That was back in kindergarten, right? It’s nostalgic. I remember the two of us making shapes with cookie cutters.”</p>



<p>“…Well, um… This year, would you like to go and see it with just the two of us? Of course, if you already have plans, I don’t want to force it—”</p>



<p>“I’m in!!!”</p>



<p>“O-Oh, I-I see…”</p>



<p>“That’s right! A festival date will be so much fun! I’m looking forward to it!”</p>



<p>Haruka eagerly hopped on board with enthusiasm.</p>



<p>I let out a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>That’s right. Instead of wasting time with foolish thoughts, I should focus on Haruka. I should think of things that would make her happy.</p>



<p>After all, I’m Haruka’s boyfriend.</p>



<p>I became her boyfriend even before I met Shigure.</p>



<p>I shouldn’t care about Shigure’s gaze.</p>



<p>I won’t think about Shigure in front of Haruka.</p>



<p>“Aww, I want to go too!”</p>



<p>“Nope. This is a date, so Shigure should find her own boyfriend and go with him.”</p>



<p>“Tch.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>The discomfort of feeling like an outsider while saying those words wells up deep inside me.</p>



<p>I clench my fists, as if crushing that feeling, beneath the table.</p>



<p>Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.</p>



<p>I can’t let Haruka find out about this.</p>



<p>I don’t want to make Haruka sad.</p>



<p>So, please, just wither away there.</p>



<p>Remain hidden, never to surface.</p>



<p>While desperately pleading.</p>
