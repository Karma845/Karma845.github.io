<h3>Chapter 27 &ndash; Battle for a Prize</h3>

<p class="calibre2">After asking Fiore, they were told there was a spacious vacant lot outside of the mercenary guild.</p><p class="calibre2">There were not many houses nearby, so they could be a little noisy.</p><p class="calibre2">“So, shall we do it over there?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asked Helvi, to which the other two nodded.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo, the prize, followed them as they left the guild.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ohh, I didn’t know about this place.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s perfect for fighting.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia said as they looked around.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-isn’t it a little dark?”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Theo.</p><p class="calibre2">The sun was setting, so to Theo’s eyes, it was too dark to fight.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, you don’t have good night vision. We’re used to it though.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. What about you Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">Both said they had no problem with it, and questioned Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">“No problem at all. I can see as well as I did at midday.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ohh, that’s great.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But we do not want our spectator, Theo, to be unable to see our fight.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi snapped her fingers, and suddenly the empty lot was bright.</p><p class="calibre2">The other three were surprised, and looked up. What they saw was a big ball of light.</p><p class="calibre2">It was not so bright that it was unsafe to look at directly, but was enough to light the empty lot.</p><p class="calibre2">“Is this enough Theo? Can you see?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, thank you very much Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">Both looked at each other and smiled, making Xena and Celia feel a little left out and annoyed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Helvi, should I bring out a ball of light too? Maintaining a ball of light this size must put a lot of strain on your magic energy, right?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. We want a fair fight.”</p><p class="calibre2">An average sorcerer could only maintain a ten diameter ball of light for about ten minutes.</p><p class="calibre2">Fighting while maintaining it would be difficult, so Celia wanted to make things fair.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi let out a little laugh, perhaps understanding what Celia was thinking.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s alright. Magic of this level is nothing to me, and will not even count as a handicap. I can bring out a hundred more if you want.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Aren’t you underestimating us just a bit too much?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Underestimating? No, this is a fair assessment of my power.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Fine. Rather than talking, show us your power by fighting.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Agreed.”</p><p class="calibre2">The three had aggressive smiles on their faces, and Theo looked on nervously at the battle that was about to start.</p><p class="calibre2">“Theo, step back.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo turned away from Helvi and was about to start running.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, wait Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes? …!”</p><p class="calibre2">The moment Theo looked back, he found himself unable to breathe.</p><p class="calibre2">His lips were sealed by other lips.</p><p class="calibre2">It was only for a few seconds, but it was so sudden, Theo’s mind went blank.</p><p class="calibre2">After stepping away from Theo, Helvi said with a self-satisfied expression.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now I will most certainly win. Thank you Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Y-yes, do your best…!”</p><p class="calibre2">This time Theo ran away as his face became completely red.</p><p class="calibre2">“Uwa. Did you see that Celia? That was incredible.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I did. Quiet.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you feeling embarrassed Celia?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I’m not!”</p><p class="calibre2">Both faces were a little red, but for some reason Celia looked embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry to keep you waiting.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You just had to show it to us didn’t you? That’s not fair you lucky woman!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Fufu, is that not a compliment?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You got married didn’t you? When?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yesterday.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yesterday!? So you’re newlyweds! That’s intense.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. By the way, why is the other one hiding her face?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, Celia is just too pure.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Quiet, I’ve calmed down.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Celia, as she took deep breaths to try to calm her heart.</p><p class="calibre2">A sorcerer could not give it her all in battle if her emotions were in disarray.</p><p class="calibre2">“Who’s going first? You’re still trying to calm yourself, so should I go first?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes, that would be for the best.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hou? What are you saying?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh? Is there a problem?”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena tilted her head in confusion, and Helvi grinned.</p><p class="calibre2">“You should both attack at the same time. It will not be a battle otherwise.”</p><p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the heat was drawn away from Xena and Celia’s faces.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Eh, you’re going that far?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I told you. The difference in our power is that large.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I don’t care if you regret that, you know?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I will not, so there is no problem.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia wanted to fight for fun and out of curiosity, but now anger was added to the mix.</p><p class="calibre2">“Alright, we’ll both attack you. That’s how confident you are right?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, let’s do that.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Do it, it would be boring otherwise,”</p><p class="calibre2">“But I’m irritated, so let’s add another prize if we win.”</p><p class="calibre2">Said Xena while grinning and raising one finger.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hou, fine by me. I will not lose.”</p><p class="calibre2">“If we win… I want a kiss from Theo.”</p><p class="calibre2">That moment, Xena and Celia felt overwhelming pressure coming from right in the front of them.</p><p class="calibre2">“Wha…!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Kuh…!”</p><p class="calibre2">That pressure made them take a step back.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hou… You want a kiss from Theo, even though even I have only received one?”</p><p class="calibre2">Every time they kissed, it had been initiated by Helvi, except from the one Helvi received that morning.</p><p class="calibre2">A kiss from Theo was more valuable to Helvi than anything in the whole world, and she could not stand the idea of it being taken away by the girls in front of her.</p><p class="calibre2">“I do not know if I will be able to hold back after hearing that. Please do your best not to die.”</p></div>
