<h3>Chapter 63 &ndash; End of the Trip</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, they rode back to Nemophila.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi and Theo messed around on their way to the mountains, but felt too awkward to</p><p class="calibre2">do anything on the way back.</p><p class="calibre2">Theo felt foolish, and too embarrassed to speak.</p><p class="calibre2">It did not help that he was ‘in that situation’ for a full ten minutes.</p><p class="calibre2">He thought it was the first time someone had seen it, but Helvi had actually seen it when he was sleeping and when he went to take a bath on their first night together.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, this was the first time he was fully aware that she saw it, and it was the most embarrassed he had been since meeting Helvi.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi wanted to stick more closely to him on the way back, but felt bad for Theo, and contained herself.</p><p class="calibre2">She read his mind and thought his innocence was cute, but it made her feel even worse.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, if she did start hugging him at that time, she was unsure if she could stop herself from going even further.</p><p class="calibre2">After a mostly silent ride back, they reached Nemophila.</p><p class="calibre2">First they returned the horses.</p><p class="calibre2">The horse that Theo rode was a little unruly when it was time to say goodbye, but calmed down once Theo pat it.</p><p class="calibre2">It seemed as though it would still not easily allow anyone else to ride it, so Theo was asked to stop by to help with its training. There was of course a reward involved, and Theo gladly accepted.</p><p class="calibre2">Next, they entered the mercenary guild and talked to Fiore.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fiore It’s been a while!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, Theo! I’m glad to see you’re alright! I assume the quest was a success!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes! We’re here to report it!”</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore was relieved to see Theo’s cute and energetic smile.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi, who stood next to him, appeared to also be well.</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore figured there would be no problems with her around, but was still a little worried.</p><p class="calibre2">“Good job Helvi. Did you have fun with Theo?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">She found this tepid answer strange, coming from a woman that was usually brimming with confidence.</p><p class="calibre2">(Did something happen?)</p><p class="calibre2">Fiore asked in her mind.</p><p class="calibre2">(…There was a small problem with the quest itself, but right now…)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi peeked at Theo, who looked back at her but turned away in embarrassment as soon as their eyes met.</p><p class="calibre2">(…You two are turning into less of a married couple and more like an innocent couple.)</p><p class="calibre2">(That is not true. What are you talking about?)</p><p class="calibre2">(This bitter-sweet mood… Maybe it’s because Theo is reacting like a girl that’s in love for the first time?)</p><p class="calibre2">(I agree, but there is a reason for this. You see…)</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi was impressed that Fiore held a conversation with her in her mind while accepting Theo’s report.</p><p class="calibre2">(Well… I think you were both wrong and not wrong. I think the biggest takeaway here is that Theo really is a boy after all…)</p><p class="calibre2">(It feels a little awkward, but that is all. Tomorrow it will be back to normal.)</p><p class="calibre2">Their conversation finished just as the report did as well.</p><p class="calibre2">“Good job everyone. The medicinal herbs are in good condition thanks to Theo, and your reward will be here no later than tomorrow morning.”</p><p class="calibre2">And with that, the travel quest was over.</p><p class="calibre2">“Thanks Helvi and Theo! I had a lot of fun!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I had fun too, and Theo’s food was as delicious as always. I also enjoyed getting closer to you, Helvi.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I had fun too! Let’s accept a quest together again sometime!”</p><p class="calibre2">“I had never done something like this, so I enjoyed myself as well.”</p><p class="calibre2">Xena and Celia returned to their inn, leaving Theo and Helvi alone. The slightly awkward mood returned.</p><p class="calibre2">“…L-let’s go back too.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Although they felt awkward, they still held hands on the way home.</p><p class="calibre2">When they got home, Helvi brought back their luggage from the sky. Xena and Celia’s was also mixed in, so Helvi sent it to them.</p><p class="calibre2">Suffice to say, both were quite surprised when their luggage suddenly dropped from the sky.</p><p class="calibre2">They quietly unpacked their things, and only started speaking again when they started having dinner.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Now that I think about it, were you hurt by that devil?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh, n-no, I’m fine!”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo answered, although he was a little startled because Helvi suddenly spoke.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. Good.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Thank you very much. Did you talk to that devil? He was saying something about hell.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, a little.”</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi explained plainly what he said, and hearing that the man told Helvi she should be the king of hell made Theo a little anxious.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum… Do you want to go back to hell Helvi?”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo figured he would not be able to live there, and the idea of Helvi returning made him sad.</p><p class="calibre2">Helvi saw this as she peeked inside his mind, and responded with a gentle smile.</p><p class="calibre2">“I have no interest in returning to a world without you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…! T-thank you…”</p><p class="calibre2">Theo’s face was red, but he responded with a happy smile.</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, cute, decided Helvi in her mind.</p><p class="calibre2"></p>
