<h2>Chapter 6: I Want You to Remain Mine</h2>



<p>When you’re absorbed in something, time passes in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>A few weeks had passed since he started his part-time job, and today was finally his last day of work.</p>



<p>In other words, once today’s work is finished, he will finally get paid.</p>



<p>At least, that’s what he thought──</p>



<p>「Here’s your pay.」</p>



<p>During his shift, the Kedogawa store manager suddenly handed him his paycheck.</p>



<p>「Huh? But I haven’t finished today’s work yet…」</p>



<p>「I have to go out for a bit now, so I’ll pay you in advance for that as well. I’ve added a little extra as a token of my appreciation.」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Kamome opens the envelope.</p>



<p>The money inside certainly appears to be more than expected.</p>



<p>「I heard from Amane-chan that you started working part-time for your first girlfriend’s birthday present. I fell in love with that enthusiasm.」</p>



<p>The manager gives a thumbs up.</p>



<p>It seems that he had added a little extra to his paycheck out of his own pocket.</p>



<p>Honestly, it seemed like a lot of money for a high school student to have.</p>


<p>But thanks to that, the gift options increased.</p>



<p>「Give your girlfriend a nice present.」</p>



<p>「Manager… Thank you very much!」</p>



<p>In response to the manly manager’s thoughtful act, Kamome lowered his head vigorously with gratitude.</p>



<p>「Good, but you’re still at work. Don’t get carried away and do your work properly until the end.」</p>



<p>At these words from Amane, who was dusting shelves with a duster, Kamome replied to her with a lively “Yes!”.</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>And so, in the evening after finishing his part-time job at Kedogawa Sports.</p>



<p>Since the manager was out, after saying his goodbyes to the remaining staff on duty, Kamome decided to head straight to the store to pick out a present.</p>



<p>That’s right ── Himawari’s birthday is coming up tomorrow.</p>



<p>He can’t waste the goodwill of the Kedogawa manager.</p>



<p>“I will make this the best birthday for Himawari”, Kamome passionately resolved, throwing himself into choosing a present.</p>



<p>…However, he ended up racking her brain with the main subject of choosing a present.</p>



<p>「Damn… I don’t even have a clue what to get her.」</p>



<p>For the past few days, He had been so engrossed in his first part-time job that he hadn’t had time to think about anything else, much less the important choice of potential present.</p>



<p>To start with, he didn’t even have any idea what would be good.</p>



<p>「What should I do? There’s absolutely no time.」</p>



<p>Even if he decided to consult Misaki or Kensuke now, it would be a bother for them to be suddenly called up…</p>



<p>Himawari’s birthday is tomorrow.</p>



<p>“What to do… What to do…”, Kamome wanders around town holding his head.</p>



<p>And then, there.</p>



<p>「…Ah.」</p>



<p>「Ah.」</p>



<p>Once again, he ran into Tsuyu.</p>



<p>He spotted her standing in front of a clock tower near the station, looking at her smartphone.</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu, were you waiting for me again?」</p>



<p>「Haah!? I wasn’t! This time it’s a complete coincidence!」</p>



<p>As soon as they meet, they start arguing.</p>



<p>「Or rather, I’m simply waiting for someone…」</p>



<p>As she says that, Tsuyu quickly turns around.</p>



<p>「It’s fine, you don’t believe me anyway.」</p>



<p>「No, I believe you.」</p>



<p>At those words, Tsuyu turns back around.</p>



<p>Kamome bows deeply to her.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry about the other day. Thanks for the cake. You really came to apologize to me.」</p>



<p>「…It’s nothing.」</p>



<p>In front of Kamome apologizing for the incident the other day, Tsuyu lowers her eyes, looking embarrassed.</p>



<p>「…Are you on your way home from your part-time job right now?」</p>



<p>「Yes, until today though. I got paid.」</p>



<p>「Ahh, tomorrow’s Himawari’s birthday, right? So, are you in the middle of choosing a present for her?」</p>



<p>「Eh, how did you know…?」</p>



<p>「It’s not like I asked her or anything. That girl blurted it out herself. She was really looking forward to it.」</p>



<p>Saying that, Tsuyu puts a smile on her lips.</p>



<p>「…About that.」</p>



<p>There, Kamome honestly tells Tsuyu about his current situation.</p>



<p>「Actually, I’m troubled. I don’t know what to give her. I mean, I’m completely at a loss.」</p>



<p>「Fuun… Even though you’re Kamome, you have become more mature.」</p>



<p>「What do you mean “Even though you’re Kamome”?」</p>



<p>「Well, any present from someone you love should make you happy, right? As long as it’s not garbage or a dead insect.」</p>



<p>In response to Kamome’s concerns, Tsuyu begins to talk while leaning her back against the clock tower.</p>



<p>…What could it be?</p>



<p>Somehow, it looks like she’s trying to give advice in her own way.</p>



<p>「On the contrary, imagine yourself in the position of receiving a gift from Himawari.」</p>



<p>「Me on the receiving end?」</p>



<p>Kamome imagines.</p>



<p>…Indeed, rather than what Himawari would give him, the act of her doing her best to think about Kamome and prepare something good with him in mind, would warm his heart and make him happy.</p>



<p>「The person giving the gift might think a lot about it, but the one receiving it doesn’t particularly dwell on it… Especially someone like Himawari. As her boyfriend, you should understand that, right?」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>「…What?」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu notices Kamome’s fixed stare at her.</p>



<p>「No, I just thought that you really do pay attention to Himawari.」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>「How can I say it? It feels like there’s still a wall between you two, and I had a strong feeling that Tsuyu hadn’t accepted Himawari, but… I think I need to change that perception.」</p>



<p>When Kamome says this in a serious tone, Tsuyu brushes him off saying, “I-It’s nothing, we’re family, so it’s normal”.</p>



<p>「So, back to the gift thing, have you really not decided on anything yet? Some stores will be closing soon, right?」</p>



<p>「That’s right. That’s why I’m in trouble…」</p>



<p>Kamome growls with a difficult expression on his face.</p>



<p>Tsuyu stares at such Kamome.</p>



<p>「…You know…」</p>



<p>After a while, Tsuyu quietly opened her mouth.</p>



<p>「If you want, I can at least give you some advice.」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>At Tsuyu’s words, Kamome widens his eyes.</p>



<p>「At least I can come up with a better idea than you… Well, I’ve caused you a lot of trouble until now, not that this is an apology for that…」</p>



<p>Tsuyu says so while averting his gaze diagonally downward.</p>



<p>「That would be helpful, but….」</p>



<p>Kamome was taken aback by the sudden offer.</p>



<p>However, it’s also true that he has no one else to consult.</p>



<p>A godsend ── not really, but if Tsuyu is willing to lend her wisdom, it’s quite reassuring.</p>



<p>「Then, sorry to bother you, but… could you please help me?」</p>



<p>「Yeah, I got it.」</p>



<p>Upon hearing Kamome’s response, Tsuyu lifts her back from the clock tower.</p>



<p>「Then, come on, let’s go. We don’t have much time, do we?」</p>



<p>「Go…? Ah, no, just the advice is fine. Aren’t you waiting for someone, right?」</p>



<p>「It’s fine, I think… they’re not coming anyway.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu says with a fed-up face.</p>



<p>Apparently, she really is going to accompany Kamome to choose the present.</p>



<p>「Really, are you sure?」</p>



<p>「You’re persistent. I told you I’m going.」</p>



<p>「…Thank you.」</p>



<p>At Kamome, who expresses his gratitude, Tsuyu sighs.</p>



<p>Then, afterward, she slightly loosened her mouth and smiled.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>And so, Kamome ended up going to choose a gift for Himawari together with Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「So, Kamome, what kind of gift do you think would be good?」</p>



<p>While walking side by side with Tsuyu in the city, they talk.</p>



<p>「Hmn…」</p>



<p>Kamome thinks.</p>



<p>Himawari likes manga and games.</p>



<p>Then…</p>



<p>「How about buying goods from a manga or anime specialty store? I know the works Himawari likes.」</p>



<p>「…Well, I don’t think she would dislike it, but wouldn’t it lack impact? It’s a birthday present after all, right?」</p>



<p>She’s absolutely right.</p>



<p>「Sorry… I could only come up with an elementary school level idea.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu sighs at Kamome’s dejection.</p>



<p>「Alright. Then, let’s change our approach… In your mind, Kamome, what do you imagine when you hear the situation of giving a present to a girl you like?」</p>



<p>「L-Let’s see…」</p>



<p>Kamome hesitated at the question.</p>


<p>Tsuyu urges Kamome, “Come on, there’s no point in being shy.”</p>



<p>「…I guess so.」</p>



<p>Kamome, at being told this, timidly expresses his inner thoughts.</p>



<p>If he were to give a gift to the girl he likes──</p>



<p>He shares his ideas based on his knowledge and imagination.</p>



<p>「…What do you think about that?」</p>



<p>「…I see. To be honest, I think it’s not a bad idea for Kamome.」</p>



<p>「Really?」</p>



<p>「Yeah, but if you want to add a little more surprise than just going with that…」</p>



<p>Tsuyu, who was inspired by Kamome’s idea, added her own idea to it and revised it upwards.</p>



<p>Once the discussion was over, they immediately searched on their phones for a nearby store in that field and headed for the store together.</p>



<p>And there, Kamome, who doesn’t really know what would be popular with women, selects products while receiving advice from Tsuyu──</p>



<p>The result.</p>



<p>「Good! This is perfect!」</p>



<p>With Tsuyu’s help, Kamome was able to successfully purchase the gift.</p>



<p>「Thank you, Tsuyu. I think I’ve prepared the best gift for Himawari.」</p>



<p>Kamome expresses his gratitude to Tsuyu from the bottom of his heart.</p>



<p>「But in the end, it was almost like Tsuyu chose most of it.」</p>



<p>「Not at all, Kamome was the one who actually chose the gift, I just gave advice, so it should be fine.」</p>



<p>The two of them are walking around town in a friendly manner.</p>



<p>Unexpectedly, the preparation of the gift was completed quickly and accurately.</p>



<p>(…Like, I should thank Tsuyu as well… I guess.)</p>



<p>Looking at Tsuyu walking next to him, Kamome suddenly thought so.</p>



<p>「… Ah.」</p>



<p>「? What’s wrong?」</p>



<p>There, Kamome stops.</p>



<p>Tsuyu, following his lead, also stops and follows Kamome’s gaze.</p>



<p>There was a game center.</p>



<p>It was the same game center that he had visited once before with Himawari.</p>



<p>「Come to think of it, we used to play at game centers when we were kids, didn’t we?」</p>



<p>「Yeah, I remember. But the one near our house wasn’t like this, was it? They were the kind where you could play games for 10 yen a time, and they were run by the same candy store.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>An expression of gratitude…</p>



<p>I don’t think this count as a thank you.</p>




<p>But, if I can share a fun time with Tsuyu ── that would be part of a thank you, Kamome thought subconsciously.</p>



<p>「…Let’s drop by for a bit.」</p>



<p>When Kamome said that, Tsuyu let out a surprised “Eh?”.</p>



<p>She looked as if she had been given an unexpected proposal.</p>



<p>「No, if you have time. I was wondering if you wanted to hang out for the first time in a while.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu looks surprised at Kamome’s invitation.</p>



<p>However, her expression quickly breaks into a smile.</p>



<p>「Kamome, you’ve never beaten me before. Are you sure?」</p>



<p>「I don’t want you to think I’m the same as I was back then.」</p>



<p>Whether Kamome’s provocative attitude was amusing or not, Tsuyu smiles as if she wasn’t entirely displeased.</p>



<p>The two of them entered the game center together.</p>



<p>It was an arcade filled with the latest game machines, built inside a building.</p>



<p>「Do you come to places like this with Himawari too?」</p>



<p>「Yeah, because Himawari likes games.」</p>



<p>Upon hearing this, Tsuyu muttered, “Fuun.”</p>



<p>「What about you, Tsuyu?」</p>



<p>「…I haven’t been coming here much lately.」</p>


<p>「I see. Ah, that.」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu spotted a zone filled with retro game machines.</p>



<p>「I remembered it when I came before. That it’s nostalgic because it’s full of games I used to play with Tsuyu.」</p>



<p>「…Is that so.」</p>



<p>When she was told that, Tsuyu let out a somewhat happy voice.</p>



<p>Kamome and Tsuyu decided to play a game in that area.</p>



<p>「Ah, this one, it was in the store near our neighborhood too, right?」</p>



<p>「Yeah, how nostalgic!」</p>



<p>As they played the game together, Kamome and Tsuyu reminisced about old stories.</p>



<p>School teachers and friends from their childhood, and the old man in the neighborhood.</p>



<p>Every time they talked, Tsuyu would say, “Ah, I remember that!” and laugh in a very enjoyable way.</p>



<p>She had a pure smile on her face, just like back then.</p>



<p>Seeing that smile, Kamome felt a sense of contentment.</p>



<p>And then, playing around in the game center, the two of them left the store.</p>



<p>「Thank you for today. For all the help and advice.」</p>



<p>「No problem…」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu gently folds her eyes and smiles.</p>



<p>「Thank you, on my part too. I felt like I laugh from the bottom of my stomach for the first time in a long time.」</p>



<p>Until today, Tsuyu, who had always had a somewhat menacing and closed-off expression, suddenly showed a calm expression.</p>



<p>At the sight of this lovely figure, Kamome’s heart beat wildly.</p>



<p>「You haven’t changed since then, Kamome.」</p>



<p>「Is that so?」</p>



<p>「Yeah. It’s been a while since we talked about the old days, and it made me remember. You see, when we were kids, there was a time when a big dog that belonged to a neighbor’s house escaped, right?」</p>



<p>「Umn… Yeah, I remember. That was when Tsuyu was awesome.」</p>



<p>A long time ago, a big dog that was kept as a guard dog in the neighborhood escaped.</p>



<p>It was a ferocious dog that would at full force even at children who approached it.</p>



<p>Tsuyu, who had the misfortune of encountering the dog, had acted as a decoy to let her friends who were with her escape.</p>



<p>「I had to run to get the dog’s attention, and I got chased around a lot.」</p>



<p>「Tsuyu was fast, too. But more than that, I thought it was amazing that you would go that far for your friends.」</p>



<p>「…To be honest, I was terrified.」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu turns to look at Kamome.</p>



<p>「At that time, Kamome came to my rescue, right? You jumped on the dog and got into a fight.」</p>



<p>「…Yeah, I did.」</p>



<p>To tell the truth, that part of the story is a memory that Kamome doesn’t really want to remember.</p>



<p>He was desperate to save Tsuyu.</p>



<p>He didn’t know what he could do, but he jumped at the dog, which was much bigger than him, to save her while crying.</p>



<p>「Kamome, you were covered in scratches and bite marks all over your body, it became a terrible situation, but eventually the dog pulled back and quieted down. Then the adults came and caught him easily.」</p>



<p>「Now that you mention it, I think that’s how it went…」</p>



<p>Tsuyu is staring at Kamome.</p>



<p>Just like when you’re looking at a dazzling light, she squinted her eyes.</p>



<p>「You haven’t changed since then.」</p>



<p>「…Umn, do you mean I’m still the same as when I was small and frail?」</p>



<p>「No, that’s not what I mean──」</p>



<p>「Oi.」</p>



<p>That’s when it happened.</p>



<p>Kamome, who suddenly called from behind, turned around to see who was.</p>



<p>At that moment, he was hit in the face by a tremendous shock, and sparks flew in front of his eyes.</p>



<p>He knew instinctively that he had been punched.</p>



<p>「Akito!」</p>



<p>「What the hell are you doing with my girl, asshole.」</p>



<p>Kamome, who had fallen onto the road, looks at the person standing in front of him.</p>


<p>He looks familiar.</p>



<p>He is tall, with dyed hair standing on end.</p>



<p>That’s right, he had seen him in town before.</p>



<p>The one who was arguing with Tsuyu…</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s boyfriend.</p>



<p>「H-Hey! What are you doing all of a sudden!?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu quickly stepped between Kamome and the man, trying to intervene.</p>



<p>「You too, what are you trying to do? You ditched our meeting and are having a good time with this guy.」</p>



<p>Hearing this, Kamome remembers.</p>



<p>Today, Tsuyu said she was meeting someone when she was in front of the clock tower.</p>



<p>In other words, she was originally supposed to meet him.</p>



<p>「Oi, you pick-up artist. You’re not getting off easy…」</p>



<p>A moment later, Kamome stands up.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry.」</p>



<p>And then he bowed his head and apologized to Tsuyu’s boyfriend.</p>



<p>「I’m not a suspicious person. I’m an acquaintance of Tsuyu-san ── I’m dating her younger sister.」</p>



<p>「Ahh? So what?」</p>

<p>「I’m sorry for taking Tsuyu-san around without permission. However, I swear that Tsuyu-san was just helping me with my shopping and nothing else happened.」</p>



<p>Kamome says firmly.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry if I caused any misunderstanding. But I don’t think it’s right to suddenly hit me before hearing the situation.」</p>



<p>「Haah?」</p>



<p>Letting out a low voice, the man threatens.</p>



<p>It’s a touch-and-go atmosphere.</p>



<p>But Kamome, on the other hand, doesn’t avert his gaze.</p>



<p>Without flinching, he stares straight back at him.</p>



<p>「Kamome…」</p>



<p>「…Tch.」</p>



<p>Seeing Kamome like this, Tsuyu is flustered.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Tsuyu’s boyfriend roughly grabs Tsuyu’s arm and starts to walk away.</p>



<p>「Let’s go, Tsuyu.」</p>



<p>You can tell that he is irritated by his large strides.</p>



<p>「Damn it, is that your strategy to get my attention by flirting with other guys like that?」</p>



<p>The man was heard saying so.</p>



<p>At that moment, the aura around Tsuyu changed.</p>


<p>She shook off his hand that was holding her wrist and immediately──</p>



<p>A flashy sound resounds.</p>



<p>Tsuyu slapped him in the face with all her might.</p>



<p>Reflexively, the man was taken aback.</p>



<p>「You were nearly an hour late for our meeting and that’s what you say!?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu shouts.</p>



<p>Forgetting that they were in the middle of the street, she got emotional and vented her anger.</p>



<p>「You didn’t reply to any of my messages! And when you finally showed up, you start hitting people and making selfish accusations! Kamome is right! Don’t make it sound like Kamome and I are at fault!」</p>



<p>After shouting, Tsuyu turns her back on the man, and starts to walk away quickly.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu! Wait, oi!」</p>



<p>The man chases after her.</p>



<p>There…</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Tsuyu took a brief glance at Kamome.</p>



<p>An apologetic gaze.</p>



<p>Her lips moved slightly, and she seemed to mutter, “Sorry…”</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu.」</p>


<p>The two were no longer in sight.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>It’s true that he had ignored their meeting and took Tsuyu around without permission.</p>



<p>Kamome felt that he had done something rude to both of them… But at the same time, he thought.</p>



<p>That there’s no doubt that the relationship between Tsuyu and him is not going well after all…</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so──</p>



<p>「Come in, come in.」</p>



<p>「Okay, thank you for having me.」</p>



<p>After school, Kamome was invited to Himawari’s room.</p>



<p>Today is the long-awaited day of Himawari’s birthday.</p>



<p>A birthday party for just the two of them at Himawari’s house.</p>



<p>「Ehehe… I might have been grinning all day, looking forward to after school…」</p>



<p>Himawari was unusually excited.</p>



<p>Her excitement was clear to see.</p>



<p>They placed the cake and juice they had bought on the way here on the table.</p>



<p>「Let’s play a game.」</p>



<p>Himawari suddenly suggests.</p>



<p>She then brings a game console from the corner of the room.</p>



<p>「…Hmm? Huh? This is…」</p>



<p>Kamome was surprised to see the game console.</p>

<p>Because it was the famous game console that Himawari had mentioned earlier, which was now so popular that it was hard to get.</p>



<p>「You see, there was a resale lottery online the other day. I wanted to make sure I got it, so I stayed up until midnight when the lottery started and reserved it right away.」</p>



<p>Himawari talks excitedly.</p>



<p>He was so excited that he won the lottery.</p>



<p>And she said she had won the lottery she had been hoping for.</p>



<p>「I thought it would be nice to play with Kamome today, so… Maybe my enthusiasm got through.」</p>



<p>Seeing Himawari smiling so happily, “She’s so cute…”, Kamome thought for the umpteenth time.</p>



<p>So, in accordance with Himawari’s wish, they decided to play games together right away.</p>



<p>Racing and party games.</p>



<p>They enjoyed the latest games and had a lot of fun together.</p>



<p>And after playing for a while, they decided it was time to eat cake.</p>



<p>It was a cake they had ordered from a popular restaurant in advance.</p>



<p>「Umm, delicious.」</p>



<p>Himawari happily munched on the shortcake.</p>



<p>Seeing her, Kamome opened his bag, thinking, “It’s about time…”</p>



<p>「Himawari, can I have a moment?」</p>



<p>Kamome takes out a beautifully wrapped bag from his bag and hands it to Himawari.</p>

<p>「Although you might have guessed already, this is your birthday present.」</p>



<p>「Woow…」</p>



<p>Himawari sighs happily with her hands over her mouth.</p>



<p>「Thank you. Umn… Can I open it?」</p>



<p>Himawari asks, holding the bag she had received.</p>



<p>「Yes, go ahead.」</p>



<p>Himawari undoes the ribbon tying the mouth of the bag.</p>



<p>「I’m nervous…」</p>



<p>Kamome feels the same way.</p>



<p>Himawari opens the bag.</p>



<p>What came out from inside was…</p>



<p>「Wow! So cute!」</p>



<p>A teddy bear.</p>



<p>It was a very fluffy one, and big enough to fit in her arms.</p>



<p>Holding it up, Himawari’s eyes sparkled.</p>



<p>「But why a teddy bear?」</p>



<p>「Ah, well, because I thought it was the cutest thing I saw in the store. Ah, you don’t like bears?」</p>

<p>「No, I’m not afraid of bears.」</p>



<p>Seeing Kamome flustered, Himawari laughs amusingly.</p>



<p>「…You gave me the one you thought was the cutest, Kamome-kun, I’m happy.」</p>



<p>Himawari mumbles and looking really happy she smiles broadly.</p>


<div><img src="https://sinkuredtranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/knav1ilus6.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div><p></p>


<p>「…Huh?」</p>



<p>There, Himawari, who was lovingly holding up the teddy bear, let out a voice as if she had noticed something.</p>



<p>The teddy bear Kamome had given her was in a strange pose, with its arms behind its back as if it was hiding something.</p>



<p>Himawari turns the teddy bear around which is in an unusual pose with a curious look on her face.</p>



<p>Then she notices that the teddy bear is hiding something in its hands behind its back.</p>



<p>With both hands, it was holding a small box as if it was very important.</p>



<p>「……Ah.」</p>



<p>Himawari then looks at Kamome.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Kamome is looking away with a bright red face.</p>



<p>Himawari, sensing something from his expression, nervously took the small box from the bear’s hand with her heart pounding.</p>



<p>When she opened the small box, which was tied with a ribbon and decorated──</p>



<p>What appeared inside was an accessory.</p>

<p>A ring in the shape of a heart with a jewel embedded in the center.</p>



<p>The ring was threaded through a chain, making it a necklace.</p>



<p>「…Ah, it’s a surprise! I heard girls like surprises!」</p>



<p>Kamome hastily made an excuse to Himawari, who was at a loss for words looking at the necklace.</p>



<p>He should have just silently watched her reaction, but he couldn’t stand the silence.</p>



<p>He has a long way to go.</p>



<p>──But.</p>



<p>「…W-What do you think? Do you like it?」</p>



<p>When Kamome asked her nervously, Himawari looked elated in a different way from when she saw the teddy bear.</p>



<p>Her cheeks were flushed, her eyebrows were lowered, and her eyes narrowed as if she was deeply moved.</p>



<p>She was showing an expression that seemed truly thrilled from the bottom of her heart.</p>



<p>「…Kamome-kun, can I try it on?」</p>



<p>When asked, Kamome nodded vigorously.</p>



<p>Himawari puts the necklace around her neck and shows it to Kamome.</p>



<p>「How is it? Does it suit me?」</p>



<p>「Yeah, it suits you very well.」</p>



<p>Saying this, Himawari gave Kamome a smile from the bottom of her heart.</p>

<p>「Ehehe… Thank you, Kamome-kun. I’ll treasure it very much.」</p>



<p>…Ah.</p>



<p>This smile, these words.</p>



<p>The way Himawari is now, it was everything.</p>



<p>Worrying.</p>



<p>Working hard.</p>



<p>He felt like everything he has worked on up until today has paid off.</p>



<p>I’m really glad, he truly thought so.</p>



<p>「Phew, I was so nervous…」</p>



<p>Kamome lets out a big sigh of relief.</p>



<p>First, he eased her feelings with the teddy bear, and then he captured her heart with the serious gift of jewelry.</p>



<p>Especially when a serious and somewhat dull guy like Kamome does something like this, the gap makes it even better.</p>



<p>It went just as Tsuyu’s suggestion.</p>



<p>「Ehehe, I’m kind of happy that you thought about it so seriously.」</p>



<p>「Yeah, I’m glad. It was worth getting advice from Tsuyu.」</p>



<p>Perhaps because the tension had eased, Kamome mentioned Tsuyu’s name there.</p>



<p>「…Eh?」</p>

<p>Tsuyu’s name came out of Kamome’s mouth.</p>



<p>In reaction to that, Himawari’s expression stiffens.</p>



<p>「Did you… consulted with Tsuyu?」</p>



<p>「Yeah, I couldn’t decide what to get Himawari until the last minute, and I was wondering what to do when I happened to run into Tsuyu on the street. It was my first time giving a present to a girl, so she gave me some advice……」</p>



<p>Saying that much, Kamome stops talking abruptly.</p>



<p>Damn it ── He let his guard down and said something he didn’t need to.</p>



<p>Tsuyu had also told him, “It would be best to keep it a secret that you received advice from me.”</p>



<p>「So… you met with Tsuyu again…」</p>



<p>Hearing what he said, Himawari muttered quietly.</p>



<p>And then, she clenches her lips tightly.</p>



<p>「…Umn …Kamome-kun.」</p>



<p>There, Himawari, who had been looking down, slowly opened her mouth.</p>



<p><br /></p>



<p>「Kamome-kun… There’s really nothing going on between you and Tsuyu, right?」</p>



<p><br /></p>



<p>The atmosphere changed.</p>



<p>The warm, soft air that had filled the room felt instantly tense and heavy like iron.</p>


<p>「Ever since Kamome-kun first came to this house… I always, I’ve always had this nagging feeling that just won’t go away. I’ve asked Kamome-kun over and over again, “There’s nothing going on, right?” and tried to convince myself over and over again, but… But now, I’m going to ask you directly.」</p>



<p>「H-Himawari?」</p>



<p>「Could it be… that time too, in Tsuyu’s room… did you two kissed?」</p>



<p>「Eh…」</p>



<p>Asked, he’s in turmoil.</p>



<p>He has been lying until today, saying that nothing happened at that time.</p>



<p>He has been avoiding talking about it, trying not to bring it up.</p>



<p>But now he is again being questioned about it straightly.</p>



<p>I’m not convinced, she says.</p>



<p>Kamome’s heart throbs loudly.</p>



<p>「No, that’s not…」</p>



<p>In a panic, Kamome covers it up.</p>



<p>While conscious of not to show his impatience.</p>



<p>He puts his hand around the numbness running down his neck, as if to suppress it.</p>



<p>「…Again.」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>「Kamome-kun… whenever we talk about this, you always put your hand behind your neck.」</p>


<p>Kamome’s heart jumped as if it was about to burst.</p>



<p>「That’s… a habit that you, Kamome-kun, have when you lie, I think.」</p>



<p>Zokuri ── his spine trembled.</p>



<p>What kind of emotion is this?</p>



<p>Fear?</p>



<p>Once again, Kamome realizes the fact that he has lied to the person he loves.</p>



<p>And that his well-meaning actions had caused her to distrust him.</p>



<p>The Himawari of now is looking at Kamome with eyes that seem to see something unbelievable.</p>



<p>──I can’t make excuses anymore.</p>



<p>──And I feel like I shouldn’t.</p>



<p>「…Yes, we kissed.」</p>



<p>「K-Kamome-kun…」</p>



<p>Kamome confesses, bowing his head deeply.</p>



<p>Not just his head, but he also puts his hands on the floor and bows down in a full prostration.</p>



<p>「But it wasn’t me who initiated it, she did it out of the blue. I just want you to believe that.」</p>



<p>「U-Uh, okay. I understand… now, lift your head.」</p>



<p>Seeing Kamome like this, Himawari seems to have come to her senses.</p>



<p>She hurriedly puts her hand on Kamome’s shoulder to show that she is not angry.</p>



<p>「…I’m sorry, Himawari. When I first came to this house, I thought that if I told you honestly what Tsuyu had done to me, it would shock you, so I kept quiet… And on the day of our date at the amusement park, when I told you honestly that Tsuyu had kissed me, you looked so sad… That’s why I felt even more that I couldn’t bring up the first incident…」</p>



<p>And so, lie piled upon lie.</p>



<p>I’m really sorry ── Kamome bows his head deeply.</p>



<p>「…No, thank you, for being honest with me.」</p>



<p>In response, Himawari shakes her head, her eyes moistening.</p>



<p>「I’ve always had that stuck in my mind… but, if that were true, I thought that maybe Kamome-kun, being the kind person you are… was trying to bear it alone in silence. So, it’s okay, it’s not that much of a shock.」</p>



<p>「Himawari…」</p>



<p>「But if something like that happens, I want you to tell me honestly. Because I’m your girlfriend.」</p>



<p>Himawari murmurs, her eyes downcast.</p>



<p>Seeing her like that, Kamome feels guilty.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry, Kamome-kun, even though it’s a day like this.」</p>



<p>「No…」</p>



<p>The tense, needle-in-a-haystack atmosphere is gone.</p>



<p>But the heavy air that accompanies the confession of sin still lingers in the room.</p>



<p>I want to do something about it.</p>



<p>I want to go back to how it was just a few minutes ago…</p>


<p>Why did I end up mentioning Tsuyu’s name…</p>



<p>As Kamome thinks this, there.</p>



<p>「…Kamome, if it’s okay with you, I have a favor to ask.」</p>



<p>Hesitantly, putting her hand between her thighs, Himawari said.</p>



<p>「A favor?」</p>



<p>「I-I’m sorry, I’ve already received a present, and it’s shameless of me to ask for more… especially at a time like this.」</p>



<p>Himawari says apologetically, but Kamome has no reason to refuse.</p>



<p>In fact, he feels like he wants to grant her wish as much as possible because of his guilt.</p>



<p>「No, it’s okay. Is there something you want?」</p>



<p>「……I want you to kiss me.」</p>



<p>Himawari said, looking into Kamome’s eyes.</p>



<p>「Eh…」</p>



<p>「I want you to kiss me. On our last date and before that, the first time you met her… Kamome-kun, you’ve already kissed Tsuyu twice, didn’t you?」</p>



<p>「…Y-Yeah.」</p>



<p>「…But I haven’t kissed Kamome-kun yet.」</p>



<p>With tearful eyes, eyes that beg, Himawari looks up at Kamome.</p>



<p>「So, I want you to kiss me too… If possible… a kiss that’s more memorable than the one you had with Tsuyu.」</p>

<p>Kamome gasps in front of Himawari, who pleads seductive eyes.</p>



<p>Is the first time he’s seen her face like this.</p>



<p>A lascivious, immoral face.</p>



<p>「…Okay.」</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>「Then, here I go.」</p>



<p>「Okay…」</p>



<p>In the center of the room, Kamome and Himawari are standing facing each other.</p>



<p>As for Kamome, it’s like recreating that day.</p>



<p>Then, remembering what Tsuyu did to him, he kisses Himawari.</p>



<p>She hopes for a kiss that is more memorable than the one he had with Tsuyu… If he were to try to make such a kiss… Inevitably, it will turn out that way.</p>



<p>He’s overwriting it.</p>



<p>…Yes, this is surely, atonement.</p>



<p>With that meaning included, it’s also Himawari’s wish.</p>



<p>「Fuua…」</p>



<p>From the gap between their overlapping lips, Himawari’s voice leaks out.</p>



<p>That voice hits her earlobe, turning on a switch inside Kamome.</p>



<p>He tickles her palate with the tip of his tongue and kisses her as if sucking on her lips.</p>



<p>A thrilling numbness runs down his spine.</p>



<p>This is bad… I can’t stop.</p>


<p>Against all reason, his body doesn’t listen to him.</p>



<p>As if the care and kindness he showed the other day when they held each other’s hands on their date were a lie, Kamome throws his desires at Himawari.</p>



<p>Kamome’s tongue ravages every corner of Himawari’s mouth.</p>



<p>As if to savor the sweetness and softness of her mouth, he licks her inner cheeks and handles her tongue with his.</p>



<p>While he kisses her, Kamome strokes Himawari’s head and back.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Himawari’s mind goes blank at this act, which is being done to her for the first time in her life.</p>



<p>It’s her first time being caressed all over like this, not just kissed.</p>



<p>A plea that came out of jealousy.</p>



<p>Even though it should be like that, she feels so warm that she is about to cry.</p>



<p>Himawari also touches Kamome’s body.</p>



<p>It’s hard.</p>



<p>A man’s body is this hard, she’s surprised at the difference between a man’s and a woman’s body.</p>



<p>A time to understand each other.</p>



<p>Even deeper than before.</p>



<p>Such a long, long time passes──</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>In the midst of this, suddenly──</p>



<p>What flashed through Kamome’s mind was Tsuyu’s face.</p>



<p>He imitated the kiss Tsuyu gave him, and kissed Himawari while remembering what had happened at that time ── perhaps that’s why he remembered it.</p>



<p>But the Tsuyu that came to Kamome’s mind at that moment wasn’t the one who had the provocative expression on her face when she half-jokingly came onto him.</p>



<p>It was the one who showed an innocent expression when they spent their time together at the game center.</p>



<p>Even though the years have passed and her appearance has changed, that smile, that smile like the sun, is reminiscent of the Tsuyu of those days.</p>



<p>Even now, that core part of Tsuyu hasn’t changed.</p>



<p>That part, suddenly, passed through his mind.</p>



<p>(…What am I thinking?)</p>



<p>Immediately, Kamome scolds himself.</p>



<p>It’s not a good thing to think about at this moment.</p>



<p>He shakes it out of his head and focuses his attention only on Himawari, who is right in front of him──</p>



<p>After enjoying the kiss thoroughly, Kamome and Himawari part their lips.</p>



<p>「Ah…」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>The two of them stare at each other, face to face.</p>



<p>Both of them are blushing and can’t find any words to say to each other.</p>



<p>But, with his palpitations still not calmed down, he starts to think that if possible… he wants to move a step ahead.</p>



<p>Does Himawari feel the same way?</p>



<p>「…Himawari.」</p>



<p>He, as a man, should make the decision here.</p>



<p>Kamome calls her name.</p>



<p>When called, Himawari shakes her shoulders.</p>



<p>「…I──」</p>



<p>「I’m home.」</p>



<p>There, with the sound of the first-floor front door opening, someone’s voice announcing their return home was heard.</p>



<p>At that voice, both Kamome and Himawari were brought back to reality at once.</p>



<p>「It’s… It’s my Dad!」</p>



<p>It seems that Tsuyu’s father has returned home.</p>



<p>「Come to think of it, he said he would be home early because today is my birthday…」</p>



<p>Himawari is somewhat dejected.</p>



<p>Seeing her like that, Kamome chuckles.</p>



<p> (Somehow, I feel a little relieved.)</p>



<p>He made up his mind for a moment, but he wasn’t ready yet.</p>



<p>Even so, he understood that Himawari felt the same way as him, that she was just as excited.</p>



<p>Just knowing that feeling makes him happy.</p>



<p>「For now, I guess I should greet your father.」</p>



<p>With that, Kamome and Himawari left the room.</p>



<p>When they came downstairs to the first floor, they met Himawari’s father in the living room.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry for the intrusion.」</p>



<p>Himawari’s father, perhaps surprised at the sight of the boy who appeared with his daughter, stopped untying his tie.</p>



<p>「My name is Ooshima Kamome, and I’m dating Himawari. Nice to meet you.」</p>



<p>In response to Kamome’s polite greeting, Himawari’s father narrows his eyes suspiciously, saying, “Hou…”</p>



<p>He was a serious-looking, bespectacled, office-worker-looking man.</p>



<p>(…This man is… Himawari’s father)</p>



<p>Although he remarried, he was the parent who won custody of Himawari when he got divorced.</p>



<p>In other words, he’s Himawari’s biological father, with whom she shares a blood bond.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Himawari’s father narrows his eyes behind his glasses and looks at Kamome as if sizing him up.</p>



<p>「…So, you’re Himawari’s boyfriend, huh…? I’ve heard about you from Himawari.」</p>



<p>「I’m glad you remember me.」</p>



<p>「When you just entered high school, you saved my daughter from a purse-snatcher, right?」</p>



<p>「Ah, yes.」</p>



<p>So that’s what he told her.</p>



<p>Looking at Himawari next to him, she seems a little embarrassed.</p>



<p>「I thank you sincerely for that. Thank you for saving my daughter.」</p>



<p>「Yes, I’m honored.」</p>



<p>「But as you may understand, you’re still students. Even if you’re dating, keep in mind to maintain a moderate relationship.」</p>



<p>「Y-Yes.」</p>



<p>「…By the way, today is Himawari’s birthday. I guess you were celebrating together.」</p>



<p>Himawari’s father says in a low tone, pushing up the bridge of his glasses.</p>



<p>「You didn’t do anything strange, right?」</p>



<p>「Eh!?」</p>



<p>Kamome is shocked by Himawari’s father’s question.</p>



<p>Strange things… he says that, Kamome but can’t help but remember the scene from earlier.</p>



<p>「That’s, um, well…」</p>



<p>「Stop it already! Don’t say strange things, Dad!」</p>



<p>There, Himawari shouts in place of Kamome, who is at a loss for words.</p>



<p>Kamome is an honest person, so if he is questioned in this way, he might speak out.</p>



<p>It seems that Himawari anticipated this and covered for him.</p>


<p>「W-What, Himawari. I also think that Kamome is a trustworthy guy. But I’m worried…」</p>



<p>「Dad is overprotective! Look, it’s time for Kamome to go home, I’m going to send him off!」</p>



<p>So, although it is half-forced.</p>



<p>Due to circumstances, Kamome had to go home.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry, my dad said strange things…」</p>



<p>「No, he’s a good father. I’m sure he cares a lot about Himawari.」</p>



<p>At the entrance.</p>



<p>In Kamome’s eyes, Himawari’s father was reflected standing in the shadows of the living room entrance, staring at him.</p>



<p>When Himawari notices this and turns around to shout, “Dad!” he quickly retreats.</p>



<p>「I’m really sorry… I’d be happy if you don’t hate my dad…」</p>



<p>To Himawari, who says this in a depressed manner, Kamome brightly replies, “Not at all, it’s okay.”</p>



<p>Perhaps Himawari’s father feels guilty about the burden his divorce has placed on Himawari.</p>



<p>That’s why he must feel that he has to take good care of her.</p>



<p>Because he understands this, Kamome doesn’t have any thoughts of disliking him.</p>



<p>So.</p>



<p>「Bye bye.」</p>



<p>They part at the entrance, and Kamome heads home.</p>


<p>At any rate, he thinks he was able to make her first birthday party a good memory.</p>



<p>She seemed to like the present too.</p>



<p>「…I wonder if he forgave me.」</p>



<p>The confession of having lied.</p>



<p>In the end, the tense atmosphere disappeared.</p>



<p>All turned out alright, and it seems that he was able to solve one of the problems he had been carrying on.</p>



<p>「…But it was unexpected.」</p>



<p>There, Kamome remembers the kiss.</p>



<p>…I can’t believe Himawari would say something like that.</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>──The next day.</p>



<p>「Haa…」</p>



<p>Himawari was walking on her way to high school.</p>



<p>Her expression was a bit downcast.</p>



<p>Yesterday’s birthday party with Kamome.</p>



<p>It was a good mood, but it became weird when his father came home at the end.</p>



<p>After that, she sent a message to Kamome to apologize again, but…</p>


<p>「Kamome-kun… I hope you don’t care about what my dad said.」</p>



<p>──You didn’t do anything strange, right?</p>



<p>(…What if Kamome really cares about it, and won’t do anything with me… What am I thinking!?)</p>



<p>「Yossu, Himawari. Good morning.」</p>



<p>There, her friend Tachibana Risa, who happened to be passing by, came to talk to her.</p>



<p>「Ah, Risa-chan. Good morning.」</p>



<p>「……Huh?」</p>



<p>Risa stares fixedly at Himawari’s face</p>



<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>



<p>「Himawari… Did you kiss?」</p>



<p>「Fue!?」</p>



<p>Himawari raises a surprised voice when Risa suddenly sees through her.</p>



<p>「Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-why!?」</p>



<p>「Because, your lips are puffy.」</p>



<p>Risa says, pointing to her own lips.</p>



<p>「The partner is Kamome-kun? Heeh… Despite his looks, he seems to have done quite a passionate one.」</p>



<p>As she says this, Risa also blushes in embarrassment.</p>


<p>「What, bragging from the morning? Stop it, Himawari~. It’s your lovey-dovey appeal.」</p>



<p>「E-Excuse me for a moment!」</p>



<p>Himawari starts running as if to run away from the teasing Risa.</p>



<p>As soon as she arrives at the school in a hurry, she immediately rushes to the bathroom.</p>



<p>And when she checks in the mirror, sure enough, as Risa said, her lips are slightly red and swollen.</p>



<p>This is certainly… because of that kiss.</p>



<p>「W-When you kiss, it becomes like this…」</p>



<p>Indeed, it wasn’t a normal kiss, but a kiss that nibbled and devoured her lips…</p>



<p>Remembering the kiss with Kamome yesterday, she feels embarrassed and quickly takes out a mask to hide it.</p>



<p>All this time without realizing it, she had been exposing these lips while commuting to school, on the train, and on the way from the station.</p>



<p>And maybe those who could tell like Risa, have been able to discern it.</p>



<p>Her face gets hot.</p>



<p>She’s embarrassed.</p>



<p>Why did she make such a request yesterday?</p>



<p>Because she was jealous of Tsuyu.</p>



<p>It’s true that seeing Kamome, who had been silent about the truth from her and seemed to feel a deep sense of guilt about it, she had an ill-conceived notion that he might accept her desires now.</p>



<p>At that time, she was a little strange.</p>


<p>(…But.)</p>



<p>The warmth she felt at that time.</p>



<p>She remembers the kisses, the temperature of Kamome’s body, and the many sensations his hands conveyed to her.</p>



<p>Kamome’s gentle gaze and his passionate desire for Himawari made her heart flutter.</p>



<p>「…I want to do it again.」</p>



<p>Under her mask, Himawari muttered quietly.</p>
