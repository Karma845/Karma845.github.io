<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>The next day…</p>
<p>Classes began at the magic academy.</p>
<p>But the magic they taught in these classes was boring to me.</p>
<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<p><em>‘First of all… let&#8217;s memorize the “Ice Ball” spell chant.’</em></p>
<p><em>and so on.</em></p>
<p>Since chanting magic is the standard in this world, I cannot help but feel that this class is inefficient.</p>
<p>Everyone was staring frantically at the blackboard and eagerly taking notes.</p>
<p>“I feel sleepy.”</p>
<p>I was seated at the very back of the class by the window, so my eyelids were heavy with the warmth of the sunlight shining on me.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I had fallen asleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>And so, in the last class before noon.</p>
<p>The &lt;First&gt; class was gathered on the school grounds for the ‘practical skill’ lesson.</p>
<p>“Ohh..! Finally, an interesting class!”</p>
<p>“Kurt, you seem very enthusiastic.”</p>
<p>said Lara.</p>
<p>Of course. That was a given</p>
<p>I do not dislike studying magic, but I still prefer to move my body and defeat monsters and such.</p>
<p>“What kind of class is this?”</p>
<p>asked Marise with a little hint of excitement.</p>
<p>A few moments later ── an unexpected person appeared, and everyone was surprised.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! Are you guys doing any muscle training?”</p>
<p>‘‘‘D-Desmond-san!?’’’</p>
<p>All the students shouted in surprise.</p>
<p>The person who appeared on the school grounds was the old man I had fought in the entrance examination ── the former S-rank adventurer, Desmond.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?”</p>
<p>Marise stepped forward and asked Desmond.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve been assigned to this school as a teacher this year. I&#8217;ll be mainly in charge of practical classes. Don’t worry! I&#8217;m going to be gentle.”</p>
<p>Desmond put his hands on his waist and laughed heartily.</p>
<p>I see…</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, at the entrance exam, the examiner said something like, <em>“You’re only here to observe, right?”</em>.</p>
<p>I did not realize this was what he meant.</p>
<p>“D-Desmond-san&#8217;s class… I never thought I&#8217;d be taught by a legendary adventurer!”</p>
<p>“Idiot! He was also called Desmond the Demon, you know? I wonder what kind of tough lessons await us…”</p>
<p>“But… Desmond-san can&#8217;t use magic, right?”</p>
<p>I heard words of anticipation and anxiety from those around me.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m looking forward to it.”</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, I still muttered it honestly.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I can&#8217;t use magic.”</p>
<p>said Desmond, sharpening his eyes.</p>
<p>“But a mage can&#8217;t just use only magic, don’t you think so? You need physical strength, too. So I&#8217;m going to teach… mainly basic physical strength training and martial arts!”</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>That’s true.</p>
<p>No matter how good you are at magic, you will also need basic footwork on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Even with enough magic power, when you get too physically tired, it will all be over.</p>
<p>“Alright! Let’s work on endurance first. Do fifty laps around the school grounds!”</p>
<p>“F-Fifty laps!? That&#8217;s absurd!”</p>
<p>Cries were let loose from the surroundings.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t complain before you do it! By the way, there will be a penalty game for those who fail to run fifty laps within the one hour during this class. Everyone, get a grip!”</p>
<p>“Penalty game&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“Lunch break. It&#8217;s a fun penalty game where you just run until the next class.”</p>
<p>“D-Demon!”</p>
<p>Fifty laps, huh?</p>
<p>Sounds good for warming up.</p>
<p>“Well then… start!”</p>

<p>Let us just talk about the results.</p>
<p>There was only one person who could complete the fifty laps within the class time.</p>
<p>It goes without saying ── that was me.</p>
<p>“T-This is tough…”</p>
<p>“Why is Kurt the only one who looks… haa… haa… okay?”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise were sitting on the ground, gasping for air.</p>
<p>“If you’re tired just from this, you won&#8217;t be able to conquer a labyrinth in a day.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s just… your common sense… haa… haa…”</p>
<p>Marise remarked as her shoulders moved up and down in pain.</p>
<p>That being said… I was not using any body strengthening in this marathon.</p>
<p>If I did that, I could have completed fifty laps in an instant, but that would defeat the main purpose of training physical endurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You were… as I recall, the monstrous boy I fought in the entrance exam, weren&#8217;t you?”</p>
<p>“You remembered me?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Desmond looked surprised.</p>
<p>“To be honest… I didn&#8217;t think anyone could complete the fifty laps. You… are also a monster in terms of physical strength?”</p>
<p>Even before coming to the magic academy, I had adopted marathons as part of my daily workout routine.</p>
<p>Even that still did not allow me to reach my peak from a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>“Can I ask you one question?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Now that I have done my warm-up, what should I do now?”</p>
<p><strong><em>KAN ── KAN ──.</em></strong></p>
<p>Just as I asked the question, I heard the bell ring, signaling the end of class.</p>
<p>“That’s too bad. The class is over.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I shudder to think that you would say it&#8217;s just a warm-up after all this&#8230;”</p>
<p>said Desmond in astonishment.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The following day, the practical class was to be held again.</p>
<p>“All right! Let’s try throwing a steel ball today!”</p>
<p>Desmond stood in front of everyone and said boldly.</p>
<p>“““Steel ball?”””</p>
<p>Hearing Desmond&#8217;s words, everyone tilted their heads and voiced out at the same time.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t you know how to throw a steel ball…? Guess it can&#8217;t be helped. Since it&#8217;s rather uncommon. Wait a minute.”</p>
<p>Desmond held up a black round ball in his right hand.</p>
<p>“Hey you, the boy over there. Try holding it.”</p>
<p>“Yes… Wha- It&#8217;s heavy!”</p>
<p>“Of course! It&#8217;s a steel ball, after all.”</p>
<p>It does not look that heavy to me.</p>
<p>I see. So throwing that steel ball is what this class is about.</p>
<p>Sounds interesting.</p>
<p>In my previous life, there was a popular competition called ‘Dragon Throwing’, in which you held a dragon&#8217;s tail and threw it.</p>
<p>“Why would that be of any use to a mage?”</p>
<p>There came such a question from among the students.</p>
<p>“Mmm… I told you that a mage needs physical strength too, didn’t I? Since the headmaster agreed with my idea, I have decided to become a teacher here. Train your body first before learning magic! Magic is important, but so is physical strength! If you neglect your physical strength, your body won’t be able to react in time to danger!”</p>
<p>I agree with Desmond.</p>
<p>Magic is important for a mage, but so is physical strength, especially on the battlefield.</p>
<p>But at the same time&#8230; I could not resist the urge to cut in.</p>
<p>“Um, can I have a word?”</p>
<p>I raised my hand.</p>
<p>“Kurt. What is it?”</p>
<p>“I have been listening to what you said… but why is it necessary to separate magic from physical strength?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Desmond looked dubious.</p>
<p>“Of course, I understand what sensei was saying. But… magic and physical strength ── it should be the ideal to combine them.”</p>
<p>Well, I understand the whole deal with trying to throw without magic first to work on the fundamentals.</p>
<p>However, Desmond seems to think that magic and physical strength should be separated.</p>
<p>That made me feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Desmond turned and leaned forward curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combining magic and physical strength? Is that even feasible?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it&#8217;s possible.”</p>
<p>As I was about to demonstrate it,</p>
<p>“Hey, hey! Don&#8217;t get carried away with your defective magic power! That’s just not possible!”</p>
<p>My classmates heckled me.</p>
<p>Well, well.</p>
<p>It seems like even here at the Magic Academy there are people like Cyril who despise defective magic power.</p>
<p>“It’s possible for me.”</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re so confident, why don&#8217;t we have a little contest? I didn&#8217;t like you because you&#8217;ve been acting all pompous for a while now!”</p>
<p>A male student comes at me belligerently.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s some vigor there.</p>
<p>Did he not see my fight in the entrance exam?</p>
<p>“There’s nothing better.”</p>
<p>“Oh? You said it.”</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s mouth formed into a grin.</p>
<p>As if he has a chance to win.</p>
<p>If not, he would not have challenged me to a fight.</p>
<p>“Then, sensei. Please lend me the steel ball.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>I received the steel ball from Desmond.</p>
<p>Hmm… The ball looked kind of heavy, but it was much lighter than I expected.</p>
<p>In that case, I might misadjust the force and send it somewhere far away.</p>
<p>Now, this is troubling.</p>
<p>“Let’s see…”</p>
<p>I look back, making eye contact with Lara and Marise.</p>
<p>“Lara, Marise. Can you two give it a try first?”</p>
<p>“Eh? Me?”</p>
<p>“I&#8230; don&#8217;t have confidence in my physical strength.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be fine. I&#8217;m going to teach you the body strengthening magic now ──”</p>
<p>I whisper to Lara and Marise.</p>
<p>“Oi-oi! If it ain&#8217;t you, it wouldn&#8217;t mean a thing!”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Stop with your chirping. I&#8217;ll do it later. Or are you afraid that you might lose to two girls?</p>
<p>“D-Don’t you make fun of me!”</p>
<p>The boy’s face turns red with anger.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t you regret it&#8230; I&#8217;ll go first then!”</p>
<p>The boy immediately takes the steel ball in his right hand and sets it on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“UOOOOOHHHHHH!”</p>
<p>The steel ball was then launched.</p>
<p>“How was it?”</p>
<p>“Mmm… ten meters. That’s pretty good.”</p>
<p>The boy rubbed his nose in satisfaction as Desmond told him after measuring it with a measuring device.</p>
<p>“By any chance, did you know about this game beforehand? You throw it differently from amateurs.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe. I wonder about that.”</p>
<p>The boy answered in a good mood to Desmond’s question.</p>
<p>He did not affirm it, but by the looks of it, Desmond was probably right.</p>
<p>That was why he was so confident.</p>
<p>He may know how to throw it, but still ── he just threw it with all his strength. He would not be a match for Lara and Marise.</p>
<p>“Then… I’m next.”</p>
<p>This time, Lara holds the steel ball.</p>
<p>With her thin arms, the steel ball especially looks heavy. Ah… No wonder.</p>
<p>“Lara. Magic. Use your magic.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes! I forgot!”</p>
<p>Lara forms a magic formula to activate the body strengthening magic, Rise Power.</p>
<p>“Take that!”</p>
<p>She then threw the steel ball.</p>
<p>“Wow! What just happened?”</p>
<p>The boy from earlier exclaimed surprised.</p>
<p>Lara&#8217;s steel ball had clearly reached twice as far as the boy&#8217;s.</p>
<p>“2-20 meters…! You are quite the monster!”</p>
<p>“I did it! It’s all thanks to Kurt for teaching me!”</p>
<p>Lara was jumping up and down with joy. She is so cute.</p>
<p>“Then I’m next.”</p>
<p>Marise stepped forward.</p>
<p>She seems to have activated Rise Power from the start.</p>
<p>Oh…? Her magic formula formation is quite good on her first try.</p>
<p>“Here we go!”</p>
<p>With a similar cry, Marise released the steel ball.</p>
<p>The steel ball arced and fell to the ground as if it were an ordinary ball.</p>
<p>“&#8230;2-25 meters!? That&#8217;s ridiculous. You have surpassed my best record!”</p>
<p>The commotion of those around us grew louder at Marise&#8217;s record.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>said Marise, who had a calm face, but her cheeks were a shade of light pink.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“T-That&#8217;s ridiculous…”</p>
<p>The boy was startled and shaking nervously.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Thanks to Lara and Marise, I think I have got the hang of it.</p>
<p>It is my turn next.</p>
<p>“B-But you won’t defeat me with your defective magic power! You can just run away if you’re scared, you know?”</p>
<p>“No way.”</p>
<p>I ignored the boy and held the steel ball in my left hand.</p>
<p>…Yeah.</p>
<p>I will keep the use of body strengthening magic to a minimum.</p>
<p>There is no need to get serious here.</p>
<p>“Then, sensei. I&#8217;ll throw it, okay?”</p>
<p>“Anytime you are ready.”</p>
<p>Alright, let me do it right away.</p>
<p>“Here I go!”</p>
<p>I threw the steel ball as if it was a pebble.</p>
<p>It’s just that… I made a mistake again.</p>
<p><strong><em>*Zuguoooooooooo!*</em></strong></p>
<p>The steel ball, which I threw lightly, flew straight and pierced a tree trunk at the edge of the school grounds.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>The boy was left slack-jawed.</p>
<p>“T-The tree is going to fall!”</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>I hurriedly cast a restoration spell on the tree and restored it so that it would not fall.</p>
<p>“Hmm, maybe I put a little too much force into it?”</p>
<p>I tilted my head.</p>
<p>Well, well, holding back is a very difficult thing to do.</p>
<p>“W-What&#8217;s going on here…?”</p>
<p>The boy who had started the contest fell to his knees after witnessing the whole scene.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s no need to be so depressed.”</p>
<p>“I-I thought that I would win this contest for sure&#8230; This can&#8217;t be happening&#8230;”</p>
<p>He was mumbling a lot of things, so I just kept quiet.</p>
<p>Earlier, I threw it with my left hand.</p>
<p>But my dominant arm is my right.</p>
<p>The first mistake I made was using my non-dominant left hand because I thought I shouldn&#8217;t throw the steel ball too far away.</p>
<p>Telling the boy about it would make him even more depressed, so I would not tell him.</p>
<p>“Well, that&#8217;s about it for today…”</p>
<p>After all, even though it is a class, it was still just a child&#8217;s game.</p>
<p>There was no need to get any more serious.</p>
<p>“B-Boy! What the hell was that!?”</p>
<p>As I was about to get back in line, Desmond came running up to me.</p>
<p>“Sensei, your face is too close.”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t care about that! How the hell did the steel ball fly so far? I… or rather, there&#8217;s nobody else in the whole world who can do that!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Isn’t that because they didn&#8217;t use magic?”</p>
<p>“Magic&#8230;? Does that mean that it is possible to throw the steel ball further away with magic? Come to think of it, at the time of the exam, your movements were quite out of the ordinary… so even back then, too?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>It seems that the body strengthening that everyone would have used 1000 years ago is not the norm in this world.</p>
<p>I continued talking to Desmond, who looked puzzled.</p>
<p>“It is a type of magic called body strengthening. With this, it is possible to dramatically increase your physical strength and speed.”</p>
<p>“Such dreamlike magic&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Please watch me.”</p>
<p>I use Rise Power to build up strength in both legs.</p>
<p>With that, I kicked the ground and leaped.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>Desmond&#8217;s eyes widened.</p>
<p>I jumped so high up that I could see the rooftop of the Rosanlila Magic Academy.</p>
<p>When I landed on the ground, a cloud of dust rose.</p>
<p>“How&#8217;s that? Easy, isn&#8217;t it?”</p>
<p>“““I don&#8217;t think so!”””</p>
<p>Not only Desmond, but all the classmates on the school grounds responded.</p>
<p>“Mages are great, and they can use magic, but… not me. I have no talent. If only I could use magic, I might also be able to defeat a dragon.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever fought a dragon?”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s just a metaphor. There’s no way we would encounter a mythical creature.”</p>
<p>Honestly, I think Desmond could defeat at least one dragon if only he could learn magic.</p>
<p>Besides.</p>
<p>“Desmond-sensei. I think you can use magic, though?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What are you talking about? Like I said, I have no talent ──”</p>
<p>“Well, if you want to reach a higher level, it will have something to do with the color of your magic power or the talent itself. But anyone can use at least some magic.”</p>
<p>“T-That’s not possible! Wasn’t magic only for the chosen ones!?”</p>
<p>Desmond raised his voice.</p>
<p>Well, such a misunderstanding is kinda disheartening.</p>
<p>Let me teach him a little of it.</p>
<p>“Desmond-sensei… so…”</p>
<p>I quickly taught Desmond the basics of magic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, try it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm… then here I go!&#8221;</p>
<p>Desmond activated Rise Power on both legs and jumped in the same way I had just done.</p>
<p>He was aiming for the rooftop of the school building ── but not quite, just barely reaching the second floor.</p>
<p>Well, it was his first time, so I guess it is fine.</p>
<p>“Ohh… I&#8217;m flying! I just used magic&#8230;!”</p>
<p>Desmond&#8217;s voice sounded lively as if he was on a high.</p>
<p>But soon he began to fall.</p>
<p>“W-What should I do!? I’m going to hit the ground!”</p>
<p>&#8230;Is landing a little hard?</p>
<p>I got right under Desmond and cast gravity magic.</p>
<p>Then, as he approached the ground, Desmond&#8217;s fall slowed, and he landed safely.</p>
<p>“How was it? Sensei can use magic too, right?”</p>
<p>“I-I never thought magic was this simple…”</p>
<p>Desmond had a blank look as if he still could not believe it.</p>
<p>The other classmates also started to make a fuss when they saw this.</p>
<p>“W-What just happened?”</p>
<p>“It doesn&#8217;t look like sensei was chanting?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve never seen this magic before in the first place!”</p>
<p>“I want to use it, too!”</p>
<p>And so my classmates rushed to me.</p>
<p>“Oi-oi, stop pushing.”</p>
<p>What a pain.</p>
<p>I have to teach them about the body strengthening magic to stop the commotion.</p>
<p>But still, I’m just a student.</p>
<p>No matter how much the other students ── including sensei ── want to learn more about magic, I do not think it would be a good idea to disregard sensei by teaching them.</p>
<p>Besides, we are in the middle of a class right now.</p>
<p>It would be a different story with Lara and Marise.</p>
<p>“Desmond-sensei.”</p>
<p>“Mmm. I know what you want to say, boy.”</p>
<p>Desmond puts his hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Just go ahead and teach them! Don&#8217;t worry about me!”</p>
<p>said Desmond.</p>
<p>…This is really getting troublesome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haa.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>Well, it cannot be helped. I&#8217;ll just accept it as a punishment for getting a little too worked up over a child&#8217;s game.</p>
<p>“Then I&#8217;ll show all of you one more time, and then I&#8217;ll teach you how.”</p>
<p>“““Yes! Please!”””</p>
<p>After that.</p>
<p>By the end of the class, all my classmates were able to use simple body strengthening magic.</p>
