<h2>Chapter 6</h2>


<p>The day I caught a cold and vowed to live in this world once again is now a few days past. </p>



<p>I ended up taking that day and the next two days off, and with the weekend in between, I managed to fully recover and make a triumphant comeback.</p>



<p>“…A lot happened” </p>



<p>Although my condition improved quickly, the visits from people who heard I was sick were overwhelming. Ayana stayed by my side constantly, of course, but then Seina-san came by, Shu contacted me, Iori, Mari, and Aisaka also reached out… and even Kanzaki-san showed up at my house.</p>



<p>Just thinking about it makes me realize how intense and chaotic those days were, but the fact that so many people cared about me was genuinely heartwarming. </p>



<p>As soon as I was able to go out, I managed to secure some cakes from the always-sold-out bakery near the station and treated everyone to them.</p>



<p>“What are you thinking about?” </p>



<p>“Oh, I was just recalling what happened after I recovered from my cold. It was pretty hectic.”</p>




<p>“Ahaha… It really was. Even though I was there to take care of you, your mom and everyone else still made such a fuss!”</p>



<p>“………”</p>



<p>You were the most intense of them all…?</p>



<p>Ayana was relentless after those sick days. Even though it was just a day or two without our usual cuddling, she was like a force of nature trying to make up for lost time. </p>



<p>I never imagined she’d be so determined and intense in her desire to be close to me.</p>



<p>(Well… I guess I feel the same way.)</p>



<p>It seems like my feelings for Ayana have grown even stronger. Whenever it’s just the two of us, there’s really only one thing we want to do.</p>



<p>[Towa-kun, I want to stay like this all day. I want to stay like this all day, until the morning♡]</p>



<p>Ayana straddled my waist, gazing down at me with heart-shaped eyes. The memory of those intense moments, as we passionately sought each other out, remains vivid and unforgettable, much like the heat of a summer day.</p>



<p>“Even so… I’m still not satisfied.”</p>



<p>“Well, there’s not much we can do about it.”</p>



<p>So, Ayana and I are living our usual school life like that… What are we doing now? We’re looking through the door to the roof, which we opened a little.</p>



<p>Down below, Aisaka and Mari were having lunch together. </p>



<p>Mari seemed to be enjoying their conversation, but Aisaka looked incredibly nervous, unable to hide his tension and only managing to nod along to Mari’s words.</p>



<p>“Hey, Ayana… I know you’re curious, but do you still want to keep watching?”</p>



<p>“Just a little longer.”</p>



<p>Despite feeling like a couple of nosy onlookers, our curiosity was genuine. The reason those two were having lunch together was because Aisaka had asked me to invite Mari on his behalf.</p>



<p>“Aisaka-senpai? Your face is so red… Wait! Did you catch a cold like Yukishiro-senpai?” </p>




<p>“No, it’s not that! I’m just—”</p>



<p>“Let me check your forehead… Oh, it’s hot! You definitely have a fever, Aisaka-senpai!”</p>



<p>It was a scene straight out of a comedy, and I couldn’t help but chuckle.</p>



<p>“Mari-chan is being quite the little devil, isn’t she? I almost feel sorry for Aisaka-kun.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, you might be right… but it’s up to Aisaka to give it his best.”</p>



<p>“True… Alright, let’s head back.”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>On our way back to the classroom, Ayana brought something up.</p>



<p>“Do you remember what we talked about for after school?”</p>




<p>“Of course I do.”</p>



<p>“You were going to buy a swimsuit, right? I was actually looking forward to it more than you.”</p>



<p>“Ara♪, I’m so glad to hear that.”</p>



<p>Today was the day we had planned to go swimsuit shopping for Ayana. While I was excited to buy her a new swimsuit, I was even more thrilled at the prospect of seeing her try it on. I knew it wasn’t something to openly boast about, but seeing Ayana so happy made it all worthwhile.</p>



<p>“Fufu… Fufufu♪.”</p>



<p>“Ayana… ?” </p>



<p>I took a step back as she suddenly began to laugh mischievously.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of the fact that no other students were around, Ayana started gesturing dramatically, like a stage actress, and began to voice her wishes… or rather, her fantasies.</p>



<p>“Childhood friends who grew even closer after overcoming hardships… Always expressing their love for each other, perfectly compatible in every way, and blessed by the heavens. Naturally, when these two go swimsuit shopping, something is bound to happen. Like pulling her boyfriend into the fitting room to show off her swimsuit and then… Kyaa♪”</p>




<p>“That’s not happening.”</p>



<p>Such a scenario might belong in an eroge or an erotic manga, but it wasn’t going to happen in real life.</p>



<p>“………”</p>



<p>Still, I couldn’t deny that a part of me found the idea slightly appealing. It’s a common trope, isn’t it? A close female friend asks you to check how a swimsuit looks, you notice someone you know nearby, and not wanting to be seen, you use it as an excuse to pull her into the fitting room. </p>



<p>What happens next depends on the genre, but it’s an enticing situation if you let your mind wander.</p>



<p>“Hey Ayana, it’s frustrating… I know it won’t happen in real life, and even if it did, I wouldn’t go through with it, but I can’t help but think it’s kind of nice.”</p>



<p>“Exactly! So, let’s save that for when we get back home. As someone who lives for love with you, I’d be thrilled to have you ruin the brand-new swimsuit you just bought… Kyaa♪”</p>



<p>“………”</p>



<p>Lately, Ayana has been rather bold in many ways.</p>




<p>But well, Ayana would never show this side of herself if there were others around, not even her best friend Todo would know that she could act this way… it would be a problem if anyone did find out. </p>



<p>This side of her is something only I know… Although her actions and words can be a bit too er*tic, I might have to give her a talking-to someday. Or maybe not.</p>



<p>After some time passed, it was finally after school. Once the closing ceremony ended, Ayana and I quickly left the school together.</p>



<p>“Hmm hmm hmm~♪”</p>



<p>Ayana was humming happily, clearly excited about the swimsuit shopping.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun♪”</p>



<p>“Oh!”</p>



<p>She hugged my arm tightly, flaunting her good mood to everyone around us, as we headed to the shopping mall. I was well aware that just walking like this would draw a lot of attention.</p>



<p>“You know, Shu-kun has been wanting to talk to us lately.”</p>




<p>“Yeah, I’ve noticed that too.”</p>



<p>Previously, Shu and I had a talk and reconciled… or at least, we cleared the air completely. Now it was Ayana’s turn, but he seemed to be struggling to gather the courage to approach her. I didn’t blame him, though; Ayana actually seemed to be enjoying his hesitation a bit.</p>



<p>“I’m not bullying Shu-kun, but I do want to make him sweat a little for everything that’s happened. I know he wants to talk, but I’ve been pretending not to notice.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that a bit harsh?”</p>



<p>“…You think so?” </p>



<p>Ayana asked with a slightly guilty smile.</p>



<p>“Well, I get wanting to see him muster up the courage on his own. I’ve only seen the weaker side of Shu-kun, so I want to see him be brave.”</p>



<p>“Exactly.”</p>



<p>When I had told Ayana about my talk with Shu, she seemed genuinely impressed. It made sense that she’d want to witness his growth firsthand. It was what she, as his childhood friend, hoped for.</p>




<p>“If he shows that, will you be satisfied?”</p>



<p>“Yes. In whatever way he manages to show it, if he can prove that he’s changed, I’ll feel completely at peace.”</p>



<p>“In the end, you’re still kind to Shu.”</p>



<p>“I suppose… I understand him because I know the old me.”</p>



<p>Hey Shu, don’t be afraid to talk to her. I’ve told him to reach out to me if he needed help bridging the gap, but he had refused, saying he wanted to muster the courage on his own. I respected that and kept my distance.</p>



<p>“Oh, there it is.”</p>



<p>The shopping mall I was looking for came into view. There’s a wide variety of things available here, but personally I don’t come here that often, and basically only when Ayana is with me.</p>



<p>“Thankfully, it’s cool today.” </p>



<p>“Yes, if it were hot, I wouldn’t be able to cling to you like this.”</p>




<p>Ayana had been holding onto me the entire way, a rare cool day making it comfortable enough to do so. </p>



<p>We walked into the mall and headed straight for the swimwear section. Despite it being a weekday, there were a lot of people, including other students like us.</p>



<p>“Lots of people, huh?”</p>



<p>“Yeah…”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Just… feeling a bit out of place.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, we’re here to have fun,” </p>



<p>The place Ayana and I had come to was the women’s swimwear section, meaning it was naturally populated mostly by women.</p>



<p>“It’s okay, as long as I’m here with you.”</p>




<p>“I guess so…”</p>



<p>Entering a women’s swimwear section was not something I’d ever done before, so I had braced myself for the inevitable awkwardness. But apparently, my resolve was as weak as chocolate. Just then, a store clerk approached us.</p>



<p>“May I help you with something?” </p>



<p>“We’re here to buy a new swimsuit, and he’s feeling a bit out of place.”</p>



<p>“Ah, I see! As her boyfriend, you have nothing to worry about. There’s no rule against men entering this area.”</p>



<p>“R-right…”</p>



<p>“Besides, what a beautiful couple you two make… Ah, maybe I should go to a mixer.” </p>



<p>The sales clerk approached me with a smile, but then disappeared into the back while giving off a dark aura… what was that?</p>



<p>“Well, the clerk said it’s fine, so let’s go, Towa-kun!” </p>




<p>“Whoa?!”</p>



<p>Where did she get that strength from?!</p>



<p>I was pulled into the forbidden sanctum with Ayana leading the way. Despite being dragged in by her, I couldn’t help but feel embarrassed.</p>



<p>But as the clerk had said, no one was whispering or giving us dirty looks. Ayana’s presence was certainly making a big difference.</p>



<p>“There are so many.”</p>



<p>“Yeah…”</p>



<p>I was overwhelmed by the sheer variety of swimsuits on display. There were so many different designs and styles.</p>



<p>“So, which one do you think would suit me best, Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“…Fumu”</p>




<p>I couldn’t afford to be nervous now. I had to choose a swimsuit that I thought would look good on Ayana. But first, I should ask her opinion.</p>



<p>“Do you have any preferences, Ayana?”</p>



<p>“Nope. This time, I want to go entirely by your taste. It might be a tough choice, but it’s a little dream of mine to wear a swimsuit chosen by my boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“Alright, got it.”</p>



<p>With her words giving me a boost, I smacked my cheeks to focus and started browsing the swimsuits. The women around us seemed to understand the situation and looked at us with amused smiles.</p>



<p>(Let’s see… I’ve never picked out women’s swimwear before, so I guess I’ll just go with what feels right.)</p>



<p>When I glance behind me, she is looking at me with a smile, and it seems like she’ll be happy no matter what swimsuit I choose… But thinking about that, I see a swimsuit that I definitely don’t want Ayana to wear, and it makes me want to say it’s a string swimsuit.</p>



<p>“Do you like that one?” </p>



<p>“No, I was just reminding myself not to choose it.”</p>




<p>“I see. Yeah, I wouldn’t want to wear that in public either. If you bought it, I’d only wear it for you in private, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Oh, okay.”</p>



<p>But I’m definitely not picking that!?</p>



<p>I pulled myself together and looked around for a swimsuit, and throughout that time Ayana didn’t say a word or even look bored.</p>



<p>Ayana said that she was happy just doing this.</p>



<p>“…I think this one.”</p>



<p>After looking around and thinking about it, a simple white bikini caught my eye.</p>



<p>This is almost the same as the one Ayana showed me before, but with slightly lighter embroidery, making it cuter.</p>



<p>“This one?”</p>




<p>“Ah… well, you know, I thought white would suit you, Ayana.”</p>



<p>White is a color that hasn’t been tainted by anything, a pure and beautiful color. It matches Ayana’s black hair, and more than anything, it suits Ayana’s clean and innocent atmosphere perfectly. Leaving aside Ayana’s recent pink thoughts… I was convinced this was the only choice.</p>



<p>“Fufu, then I’ll go try this on.”</p>



<p>Holding the swimsuit, Ayana headed toward the fitting room.</p>



<p>“Please stay here.”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>The curtain closed, and I could hear the sound of her undressing from inside. I could also hear Ayana’s breathing, and even though I couldn’t see her, my imagination started running wild. </p>



<p>I used to think Ayana had too many pink thoughts lately, but it seems I’m no better.</p>



<p>“Okay, is this good enough… I’m coming out, Towa-kun.”</p>




<p>“Eh? Already──”</p>



<p>Before I could prepare myself, the curtain was thrown open, and an angel appeared. Ayana, clad in a pure white swimsuit, instantly captivated me, and I lost the words I should have said.</p>



<p>… Well, isn’t it obvious? Ayana is the person I love the most, my beloved… and above all, my favorite. The sight of her showing me her swimsuit is indescribable… in other words, it’s the best sight ever.</p>



<p>“From your reaction, I’ve decided. This one is perfect. The texture is great, and it’s very comfortable to wear.”</p>



<p>“I see… that’s great. By the way, you really are a beautiful girl, Ayana… I almost thought an angel had come out.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that an exaggeration? But thank you♪”</p>



<p>It’s not an exaggeration at all; I truly think so. Of course, Ayana looks cute in her swimsuit, but more than that, her great figure exudes an overwhelming allure.</p>



<p>The way her large ch*st is emphasized by the white swimsuit is breathtaking, and I wonder how many men would be captivated by this sight… but I’m the only one by her side!</p>



<p>“Ah… Towa-kun’s gaze is glued to me… this is the best!”</p>




<p>Of course it is. After that, Ayana changed back into her uniform, took the swimsuit to the register, and completed the purchase. I don’t know when Ayana will show off her new swimsuit, but for now, I’ll engrave today’s memory deeply in my mind.</p>



<p>“Shall we go home?”</p>



<p>“Yes… what should we do when we get back? There’s still time before Akemi-san returns; should we do something with this?”</p>



<p>“… You weren’t joking about that?”</p>



<p>“Of course not! Well, let’s keep it safe since we just bought it. We’ll use it again sometime soon… okay♪”</p>



<p>… I’m not disappointed at all. Really, I’m not. After leaving the shopping mall, we didn’t stop anywhere and kept walking… but then I suddenly needed to go to the bathroom.</p>



<p>“I need to go to the restroom for a bit.”</p>



<p>“I’ll wait here.”</p>



<p>“I’ll be quick!”</p>




<p>… Was it bad to say “I’ll be quick” to a girl? But there’s a reason for that: if I leave Ayana alone in such a crowded place, she’ll definitely get hit on. I rushed to the restroom and tried to finish as quickly as possible, but it took about three minutes.</p>



<p>“… Damn it, of all times to have a stomachache.”</p>



<p>I grumbled as I left the restroom and returned to Ayana, only to find my fears confirmed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Ayana, with her back turned to me, was being harassed by an obviously flashy guy, and I could tell from her posture that she was extremely irritated. There was no time to observe, so I was about to rush over to her.</p>



<p>“Ayana!”</p>



<p>“Ayana-san!”</p>



<p>“… Hmm?”</p>



<p>A familiar voice sounded from beside me, and I involuntarily stopped in my tracks. Rushing towards Ayana were Shu and Iori.</p>



<p>I was left wondering why the two of them were here as they quickly ran to Ayana’s side. Coming back to my senses, I also started running towards Ayana, but then I saw it—the black Ayana awakened within her.</p>



<p>“What are you trying to touch, you creep? Get out of my sight already…! I’m on a date with my beloved, and you’re ruining the mood. Get lost!!”</p>



<p>It was a cry of fury. Even I stopped in my tracks at this, and Shu and Iori, who had also stopped, looked puzzled… as did the flashy guy who had been trying to hit on Ayana. Despite the numerous passersby around, the area fell into silence.</p>




<p>“… Eh? Maybe I was mistaken?”</p>



<p>“It looked like someone who resembled Ayana-san… that must be it.”</p>



<p>It seemed they couldn’t believe that such a voice had come from Ayana, so Shu and Iori stood still, tilting their heads in confusion… or rather, they seemed slightly frightened. </p>



<p>Not just them, but also the flashy guy seemed scared as he quickly turned on his heel and left in a hurry.</p>



<p>“Good grief… haah, is Towa-kun still… eh?”</p>



<p>At that moment, Ayana turned around and her eyes widened in surprise. Shu and Iori also noticed my presence, but they seemed more struck by Ayana’s strong reaction and quickly looked back at her.</p>



<p>“… Umm”</p>



<p>Ayana’s face gradually turned red. Unable to bear it, she lowered her face and ran towards me, hiding her face by burying it in my chest.</p>



<p>“This is the worst~!!”</p>




<p>She seemed extremely embarrassed about losing her temper at the flashy guy and having it seen by Shu and Iori.</p>



<p>“Ah… it really was Ayana…”</p>



<p>“Ayana-san… it was really her…”</p>



<p>Ayana’s body shivered slightly. I understood that she didn’t want to be seen like that, but it was my fault for going to the bathroom in the first place.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, Ayana, I left you alone for a bit.”</p>



<p>“It’s not… it’s not Towa-kun’s fault. It was that trash who said something irritating.”</p>



<p>Trash… and something irritating?</p>



<p>“He tried to hit on me even though he knew I had a boyfriend, using the usual clichés.”</p>



<p>“I see…”</p>




<p>Probably something like he could satisfy her better than me… If that’s the case, I want to chase after him and tell him to keep his hands off my beloved girlfriend, but right now, comforting Ayana is more important.</p>



<p>“There, there. For now, let’s sit on a nearby bench.”</p>



<p>“Okay…”</p>



<p>I signaled to Shu and Iori with a glance, inviting them to join us if they wanted. Honestly, I didn’t expect them to understand, but they nodded and followed us.</p>



<p>Even when we sat on the bench, Ayana didn’t move away from me, and she mumbled softly into my chest.</p>



<p>“What do they mean by entertaining me, or satisfying me… ugh, it makes me sick. Towa-kun is the most important to me… I can’t be satisfied without being by Towa-kun’s side… I can’t live without you.”</p>



<p>“Just let it all out, whatever is bothering you.”</p>



<p>“Ughhhh!! It really pisses me off!!”</p>



<p>She was angrier than I had ever seen her. I continued to gently pat her head while glancing at Shu and Iori to explain Ayana’s current state.</p>




<p>“Ayana isn’t pretending to be someone she’s not. It’s just that she’s had to endure a lot, and sometimes she just explodes like this. So please, don’t think this isn’t the real Ayana.”</p>



<p>Well, Shu and Iori probably wouldn’t think that anyway. However, Shu looked down slightly, likely because he knew all too well about the “having to endure a lot” part… Sorry about that, Shu. I didn’t mean to hit a nerve.</p>



<p>“I personally like this side of Ayana too. Even when she explodes with emotion, she’s still my beloved girlfriend, and that doesn’t change.”</p>



<p>“… I know that. I know how much you hopelessly love me, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Right? And that goes for you too, Ayana.”</p>



<p>“Of course!”</p>



<p>Ayana’s smile as she said this, as if to say “isn’t that obvious?” made not only me but also Shu and Iori smile. It seemed Ayana had managed to let off some steam.</p>



<p>Just then, Iori said something unexpected.</p>



<p>“I see… that kind of gap is also interesting.”</p>




<p>“Iori-san?”</p>



<p>“Hey Shu-kun, if I turned into a gal or something… would that make your heart race a bit?”</p>



<p>“… Eh?”</p>



<p>What is this person saying? Shu’s gaze pierced through Iori, but he also seemed to imagine it and looked quite displeased. </p>



<p>I too imagined Iori turning into a gal after her comment. Iori usually gives off a cool impression, and words like pure and graceful are likely often associated with her… If she suddenly adopted a gal fashion, everyone at school would be utterly shocked.</p>



<p>“If Iori-san transformed into a gal, it would definitely be one of those ‘I trusted her and sent her off’ situations.”</p>



<p>“You know about that, Ayana…”</p>



<p>I didn’t know where Ayana had picked that up, but I generally agreed.</p>



<p>“So, what do you think, Shu-kun?”</p>




<p>Iori asked Shu cheerfully, but his response was blunt.</p>



<p>“If you turned into a gal, I’d be shocked. Oh, and I might wonder if you got involved with some flashy guys like in those erotic manga.”</p>



<p>Iori, startled by his words, grabbed Shu’s shoulders.</p>



<p>“Th-that would be a problem! I would never sell my body like that!”</p>



<p>“Wait, please don’t shake my shoulders so hard!”</p>



<p>Shu, who was being shaken vigorously, seemed not to hear, but Iori also declared that she wouldn’t be with anyone but Shu. In other words, she was vehemently denying it.</p>



<p>Seeing this commotion seemed to have calmed Ayana down, and she was back to her usual self.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“As long as you’re calm, that’s good.”</p>




<p>“Yes♪”</p>



<p>Ayana replied cutely, then turned her gaze from me to Shu. Shu noticed Ayana’s gaze and stopped his interaction with Iori to meet Ayana’s eyes. </p>



<p>A moment of silence fell between them, but there was no discomfort in the air. Knowing that, I felt at ease watching them.</p>



<p>“Shu-kun… you’ve changed, haven’t you? You seem much more mature, like your heart has grown stronger.”</p>



<p>“Is that so… maybe? Yeah… I think so.”</p>



<p>Even so, Shu’s expression and attitude were a bit stiff. While Ayana had an idea of how he felt, for Shu, it had been two months since he last talked to Ayana… so naturally, he was nervous.</p>



<p>“When you move forward, the view looks different than before, right? I think you can understand this now.”</p>



<p>“… Yeah, I understand it well. I’ve realized that I used to be small-minded, not paying attention to those around me.”</p>



<p>“Fufu, that’s right. I felt the same way… and there was someone who made me realize that.”</p>




<p>“Yeah, me too. I definitely thought about a lot of things, but there was a best friend who helped me realize them.”</p>



<p>Ayana, who was sitting next to me, and Shu, who was standing in front, both looked at me simultaneously.</p>



<p>I was surprised by the sudden attention, then embarrassed, scratching my cheek. When I diverted my gaze from the two, I realized Iori was right there.</p>



<p>She was looking at me with a warm, kind gaze, and I didn’t know where else to look.</p>



<p>Ayana, who had been looking at Shu, turned her gaze back to him and smiled softly.</p>



<p>“Shu-kun, please continue to take care of me. As an old acquaintance.”</p>



<p>“Ah… yeah… yeah! But before that, I have a lot of apologies to make to you.”</p>



<p>“You don’t need to go that far anymore. I can see everything now in the way you are now… But if Shu-kun isn’t satisfied, I only have one thing to say. We don’t need a somber atmosphere, right?”</p>



<p>“… I give up. If you put it that way, I can only say one thing—sorry.”</p>




<p>“Yes, I heard that loud and clear. This is the end of the dark things from the past! Finished!”</p>



<p>…Haha, watching this unfold makes me feel like crying a little.</p>



<p>On that day… I confessed to Ayana again and told Shu about our relationship, thinking our relationship had ended on the rooftop afterward.</p>



<p>Yet here we are today, the three of us together again… There’s no reason not to be delighted by the fact that we’re all smiling.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro-kun, you seem happy, don’t you?”</p>



<p>“Well, yeah… Sorry, I forgot to use polite language.”</p>



<p>“It’s okay. But… I also got to see a good moment. I know there have been a lot of ups and downs, but haven’t we finally gotten back to being the three of us?”</p>



<p>“… Haha, yeah, you’re right.”</p>



<p>It really… really feels like we’ve finally come back. Ayana and Shu are enjoying their conversation without any awkwardness now that their differences have been resolved.</p>




<p>I don’t feel any jealousy seeing this, but now I guess I’ll be talking to Iori.</p>



<p>“What were you doing with Shu today?”</p>



<p>“He helped me with some student council work on the way back. Then we happened to find Ayana-san and ended up here.”</p>



<p>“I see. Did you enjoy your time with Shu?”</p>



<p>“Very much. Shu-kun has been amazing lately, you know? He’s even more efficient than before, and above all, he’s so cheerful. A good atmosphere really increases efficiency, after all.”</p>



<p>There’s some truth to that… Atmosphere really is important in everything.</p>



<p>“Thank you for waiting, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Thanks, Towa. Thanks for spending time with Ayana.”</p>



<p>“No problem. Well then, shall we head home soon?”</p>




<p>“Yes, I think so. Shu-kun, and also Iori-san, see you at school.”</p>



<p>“Okay, see you later, both of you.”</p>



<p>We said goodbye to them and went home as planned.</p>



<p>After this, Ayana is supposed to have dinner at my place, and Seina-san is also planning to join us.</p>



<p>Originally, I would have returned home a bit earlier, but meeting with Shu and the others delayed my return.</p>



<p>“I’m home.”</p>



<p>“Excuse me for intruding.”</p>



<p>It seems Mom is already home, and Seina-san is here as well. When I entered the living room, the two of them were chatting amicably, and Ayana and I joined in, enjoying a conversation as a family. Of course, the main topic was what happened earlier.</p>



<p>“Yeah… even though there were various things going on, it turned out well, didn’t it? Hey, Towa, next time, bring Shu-kun when I’m around.”</p>




<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>“Ayana seems much more refreshed now. And Shu-kun seems to be doing well too.”</p>



<p>“I caused worry for Mom as well. But it’s all okay now.”</p>



<p>Mom and Seina-san were both relieved and happy, and Ayana and I exchanged glances and smiled at each other.</p>



<p>Just as I was thinking about preparing for a bath and dinner, there was an unexpected additional visitor.</p>



<p>“Who could it be…”</p>



<p>“I’ll go see.”</p>



<p>Heading to the entrance and opening the door, there stood Kanzaki-san.</p>



<p>“Yahoo, Towa-boy. Sorry for coming over all of a sudden.”</p>




<p>“No no… What’s up?”</p>



<p>“I just felt like eating Ane-san’s cooking! Is it okay even though it’s last minute?”</p>



<p>“Oh, is that so?”</p>



<p>As an adult, saying something like that… well, it’s a bit uncouth at this point.</p>



<p>Mom, who arrived late, was amazed but invited Kanzaki-san in. There was a slightly awkward atmosphere the moment Seina-san met Kanzaki-san, but there was nothing to worry about. Moreover, with Mom mediating and Ayana also joining in, Seina-san and Kanzaki-san quickly hit it off.</p>



<p>“Akemi really is a good person… I can feel that so painfully well.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I can relate to that! Ane-san is truly—”</p>



<p>“Wait, stop with the ticklish talk.”</p>



<p>Since they got along so well, dinner time became quite lively. Well, if you gather three people who get loud when they drink, it’s inevitable in a sense… Ayana and I finished our meal early and took refuge in my room to catch our breath.</p>




<p>“Haa… The smell of alcohol still lingers from being hugged tightly.”</p>



<p>“Haha… Well, I think we endured it pretty well.”</p>



<p>Ayana got tangled up with Mom, and I got tangled up with Seina-san and Kanzaki-san, and we ended up covered in the smell of alcohol. At this rate, Seina-san will probably stay over again today, and Kanzaki-san might do the same… which means Ayana will stay over as well, that’s confirmed.</p>



<p>“Ah, look, Towa-kun! A shooting star!”</p>



<p>“It’s too late when you ask me to look!”</p>



<p>Sneaking up behind Ayana, who was gazing at the starry sky, I hugged her tightly.</p>



<p>Without doing anything special, we simply looked up at the sky together, enjoying a relaxed time.</p>



<p>“Hey, Ayana… don’t you think we really did our best?”</p>



<p>“I do. Honestly, we’ve experienced too much for high school students.”</p>




<p>“I guess we’re about the only ones who’ve had such an intense high school life.”</p>



<p>Smiling gently at that thought, I buried my face into Ayana’s neck, inhaling her sweet scent.</p>



<p>“You’re tickling me♪”</p>



<p>“Sorry, but I just wanted to do that.”</p>



<p>Not content with just smelling her scent, I slowly shifted my hand position to rest it on Ayana’s ch*st.</p>



<p>As my fingers gently sank in, Ayana trembled, her eyes moistening with expectation… and as we gazed at each other, inevitably, our faces drew closer and developed into a kiss.</p>



<p>“<em>Chu… Mm…♪</em>“</p>



<p>It didn’t take long for a kiss that started with just a touch to turn into a deep kiss with our tongues. Once that switch was flipped, we couldn’t stop… However, for now, I just want to enjoy the time of touching and kissing.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, you’re… mean.”</p>




<p>“Oh? I just want to see more of cute Ayana, that’s all.”</p>



<p>“I’m happy to hear that, but I’d be satisfied with just this… but don’t you feel like you want more than this?”</p>



<p>“…I’m sorry for starting something and then stopping. Let’s wait a bit longer.”</p>



<p>Because, you know, our moms are still awake.</p>



<p>When I said that, Ayana puffed out her cheeks for a moment, but she nodded, understanding the situation.</p>



<p>“It’s like we need our own space soon, without worrying about such things.”</p>



<p>“Yeah…”</p>



<p>As I was about to nod, we heard a loud noise from the living room.</p>



<p>It was probably the sound of something falling, but Ayana and I sighed in unison before heading downstairs to investigate the cause… back into the battlefield smeared with alcohol where the adults were.</p>




<p>“Oh come on! You’re all adults, can’t you consider some limits?”</p>



<p>“Ayana-chan, welcome back!”</p>



<p>“Ayana, what’s wrong? Do you want some attention?”</p>



<p>“Come here, come here~”</p>

<p>“…”</p>



<p>Seeing Ayana’s shoulders start to tremble, I left the living room behind. It’s not hard to imagine what kind of storm is about to descend upon our mothers, but despite that, I still love this chaos.</p>



<p>“…It really is happiness.”</p>



<p>This, too, is a form of the future that Ayana and I have obtained… From now on, memories will surely remain by our side as treasures.</p>



<p>The journey we’ve desperately struggled through so far… When it all comes together, it feels like it could become a story. Perhaps even a story that surpasses a game.</p>




<p>But maybe that’s going a bit too far?</p>



<p>“D-don’t get any closer! Towa-kun! We’ll be attacked by old, drunk zombies!”</p>



<p>“O-old…!?”</p>



<p>“Wh-what are you saying…!?”</p>



<p>“I’m not… at the age where I can say that yet…”</p>



<p>I heard the sound of a few people collapsing to the floor.</p>



<p>It seems like a scene from hell is spreading out so much that it’s scary to peek again, but in response to Ayana’s voice, I returned to the living room once more.</p>
