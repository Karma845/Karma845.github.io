<h2>Chapter 6: High School Daily Life</h2>

<h4>Yuno’s PoV</h4>


<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre6">*Ding Dong*</em></p>



<p class="calibre2">The familiar sound of the school bell echoed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After finishing her Saturday morning classes, Yuno approached a girl nearby.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Suzuha-chan, how did you do on the test earlier?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I got 96 points…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Wow! So, Suzuha-chan had the highest score in the class after all. As expected of you!” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno, who has been friends with Mochizuki Suzuha since elementary school, chatted with her while preparing to leave school.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“How about you, Yuno-chan?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I managed to get 90 points somehow.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Wow… Getting 90 points in a subject you’re not good at is really impressive, isn’t it?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thanks! At least now my idiot big brother (<em class="calibre6">baka aniki</em>) won’t have to worry so much.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, that’s good.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-39" class="calibre2">Suzuha, with her medium-long silver hair swaying, narrowed her clear blue eyes and smiled softly. Yuno returned the smile.</a></p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh… Is Haruto onii-san doing well?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“He’s doing great. The other day, he came home without notifying anyone, and he spent over an hour talking nonsense.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Did Yuno-chan punish Haruto onii-san?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I gave him a good spanking on the butt. Hopefully, he would remember it next time.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suzuha, who has been friends with Yuno since elementary school, is well acquainted with Yuno’s family situation. In fact, she is the only person who knows the details.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Amid their lighthearted conversation about family matters…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“!?””!!””!?”</p>



<p class="calibre2">A trio of male classmates who had been standing nearby overheard the conversation, and upon hearing it, they turned their heads and glanced at the girls.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Upon meeting the gaze of the boys, Yuno immediately shifted her expression to a stern glare.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“What? You boys over there. You seem like you guys have something to say.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-No, nothing at all!” (Trio)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The boys quickly denied with nervous expressions.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Despite their synchronized denials and attempts to form a circle again, it was clear that the boys overheard the conversation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, did you hear that!? Yuno-chan is willing to spank her brother just for causing a little bit of trouble!” (Student)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m so jealous of her brother…” (Student)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t he lucky…” (Student)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno and Suzuha remained oblivious. They had no idea that they were currently the top two in the “Cute High School Girls Ranking, According to Second-year Boys”.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was precisely because of their popularity that such conversations took place.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uwaa…” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, it’s just a joke! Don’t be so repulsed, Yuno-chi! It’s just a joke, right!?” (Student)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I think there are good jokes and bad jokes.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As Yuno responded to the first boy who tried to explain himself, another boy chimed in.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t say such awful things!” (Student)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m just stating the obvious.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a twitching brow, as Yuno grew disdainful, the last boy made a different suggestion.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Come on, don’t say things like that! Oh, how about we all go bowling together today? What do you think?” (Student)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-well, I’ll pass…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ll pass too. And aren’t there club activities for the baseball club today? Stop saying weird things and go already.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">These words served as the final blow to the boys.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Did you have to say that…” (Student)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s just mean…” (Student)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I wanted to escape from reality a bit longer…” (Student)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah yeah. Good luck to the three of you.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Woo-hoo…” (Trio)</p>



<p class="calibre2">After casually dismissing the boys and waving goodbye, their conversation resumed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>… Why are they so childish? They’re supposed to be second-year high school students.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Maybe they just want your attention, Yuno-chan… You’re popular, after all.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I think they’re just teasing me.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But weren’t you confessed to yesterday? During lunch break?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh… W-Wait, were you watching!?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, I just assumed so because you were called out. The guy who called you out looked extremely nervous. You rejected him, right?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“He wasn’t a bad person, but compared to my <em class="calibre6">baka aniki</em>, he just seemed too childish.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I think it’s a bit unfair to compare him to Haruto onii-san…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Watching Suzuha hesitantly express her opinion with hands over her mouth, Yuno stared at her for a few seconds, then lifted the corner of her mouth and said with a smirk.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“As expected of someone aiming for my onii-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-It’s not like that…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I know you drop by the cafe where he works just to chat with him.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uuu…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, I’m planning to have dinner outside with my <em class="calibre6">baka aniki</em>.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ugh…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suzuha furrowed her eyebrows, a clear expression despite her quiet demeanor.&nbsp; Yuno, who was well-aware of this part of Suzuha, teased her further.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Look, you’re making an envious face.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">M-Mouuu</em>!” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, Suzuha-chan, you’re always welcome to join us. <em class="calibre6">Baka aniki</em> will be at home on Sunday so feel free to come over during that day too.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Un… Okay, got it.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">After widening her blue eyes, Suzuha smiled faintly. It was a mix of surprise and joy.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Now then, I have to head to work soon, but are you planning on staying at school a bit longer, Suzuha-chan? If you’re going home&mdash;” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, I have something to do today, so let’s go home together?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“All right!” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suzuha usually stayed back at school for self-study while Yuno had to rush home immediately to take care of household chores, cooking, and her part-time job.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Due to their conflicting schedules, they rarely walk home together.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After finishing their preparations, they passed through the corridor from the classroom to the entrance, and the two of them encountered an unexpected event.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As Yuno reached up to open her shoe locker as usual, something unexpected happened.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Whoa!” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Two letters fluttered out from the shoe locker, landing on their heads.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Phew, that was a surprise… I thought it was a bug.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah this again…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">They were letters with ‘To Yuno-san’ written on them. Everyone was clear from a glance.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Following suit, Suzuha opened hers and…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Two letters, each addressed ‘To Suzuha-san,’ fell out.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The two exchanged silent glances and then bent down to carefully pick up the fallen letters.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Students passing by who observed the whole scene couldn’t help but think:</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;(Someone’s confessing to them again…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;(Are there going to be more casualties…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;(They don’t even have a chance…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Except for the two girls involved, no one else was surprised by the event. It was a common sight in this school, and there was already a widespread rumor circulating among the students that killed any chances of any boys dating them.</p>



<p class="calibre2">There was a certain monster (man) out there who managed to seduce the two girls, who had been confessed to by dozens of people. Because of that, it was believed that no one could date them!</p>



<p class="calibre2">This aforementioned individual, who is currently sweeping the entrance of his house energetically with a broom, was eagerly anticipating something today</p>



<p class="calibre2">And so, In the evening on that day…</p>



<p class="calibre2">===</p>



<p class="calibre2">[Haruto’s PoV]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Heh.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What’s with the grin, onii-chan…” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno, done with her part-time job, had joined her brother for dinner at a family restaurant.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto wore a gentle smile when they were looking at the menu together.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“S-Sorry. It’s just that it’s been a while since we went out to eat together.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Although he apologized and gave an explanation, he received no response and instead was met with a half-hearted glare.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s creepy when you look that happy.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t it normal?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“What part of it?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In reality, Yuno was not wrong. With how happy Haruto was, if judged solely by their atmosphere, it wouldn’t be unreasonable for someone to mistake them for a “fresh couple”.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well, I hope you can forgive me for being that way… Like I said, it’s been a while.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s been a while because onii-chan rarely ever invites me. If you invited me, I wouldn’t refuse.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno lowered her gaze, flipping through the menu, but her thoughts were clear: “Just casually invite me. I’ll go with you.”</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, in that case, how about we set a goal to go out for a meal about twice a month? It would make things easier for you, and we could both relax. Coming up with a menu every day must be tough, right…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s a no.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh, you don’t like it?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. I don’t want to.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto, having researched how challenging daily cooking can be through the voices of housewives online, made the suggestion to lighten Yuno’s load. However, it was promptly rejected, leaving him a bit taken aback.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Can I ask why?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Simply put, it’s more of a luxury. Dining out costs more than cooking at home, you know? With the money spent on one meal outside, I could make enough food for two or three days.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But, you know, having days when you don’t have to cook, can relax, and don’t have to think about the menu seems like a good balance, doesn’t it?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If I hated cooking and did it begrudgingly, maybe. But I enjoy cooking. Besides, we made a promise, right? ‘Don’t push yourself on days you’re not feeling well.’ So, there’s no need to force dining out days.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Is that so?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. Rather than increasing dining out days, I’d be happier buying a pudding from the convenience store and eating it together with you.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-I see… Then, how about buying pudding on our way home today?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. I’ll go for the baked pudding.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Then I’ll take the milk pudding.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Sorry, but they’re sold out of the one you like. I forgot to tell you last time as a punishment.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“In that case, maybe I’ll sneakily eat Yuno’s pudding.”</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If you do that, I’ll spank you again.”</p>



<p class="calibre2">And so, they decided on their dessert for the trip home, playfully discussing which one to buy.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, then, let’s drop the dining out talk. Onii-chan, just keep enjoying my cooking, okay? Got it?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hahaha, got it, got it.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The frequency of dining out remained unchanged. They reached the conclusion of ‘occasionally going out,’ and the topic quickly shifted.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, speaking of which, there’s something I want to confirm.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“What is it?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You haven’t forgotten that Suzuha-chan is coming over tomorrow, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uh…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto let out a pathetic sound and covered his mouth. With this reaction, it was evident to anyone that he had indeed forgotten.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“E-Eh… Did you maybe forget to re-schedule the livestream?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, it’s not that. It’s just that I forgot to buy sweets for the two of you…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haa?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ouch!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Seeing Haruto’s face filled with despair, as if he had done something irreversible, Yuno promptly gave him a forehead flick.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Come on, don’t make such a face over something like that, it’s misleading. We can just buy them together after this, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, I wanted to buy it by myself…&nbsp; It’s better if it’s a surprise. Yuu would be happier that way, right?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“For that reason?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah… Ugh. Instead of getting hung up on our dining session today, I should have gone to buy them earlier…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The planned surprise didn’t go as smoothly as intended.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Watching Haruto’s shoulders slump and his mood dampen, Yuno wore a puzzled expression.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Onii-chan, it’s a bit late now, but since Suzuha-chan isn’t coming early in the morning, couldn’t you have secretly gone to buy them tonight or tomorrow morning without me knowing?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Ah, yeah. I guess you’re right.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You don’t need to get so down about it. I appreciate the thought.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Please don’t say it with a ‘you’re so stubborn’ face.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, you are stubborn though.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-You say that quite often, don’t you?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, let’s not dwell on that so much and continue with our order, okay? Look, they have onii-chan’s favorite cheese hamburger on the menu.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm, there’s also a cheese topping…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Why not add it on top of the hamburger? Think of it as a reward for trying to make us happy.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Sure, let’s give it a try. I wonder how it’ll taste like with extra cheese.” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-40" class="calibre2">“I’ll go for gratin<sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a> and seafood salad. Also, let’s get two drinks from the drink bar.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Is that all? You can order more meat and stuff, you know? And look at the desserts, there are so many nice options.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“My stomach isn’t as big as yours… Besides, isn’t the pudding later already a dessert?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-Yeah, you’re right.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto could only offer a wry smile, looking somewhat embarrassed as he shifted his attention to the menu.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Observing this scene, Yuno muttered under her breath softly:</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Is having an onii-chan like this really okay, Suzuha-chan?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a relaxed expression, she let out these words, as if speaking to herself.</p>


<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre6">Suzuha, with her medium-long silver hair swaying, narrowed her clear blue eyes and smiled softly. Yuno returned the smile.</em></a></p>

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vampiramtl.com/wp-content/uploads/TGS_10.jpeg?w=1101&ssl=1">

<p class="calibre2">It was 1 PM on Sunday, the day after the siblings were eating out.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre6">*Ring*&nbsp;</em></p>



<p class="calibre2">The intercom of the house rang, and Haruto immediately stood up from the sofa.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh? I wonder who that is.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You sure move quickly, onii-chan. It’s Suzuha-chan, so I’ll answer.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“How do you know?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“We were in touch with each other.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, I see.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Seated next to him, Yuno happily played with her phone while humming. The reason for her cheerful mood has now become clear.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, I’ll go welcome her.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Okay.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">(I’m sure Suzuha-chan would be happy if I told her Yuu had been waiting eagerly waiting for her.)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With such thoughts in mind, he stood up with newfound determination and slowly followed her sister’s back.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey…” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What is it?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Yuno stopped in her tracks and turned around.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t you ‘what is it?’ me, why is onii-chan coming along? I said I’d go welcome her myself.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, I just thought I’d take the opportunity to greet her too.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">(I don’t think I said anything particularly strange…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">However, dissatisfaction was evident all over Yuno’s face.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Mouu</em>… You don’t have to do it right now, right? Suzuha-chan probably expects me to be the one to come out. Are you trying to surprise her?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-No, that’s not my intention…! Um, can you consider it, Yuu? Of course, I’ll stop if you think that Suzuha-chan wouldn’t like it, but I want to come with you if possible.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Knowing that Suzuha was the person who had always supported Yuno, in areas where Haruto couldn’t, led him to feel a strange sense of obligation to greet her.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After all, he was like a parental figure to Yuno.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“D-Don’t make such a scary face. Besides, there’s no way Suzuha-chan would dislike it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha… Suzuha-chan is kind, just like you.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t include me in that and don’t praise us together! I’m not kind!” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You’re saying that again. Even though I know you well enough.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-it’s true! At school… I refer to you as ‘stupid brother (<em class="calibre6">baka aniki</em>)’!” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh?… Wait, ‘stupid brother’!? Hold on, is that true!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Did he mishear? That thought crossed his mind for a moment, but he quickly grasped the reality.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He didn’t know that he was being called that. It was the first time he heard it. His mind went completely blank.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Also, kindness isn’t the only reason why she wouldn’t dislike it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Wait, Yuu. More importantly, what’s with that ‘stupid brother’ thing…!? When did you start calling me that!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, I’ll see if I can create an opportunity for you to greet her.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah… R-Right. Thanks for that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He asked, but the topic was dodged. From the way she was acting, it seemed like she had no intention of answering.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, come on. Instead of standing around here, head back to the living room and wait. We can’t keep Suzuha-chan waiting any longer.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Sure…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Overwhelmed by shock, his legs lost strength, but Yuno pushed him back into the living room.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After about 15 minutes…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Such a deflated voice escaped when the sounds of two footsteps passed through the corridor to Yuno’s room.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It seemed like the greeting would have to wait a bit longer.</p>



<p class="calibre2">…</p>



<p class="calibre2">Despite trying to maintain composure and endure the sadness of being called ‘Stupid Brother’, when he realized that he couldn’t greet Suzuha-chan, the dam holding back his emotions seemed to break.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Aaahhh…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">An inaudible sound left his mouth as his body lost all its strength and he collapsed onto the sofa, lying there like a corpse.</p>



<p class="calibre2">His body slowly slipped onto the floor and…</p>



<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre6">*Thud*</em></p>



<p class="calibre2">He was hit with a dull pain, but the shock to his heart was nothing compared to the pain.</p>



<p class="calibre2">…</p>



<p class="calibre2">There was only one thing that crossed his empty mind.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He pulled out his smartphone from his pocket and, with trembling fingers, opened a certain app.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-75" class="calibre2">One with an icon of “X”<sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a>. On Twitto, he switched from the main account “Oni-chan the Toxic Streamer” to his sub-account, “Oni-chan the Second”.</p>



<p class="calibre2">This sub-account was set up so that only people who followed him could see his posts.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With 20,000 followers on this account, he quietly made a post.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [Question: Does my family hate me? Context: Apparently, when I’m not around, they call me ‘Stupid Brother’.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">With eyes that resembled those of a lifeless fish, he waited for incoming notifications. In just a few minutes, likes and comments started pouring in.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Are you okay, lol? Are you crying?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Oof that sounds painful.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Oh, things sound kinda serious over there.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Oni-chan sounds devastated lol.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [You really love your little sister, huh.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Cheer up, Oni-chan!!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [It’s cute that you think being called stupid equals being disliked lol.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“What else could it mean other than being disliked… And they’re all ignoring the main question to begin with…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">No one answered the question.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While muttering to himself, he scrolled through the comments and finally found a follower who responded to his question.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [To be honest, I don’t think you’re disliked! Oni-chan’s sister is pretty young, right? She’s probably just going through her rebellious phase, pretty normal stuff.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Rebellious phase…? Yuu?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While it is true that she’s around that age, he couldn’t imagine her sister behaving like that based on their usual interactions.</p>



<p class="calibre2">However, whether it was because of this response or not, he started receiving numerous stories about rebellious phases.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [My sister’s rebellious phase is way worse. She freaks out just from doing laundry together.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He was so shocked by the content that his voice slipped out unintentionally.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [No way, right? That’s gotta be a lie.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Another response:</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [My sister will always slip in a profanity every time I talk to her!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [Does that really happen?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Another response came:</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [You guys are having it so easy. My sister ignores me, curses at me, and steals everything I buy.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [That’s probably because you’re being mean to her or something.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yet another response:</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Ah, memories… Back then during my daughter’s rebellious phase, I was told by her that I stink lol.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [Good job surviving that. If I ever get told that, I’ll come to you for advice.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“H-Hearing everyone’s stories, I guess Yuu is on the gentler side… probably…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even so, being called ‘Stupid Brother’ by his beloved family was painful.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He had never been called that at home, and nothing was alluding to it. Because he wasn’t mentally prepared, the damage was quite severe.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a heavy heart, he remained lying on the floor, with Twitto still open. Then, another response arrived.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [In my opinion, Oni-chan, you’re not disliked. She probably just doesn’t want people at school to find out that she’s close to her brother.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [You got my attention. Tell me more.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">This person seems to be a woman giving insight from her perspective.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Wow, I got a reply too! Hey, let’s ABEX together sometime.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [There’s no point in asking that. Come on, hurry up.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even at times like this, he still held on to his character.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The other person seemed to understand this and provided information straight.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Well, it can’t be helped. I don’t know your sister’s age, but if she’s in high school, everyone’s going through their rebellious phase. If word gets out that she’s close to her brother, people might tease her, calling her a brocon or something. She might end up standing out in school because of this.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [That’s true.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [In other words, what she says might not be what she thinks. It’s most likely just a cover-up. Anyways, isn’t it nice that she doesn’t actually hate you? Keep it up.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [I see. I get it now. Thanks.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Certainly, there was a possibility that she was conscious of how others perceived her… With that thought, he pressed the like button on the message.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He felt a little relieved.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Recovering a bit from his fish-like gaze, Haruto continued to check his notifications. Just as he did, a new response caught his eye, and he promptly replied.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Hey, Oni-chan. I have three sisters, and they complain a lot, but every time they do, I’m thrilled!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [What do you mean, thrilled? If you say something weird, I’ll block you.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [It’s not like that! I’m thrilled about their growth! Entering the rebellious phase means there are only a few years left before they become independent, right? There’s no time to be shocked, right?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was something he hadn’t considered, but it made sense once he thought about it.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [Thanks. Indeed, I don’t have time to be shocked.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Yeah. Also, even if she dislikes you now, she’ll probably be grateful when she becomes an adult. Maybe.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [Maybe, huh? Well, thanks for the tip.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was a message deserving of a hundred likes, but he maintained his character and responded coldly.</p>



<p class="calibre2">(Not that I take pleasure in others’ misfortune, but hearing people complain about their sister makes me feel a bit better…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He chuckled as if the wound in his heart had healed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While some people were teasing him, he felt that making this post was a good decision.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He couldn’t dwell on it any longer.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As he was about to turn off his smartphone and try to lift his body from the floor, he was called out from behind.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, excuse me… Haruto onii-san?” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was a familiar voice.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With surprised eyes, he turned his head and there she was.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Lacy socks, a short skirt, and black pant&mdash;</p>



<p class="calibre2">“S-Suzuha-chan!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even without seeing her face, it was clear who it was. He quickly stood up like a ninja, trying to hide the fact that he had seen something he shouldn’t have.</p>



<p class="calibre2">(D-Dangerous. Why did she approach me when I was lying down? No, more importantly…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Cold sweat wouldn’t stop pouring. Despite his tense expression, he opened his mouth.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, um, Suzuha-chan… It’s been a while, huh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre6">*Nod nod*</em></p>



<p class="calibre2">While nodding like a squirrel, Suzuha responded.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-It’s been a while. Um, you were lying on the floor just now… Are you okay…?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, y-yeah. I’m fine, totally fine! A-And, I didn’t see anything, okay?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Didn’t see anything?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-74" class="calibre2">Suzuha, maintaining her elegant posture, widened her beautiful eyes and tilted her head. Seeing her clueless expression, he felt both relief and regret for not explaining the context.</a></p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, don’t worry about it! I was just lost in thought for a moment…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-I see.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">There was no way he could tell her he accidentally saw her underwear.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It might be rude, but if she hadn’t noticed, it was better not to say anything… Otherwise, things would have become awkward.</p>



<p class="calibre2">That was the conclusion he reached.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah! Thanks for coming all the way to greet me, Suzuha-chan. You haven’t been to the cafe recently, so I wanted to say hello.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, um… that’s because it was the exam period. It’s not that I was purposely avoiding Haruto onii-san…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, I see. Wait, it’s the exam period!? Yuu didn’t tell me anything… probably because she thinks I’ll start doing housework for her…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, that sounds just like Yuno-chan.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It would be nice if she relied on her big brother a bit more, don’t you think?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If things get too hard, I believe that she’ll genuinely ask for help.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ll choose to believe that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suzuha narrowed her beautiful jewel-like eyes at those words.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Though captivated by the smile on her well-featured face, Haruto shook his head to regain composure. She was his sister’s friend; he shouldn’t look at her with weird eyes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto utilized the conversational skills he gained from streaming to lead the conversation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Right, right! Suzuha-chan, how did your exams go?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, well, I think I’ll manage to stay within the top 10 in my grade.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Wow! That’s great! That’s really amazing, Suzuha-chan!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“T-Thank you… Just hearing you say that makes me happy…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Keep up the good work. If you ever have any problems, feel free to look for me anytime. Though I’m not going to be much help when it comes to studying, haha.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-It’s okay… If the time ever comes, I’ll appreciate your help…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">After shaking her head left and right, Suzuha bowed politely.</p>



<p class="calibre2">(You don’t have to be that formal…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He had that thought multiple times before, but this had always been a part of Suzuha’s personality since a long time ago.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, Suzuha-chan, you’ve become even more beautiful in the short time I haven’t seen you. I was surprised when our eyes met.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh!?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Just between the two of us, you’ve got a boyfriend now, right?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-N-N-No, that’s not true…!” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He couldn’t help but laugh at her vigorous denial, making an “X” sign with both hands and vigorously shaking her head.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno and Suzuha had been friends since elementary school. For Haruto, who had seen them grow together, Suzuha was like another younger sister to him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Is that so?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s true…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, really…? Well, I know a lot of good things about Suzuha-chan, so it wouldn’t be weird for you to have a boyfriend.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You always tease me like that, Haruto onii-san…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I didn’t mean to tease you! I really mean it.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If Haruto onii-san wants to put it that way… then, do you have a girlfriend?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh, me?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yes. I also know a lot of wonderful things about Haruto Onii-san…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She brought her fingertips together and blushed slightly as she conveyed her thoughts. Haruto couldn’t help but swallow a breath at her cute girlish gesture.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thank you for saying that. But unfortunately, that’s not the case.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-I see… Well, then… I’m glad.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh? You’re glad?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eek! Um, well, what I meant just now was…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suzuha spoke in a transparent voice.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even with her small voice, it was easy to understand. Watching her flustered state, Haruto put his thoughts together and could deduce the meaning behind those words.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Ah! I see, that makes sense. If I were to get a girlfriend, it would mean less time to spend with Yuu, and she’s still in high school, so that wouldn’t be good.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh, well…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Really, I’m glad that Suzuha-chan is Yuu’s best friend. Please continue taking care of my sister from now on too.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um… o-of course.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-76" class="calibre2">(There’s something a bit strange about her reaction…)<sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a></p>



<p class="calibre2">He hadn’t said anything strange. It must be his imagination.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, I shouldn’t take up any more of your time since it’s your special day with Yuno. I hope you have a lot of fun today.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“T-thank you… Well then, Haruto onii-san, I’ll take my leave.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Sure. Take your time.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Honestly, he wanted to talk more, but he didn’t want to bore Yuno so he waved goodbye.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, sorry. I forgot to mention one thing.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm? Forgot something?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yes. It seems Yuno-chan sent a message to Haruto onii-san and she wants you to check it.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I see. Thanks for letting me know.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-No problem.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He saw her off to the corridor and when she entered Yuno’s room, he immediately checked his phone for the message.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Onii-chan, I’m sorry. I might have said too much earlier. You might not believe me, but I’ve never once thought badly of you. Thank you for always doing your best for my sake.)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;An unexpected apology.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Though not said in person, the sincerity behind the words was clear. Following what he heard from Twitto, it seemed that this was indeed part of going through a rebellious phase.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“So that’s how it is, huh? I see, I see.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The more he read the message, the more a sense of joy welled up within him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He wasn’t disliked after all. At this moment, Haruto felt as if he could soar through the sky.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehehe. I guess I’ll give my all in video editing today!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">For Haruto, there was nothing more joyful than being able to spend an ordinary day with his beloved family.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Alright, let’s get back to work!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto joyfully scattered musical notes around as he moved to his gaming room.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post (Oni-chan)</strong>: [Ha! As it turns out, she doesn’t hate me at all!! Take that, those who teased me!!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Later, the sunny Haruto posted the details of his overwhelming happiness on his&nbsp; ‘The Second Oni-chan’ account/</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh! But before that, there’s something I need to do…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">And then, he remembered.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In preparation for this moment, he hurriedly arranged the snacks he had bought and delivered them to Yuno’s room.</p>


<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vampiramtl.com/wp-content/uploads/TGS_11.jpeg?w=1066&ssl=1">


<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre6">“Suzuha, maintaining her elegant posture, widened her beautiful eyes and tilted her head. Seeing her clueless expression, he felt both relief and regret for not explaining the context.”</em></a></p>

<p class="calibre2">After Haruto delivered the snacks…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, Haruto Onii-san… is amazing, after all. That’s a lot…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Looking at the snacks on the table and carpet, Suzuha gave a wry smile, while Yuno, placing a hand on her forehead, had a bewildered expression.</p>



<p class="calibre2">At a glance, there were countless snacks scattered around.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Two-liter carbonated drinks, apple juice, and one bottle of tea each.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Two bags of family-sized chips.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;One bag of family-sized chocolates and one bag of family-sized cookies.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Several types of gummies and candies.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Two triangular shortcakes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The drinks and snacks instantly took over the table, which was supposed to be used for studying.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“S-Sorry, Suzuha-chan. Onii-chan just thinks that the more snacks there are, the happier people are… He never considers how much one can actually eat…” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She added a firm explanation and defense as a responsible younger sister.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“We don’t have to eat everything just because he gave it to us.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suzuha understands Haruto’s personality but says this just to be safe.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>. He must have gotten excited since it’s been a while since Suzuha-chan visited.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As Yuno moves the snacks on the table onto the carpet to create a space for eating, she reflects on how things ended up like this.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Normally, one wouldn’t even think about bringing in so much, right? There isn’t even any room on the table for us to eat.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, that’s so typical of Haruto onii-san.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“He’s always been like this. I know it’s one of his good points, but still.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno, with a disapproving look, could easily picture the situation that led up to this.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Her brother happily puts snacks and drinks into the shopping basket without any consideration for the cost, without checking the prices, just to make someone happy.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Although she knew this would happen, her brother refused to let her come with him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He even proudly said, ‘I’ll go shopping alone! Look forward to what I’ll bring back!’ with a smile.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Also, he forgot to prepare cups for the drinks and forks for the cake. This is like some malicious prank.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, true. Hehehe.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“He looked so proud of himself when he brought in the snacks, and it somehow ended up like this… Why is onii-chan and I so different in this regard?”</p>



<p class="calibre2">While muttering complaints, Yuno’s tone and expression remained gentle, and she seemed to be smiling inwardly.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suzuha, seemingly understanding Yuno’s feelings, silently watches and softens her expression.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She continued to talk about Haruto’s clumsy side one after another. Simple complaints come out, but the atmosphere in the room is warm.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Because they know Haruto well, the conversation ends with a ‘It can’t be helped’.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Now then, I’ll go get some cups and forks. I’ll also bring wet tissues while I’m at it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, maybe you should wait a bit longer…?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s fine. Onii-chan has probably already moved to his gaming room.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Judging from the happily delivered snacks, it’s safe to say that Haruto read the apology message Yuno sent a little while ago.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Living under the same roof as Haruto, Yuno can easily anticipate what action he’ll take when in such a mood.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He’s definitely going to start working right away.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Even if onii-chan is in the living room, you can just say you need to use the bathroom and get away with it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ehh? But the bathroom and living room aren’t near each other.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Usually, yes, but he’ll apologize with a ‘Sorry for catching you at a bad time’ in response.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“H-Have you tried that before?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suzuha widens her eyes in shock at the surprising revelation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“When living together, you’ll get used to onii-chan’s absent-mindedness. I’ve been using this to help out more in secret.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno has been consistently acting this way. If she could help out around the house without him noticing, she prefers it to be that way.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Besides, if I bluntly tell him about what I’m doing in secret, my brother might cry or something.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, if Haruto onii-san were to cry, it would most likely be at Yuno-chan’s graduation ceremony, wouldn’t it?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, 100%. He’d probably cry so much that one tissue wouldn’t be enough.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Maybe he should prepare three.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Even that might not be sufficient.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, even though I say that, I’ll probably end up the same way at my graduation. I’ll cry along with him, and there are things that can only be said on that day.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Things that can only be said on that day?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“My brother may not say much, but because of our family situation, he gave up on his own education, prioritized part-time jobs even as a student, and worked hard for me… There’s no end to the list of things that makes him an amazing person.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even in difficult times, Haruto would cheerfully interact with her while hiding his feelings. If she seemed down, he would invite her to go out and show more consideration than usual. He even lied about preferring work over his studies to earn money for her.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno may scold or get angry with him, but deep down, she feels that she can’t compete with her brother. Although it was more than a year away, she had already decided to use the graduation ceremony to convey these feelings that had been accumulating over the years.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Ah, we’re starting to get off topic. How was onii-chan when you greeted him? Since it was the exam period, it’s been a while since you saw him, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well, yeah. I was nervous, but we talked a lot… It was really fun.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I see, I see.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She intentionally sent Suzuha alone for this reason, so that she could have some one-on-one time with Haruto.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“He praised you for the results, right? Since you worked so hard to be praised by him, you definitely told him about it, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uh! W-Well, um…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“He… He did praise me.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, that’s great.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno notices Suzuha blushing, using polite language, and nodding her head up and down. Unable to hold it in, she breaks into laughter.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Peeking from below, she could see Suzuha’s ears turning bright red.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, did he compliment your outfit?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Why are you asking about my outfit…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s because the usually modest Suzuha-chan is wearing a shorter skirt today, right? It’s obvious you chose it with onii-chan in mind.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“T-That’s… not true…? It was just particularly hot today…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Right…” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ugh…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Her voice becomes softer, and her face continues to redden.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In the first place, today’s temperature is a cool 22 degrees. It’s clear that Yuno hit the nail in the coffin.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“From the looks of it, he complimented that too, didn’t he?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well, um, he didn’t compliment my outfit, but he did say, ‘You look beautiful’. I-It’s embarrassing…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What the!? I didn’t think onii-chan would ever say something like that! Hehe, if that’s the case, then it was worth coming over today, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While nodding with a smile, Suzuha intertwines her fingertips and playfully wiggles them. It was a joyful reaction which only ever appears when Haruto is involved.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno, who knows about this side of her, smiles without saying anything else. She decided that it was best not to tease her any further.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Yuno-chan…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah? What’s up?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, it’s about Haruto onii-san… Was he not feeling well today?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh? There didn’t seem to be anything particularly different about him today. Why do you ask?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, you see, before I greeted him, Haruto onii-san was lying on the floor face-up…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh? On the floor, not on the sofa!?” (Yuno)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre2">“Yeah. He was just sprawled out on the floor…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s unusual for the clever Suzuha to show such expressions. Apparently, he was lying there like a dead fish.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Gimme a moment. Let me see if I can figure out what happened.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">If he collapsed on the floor, something significant must have occurred.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If Haruto’s health was bad, and he was enduring it, Yuno couldn’t just brush it off lightly. While emitting a serious aura, making her difficult to approach, Yuno starts pondering what could have happened.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Her expression quickly relaxed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s not because he’s unwell, so it’s okay. He probably rolled off while lazing on the sofa.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Maybe he hurt his back and couldn’t move…?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well, it’s onii-chan, so he’ll be fine.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno forces a wry smile.</p>



<p class="calibre2">What crosses her mind is the image of Haruto, hurt by insults like “stupid brother”.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She’s relieved that she sent the apology message before things got worse. Fearing that Suzuha might scold her if she found out, Yuno quickly changes the subject.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">*Ahem*</em> Well then, I’ll go to the living room and get cups and forks. We shouldn’t wait too long to eat the cake.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ll help too.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thank you. But let’s prioritize not getting caught by onii-chan, okay? If he finds us together in the living room, it might be hard to cover up.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-Yeah, you’re right. So, I’ll leave it to Yuno-chan…?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As Yuno rises and reaches for the doorknob, the phone in her pocket starts to vibrate.</p>



<p class="calibre2">…</p>



<p class="calibre2">While opening the door with her right hand and taking out her phone with her left, Yuno, after checking the notification, turns to Suzuha with a surprised yet triumphant grin.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Suzuha-chan, I just received a message from onii-chan. He said, ‘The outfit today really suited you!’ Apparently, he forgot to mention it when he greeted you.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“?!” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“He should have probably just said these things directly, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suzuha, upon hearing the message, tightens her lips, shaking her head left and right.</p>



<p class="calibre2">At first glance, it might seem like a denial, but in Suzuha’s case, it was just a sign that she was embarrassed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, Suzuha-chan, do you want to be alone with onii-chan…?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Wha-wha-wha…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suzuha stumbles over her words, her face turning bright red. However, given their friendship since elementary school, Yuno’s intentions are clear.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Why are you surprised? When you helped me with my studies during the exam period, I promised I would repay the favor, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Repaying the favor means fulfilling the other person’s wishes within reasonable limits.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s something the two of them often do.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Today is a great opportunity, and I thought that Suzuha-chan might not have had enough time to talk with Onii-chan. Of course, I’m sure this is what Onii-chan thinks too.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She doesn’t want to selfishly involve important family members, but this suggestion comes from knowing that both of them want to talk more to each other.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yuno-chan… is it really okay? I mean, if you leave Haruto onii-san and I alone, you’d be by yourself for a while…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’d actually prefer that.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“He gets so happy about it, you know? If he’s happy, then I’m happy too.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno chuckles softly.</p>



<p class="calibre2">That’s because she can imagine the delighted expression on Haruto’s face.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Some might think, “Why not the three of them play?” but even that would be troublesome for Yuno.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Especially since she finds it challenging to be completely honest in front of her brother.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“U-Um, then I’ll take you up on that… Thank you.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Sure thing.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uh, and also… I need some time to prepare my heart…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s okay. I can wait.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suzuha shows a relieved expression at those words.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, now that our little off-topic chat is over, I’ll go get the cups and forks first. Suzuha-chan, take your time.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“T-Thank you.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry about it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With that, Yuno stands up, heads to the hallway, and closes the door to her room on her way to the living room.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;And, she backpedals.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She quietly opens her room door just a few centimeters and peeks inside.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-12" class="calibre2">There stands Suzuha, covering her face with both hands, embodying the principle of “See no evil” from the three wise monkeys.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Being complimented on her outfit and the idea of being alone with Haruto seemed to bring her immense joy.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Hehe, you’re so easy to read.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">After completely closing the door, Yuno murmurs to herself and heads towards the living room.</p>
