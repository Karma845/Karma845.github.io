<h2>Epilogue: Stolen Heart</h2>

<p>In the end ── carrying Tsuyu on his back, by the time he walked her home, the sun had completely set.</p>
<p>But anyway, he made it to her house.</p>
<p>Tsuyu’s house, and also Himawari’s house ── the Shishido residence, where he had been several times before.</p>
<p>「With your permission.」</p>
<p>It seems that no other family members have returned home, and the lights are off.</p>
<p>After having Tsuyu unlock the door, Kamome enters the house, and carries her all the way to her room on the second floor.</p>
<p>「Fuu… Okay, we’ve arrived.」</p>
<p>「Thank you.」</p>
<p>He seats Tsuyu on the bed in her room, and Kamome takes a breather.</p>
<p>「You must be tired too, Kamome. Why don’t you sit down?」</p>
<p>With that, Tsuyu pats the space next to her on the bed.</p>
<p>「Ah, sure.」</p>
<p>Kamome sat down next to her, looking a little puzzled.</p>
<p>「…I brought you all the way here without stopping, but I really wonder if this was the right thing to do.」</p>
<p>Without confirming Tsuyu’s intentions, he had taken an action in a way that would have a significant impact on her life.</p>

<p>The realization of that fact makes Kamome feel uneasy.</p>
<p>「It’s fine. Don’t worry about it.」</p>
<p>Tsuyu says to Kamome.</p>
<p>While Kamone’s expression is clouded, her face ── since their time by the riverbank, had been nothing but bright.</p>
<p>「Kamome, you saved me. And also…」</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>Tsuyu took the hand of Kamome who was sitting next to her.</p>
<p>「When I ran hand in hand with Kamome… for the first time in a long time, I was able to run with all my might. Somehow, it felt good. Thank you, truly.」</p>
<p>「Tsuyu…」</p>
<p>Hearing Tsuyu’s words, Kamome felt reassured.</p>
<p>That his judgment was not wrong.</p>
<p>「Tsuyu. I’m sure there’s a possibility that you’ll be harassed or harmed by that person again in the future. If he does anything to you again, I want you to consult me anytime. I’ll protect you, Tsuyu.」</p>
<p>「…Yeah.」</p>
<p>…The two of them fall silent.</p>
<p>Inside the house filled with silence ── Tsuyu’s room filled with silence.</p>
<p>In an almost crushing silence, the two look at each other.</p>
<p>All they can hear is each other’s breath.</p>

<p>Kamome feels Tsuyu’s gaze, almost hotly.</p>
<p>Tsuyu places her hand on Kamome’s chest.</p>
<p>Just like that, she brings her face closer.</p>
<p>「…Tsuyu.」</p>
<p>Taking the hand that Tsuyu placed on his chest, Kamome says.</p>
<p>「…I saved Tsuyu because I wanted to. And I want to protect you from now on. I think of Tsuyu as someone important to me…」</p>
<p>His feelings of love for Tsuyu have not disappeared.</p>
<p>He understood that well.</p>
<p>But right now, he’s not qualified to clearly voice that.</p>
<p>「But we can’t go any further.」</p>
<p>Hearing those words, the heat disappeared from Tsuyu’s expression.</p>
<p>Her face becomes one of shock, as if she’d been pushed off a cliff.</p>
<p>「…Kamome, I…」</p>
<p>Tsuyu’s intent comes through.</p>
<p>Even Kamome, as insensitive as he can be, understands that from the heat emanating from her body, her expression, all of it, she is wanting Kamome.</p>
<p>「…Just for now is fine.」</p>
<p>Tsuyu pleads, as if clinging to Kamome.</p>

<p>「Please, just kiss me one more time.」</p>
<p>「…Sorry. I can’t… betray Himawari… I can’t betray her anymore.」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>In the dim light, Tsuyu looked down.</p>
<p>He can’t see what kind of expression she has on her face now.</p>
<p>It was at that time.</p>
<p>「I’m home.」</p>
<p>The sound of the front door opening.</p>
<p>And then, a voice like ringing bells resounded in the house.</p>
<p>「Huh? No one’s here?」</p>
<p>──It’s Himawari.</p>
<p>She has come home.</p>
<p>That’s right, he has to explain to Himawari.</p>
<p>Why he’s at home with Tsuyu.</p>
<p>Kamome stands up.</p>
<p>In an instant ── Tsuyu pulled Kamome’s arm as he was about to head towards Himawari.</p>
<p>She lies on Kamome, who falls on her back on her bed──</p>

<p>A kiss.</p>
<p>Her tongue slips in, invading his mouth.</p>
<p>The heat, the touch, the scent, the heartbeat, the emotions, everything about her is transmitted.</p>
<p>Their lips do not part.</p>
<p>Their saliva mixes together.</p>
<p>He is forced to swallow the sweet poison that has accumulated in his mouth.</p>
<div><img src="https://sinkuredtranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/knav1ilus9.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div><p></p>
<p>「Nee… Kamome.」</p>
<p>Tsuyu uttered with her lips still pressed to his.</p>
<p>Conversing while kissing.</p>
<p>Her voice, her breath, delivers a shock as if striking directly at his brain.</p>
<p>「If you tell me I haven’t changed since then, don’t you still love me?」</p>
<p>A sweet numbness shakes his brainstem.</p>
<p>「I love Kamome. I can’t hold back anymore.」</p>
<p>「Tsu, yu…」</p>
<p>「I love Kamome. I love Kamome. I love Kamome… Even though I should support your relationship with Himawari, I can’t do that anymore. What should I do? Kamome.」</p>
<p>Skin adheres to skin.</p>

<p>Body clings to body.</p>
<p>Breath melds together.</p>
<p>A voice echoes and resounds within his body.</p>
<p>「I don’t know what I should do. It’s absolutely wrong to steal you from Himawari… but I want to. Kamome, do you hate me like this?」</p>
<p>A painful voice.</p>
<p>Tears spilling from the corners of her eyes dampen Kamome’s cheeks as well.</p>
<p>With a love so heavy it hurts, Tsuyu asks.</p>
<p>「Do I have the right to be liked by Kamome, as I am now?」</p>
<p>『There’s no need for Tsuyu to force herself to change for the sake of those who torment you.』</p>
<p>『You just need to stick to what you have resolved to be.』</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Ahh, that’s right.</p>
<p>I remember.</p>
<p>I certainly told her that.</p>
<p>To the man who made her bear a desire she shouldn’t wish for, who tormented her.</p>
<p>Tsuyu is trying to follow through with what she has determined without bending herself.</p>
<p>Yes, this is all.</p>

<p>A curse I’ve placed on her.</p>
<p>From now on, Ooshima Kamome will come to realize.</p>
<p>What it means to “steal a heart”, and how much responsibility it entails.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Afterword</strong></p>
<p>Nice to meet you, or long time no see. My name is Kimura Kaito.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for picking up my work titled “My Girlfriend’s Older Sister… Is My First Love, Who Has Changed”.</p>
<p>In my previous work, “You Are the Daughter of My First Love”, I wrote an immoral yet pure love story about an adult male protagonist and a high school girl heroine.</p>
<p>In contrast, while this work also centers around the theme of pure love, its tone and style are distinctly different.</p>
<p>A story that begins with pure feelings and innocent thoughts, delving into obsession, ego, and a love that steals.</p>
<p>The protagonist, who is serious, straightforward, and strong in his sense of justice, gradually becomes consumed by lies and passion.</p>
<p>The heroine, who has lost everything, becomes dependent on the one who saved her, wanting to give all her love to him.</p>
<p>And the other heroine, who merely wanted a world filled with peace and security with her beloved boyfriend, is also forced to make an undeniable decision.</p>
<p>Still, it’s a story of struggling to move toward the best possible future.</p>
<p>I would be delighted if you could stay with me until the end.</p>
<p>The following are my words of gratitude.</p>
<p>To everyone at GA Bunko editorial department and the sales department, thank you always for your support.</p>
<p>To my editor M-san, thank you for all the support until now.</p>

<p>T-san, once again, I look forward to our continued relationship.</p>
<p>To Hamu-sensei, who adorned this work with superb illustrations.</p>
<p>To the proofreaders, the printing staff, and bookstores nationwide.</p>
<p>And above all, to all the readers who have read this work up to this point.</p>
<p>Really thank you very much.</p>
<p>Then, hoping for a day we can meet again.</p>
<p>Yoroshiku onegai itashimasu.</p>
