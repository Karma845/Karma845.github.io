<h2 style="text-align: center">Epilogue</h2>


<p>I have traversed this world from the moment of reincarnation into the world of erotic games until now, and no matter how much time passes, no matter how old I become, those days are ones I can never forget. </p>



<p>Facing Ayana, facing my mother, facing Seina-san, facing Shu… and not just them, but many others as well. Through various connections, these bonds have made me a resident of this world, and they made me want to live in this world.</p>



<p>“…There were truly so many things.”</p>



<p>Even considering my previous life, an intense high school life like this would be rare… No, I could say it’s an experience only I have had.</p>



<p>“But… high school life is almost over.”</p>



<p>It’s been quite a while since then… No, it’s been too long to even say that. When I realized I had been reincarnated, it was the beginning of my second year, and since then, I’ve become a third year… and graduation is just around the corner.</p>



<p>“Oh, right around here…”</p>



<p>I picked up an album placed on the bookshelf and opened it. I bought it before the summer vacation of my second year, wanting to preserve memories personally.</p>




<p>“…”</p>



<p>As I opened the album, memories from two years greeted me.</p>



<p>Of course, there were pictures of Ayana and other friends, as well as perfect pictures with the adults. Every time I see them, I vividly recall what happened then.</p>



<p>“Oh, this is the couple zone.”</p>



<p>On that page were photos of couples. Since then, relationships other than Ayana and me have developed well, and Shu is dating Iori, who has become a college student. Aisaka and Mari, whom I thought about, are also getting along well. Thinking about it, almost all of my acquaintances around me have overcome various things and met wonderful partners… Isn’t that amazing?</p>



<p>“Summer vacation was at the beach, winter vacation was skiing, and spring vacation… well, it was quite hectic in the third year.”</p>



<p>Yes, the third year… this year was really busy.</p>



<p>I became engrossed in looking at the album and didn’t notice the presence slowly approaching from behind.</p>



<p>“Who’s ~ there?”</p>




<p>I said that as someone blindfolded me from behind, but there was no way I wouldn’t know it was her.</p>



<p>“Ayana.”</p>



<p>“Correct♪”</p>



<p>Ayana peeked out with a smile from beside me.</p>



<p>I’ve grown taller and my face has become more mature, but Ayana has also grown in the same way.</p>



<p>She was already a beautiful girl, but the passage of this year has transformed Ayana into a stunning beauty… It might be an exaggeration, but Ayana has indeed become incredibly beautiful.</p>



<p>Her long, silky black hair remains the same, her face has matured even more, and her figure has grown… I heard recently that her chest has gotten a bit bigger again, and she complained that it’s hard to keep buying new underwear.</p>



<p>“What were you doing?”</p>



<p>“I was reminiscing about old memories.”</p>




<p>“Ah, the album!”</p>



<p>From there, Ayana and I looked at the album together.</p>

<p>“It was busy after becoming a third year, right? Being the student council president after Iori-senpai graduated was quite a burden.”</p>



<p>It became busy after becoming a third year… and the pinnacle of that was Ayana becoming the student council president after Iori.</p>



<p>Initially, Ayana had no intention of being the student council president at all, but with Iori’s request and my support, she took on the role.</p>



<p>“Even so, didn’t they say you worked even harder than expected, from both students and teachers?”</p>



<p>Iori was amazing, but Ayana was incredible in her own right. She had thick trust from the teachers, to the extent that she had some leeway to do as she pleased… That’s why, on Ayana’s initiative, I became the vice president of the student council.</p>



<p>“It’s because Towa-kun supported me as vice president.”</p>



<p>“…Well, I wanted to support you.”</p>




<p>“I knew that too. But it was good, right? The student council room was almost like our own private space, and we could do various things together, right, Towa-kun?!”</p>



<p>Guh! I couldn’t say anything in response to that!</p>



<p>As I blushed and remembered those times, Ayana chuckled softly and then exclaimed as she picked up a certain newspaper.</p>



<p>“It’s nostalgic, isn’t it? This newspaper from just before last summer vacation. Look, look, it says Towa-kun and I were voted Best Couple ♪!”</p>



<p>“Whaa!”</p>



<p>It was a newspaper issued by the newspaper club before summer vacation of our second year. At that time, the senior members of Bundou conducted interviews and rigorous evaluations for the school’s couple ranking, and Ayana and I were selected as the best couple.</p>



<p>“Back then, Bundou-senpai was amazing, wasn’t he?”</p>



<p>“That’s right. I think he was the one who was most delighted, even more so than us.”</p>



<p>Ignoring the parties involved, Bundou-senpai was really getting excited. Even though I thought it was too noisy, I couldn’t bring myself to tell him to stop, since he had pushed us so much.</p>




<p>The newspaper club was disbanded after Bundou-senpai graduated, so this was effectively the last couple ranking.</p>



<p>“There were really… a lot of things.”</p>



<p>“That’s right… but all of those are our memories.”</p>



<p>And so, we would create many new memories… I would need to buy a new album and make preparations.</p>



<p>“Aren’t you nervous, Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“Nervous?”</p>



<p>“We’ll be living together once we start university.”</p>



<p>“…Ah~”</p>



<p>With the start of university, Ayana and I were supposed to rent an apartment together. There were various things to consider financially, but my mother and Seina-san had made arrangements for us, and our cohabitation was settled.</p>




<p>Kanzaki-san also said she wanted us to rely on her if anything happened, so in a way, we were being protected by the strongest lineup.</p>



<p>“I’m a little nervous… but more than that, I’m looking forward to it. Because from now on, Ayana and I will be spending our time together for real.”</p>



<p>“I’m looking forward to it too! But I might have to come back frequently because Akemi-san and my mother will be lonely.”</p>



<p>“I understand how they feel. I’ll plan to check on them before they get too lonely.”</p>



<p>“Yeah♪”</p>



<p>However… even with the reason to attend university, it was still quite sad to leave the home I had been living in until now.</p>



<p>Ayana seemed to feel the same way, because of her reasons, my mother and Seina-san would leave her alone in the house.</p>



<p>[What are you thinking, kid?]</p>



<p>[Yes, enjoy your university life as much as you want.]</p>




<p>It was easy to imagine them saying that… but loneliness was loneliness.</p>



<p>After indulging in memories with the album and newspaper, Ayana and I bundled up in our coats and stepped outside. The snow had already melted, but it was still cold, with breaths turning white.</p>



<p>“We came out under this cold sky without thinking much about it…”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s a walk, a walk.”</p>



<p>To distract us from the cold, Ayana held onto my arm tightly.</p>



<p>We headed to a high hill overlooking the town… This place was famous as a dating spot and apparently a classic confession spot too.</p>



<p>Indeed, on a day like today, there’s no one else here besides us, which allows us to have this quiet, scenic spot all to ourselves.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, do you remember?”</p>



<p>“Is this about our college student marriage discussion?”</p>




<p>“Eh? How did you know!?”</p>



<p>“Oh, sorry… I didn’t expect to hit the mark.”</p>



<p>Honestly, I just blurted it out without much thought, but Ayana seemed quite excited, leaning her face closer to mine.</p>



<p>“As expected, Towa-kun is amazing! You know everything about me and understand everything I want to say!”</p>



<p>“Well, yeah!”</p>



<p>“Let’s get married soon! I love you so much!”</p>



<p>With that, she hugged me tightly, burying her face in my chest. I pondered what to do next.</p>



<p>(When… should I give it to her?)</p>



<p>It’s in my pocket, something I’ve been planning to give her in a reasonably romantic atmosphere.</p>




<p>…No, isn’t now the only time?</p>



<p>There might be a better opportunity, but it just came up in conversation.</p>



<p>“Anyway… let’s leave it at that for now. But, you remembered, huh?”</p>



<p>“Of course. I hardly forget anything about you.”</p>



<p>“Hardly… not everything, huh?”</p>



<p>“Sorry, I’m not that omnipotent.”</p>



<p>Laughing at that, Ayana moved away from me and started enjoying the scenery.</p>



<p>Continuing to gaze at her back… I gathered my courage and took a small box out of my pocket.</p>



<p>“Ayana…”</p>




<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>Ayana turned towards me, shifting her gaze from my face to my hand, and let out a surprised sound before looking back at me with wide eyes. Her surprised expression had a freshness I rarely saw.</p>



<p>Since I knew showing her this suddenly would surprise her, I decided to explain it step by step.</p>



<p>“You knew I was doing a part-time job with Kanzaki-san’s help, right?”</p>



<p>“Well… yes. But… huh?”</p>



<p>Yes, I consulted with Kanzaki-san and got introduced to a job. It wasn’t anything shady; it was a legitimate business from an acquaintance of Kanzaki-san.</p>



<p>It was quite tough, but facing what I wanted, this was an obstacle that I couldn’t resist… That was what I bought with the money I saved after a few months of work.</p>



<p>“By the way, Mom and Seina-san know. I haven’t told you, Ayana, so… I’d like you to forgive me.”</p>



<p>“Uh… Eh?”</p>




<p>Still in confusion, Ayana smiled wryly at me as I opened the box with a snap.</p>



<p>Inside was a ring──this was what I wanted to give Ayana… a gift to pledge our future together, because I want to spend more time with her.</p>



<p>“I want you to be by my side forever… Ayana, I love you with all my heart.”</p>



<p>“Ah… yes…!”</p>



<p>“Right now… it’s impossible to say that immediately, but let’s definitely get married.”</p>



<p>I… Even if I had memories of my past life, I think it’s a bit too mature no matter how much I love Ayana… but I can’t help it because I want to do this.</p>



<p>“What is your answer?”</p>



<p>Ayana, who was dumbfounded, said nothing, lowered her head, and shook her shoulders.</p>



<p>While wiping tears from her eyes with her hand, she lifted her face with a smile and nodded.</p>




<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>She was smiling despite her tears as she held out her hand to me, and I slowly put the ring on her finger.</p>



<p>Ayana was moved by the sparkle emanating from the ring, as if she had become a small child, shading her eyes while gazing at the sky.</p>



<p>“How happy are you trying to make me with this surprise…?”</p>



<p>“Well, I just wanted to do something like this.”</p>



<p>“Mou, come on… it’s too sudden. But I’m really, really happy… Am I allowed to be this happy?”</p>



<p>“What are you saying? We’re going to be even happier. Ayana, you and I are going to be so happy that others will be jealous.”</p>



<p>I meant every word of that.</p>



<p>We’re going to be even happier… even more, to the point where others will be envious. But it wouldn’t mean anything if Ayana wasn’t by my side. And it wouldn’t mean anything if I wasn’t by hers… Ayana, you said my love is heavy, but isn’t it heavy for me too?</p>




<p>“Can I ask you for a kiss, Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“Of course.”</p>



<p>I nodded in agreement with Ayana’s proposal, gently kissed her, while caressing the ring with great care.</p>



<p>(Really… we’ve come a long way.)</p>



<p>That’s not to say it was a bad thing; it was simply a reflection on how we’d managed to reach such an unexpected, perfect future.</p>



<p>Initially, it was… extremely difficult, and I had no idea how things would turn out.</p>



<p>Still, here I am, by the side of the person I love… I’ve managed to grasp this happiness.</p>



<p>“Ayana, I love you.”</p>



<p>“I love you too, Towa-kun.”</p>




<p>Our lives will continue from here, and there will surely be challenges ahead.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, there’s nothing we can’t overcome together… forever together, forever loving you.</p>



<p>That’s the future I’ve grasped… the ongoing story with Ayana.</p>



<p>I was reincarnated as a man who steals the heroine of an erotic game, but I will never steal her.</p>

<h2>Short Story: Future</h2>



<p>This is a story of a near future.</p>



<p>It’s a tale of a brilliant future where a man and a woman overcome the tragedy that was supposed to visit them, and pull forth the greatest future imaginable.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>It was during his second year of high school that Towa became aware of his reincarnation, and now several years have passed since then, making him a third-year university student.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, what are we going to do now?”</p>



<p>“Wanna go karaoke?”</p>



<p>“Sounds good~”</p>



<p>After finishing their classes for the day, other students engaged in such conversations. Despite the change in environment since high school, Towa’s natural brightness and consideration made him a reasonably popular male student within the university.</p>



<p>Well, it’s not just his good personality; his appearance is also outstanding, which led to him receiving several confessions.</p>




<p>“Oh, Yukishiro-kun! Are you leaving already?”</p>



<p>“Eh? Uh, yeah…”</p>



<p>Perhaps this is why he often gets approached like this. The girl who approached him with a smile had made advances on Towa several times before, earning her exasperated glances from those around her.</p>



<p>However, this was also a sort of tradition within their class.</p>



<p>Approached by the girl with a smiling face, Towa was suddenly interrupted by a “her” who was approaching the classroom entrance, showing a fierce anger.</p>



<p>“What are you doing, persistently like this?”</p>



<p>“Gulp!?!”</p>



<p>“Back again, Ayana?”</p>



<p>Yes, it was Ayana who had arrived.</p>




<p>Silent, and also soundless.</p>



<p>Leaving aside such a pointless pun, Ayana stood directly next to Towa.</p>



<p>Since high school… No, ever since Towa met her, she has been charming, and these past few years have only polished her beauty. After advancing to this university, she has always ranked first in the Miss Contest.</p>



<p>“It’s okay to invite Towa-kun, but if someone else is present, at least I would like you to respect my presence.”</p>



<p>With Ayana’s intimidating words, the girl’s expression turned sour.</p>



<p>Ayana smiled triumphantly, and with a proud smile, she pressed Towa’s arm against her chest, which had grown larger since high school.</p>



<p>“Let’s go, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>As if the previous exchange had never happened, Towa and Ayana left the university with a dignified air.</p>




<p>While Towa had a noticeable appearance, Ayana, who stood out even more, attracted many gazes—jealous glances towards Towa were abundant, but there was also no shortage of admiring looks towards Ayana.</p>



<p>“It’s been a while since I entered this university.”</p>



<p>“Fufu, that’s just what it means to stand out. Personally, it feels good to show off my relationship with Towa-kun!”</p>



<p>By showing off their relationship, not only did it serve as a deterrent to foolish people trying to intrude, but it also demonstrated to everyone that Ayana belonged only to Towa. It was killing two birds with one stone.</p>



<p>Well, even thinking about intervening between the two who were dating was an invitation to be kicked by a horse, but they both had the charm to make people think so.</p>



<p>(…In the world of cuckoldry games, there are good things to do and bad things to do.)</p>



<p>Sometimes, Towa almost forgot.</p>



<p>This world originally belonged to an NTR game, where he was the character meant to steal the heroine Ayana away from the protagonist.</p>



<p>(Since then, we’ve all been walking towards our own futures… me with Ayana here)</p>




<p>By the time he was a third-year university student, it was natural that he had already become an adult.</p>



<p>Including Shu, those he had met during high school regularly kept in touch, and they even met up at the Coming of Age Ceremony.</p>



<p>Every time they met, everyone looked happy and genuinely enjoyed their time with their partners… just like Towa and Ayana, if not more so.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, I… I’m so happy.”</p>



<p>“What’s gotten into you all of a sudden?”</p>



<p>“Fufu, I just felt like saying it. We’re lovers, so there’s no reason to keep quiet about how happy I am.”</p>



<p>“That’s true… Alright! Hey, Ayana, I’m really happy too. Stay with me forever.”</p>



<p>“Of course♪”</p>



<p>Ayana tightly embraced Towa’s arm with even more affection.</p>




<p>Although they had graduated from university, there were still many students heading home around them… all of whom, without exception, averted their eyes from Towa and the others.</p>



<p>Whether it was because they felt the intensely passionate atmosphere or simply couldn’t bear to look away in embarrassment… Of course, there were also those who continued to gaze at them enviously and with joy.</p>



<p>“Ayana, how about we go to that hill over there?”</p>



<p>“That sounds good.”</p>



<p>So they headed to the place with the best view around there.</p>



<p>Towa’s suggestion to come here wasn’t anything special—simply, he just wanted to spend a little more time with Ayana like this.</p>



<p>“From now on, forever… with you—”</p>



<p>“Let’s get married, Towa-kun. Right after we graduate… after all, you’ve already given me a ring!!”</p>



<p>Towa chuckled at Ayana’s slightly… well, okay, very eager words.</p>




<p>Getting married right after graduating from university—whether it was too soon or too late, many people were in favor of it.</p>



<p>Even their mothers, among others, had said they would provide maximum support no matter what.</p>



<p>For both Towa and Ayana, a future spent together forever was promised—grasping such happiness, the two of them continued to walk hand in hand into the future, harmoniously.</p>

<p>TL: Well folks, that’s it. It was a fun read while it lasted. Thanks for reading until the end and I hoped you enjoyed it as well. </p>
