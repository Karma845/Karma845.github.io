    </h1>

    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">The broadcast of the sixth episode of "Season of First Love" has generated an unprecedented enthusiastic response. Discussions online are incessant, and related messages with "#LoveSeason" dominate the trending topics on social media. Among all aired TV dramas, "Season of First Love" stands firmly at the top, captivating the streets and alleys.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">As expected, most voices shower praise on Rena's performance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"How can there be such an angel! She's too cute!""I always thought Rena-chan was the best among young actors, but this is on a different level!""Even as a girl, I can't help but have my heart race.""To be able to portray emotions to this extent.""I used to think romance wasn't her strong suit, but now, it's her expertise."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Browsing through the mountain of comments, I silently agree. Indeed, my suggestion was correct. Rena's everyday expressions, seemingly ordinary, possess a power capable of captivating the audience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Though I haven't watched the sixth episode due to embarrassment, judging by the reactions, I understand it has been a tremendous success. The next day's shoot was filled with joy among the staff, even Director Morita, who was unusually cheerful.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Achieving significant success in the work also means success in my career.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">However, a serious problem now looms before me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Since that day, Rena has been noticeably avoiding me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Of course, as co-stars, we meet every day for work, but our interactions have become minimal. Not only that, during breaks in shooting, Rena hasn't come backstage to hang out with me. The customary practice during lunch breaks has been rejected for various reasons—this situation has persisted for two weeks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">(It seems... I really made her angry, huh...)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Even though it was for the performance, taking away her lips during the improvisation was evidently a mistake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Yet, that kiss lingers in my mind, causing the guilt within me to continuously expand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Two weeks have passed since that day of shooting, yet the sensation of Rena's lips remains vivid in my memory. Whenever I meet Rena, my gaze involuntarily drifts towards her lips, and the soft, warm touch resurfaces in my mind, causing my heart to race. Because of this, I've been unable to speak to Rena.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">However, distancing myself from Rena like this is something I absolutely don't want.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">So, even though I'm unsure if an apology will lead to forgiveness, I've decided to convey my feelings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Determined, I caught up with Rena after the shoot. As we neared the backstage area, I called out to her from behind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"Rena!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Rena turned around in surprise, then awkwardly averted her gaze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"W-What's wrong?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"Um... lately, you've been avoiding me, haven't you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"Well, um..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"I don't mean to blame you. Instead, I'm here to apologize. What happened before, I'm really sorry!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">I bowed deeply, and after a moment, nervously lifted my head to find Rena looking at me with confusion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"Huh? W-Why are you apologizing?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"Because during the kissing scene, I didn't discuss it with you beforehand and did that during the improvisation... I thought you must be angry, so..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"W-What are you talking about! How could I be angry!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">To my surprise, Rena outright denied it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">However, she didn't look at me and continued, avoiding eye contact.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"I think Kaito-kun is an amazing actor. I didn't even know I had that potential. With the airing of the sixth episode and the high praise for my acting, it's all thanks to Kaito-kun. All I can say is thank you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"Uh, but..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">"Let's end the conversation here. I want to take a break. Excuse me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Until the end, Rena didn't meet my gaze. Her speech was rapid, clear, and without hesitation. After speaking, she turned and headed towards her own backstage. I had intended to catch up, but I heard the sound of the door locking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">(She says one thing, but she's still angry...)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">It seems this situation will continue for a while. Just thinking about it makes me feel uneasy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Wanting to be with Rena, having intimate conversations, going places together, visiting Rena's home... During these two weeks of distance from Rena, my mind is filled with these emotions. Whether asleep or awake, Rena's image remains inescapable...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">(Is this how it is... I really...)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">As an actor, I continually pursue and admire her; as a girl, she's the childhood friend I've always wanted to meet again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Meeting her again, I felt surprised by the contrast between her and the image in the media.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">She's an actress with outstanding talent, someone to admire, and at the same time, an extraordinarily cute girl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">I—I once again became aware of my feelings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4 c7">
      <span class="c0"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c22">
      <span class="c0">*</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4 c7">
      <span class="c0"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">I retreated into the backstage room and immediately locked the door, collapsing onto the ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">(I-I can't do it... I still can't see Kaito-kun's gaze...)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Just talking made my face slightly warm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Since that day, I've become strange.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Whenever I see Kaito-kun's face, I remember that kiss, and my heart can't stop pounding. So, for these two weeks, I've been avoiding Kaito-kun. If I wear the actress's mask, communicating with Kaito-kun at school and on set is not an issue. But having a private conversation, I just can't bring myself to do it...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">(But... What should I do, Kaito-kun? You wouldn't hate me, would you...?)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">My inner turmoil is filled with anxiety about this thought.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Avoiding Kaito-kun has always made me feel guilty, but I never expected Kaito-kun to think I was angry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Being unexpectedly kissed during the improvisation did startle me. After Director Morita explained Kaito-kun's intention behind the performance, I fully understood. How could I be angry at Kaito-kun's improvisation when we've sworn to make "Season of First Love" the best creation?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Despite wanting to clear up the misunderstanding, I don't feel like I can smoothly talk to Kaito-kun right now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">(Oh, Kaito-kun, you fool...)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">For me, Kaito-kun is my first love.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">However, childhood crushes can't last for eight years. When we met again in April, Kaito-kun was just the childhood friend I'd always wanted to see.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">In the past few months, I have been spending time with Kaito-kun every day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">I fell for him again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">His devoted efforts as an actor, in stark contrast to my carefree attitude, and his excellent acting that he put so much thought into.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">He treats me with the same kindness as always, constantly caring for me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">On the day of the first episode's airing, when Kaito-kun noticed the secret I had been hiding and allowed me to act cute towards him, just like eight years ago, I became acutely aware of my feelings. I realized I see Kaito-kun as someone of the opposite sex.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">I like Kaito-kun.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">But—my feelings, I probably haven't conveyed them to Kaito-kun at all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">(Kaito-kun, how do you see me...?)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Just thinking that on the other side of the door is the person I've been yearning for day and night, my cheeks heat up even more.</span>
    </p>
