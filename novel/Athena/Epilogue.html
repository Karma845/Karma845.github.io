<h2 style="text-align: center">Epilogue</h2>
<p>“Ah, there it is. They told me my piece would be displayed separately from the others, and it looks like they were right.”</p>
<p>At the end of summer vacation, in late August, I found myself in a large event hall in Tokyo.</p>
<p>“They said it was too intense for the general display.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It was the art competition organized by the government to find “Japan’s Best High School Artist,” the Shinsei Sansen Prize. We were at the exhibition of the winning works.</p>
<p>In the oil painting section, beyond the sign that read “Grand Prize,” there was a space partitioned off like a semi-private room.</p>
<p>“…But I really didn’t think I’d win again this year, not really.”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah, …that.”</p>
<p>The girl who had been silent the whole time finally spoke up next to me.</p>
<p>“C-Congratulations on…on winning the grand prize…”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, thanks. It’s all thanks to you, Suika.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s, um, I didn’t really, …I mean, it’s not like that, …you know, really, it’s not…”</p>
<p>She kept her head down, shaking it and her hands vigorously, and then finally stopped moving.</p>
<p>Then, cautiously, she looked up at my face.</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>In that instant, her face turned bright red.</p>
<p>“Still too much?”</p>
<p>“I-I’m so sorry…!”</p>
<p>Again, she looked down, her ears as red as her face, repeatedly saying, “I’m so sorry…!”</p>
<p>…It’s been more than a month since that day on the rooftop when we were both covered in blood. We went to the hospital together to get treated for our injuries.</p>
<p>I no longer feel cold towards the color red, and Suika has stopped hiding her color.</p>
<p>When I concentrate and “see” her, the mist that appears is a very deep red… She says it’s not so much that she isn’t hiding it anymore, but that she can’t.</p>
<p>Ever since it all came out, she can’t look me in the eye properly, stutters during conversations, always fidgety, and her face turns red at the slightest thing.</p>
<p>Even without using my eyes, it’s clear; these are all signs of deep affection.</p>
<p>This is the first time we’ve gone out together since that day, and, as expected, we couldn’t have a normal conversation.</p>
<p>She’s always hidden her feelings, and now that they’re out in the open, she’s too embarrassed to talk properly.</p>
<p>“For now, let’s go see the painting exhibition.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes…”</p>
<p>As we were about to enter the partitioned-off area, a boy rushed out quickly, followed by a woman who seemed to be his mother.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? It’s the grand prize-winning painting, don’t you want to look more?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see it! Let’s go, Mom! …I don’t want to see that painting. It’s scary…”</p>
<p>“…Is that so? …Okay, then.”</p>
<p>“Let’s see the other paintings, come on!”</p>
<p>The boy took his mother’s hand and pulled her away.</p>
<p>…Sorry about that. I apologize to him in my heart.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s scary, isn’t it?</p>
<p>“…Kuuya.”</p>
<p>I feel a tug on my clothes. Suika, with her face still bright red, grabs my sleeve, looking concerned yet affectionate.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I painted that painting.”</p>
<p>Together with Suika, I step into the exhibition area.</p>
<p>There are many people there, all looking at one painting—my painting. Their expressions vary, but they all share a common thread: none of them look relieved or comforted.</p>
<p>Some have their faces tensed, hands trembling, or look like they’re about to cry.</p>
<p>It’s a strange atmosphere.</p>
<p>“…It’s a selfish painting.”</p>
<p>“…Kuuya.”</p>
<p>“I painted this for myself. It’s pure egoism. I did whatever I wanted.”</p>
<p>Flames and shadows. If I were to describe the shape of this painting, that would be the most fitting. The deeply, vividly burning flames and the contrasting dark, dense shadows they create.</p>
<p>The painting, rich in the color red, was completed in about three days. I had to heal the injury on my right hand, which took time away from the competition deadline. I worked at a frantic pace, like I was preparing for an art school entrance exam.</p>
<p>Effective composition, desired techniques, a theme to convey.</p>
<p>For someone else, that is.</p>
<p>I didn’t consider any of that. I didn’t have the time, nor did I intend to. I just wielded the brush as I pleased, painting what I wanted.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I look away from the painting and stare intently at my right hand. A faint scar remains.</p>
<p>This will probably be my lifelong talisman.</p>
<p>“…Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all. …What about you, Suika? Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m perfectly fine! I’m a woman of Ado, after all!”</p>
<p>Suika shows me her right palm. No matter how closely I look, there’s not even a trace of a scar.</p>
<p>Regarding that injury, I had no choice but to profusely apologize to Suika and her family, but none of them blamed me. …Suika’s grandmother, Kinue-san, said, “A scar from a blade is Ado’s honor,” and Aunt Ran laughed, saying, “It’s just a scratch unless you lose a finger.”</p>
<p>…Her wounds healed at least three times faster than mine.</p>
<p>Still, causing her pain and inconvenience until the wound healed is a fact, and I’ve decided I’ll never forget this gratitude for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>“…Excuse me! I overheard your conversation just now…”</p>
<p>A voice, hesitant and yet filled with strong emotion, suddenly spoke to us. When I looked up, I saw a young woman I didn’t recognize.</p>
<p>“Did you paint that painting?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that was me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The woman in front of me clenched her eyes tightly, took a deep breath, and took my hand. Then, she said firmly, “Thank you so much…!”</p>
<p>“…Eh?”</p>
<p>“I can’t really explain it well, but…thank you! For painting that and showing it to me. …Ah, I know it’s not a painting for me, of course, but still.”</p>
<p>The woman paused, took another breath, and I could see her throat trembling.</p>
<p>“I’m glad I could see that painting. I’m glad I came here today, by chance, to…I’m glad I could encounter that painting today. Thank you, thank you so much.”</p>
<p>She bowed her head, holding my hand tightly with her trembling ones, repeatedly thanking me.</p>
<p>“…Thank you, too.”</p>
<p>That was all I could respond with. Anything else felt like it would be a lie, but I wanted to convey at least that much.</p>
<p>“…I’m so sorry for suddenly, really, aaaah! In front of your girlfriend, even! I’m sorry!”</p>
<p>As the woman finally looked up, realizing her haste, she quickly let go of my hand.</p>
<p>Before I could reply, Suika spoke up.</p>
<p>“No, I’m not…his girlfriend.”</p>
<p>“Oh, is that so…?”</p>
<p>“Yes. …I…wish I could be, a childhood friend.”</p>
<p>Hearing Suika’s words, the woman seemed taken aback for a moment before smiling kindly and saying, “I’m sorry for interrupting, I’m rooting for you!” before leaving.</p>
<p>“…Suika, I…huh?”</p>
<p>Suika silently took my hand, the one the woman had just held. It’s probably the first time we’ve touched since that day.</p>
<p>She led me away from my painting’s exhibition area to a place that looked like a rest area.</p>
<p>“Suika,”</p>
<p>“Kuuya, …I understand if you’re not ready for romance yet.”</p>
<p>Suika held my hand but turned her back to me.</p>
<p>“…Sorry.”</p>
<p>I no longer find the color red empty. I can feel its warmth and brilliance. I think I’ve managed to overcome my fundamental fear of love.</p>
<p>But the idea of falling in love with someone right now…seems difficult. I still need time to feel the ground I’ve finally managed to solidify under my feet.</p>
<p>I understand Suika’s feelings, but that’s precisely why I don’t want to respond in this state.</p>
<p>“But, you know, …I will definitely…make you like me one day…! …I may not be the most straightforward woman, sorry about that…Even just now!”</p>
<p>“Just now?”</p>
<p>“When that woman came to thank you for your painting…while I was grateful…your hand! She held your hand! You and…another woman…”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah…”</p>
<p>“…It was very unsettling for me! …Shameful, shallow…”</p>
<p>After finally turning to face me, Suika’s eyes were moist and trembling with emotion.</p>
<p>Not just a childhood friend who has always been by my side but a girl with profound and sincere feelings stood before me.</p>
<p>We couldn’t even look at each other for a second before Suika looked down, letting go of my hand.</p>
<p>“I held your hand…Aaaahhhh…”</p>
<p>Today, Suika’s ears turned the reddest they had all day.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, seeing another woman hold your hand…I couldn’t control myself…Uuuuu, it’s disgraceful…shallow…”</p>
<p>Even though she had already done something much more significant that day, Suika whispered such things in a soft voice.</p>
<p>“That’s right, she’s too jealous and possessive. You’re better off without such a woman.”</p>
<p>Wasn’t that the best move?</p>
<p>Those words came unexpectedly from the side. Surprised, Suika and I turned our gaze to see a beautiful woman who made every other painting in the exhibition seem dull in comparison.</p>
<p>“Kujou-san…!”</p>
<p>Kujou Kurenai. My classmate.</p>
<p>“…Where did you come from!”</p>
<p>With an overtly wary voice, Suika questioned, and Kujou-san answered with a refreshing tone.</p>
<p>“By chance, just happened to be here.”</p>
<p>“That can’t be…! …Kujou-senpai.”</p>
<p>Suika’s voice cooled down, but she put on a smile.</p>
<p>“We came here together. Could you please not interfere?”</p>
<p>“Just friends, right? Not lovers. You just said so yourself.”</p>
<p>“When have you been following us,”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how long you plan to keep this up, but”</p>
<p>Cutting off Suika’s words, Kujou-san continued with a strong voice.</p>
<p>“If things are still unresolved, then my best move is, of course, clear. …Once, how much…”</p>
<p>I couldn’t catch what followed; it was too soft.</p>
<p>Sighing, Kujou-san turned her gaze to me.</p>
<p>“Miyashiro-kun. …Will you ‘see’ me?”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>
<p>Asked, I concentrated. The mist that appeared from Kujou-san was the same color as her name.</p>
<p>…In the end, whether this is right, I don’t know. With my misunderstanding about Suika now clear, my confidence is even more shaken.</p>
<p>“Are you curious? If it’s correct?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>As if reading my thoughts, she asked.</p>
<p>I nodded, and she smiled.</p>
<p>…It was time for the answer reveal.</p>
<p>“Hey, Miyashiro-kun.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What I feel about you——”</p>
