<h1 class="calibre1">Epilogue</h1><p class="calibre2">On a certain holiday at 11 a.m.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Nice, Ayachi! That cover was amazing!!” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You too, Rina-san~!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ayaya, aka Aya, just finished playing a round of ABEX with Rina, another member of the professional gaming team, Axcis Crown.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Returning to the home screen, the two professionals continued their friendly conversation as usual.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, well, now that we’ve finished our practice, shall we do the simultaneous live stream as planned? It’s a holiday, so a lot of people will come and watch, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah! I’m looking forward to it!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Me too!” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With an elegant face and excellent communication skills, Rina, who is also a streamer, is a 22-year-old with an impressive 600,000 channel subscribers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">There are likely very few ABEX players who haven’t heard of her. She’s often referred to as the “Gal who is kind to otaku”.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Today, Aya had a collaboration stream planned with Rina.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, right! Before we start, congratulations on reaching 400,000 subscribers, Ayachi. Your growth has been impressive lately!” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thank you! It was a bit stagnant until recently, but collaborating with Oni-chan really helped a lot!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, Oni-chan the siscon! His popularity is seriously crazy. He’s trending on Twitto every time, and his number of subscribers is increasing rapidly.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah! I think he’s currently the most popular ABEX streamer as of right now!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, that streaming incident had quite an impact. The character breakdown is also quite interesting.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Seated in her gaming chair, Rina crosses her legs, laughing softly as she shakes her golden hair.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Then, she throws these words at Aya, who has a connection with him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Seriously, Oni-chan is so smart. His response after the streaming incident is a perfect 100, and the way he added fuel to the fire was quite skillful.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, skillful…?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh? Didn’t Oni-chan plan out the entire thing that led to the incident?&nbsp; He had already decided that he would give up on his toxic persona from the beginning and introduce a different side to him.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, that’s not it.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh? Then, wasn’t everything he did after the incident intentionally done so that he could move on from his toxic persona?!” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, I don’t mean to say anything bad, but Oni-chan is really unique, so the result of working hard to return to the status quo was perceived like that.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Wait. So, he wasn’t clever and didn’t plan anything from the start? All this time, he was just continuously self-destructing?” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s right!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, um… What a total mess.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Rina, who had thought of Oni-chan as a calculating and intelligent streamer, couldn’t help but express her honest thoughts with raised eyebrows.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If that’s the case, it must have been even more tough for him… To continue his toxic persona despite being so clumsy.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“His dedication is real, he writes scripts for provoking others and probably does image training too.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“People who put in extraordinary effort behind the scenes that no one knows about. Without something like that, it’s tough to get your channel going.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, that’s true.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Neither of them initially belonged to a professional gaming team.</p>



<p class="calibre2">They started as independent streamers until they gained a certain number of channel subscribers and were eventually invited to join the team.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Having gone through the channel recognition process, they can understand the effort that goes into it.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oni-chan is truly an amazing person. He works harder than anyone to save up for his sister’s education.&nbsp; Besides streaming, he also has a lot of other duties…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya, who attends university while earning education and living expenses through streaming, understands this well. Oni-chan, who is supporting not only himself but also his family in a similar situation, is doing something truly remarkable.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Indeed, being able to work so hard for the sake of family is incredibly admirable. He’s got a really cool personality.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“This is a secret, but Oni-chan is also handsome. At least in my opinion, he’s the best in that regard!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I can’t believe the Ayachi, who is popular at offline meetings, is saying such a thing…” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Also, his smile is wonderful! He’s super kind! And not only that&mdash;” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">When it comes to someone you care about, you can’t help but want to brag.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As these feelings come to the surface, Aya becomes more talkative.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh? Ayachi, are you dating Oni-chan?” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Why would you think that!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, you look so happy when you talk about him, you praise him a lot, your energy changes whenever you talk about him, and if you met him before, it’s natural to assume so.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s not it! We met by accident!!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, the more Aya tries to explain, the more credibility she loses.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In Rina’s mind, it’s pretty much already confirmed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry, Ayachi. Even though I have this flashy appearance, I’m really good at keeping secrets. Besides, there’s no rule against dating in our team. At your age, you should enjoy having ‘fun’ with your boyfriend.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Wha…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">An unexpected word. And a lack of resistance to explicit jokes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya, who has never engaged in such things, turns bright red and stumbles over her words.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Could it be that the main reason you moved here was to meet Oni-chan in real life and have some ‘fun’?” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well! I-I came here for university, you know!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, sure, sure.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">M-Mouu</em>! You’re totally misunderstanding…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s unavoidable that a misunderstanding arises from accidentally hitting on the worst possible topic at the worst possible time.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Realizing that nothing she says will be believed in this atmosphere, Aya decides to use her ultimate technique.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-If you tell anyone about this… I’ll tell everyone Rina-san’s secret.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I know. But anyways, I’m starting to get curious about Oni-chan. So, let’s do a collaboration stream with the three of us next time.” (Rina)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-No!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya’s resolute refusal echoed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“H-Ha… Achoo!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">At the same time, Haruto sneezes on the sofa, and Yuno approaches from behind.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Onii-chan, do you have a cold?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, it just came out of nowhere.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Then someone must be spreading rumors about onii-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, if that’s the case, they’re definitely saying something bad.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t push yourself too hard.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Facing Yuno, who placed her hands on her hips and squinted her eyes, Haruto shook his head.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s all part of my plan. I’ll work hard to become more famous.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You’re a reliable onii-chan. Good boy, good boy.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Yuu? Isn’t it a bit weird to pat the head of your 20-year-old brother?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Looking up, their eyes met.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, what do you want for dinner today? I’ll make whatever you want.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Really!? Well, it might take some effort, but… I want hamburgers. Hamburgers with melted cheese.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Got it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I want to help.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Then, onii-chan’s job will be kneading the mixture.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I want to do the grilling.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, onii-chan well definitely burn them. Just knead the mixture.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-Yes…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The man who surpassed 200,000 subscribers on his channel today is, as always, no match for his sister.</p>
