<p>“──Hey, Arakawa, have you heard of ‘Mashima of Higashi Middle School’?&#8221;</p>
<p>The long rainy season in Kamimura ended, and it was a sweltering lunch break.</p>
<p>Tatsuki Iwasawa, the disciplinary committee member with adhesive bandages all over his face, casually spoke.</p>
<p>In his hand, of course, was his favorite carton of protein juice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Mashima of Higashi? What&#8217;s that? Something about Kengo?&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The one asking was Kawariku Arakawa, the disciplinary committee member who was having lunch with him, leaning against a desk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His face also had several bandages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Never heard.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Arakawa replied, Iwasawa, while sipping on the straw stuck in the carton, said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently, Mashima-kun was a troublesome delinquent in middle school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arakawa, after a few seconds of freezing, eventually started shaking his shoulders and burst into laughter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;──Ahahahahahahaha!! What&#8217;s that? That&#8217;s so funny───!&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Laughing loudly enough to make everyone in the class turn around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Why is your voice so loud, idiot&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H-hey! W-why can&#8217;t we ever hear such interesting things!? Even though we&#8217;re always with Kengo!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Actually, this rumor has been around for a while, and I&#8217;ve heard it often. According to what I&#8217;ve heard, Miyanoshita was put down in middle and high school&#8230;Maybe it&#8217;s because of that incident, he tried hard to spread the rumor in various places&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O-oh.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Iwasawa made a serious expression, and Arakawa swallowed his saliva.</p>
<p>And then&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;In the end, everyone just laughed, and it didn&#8217;t really spread. The rumor mostly stopped among people who don&#8217;t know much about Mashima.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;.….. I totally get that.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arakawa nodded vigorously to Iwasawa&#8217;s words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, rumors and Kengo don&#8217;t mix well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True, all that fuss about the rumor disappeared in less than 75 days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, there&#8217;s no one more straightforward than him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The two, covered in bandages, nodded at each other, and unexpectedly close friends at the same time realized something.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;But, that rumor was true, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; I wonder where it leaked from&#8230; Iwasawa, did you tell someone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t! I didn&#8217;t tell anyone, so don&#8217;t get ready to fight! I&#8217;ve run out of bandages to buy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s not Iwasawa, then&#8230; who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe no one? Perhaps, we just didn&#8217;t understand because we&#8217;ve been too close to Mashima-kun. It might be more obvious from an outsider&#8217;s perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They casually ended the conversation and looked out the window.</p>
<p>Cumulus clouds floating in the clear blue sky looked down on them.</p>
<p>While looking at the thin contrail extending from the cumulus clouds, Iwasawa muttered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Mashima-kun seems to like Takane-san&#8230; or so I&#8217;ve heard.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nextPage">■ Chapter: Kengo Mashima ■</h3>

<p>Summer arrived in Kamimura City, even though it was a snowy region.</p>
<p>Trees flourished, and the chorus of cicadas reached its peak, and the seasonal limited-edition Maritozzo disappeared from the store shelves.</p>
<p>Recently, something called &#8220;Canelé”, a sweet resembling fried manju, seems to be popular.</p>
<p>Fried manju is perfect as a tea accompaniment, so Canelé is probably the same.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to try it someday. I looked down at the schoolyard from the landing, contemplating.</p>
<p>This place is dimly lit, smells musty, and is generally not suitable for meals&#8230; but it&#8217;s quiet.</p>
<p>The quietness lets me feel the changing seasons.</p>
<p>&#8230;When was it that I said something like that?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Mashima-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Wh-what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Please say something.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Saki Takane, sitting next to me, said that while taking a bite of her pineapple fruit sandwich.</p>
<p>Even if she asks me to say something&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;To-to&#8230; today we replaced the bulletin boards as part of the Discipline Committee&#8217;s activities. We&#8217;ll probably continue after school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Next week is the sports festival.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;And the week after that, well, it&#8217;s summer vacation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;! Yes! So&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; even though it&#8217;s summer vacation, we must not forget the duties of students and behave with decorum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haaah─────&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Takane Saki let out a deep, deep sigh, as if she were about to fall to the first floor.</p>
<p>…It seems like I&#8217;ve made another mistake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;As Kaoru-san said, really&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having finished eating the fruit sandwich, Takane Saki patted her hands and handed me a book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mashima-kun, I&#8217;ll give you this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What is this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read this and learn about how to talk with girls. It&#8217;s your homework.&#8221;</p>

<p>Concerned about that girl? To you who is interested in a girl&#8230;</p>
<p>…….</p>
<p>Interested in a girl, to you&#8230;?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;? Is there something wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is it really okay for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230; I can&#8217;t say clever things, and I&#8217;m a boring person&#8230; I just ate Maritozzo for the first time the other day, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haaah─────&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second time.</p>
<p>For the second time. Takane Saki stood up from and muttered softly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;There&#8217;s no one as interesting as you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing! Come on! I&#8217;ll show you how it&#8217;s done, so stand up!&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Takane Saki is unusually forceful today&#8230;?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Normally we would go downstairs, but&#8230;</p>
<p>For some reason, Takane Saki was slowly climbing the stairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Takane Saki, where are you going? The door to the rooftop is locked, and there&#8217;s nothing there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Do you know about this rumor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rumor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rumor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Takane Saki, in front of the thick door leading to the rooftop, stopped.</p>
<p>And then, she began to speak slowly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The rooftop door of Kamimura High School, it&#8217;s locked──&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a strange sound of clattering coming from Takane Saki&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? What is she doing?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;──But due to being neglected for many years, the lock has rusted and become unusable── that&#8217;s the rumor.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Clank! A particularly loud sound echoed.</p>
<p>In the next moment, we were enveloped in blinding light, and a strong wind blew through.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, &#8230; as long as you don&#8217;t get caught, it&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…This is.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The door leading to the rooftop was open.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the clear blue sky, pure white cumulus clouds, houses, hospitals, stations, supermarkets, &#8220;Leo”, the middle school we attended,</p>
<p>And beyond that──the Sea of Japan spread endlessly.</p>
<p>From the rooftop of Kamimura High School, you could see everything in Kamimura at a glance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Such a scene was spreading right behind that dim and musty place where we always had lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The overwhelming beauty of that scene, illuminated by the intense sunlight, left me speechless.</p>
<p>And as Takane Saki and I gazed at this scene together, she muttered softly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;I used to hate Kamimura. It was suffocating, cramped, and I always remembered unpleasant things wherever I went. &#8230;But, from now on…&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Saying that, Takane Saki looks at me.</p>
<p>She smiles like a midsummer sunflower and says,</p>
<p>“──It seems like little by little, it will become all about good memories.”</p>

<p>&#8230;That smile is unfair.</p>
<p>Seemingly embarrassed halfway through, Takane Saki returned her gaze forward again…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Y-Yes! With that in mind, is there anything you need to tell me!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking up at the clear blue sky, I began to speak slowly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;The other day, for the first time in my life, I bought something other than plain Manjū. It was the La France one&#8230; surprisingly, it wasn&#8217;t bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Commercial TV can be a change of pace sometimes&#8230; I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What I&#8217;m trying to say is&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely, if it weren&#8217;t for you, I would never have seen this scenery in my entire life. I&#8217;m really grateful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>“──But a violation is a violation.”</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You intentionally trespassed onto the rooftop, which is prohibited by the school rules. Moreover, you did it in front of me, the Discipline Committee President!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, w-wait, hold on&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shared responsibility. Class 2-B, Takane Saki, and Kengo Mashima, report voluntarily to the homeroom teacher and submit a specified number of reflection essays. Also, report to the student council that the rooftop lock is broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Eeeeeeeehhhhhh──────────!?!?!?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, let&#8217;s go to the beach during the summer vacation&#8230; after all, we&#8217;re dating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;………Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Takane Saki let out a dumbfounded voice, but I&#8230; couldn&#8217;t look at Takane Saki&#8217;s face anymore. Blatantly turning my face away, she faced the back of my head.</p>
<p>&#8230;My face is hot.</p>
<p>&#8230;It feels like it&#8217;s flushed all the way to my ears.</p>
<p>&#8230;Wait?</p>
<p>&#8230;To my ears?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>──Look at what kind of face Saki Saki is making behind me, and you&#8217;ll probably understand everything.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8230;Ah.</p>
<p>&#8230;Senami Yuka&#8217;s words at that time&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Were about that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, Mashima-kun, could you turn this way for a moment?&#8221;</p>
<p>“──I refuse!”</p>
