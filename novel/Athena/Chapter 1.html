<h2>Chapter 1: Future Bride</h2>



<p>When I arrived in front of the house, I was a little surprised.</p>
<p>A familiar moped was parked in front of our house.</p>
<p>This license plate bike is…</p>

<p>“Son of a motorcycle shop, you’re back now?”</p>

<p>From the front entrance of my home, a middle-aged man in a chef’s outfit came out.</p>
<p>He’s the head of Sushimaru, the sushi restaurant located in the shopping district.</p>

<p>“…You’re doing maintenance on your bike at my home?”</p>

<p>Though I thought it might be different, those were the words that came out.</p>

<p>“No, it’s a sushi delivery. Or rather, Hakuba, did something good happen? For the Ouji family to order the highest-grade sushi…as far as I know, this is the first time!”</p>

<p>He’s a very rude old man, but he’s right to be surprised.</p>
<p>If my memory is correct, I don’t recall ordering anything higher than the regular grade, let alone the highest grade.</p>

<p>“Who would have thought that I’d get three ‘Yukichi’ notes from the Ouji house? Could tomorrow be the day when octopuses rain down from the sky?”</p>
<p>(TN: ‘Yukichi’ refers to the ¥10,000 bill in Japan, which features the portrait of Yukichi Fukuzawa. )</p>

<p>I know he’s being disrespectful, but I can understand that sentiment.</p>
<p>Octopuses will likely fall from the sky tomorrow. That’s just how unimaginable this is for our family.</p>

<p>“Oh well, no time to dilly-dally. The next delivery is waiting. Alright then, take care, Hakuba!”</p>

<p>The head chef waved his hand lightly at me and headed towards the next delivery location.</p>

<p>“Could it be that Old woman’s prediction is coming true…?”</p>

<p>I’m about to have the highest-grade sushi.</p>
<p>Normally, I’d be ecstatic and call Kanako to brag, but right now, I can’t genuinely enjoy it.</p>
<p>For now, let’s go inside the house. I opened the front door and entered.</p>

<p>“Hmm? Is someone else here?”</p>

<p>Why did I come to that conclusion? The answer is simple,</p>

<p>“Ah~~ I’m so lucky to have such a cute girl pouring me drinks. I’m really happy right now!”</p>
<p>“Come on, don’t be shy, eat as much as you want.”</p>

<p>The cheerful voices of my parents echoed from the living room on the first floor.</p>
<p>It seems that someone, a guest perhaps, has come to the house. As evidence, there was a pair of shoes I’d never seen before.</p>
<p>Indeed, shoes that didn’t quite match the entrance of our house were neatly placed there.</p>
<p>Even though I thought it was impolite, I couldn’t help but be drawn to these shoes, lifting them up to my eye level.</p>

<p>“…What’s this? They’re incredibly flashy.”</p>

<p>Rather than flashy, the term ‘fancy’ would be more fitting.</p>
<p>It’s like the white heels a Western princess from a fairy tale would wear.</p>
<p>I wonder Where did I meet the owner of such shoes?</p>
<p>At least, they’re not in my memory. My curiosity was thoroughly piqued.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I scattered my loafers, headed straight for the living room, turned the doorknob, and stepped into the place where cheerful conversations were flying around.</p>

<p>——To my surprise, there was a girl I knew very well in the living room.</p>
<p>That girl greeted me with a smile and said, ‘Welcome back.’</p>

<p>I first doubted my own eyes. Then I doubted my own head.</p>
<p>I rubbed my own eyes and smacked my own head.</p>

<p>That’s how unimaginable the scene was: an unbelievable person sitting on a chair in the living room.</p>
<p>And then, I looked at her again——</p>

<p>“Welcome back.”</p>

<p>She waved her hand cutely at me and greeted me again with another smile.</p>
<p>I don’t know what’s going on, but she’s really cute…</p>

<p>Well, whatever, my eyes and head seem fine.</p>
<p>If my body is okay, then this situation is unmistakably real..it’s an unbelievable reality.</p>
<p>In the living room, a scruffy-looking middle-aged man and a baby-faced woman are devouring the top-grade sushi placed in the middle of the table.</p>
<p>Well, these two silly people are my parents, so there’s no issue whatsoever, and it doesn’t matter right now.</p>
<p>The problem is the woman sitting across from them.</p>

<p>Why is she here in my house? She just rejected me today!</p>
<p>She’s staring at me intently now, giving me a cheerful smile.</p>

<p>What’s happening? Why is Touka Himegi in my house???</p>
<p>No, the problem isn’t just that she’s in my house.</p>
<p>What’s with her outfit? Why is Himegi-san dressed in a wedding gown?</p>

<p>Yes, her appearance unmistakably resembles that of a bride. Pure white, a sparkling snow-white dress.</p>
<p>As far as I know, a wedding gown is not the kind of casual wear you put on at home.</p>

<p>…No, a wedding gown is meant to be worn for a wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>I see, the owner of the heels at the entrance must be Himegi-san’s…</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by this situation, I blinked my eyes and stood dumbfounded.</p>
<p>I tried to stay composed, but I couldn’t help it—this scene seemed like a dream.</p>

<p>“Ah, uhh?”</p>

<p>Like a puppet with its strings cut, I plopped down onto the floor with a thud.</p>
<p>I had what one would call a ‘my legs gave out’ moment.</p>

<p>“——Huh? H-Ha-kun, a-are you okay?”</p>

<p>Touka Himegi, dressed in a wedding gown, looked surprised as she saw me collapse.</p>
<p>Then she stood up from her chair and rushed over to where I was.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, I raised my finger and pointed at her face. And then——</p>

<p>“Hawawawa——” then I let out a silly-sounding voice.</p>

<p>Beep- beep- beep-</p>
<p>At the same time, an alarm rang out from my pants pocket.</p>

<p>It was the alarm I had set an hour and five minutes ago. It seemed to me as if that sound were representing my current situation.</p>
<p>Either way, that prediction had undoubtedly hit the mark.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, just as that Old woman had said, an hour and eight minutes later, I’ll momentarily speechless and let out a foolish voice.</p>

<p>I regretted it very much. I should have asked the Old woman to tell me the future developments.</p>
<p>To lose my balance and fall on my back in front of someone I like…I am truly a pathetic guy.</p>

<p>…Ahh, if only I could go back, I wish I could return to five minutes ago——</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Ha-kun, have you calmed down a little?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Heyy Ha-kun, can you hear me?”</p>

<p>I managed to sit down on an empty chair under my own power after regaining my composure.</p>
<p>I appreciated her concern, but unfortunately, there was no way I could calm down.</p>
<p>I tried my best to sort out the situation, but I ended up even more confused.</p>

<p>Sitting next to me, Touka Himegi peered at me with a worried expression on her face.</p>

<p>“I understand that you’re confused, but I think you’ll be somewhat convinced if you listen to what I have to say.”</p>
<p>“…Convinced?”</p>

<p>There are a mountain of things I’m curious about. Will she explain all of them from now on?</p>
<p>I repeatedly confirmed her appearance from head to toe. Just as I thought, it’s a wedding dress, right?</p>
<p>To me, it unmistakably looks like a wedding dress.</p>

<p>Since her shoulders and back are exposed, I can clearly see her beautiful collarbone and graceful neck.</p>
<p>Also, her chest is very large, as I thought. Even when she was wearing a school uniform, she couldn’t hide it.</p>
<p>Seeing her ample cleavage, I reconfirmed that she belongs to the category of girls known as busty.</p>

<p>By the way, I’m not looking at her with any improper intentions.</p>
<p>There’s a reason I can’t help but focus on her chest.</p>
<p>There’s a number on it. The number 『60』 is engraved on her right breast.</p>

<p>Is that some kind of tattoo? Even if it were, what could that number mean?</p>
<p>Is it perhaps her breast size? Does 『60』 indicate her bust measurement?</p>

<p>No matter how I look at it, I think Himegi-san’s bust size is well over 90 centimeters.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s not centimeters but inches?</p>
<p>I forced my gaze away from her chest, really struggled to look away, and then raised my gaze upward, focusing on her finely sculpted face.</p>

<p>“Hmm? Is there something on my face?”</p>

<p>Touka Himegi directed a carefree smile towards me.</p>

<p>Ahh…it’s my favorite expression.</p>
<p>Although she’s usually have a cold expression, this pure smile she occasionally shows is what captivated my heart.</p>
<p>Yes, I wanted to monopolize this smile all to myself.</p>

<p>However, as I looked at her face, I felt a slight sense of discomfort.</p>
<p>Could it be my imagination…?</p>
<p>She’s oddly sensual, or perhaps a bit seductive… Is it because she’s in a wedding dress? Or is it due to a different makeup or hairstyle than usual?</p>
<p>I thought her aura seemed more mature than ever before.</p>
<p>Though she already looks more mature than her peers, now she seems like a mature woman.</p>

<p>“Just to confirm one thing.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“…This isn’t some kind of prank or surprise, is it?”</p>

<p>I considered various possibilities, but this question seemed to be the most appropriate.</p>
<p>My parents, who were enjoying their sushi, Kanako, along with that fortune-telling Old woman and Himegi-san, all conspired together to surprise me with an elaborate prank.</p>
<p>If that’s the purpose, then they’ve certainly achieved it. But why?</p>
<p>I’m getting impatient for them to reveal the joke.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure you’re surprised, but it’s not a prank or anything like that.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you in my house? Why the wedding dress? Also you two, don’t just calmly eat sushi like nothing’s happening! This is an emergency, okay? There’s a woman in a wedding dress sitting in our house, sipping green tea with a serene face! Aren’t you supposed to react like an adult? Also, that salmon roe, sea urchin, and fatty tuna are mine!”</p>

<p>How can my parents eat sushi so leisurely? Unbelievable.</p>

<p>“Calm down, Ha-kun. I’ll explain everything step by step.”</p>
<p>“Step by step?”</p>
<p>“First of all, I am——a time traveler.”</p>
<p>“——Yes?”</p>
<p>“You see, I am not the Touka Himegi you know, but rather, I am Touka Himegi from six years in the future. I’m a future person.”</p>

<p>What is this person saying? Touka Himegi from six years in the future?</p>
<p>I don’t understand…I can’t grasp anything at all.</p>
<p>I hope I misheard.</p>

<p>“I admit, you do appear more mature than the Himegi-san I know, but to call yourself a future person… It’s just too absurd.”</p>

<p>However, there’s one thing I am certain of. She is undoubtedly Touka Himegi herself.</p>
<p>I can’t explain it well, but I’ve been watching Himegi-san for a long time, so I can tell.</p>
<p>The woman in front of me isn’t a look-alike or anything like that; she is the genuine Touka Himegi.</p>

<p>“Hmph, I knew you wouldn’t believe me! …well, it’s to be expected. Everything is as it should be.”</p>

<p>She tries to take something out of her designer bag.</p>

<p>“Surely you’re not going to tell me that bag is evidence from the future, right?”</p>
<p>“Rest assured. I’m going to show you something more convincing right now.”</p>

<p>And with that, Himegi-san proudly takes out a red smartphone from her bag.</p>

<p>“If you look at this, I think you’ll be convinced that I came from the future. In fact, this smartphone is evidence that I’m from the future. After all, this device is a new model of smartphone that doesn’t exist in the present time.”</p>

<p>She handed me the red smartphone, and I accepted it.</p>
<p>This is a smartphone from the future? It’s just a regular smartphone…</p>

<p>“I see…so this is a smartphone being sold in the future…”</p>
<p>“Ah! That expression clearly shows you still don’t believe it. Then I’ll show you the video inside. If you see that, even someone as stubborn as you should believe me!”</p>

<p>She takes the smartphone from my hand and starts doing something with it.</p>

<p>“See, you should be convinced after watching this.”</p>

<p>Then she holds the smartphone up to my face.</p>
<p>I focus on the screen, and the video seems to be taken in a luxury hotel somewhere.</p>

<p>“Hmm? Mom and Dad and Himegi-san?”</p>

<p>The smartphone screen displayed my parents, a boy and a girl who appeared to be around five years old, and Himegi-san in a wedding dress of the same design as the current one, all in what looked like a luxurious hotel.</p>

<p>I glance at my father and mother, who are eating sushi and nikujaga for a moment.</p>

<p>“Mom and Dad are oddly dressed up in fashionable tailcoats and black kimonos…”</p>

<p>The two in the screen appeared a little older.</p>
<p>Yeah, Mom had gained a little weight, and Dad’s forehead had gotten wider.</p>

<p>“Wait, who are the children waving while saying ‘Big brother, do your best!’? Did we have such young cousins or something?”</p>
<p>“—Those children are your twin sister and brother.”</p>
<p>“What? My twin sister and brother?”</p>

<p>What is this person talking about? I’ve been an only child since I was born.</p>
<p>There’s no such thing as a younger sister or brother in this world.</p>
<p>Unable to grasp the situation, I gaze at my silent parents and ask for an explanation.</p>
<p>Then, my father places his chopsticks down and speaks for the first time.</p>

<p>“Well, you see… Hakuba, you’re going to be a big brother soon.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Ha-chan, Mommy’s tummy has two babies inside.”</p>

<p>My mother lovingly touches her belly with a gentle expression.</p>
<p>I’ve only noticed it now, but my mother’s belly has grown larger.</p>
<p>So, that’s what it is. Then, I’ll become a big brother soon…</p>

<p>“I see… Well, um, congratulations to both of you.”</p>
<p>” “Thank you!” “</p>

<p>And with that, I stand up.</p>

<p>” ” “——Ahahaha! ! !” ” “</p>

<p>Everyone bursts into a good laugh. Oh man, this is such a joyous occasion.</p>
<p>I never thought I’d become a big brother at sixteen.</p>

<p>Well, it’s probably a lie though. I bet they just put something in her belly…</p>

<p>“Sigh… If my future looks like that video, I’m sure I’ll be really happy.”</p>

<p>I plop down on the seat and gaze at the smartphone screen with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>From what I gather from the video, it seems that we were invited to Himegi’s wedding.</p>
<p>Even in the setting of a video, it’s genuinely heartwarming to know that I’ll still be connected with her six years from now.</p>

<p>Honestly, I had given up today after she rejected me.</p>
<p>After graduation, we’d each walk different paths and never cross each other’s paths again.</p>
<p>It’s sad, but that’s what I had imagined.</p>

<p>Yet my family and I were invited to Himegi-san’s wedding in the video. Even if it’s a fabricated video, it makes me happy.</p>
<p>If I’m in a position to celebrate Himegi-san becoming a bride, it’s genuinely an honor.</p>
<p>If such a future exists, I hope it comes true.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“…We’re still friends in the future, huh? At least, in the context of this video…”</p>

<p>Even though I’m happy for her, my heart still aches painfully. Yes, conflicting emotions have sprouted in my heart.</p>
<p>This girl with such an innocent smile on her face will belong to someone else…</p>

<p>Even if it’s just a setup for a video, I still feel complicated about it.</p>
<p>I should have understood that I had to give up on her when she rejected me today… but a part of me doesn’t want to.</p>
<p>And even though I knew it was just my own ego, I didn’t want to lie to myself.</p>

<p>“…Friends….according to the video… you still don’t believe it, huh?”</p>
<p>“Anyway, using my parents as well, what’s the purpose behind this grand scheme?”</p>

<p>It feels like they’re going overboard if all they’re doing is scaring me.</p>
<p>Who on earth came up with this idea?</p>

<p>“Sigh… I expected that kind of response, but it’s still a bit frustrating when you don’t believe me.”</p>
<p>“By the way, who’s the one who filmed this smartphone video?”</p>
<p>“My younger sister. But more importantly, have you understood that this video is my wedding?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s at some luxury hotel, huh?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. On April 14th, six years from now, we rented out a well-known hotel and had a grand wedding.”</p>
<p>“…Congratulations…”</p>
<p>“Well, Ha-kun isn’t exactly the side to offer congratulations…”</p>
<p>“Huh? I’m not the side to offer congratulations?”</p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>

<p>“Well, never mind. Let’s move on with the conversation. So, on this date six years from now, I’m getting married. And since it’s a wedding, it’s only natural that I have a partner. Are you with me so far?”</p>
<p>“Are you talking about the groom?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. By the way, what kind of person do you think my groom is?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Maybe a super wealthy heir or a handsome actor?”</p>
<p>“My husband isn’t an heir, and he’s not particularly handsome either. If anything, he’s a cute guy who falls into the ‘pitiful’ category.”</p>
<p>“Huh? ‘pitiful’ category?”</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’ll rewind this video a bit. And then, I want you to take a look at my husband.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san operates the red smartphone with a serious expression.</p>

<p>“Let’s start from around here… Ha-kun, try not to get flustered again.”</p>
<p>“You’re pretty demanding. Well, I won’t be surprised anymore. I mean, there’s nothing left to be surprised about.”</p>

<p>A magician thrives on surprising their audience. And yet, I’ve been surprised one after another today.</p>
<p>Here, as a magician, I’ll maintain my composure and remain unfazed, no matter what happens!</p>

<p>“You’re setting up various flags, aren’t you? Well, never mind. Stay calm and watch this footage.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san hands me the smartphone.</p>
<p>I accept the smartphone and gaze at the screen intently.</p>
<p>The scene transitions, and it changes to what seems like a chapel.</p>

<p>A white aisle with a large cross.</p>
<p>There, a foreign man dressed as a pastor with glasses, not Japanese, holding a thick book in his hand, standing with a very composed expression.</p>
<p>From the chapel, the soothing sound of a pipe organ resonates, and the familiar ‘Bridal Chorus’ by Wagner, heard by everyone at least once, is playing.</p>
<p>Then, the large wooden doors open, and from there, an unfamiliar handsome middle-aged man and Himegi-san in a wedding dress appear.</p>

<p>This is it, right? The situation of walking down the aisle with a parent.</p>
<p>I was slightly taken aback. I never expected to be shown such an elaborate fake video…</p>

<p>“It’s actually looks like a real wedding…”</p>
<p>“That’s because it is real…”</p>

<p>Pressing her temple, Himegi-san makes a frustrated expression. And once again, I focus on the smartphone.</p>
<p>On the screen, a pure white Himegi-san in a wedding dress stands next to a man in an equally white tuxedo.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the screen only shows the back of the groom. So, I can’t see the groom’s face clearly.</p>
<p>But his height doesn’t seem to be particularly tall.</p>
<p>Still, the unfolding scenario is easily imaginable.</p>
<p>Probably, the groom and bride will exchange vows of eternal love before the pastor next. And as I imagined, the groom and bride, Himegi-san, exchange vows of eternal love before the pastor.</p>

<p>“This way, I can’t figure out who the groom is.”</p>

<p>I don’t know, but his back and head look familiar to me.</p>
<p>The voice, too, seems somewhat familiar… Where have I heard it?</p>

<p>Then, the exchange of vows concludes.</p>
<p>Even though I’ve never been to a wedding, I know what happens next.</p>

<p>Ahh, the ring exchange and the vow-sealed kiss.</p>
<p>The groom and bride would kiss in front of everyone, and everyone would applaud to bless the couple. That’s how it should go.</p>
<p>The pastor, uttering some profound words, would encourage the ring exchange between the two.</p>

<p>“——Hmm?”</p>

<p>Wait? This profile of the groom… I’ve seen this face somewhere. Huh, where did I see it?</p>
<p>I try hard to trace back through my memories.</p>
<p>Oh, that delicate build, chestnut-brown hair, and blue eyes.</p>
<p>An androgynous youthful face, with a slightly unreliable vibe…</p>

<p>“Wait, is it me? No way, could it be…is this me!?”</p>
<p>“What? Just now? You just found out now?”</p>

<p>To my disbelief, the groom in the screen was me!</p>

<p>In the video, I nervously placed a ring onto her slim and beautiful left ring finger.</p>
<p>I have no memory of experiencing an event like this. I often forget things, but surely if I had experienced something like this, I wouldn’t forget it even if I wanted to.</p>

<p>In other words, this is an event I don’t remember.</p>
<p>It seems that the unbelievably strange story she was telling wasn’t just a tall tale but the truth.</p>
<p>I gazed at her before me. She was looking at me with a triumphant expression.</p>

<p>Ah, this expression is unfamiliar to me. It seems to be a natural face that she only shows to someone special.</p>

<p>——In the video on the screen, ‘me’ and her were kissing.</p>
<p>It may sound strange coming from me, but it looked quite picturesque.</p>

<p>It’s strange…I’ve never even touched the hand of someone of the opposite sex, let alone kissed them. And yet, there I am, placing my hand on her face and kissing her in a practiced manner.</p>
<p>It felt like a scene from a movie.</p>

<p>Ah, but I can’t put into words the feelings that are welling up.</p>
<p>Is this a dream? If it is, I wish I would wake up soon… It’s too embarrassing to continue watching.</p>

<p>With that thought, I stopped the video.</p>

<p>” ——Wait! The best part is coming!”</p>
<p>“Uh, no, I’m done now. My head will start hurting if I continue…”</p>

<p>With trembling hands, I tried to return the red smartphone to its owner, but instead, I found myself staring at her face——precisely, staring at her lips.</p>
<p>No, I can’t get that kissing scene out of my head…</p>

<p>“With this, have you understood who my husband is?”</p>

<p>No words came out.</p>
<p>I was trying to speak, but my throat was trembling and no words emerged.</p>
<p>I raised both hands in surrender, because I had no choice but to honestly admit defeat.</p>

<p>Finally, she looked at me with a pleased expression and now, she gazed at me with an innocent smile.</p>
<p>I see, if she’s my bride, then it’s not strange for her to be in this house.</p>

<p>Then she fluttered her wedding dress, did a little twirl, and showed me the sparkling ring to me.</p>

<p>“I am your destined victorious bride!”</p>

<p>She declared so with a lovely smile.</p>
<p>——It seems that I am the one who gets to monopolize this smile.</p>
