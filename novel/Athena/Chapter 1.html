<h2>Chapter 1: You, Who Has Changed</h2>


<p>Kamome and Tsuyu were close friends as neighbors when they were children.</p>



<p>「Kamome! Let’s go play!」</p>



<p>At that time, Tsuyu was a strong-willed girl who pulled the shy Kamome.</p>



<p>She liked to be physically active, especially running, he has memories of her often inviting him to run around the city.</p>



<p>Around this time, Kamome, who was weak-willed and short compared to now, was sometimes targeted by the neighborhood brats.</p>



<p>But each time, Tsuyu protected him.</p>



<p>That’s why he naturally admired her…</p>



<p>And surely, what Kamome was feeling at that time must have been the feeling of liking her.</p>



<p>Tsuyu was very athletic and fast on her feet.</p>



<p>She was also a member of the track and field club and had good grades.</p>



<p>“In the future, I’m going to become a track and field athlete”, she said very happily, and Kamome also believed that she would definitely become a famous athlete.</p>



<p>A promising athlete who gives her best effort in the competitions, cheerful, bright, kind and treats everyone equally…</p>



<p>Tsuyu was such a divine being.</p>



<p>There was a time when Kamome admired her so much that he devoted himself to track and field.</p>



<p>However, one day, Tsuyu suddenly had to move out.</p>


<p>It seemed to be due to her parents’ work; it was a sudden thing.</p>



<p>On the day of the separation, he went to say his goodbyes to the house from which she was moving, in which she lived at that time.</p>



<p>He remembers Tsuyu cheering him up with a smile, who cried at the suddenness of the situation.</p>



<p>Thus, Tsuyu disappeared from Kamome’s life and never came back──</p>



<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>「…Kamome-kun?」</p>



<p>「…Eh?」</p>



<p>Kamome regains consciousness after being called by Himawari</p>



<p>This is Himawari’s room.</p>



<p>(…I was in a daze.)</p>



<p>Apparently Kamome was surprised to find that Himawari’s older sister was Tsuyu, the person he once admired, and his memory became confused.</p>



<p>「What’s wrong Kamome-kun? Even if I talk to you, your head seems to be somewhere else…」</p>



<p>There, seeing Kamome acting strange since a while ago, Himawari tilts her head.</p>



<p>「Kamome-kun, could it be that you know Tsuyu-san?」</p>



<p>「No, emn…」</p>



<p>What should I do.</p>



<p>How should I explain it?</p>


<p>Or, perhaps, she just resembles her, and can just be misunderstanding.</p>



<p>In the first place, if I spent my childhood with her, I should be acquainted with her younger sister Himawari as well.</p>



<p>In other words, there is a high possibility that she is a complete stranger who miraculously resembles Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Having concluded that, Kamome explains to Himawari while scratching his head.</p>



<p>「Like she’s an acquaintance, or rather she looks a lot like someone I know… No, I’m sorry, I think is probably a misunderstanding. Because if Himawari is that person’s younger sister, there’s no way I wouldn’t know.」</p>



<p>「I-I see.」</p>



<p>When he explained that, Himawari made a relieved expression.</p>



<p>「…Wait.」</p>



<p>Then, a question arose in Kamome.</p>



<p>「Come to think of it, Tsuyu-san is Himawari’s older sister, right?」</p>



<p>「Yeah.」</p>



<p>「Why do you call her “Tsuyu-san”?」</p>



<p>「…Ah, umn….」</p>



<p>When Kamome asked, Himawari’s expression darkened and hesitantly opened her mouth.</p>



<p>「This is something I’m talking about to you for the first time, Kamome-kun, but… My parents are remarried.」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Himawari talks about her home environment to the surprised Kamome.</p>


<p>According to her, Himawari’s parents divorced a few years ago, and she lives with her father.</p>



<p>And after that, her current parents remarried.</p>



<p>The woman who remarried Himawari’s father was also divorced, and Tsuyu was her stepmother’s child.</p>



<p>In other words, Tsuyu and Himawari are not blood related sisters.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Hearing that story, Kamome was so surprised that was at a loss for words.</p>



<p>「T-Then, you and Tsuyu-san became sisters…」</p>



<p>「Yeah…. About a year ago. So, umn, I’m still not used to calling Tsuyu-san ‘Onee-chan’… Tsuyu-san also told me that I don’t have to feel obligated to call her that way, so I just call her by name… Kamome-kun?」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>In the middle of Himawari’s talk, Kamome was somewhat absent, as if his mind was occupied with something else, he was silent with that kind of expression.</p>



<p>「…So that was the case.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu and Himawari are not related by blood.</p>



<p>Tsuyu and Himawari have been living together for the past year or so.</p>



<p>There is no connection between Tsuyu and Himawari before that.</p>



<p>In other words, the possibility that she’s the same person as the Tsuyu of his memories has resurfaced again.</p>



<p>「…Himawari, about Tsuyu-san──」</p>



<p>In that instant, Kamome realized when he looked back at Himawari.</p>


<p>That Himawari doesn’t have a very cheerful expression.</p>



<p>「…Ah.」</p>



<p>Kamome was ashamed of himself.</p>



<p>Today, he is at Himawari’s… his girlfriend’s house.</p>



<p>Now is his precious time with Himawari.</p>



<p>Tsuyu is irrelevant.</p>



<p>As for Himawari, even if Tsuyu is her sister, there’s no way she would be happy when Kamome is talking like he is interested in another woman.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry, Himawari.」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Kamome says, as if to change the mood of the air.</p>



<p>「Even though I was invited to Himawari’s house, all I have done is talk about irrelevant things… I’m really sorry!」</p>



<p>Himawari hurriedly held up her hand to Kamome, who bowed his head saying so.</p>



<p>「N-No! That is not true! I think it’s a normal conversation!」</p>



<p>After he said that, “…Ehehe”, Himawari gave a small laugh.</p>



<p>「But… I’m happy. Kamome-kun, you even think about my feelings seriously.」</p>



<p>「Well, I’m your boyfriend?」</p>



<p>When he stated that, Himawari’s face turned so red that it seemed like she was going to make a “Boo” sound.</p>


<p>「M-Mou, I’m embarrassed! You’re making me blush!」</p>



<p>Kamome stared at her, who covered her face as she said that, with a face that honestly said, “How cute”.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>「Fuu…」</p>



<p>After spending a cheerful time with Himawari for a while like that──</p>



<p>Kamome borrowed the bathroom at Himawari’s house.</p>



<p>It was just down the stairs, so he didn’t get lost.</p>



<p>After opening the bathroom door and returning to the hallway, he looked around the house again.</p>



<p>As expected, it’s a pretty big house.</p>



<p>He doesn’t know if it’s the father, the mother who remarried, or both parents, but they must have very respectable jobs.</p>



<p>Come to think of it… Kamome realizes that he didn’t know anything about Himawari’s family or household.</p>



<p>He had never had such a conversation with her until now.</p>



<p>It might just be a coincidence, but perhaps Himawari herself didn’t want to talk much about her family.</p>



<p>「…No.」</p>



<p>We’re talking about Himawari.</p>



<p>She may have kept quiet about her complicated relationships, like her parents who once divorced, the remarried, and that had a sister who is not related by blood, because she thought it might cause people to feel uncomfortable or make the mood worse.</p>



<p>It’s possible, being that kind and caring girl.</p>


<p>If anything, he’ll have to adapt to the situation that has become clear to him.</p>



<p>Accepting, without worrying about such circumstances, they have to become a relationship where they can spend time together without hesitation.</p>



<p>Because they are lovers.</p>



<p>As he climbed the stairs, he slapped his own cheeks.</p>



<p>Kamome, who has a serious personality, returned to the front of Himawari’s room with such thoughts running through his mind.</p>



<p>And then, he opens the door.</p>



<p>Inside the room was Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「……Eh?」</p>



<p>The person standing in the center of the room is not Himawari, but Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Moreover, she seemed to be in the middle of changing clothes, her upper body was in her underwear.</p>



<p>At Kamome, who was stiff with the door open, she also had a surprised expression with wide eyes.</p>



<p>「W-Why──」</p>



<p>「…Himawari’s room is next door.」</p>



<p>Kamome realizes when Tsuyu says so.</p>



<p>That he had mistakenly opened the door of the room next to Himawari’s, Tsuyu’s room.</p>



<p>Since he was absorbed in his thoughts, his attention was distracted.</p>



<p>「I-I’m sorry! I made a mistake! I never meant to peek──」</p>


<p>This is the worst.</p>



<p>It’s one thing if he just gets the wrong room, but to run into her at a bad time when she is changing clothes.</p>



<p>Kamome closes both eyes, says a few words of apology, and tries to quickly close the door.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>There, suddenly Kamome’s hand was grabbed.</p>



<p>It was Tsuyu.</p>



<p>With her upper underwear at sight, she grabbed Kamome’s hand on the door and pulled him into the room.</p>



<p>「Eh, wai──」</p>



<p>Then, the door was quietly closed.</p>



<p>「Ah…」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Tsuyu silently returns to the center of the room and resumes changing clothes.</p>



<p>「It would be a problem if the door was left open.」</p>



<p>「…Ah! I-I’m sorry!」</p>



<p>Kamome replied with a bit of agitation to Tsuyu, who indicated in a calm tone.</p>



<p>「Ah… Umn…」</p>



<p>While averting his gaze as much as possible, or rather, trying not to focus his vision on her, Kamome asks Tsuyu.</p>


<p>「Why did you let me into your room?」</p>



<p>Unlike Himawari’s room, which was decorated with girlish and fluffy furnishings, Tsuyu’s room was decorated in black, gold, and pink with leopard and zebra prints, giving it a somewhat gaudy and decadent atmosphere.</p>



<p>Like this room, Tsuyu has lost the bright and cheerful atmosphere she used to have.</p>



<p>It seems that the strong-minded and unyielding spirit feeling remains… but the direction is a little different.</p>



<p>A dangerous atmosphere can be sensed, as if she is used to play around.</p>



<p>It makes Kamome wonder if she’s really the same person.</p>



<p>…No, there’s still no clear evidence that she’s the same Tsuyu I know.</p>



<p>「…Just before, you.」</p>



<p>On the other hand, Tsuyu doesn’t seem to care about the fact that she was seen in her underwear and continues to change clothes.</p>



<p>She put the T-shirt over her head, pulled the sleeves through, and when stuck her head out of the collar neck, she naturally returned to the conversation.</p>



<p>「You seemed to know me. Do we know each other? Have we met before?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu asked him just like that.</p>



<p>I see.</p>



<p>Because she was curious about that, she pulled me into her room, huh. Kamome was convinced.</p>



<p>「…Moreover, you called me by my name, Tsuyu. Did we spend time together somewhere?」</p>



<p>「Ah, umn…」</p>



<p>Perhaps, because of that behavior, she might be a little wary of Kamome as well.</p>


<p>Kamome is flustered as he replies to Tsuyu, who asks him questions like an interrogation.</p>



<p>「When we were kids… I think.」</p>



<p>「…When we were kids?」</p>



<p>「…You probably don’t remember anymore, though.」</p>



<p>There, Kamome gets into the heart of the matter.</p>



<p>「When I was a child, I lived near Tsuyu-san’s house, and we often played together. To Tsuyu-san, I was just one of your many friends, so you may not remember me.」</p>



<p>「…Ah.」</p>



<p>It was at that time.</p>



<p>Hearing Kamome’s story, Tsuyu tilted her head at first.</p>



<p>However, gradually, as she stared suspiciously at Kamome’s face, stardust-like sparkles began to scatter in her eyes, and eventually a clear light lit up inside them.</p>



<p>「…Kamome?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s mouth called his name.</p>



<p>His childhood friend who met again for the first time in several years called his name just like back then.</p>



<p>At that situation, Kamome’s face naturally burst into joy.</p>



<p>「That’s right, it’s me, Tsuyu!」</p>



<p>Calling her that, Tsuyu also showed an innocent smile on her face and covered her mouth with her hands.</p>



<p>「No way! Is that really you, Kamome!?」</p>


<p>And then, she rushed toward Kamome with great vigor.</p>



<p>「Ooshima Kamome-kun, right!? Really!? It has been so long!」</p>



<p>From the bottom of her heart, she raises the tone of her voice as if rejoicing at the reunion.</p>



<p>The person he admired was happy to see him again after so many years apart.</p>



<p>Looking at her expression, Kamome also felt his heart warm up.</p>



<p>「Yeah, it has really been a long time. I’m currently attending the same high school as Himawari.」</p>



<p>「I see… I didn’t know this was possible!」</p>



<p>Kamome is genuinely happy that Tsuyu remembered him.</p>



<p>The person he admired as a child remembered him.</p>



<p>That honestly made him happy.</p>



<p>However, Kamome’s excitement was soon to be cruelly betrayed.</p>



<p>「Fuun… That tiny and cute Kamome is now a splendid high school student.」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu looks around Kamome’s body from the top to the bottom and from the bottom to the top.</p>



<p>The innocent expression from earlier disappeared, and she looked at Kamome as if she was licking his whole body.</p>



<p>The look in her eyes sent a chill down Kamome’s spine.</p>



<p>「…You don’t have a bad face, and your figure is properly in good form, too.」</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu?」</p>


<p>「Your shoulders are broad and sturdy, and your larynx too…」</p>



<p>The innocent, girlish smile that had been on her face up until a few moments ago vanished, and the mature expression had returned to her face.</p>



<p>Like evaluating the other party and expecting something from them.</p>



<p>With provocative eyes.</p>



<p>「You’re a good man.」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Somehow, it’s not like her.</p>



<p>Kamome wonders about her behavior that is far from hers in his memories.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu, umn…」</p>



<p>It was at that moment.</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s body at once adheres closely to Kamome’s. And then, she made a judgment about what had happened.</p>



<p>And without even being given time to judge what happened, Kamome found himself being kissed by Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「───」</p>



<p>The suddenness of this act made Kamome forget how to speak and even breathe.</p>



<p>He doesn’t understand what she’s doing to him right now.</p>



<p>His mouth and nostrils are filled with the sweet smell that wafts from her hair and body.</p>



<p>「Hmm….」</p>



<p>After that posture continued for several seconds.</p>



<p>Once they lips are separated, Tsuyu looks into Kamome’s face.</p>



<p>Looking at Kamome’s face as if to ascertain him, Tsuyu narrowed both eyes in fascination.</p>



<p>A red tongue peeks out from between her lips, licks her lower lip, and she smiles.</p>



<p>A smile that makes your skin bubble and sends shivers down your spine.</p>



<p>He thought it was like a predator’s smile in front of its prey.</p>



<p>It was an unthinkable expression for that Tsuyu to have on her face.</p>



<p>Why, why is she doing this all of a sudden?</p>



<p>Without caring about Kamome, who was coming and going with such confusion, Tsuyu brought her face close again and put her lips on top of him.</p>



<p>This time, the kiss was even more passionate, dynamic, and wild.</p>



<p>A slimy, warm sensation of flesh slipped into Kamome’s mouth.</p>



<p>It was her tongue.</p>



<p>She inserted her tongue.</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s tongue violates Kamome’s oral cavity.</p>



<p>Needless to say, all of this is a first time for Kamome.</p>



<p>Being kissed and being attacked in such an aggressive manner.</p>



<p>The tip of her tongue traces the back of his teeth and tickles his palate.</p>


<p>As if tempting, as if teasing.</p>



<p>Furthermore, she sucked on his lips and kissed in a coaxing manner.</p>



<p>Speaking of kissing, he had only thought of it as nothing more than lips touching lips.</p>



<p>For Kamome, who knew only that, it was such a shock that it sent shivers down his spine and set every nerve in his body on edge.</p>



<p>「…Could it be that it was your first time?」</p>



<p>He lost all sense of time, and even forgot to breathe.</p>



<p>The sweet moment that seemed like an eternity came to an end, and they lips parted.</p>



<p>Their saliva pulls threads.</p>



<p>Each other’s sighs were so close that they could catch each other’s breath, and while Tsuyu licked the threads of saliva with her tongue, she asked in a whisper.</p>



<p>With a volume that only Kamome could hear.</p>



<p>「No, that…」</p>



<p>「It’s okay, even if you don’t say it. Because I know.」</p>



<p>Seeing Kamome’s flustered reaction as he looked away, Tsuyu says with conviction.</p>



<p>「I see, you and Himawari haven’t done it yet… Nee, don’t you want to experience it in advance?」</p>



<p>「E-Experience it?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu extends a hand.</p>



<p>At the end where she extended her hand, there is a bed.</p>


<p>The pipe bed of this room…</p>



<p>「…What!?」</p>



<p>At that moment, her mindset that had been in a daze came to senses.</p>



<p>Kamome looked at Tsuyu with a flustered expression.</p>



<p>「T-Tsuyu!? What are you──」</p>



<p>「I’ll help you out, we’ve known each other for a long time.」</p>




<p>Kamome doesn’t understand what Tsuyu is saying.</p>



<p>No, he does understand, but…</p>



<p>He doesn’t understand the reality in which she is making such a statement.</p>



<p>However, the girl in front of him, Tsuyu, doesn’t care and pulls Kamome’s hand.</p>



<p>「I’ll keep Himawari in the dark. If you practice now, you’ll look cool when it comes the time to do it with that girl, right?」</p>



<p>「No, it’s not that…」</p>



<p>Kamome desperately chooses his words.</p>



<p>However, when he finds herself in such a situation, he has absolutely no idea what to say.</p>



<p>「…I feel bad about this…」</p>



<p>「You don’t like it?」</p>


<p>「It’s not that I don’t like it or anything…」</p>



<p>Seeing Kamome’s face as he said that, Tsuyu chuckled.</p>



<p>「I don’t mind. I don’t dislike it, this kind of thing.」</p>



<p>「…Eh?」</p>



<p>「Or, do you dislike me, Kamome?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu makes a sad face.</p>



<p>A sensual woman’s expression that would instill a sense of guilt in men and destroy his reason.</p>



<p>But at that time, seeing Tsuyu in front of him, the emotions that swirled inside Kamome were something else.</p>



<p>『I don’t mind.』</p>



<p>『I don’t dislike it, this kind of thing.』</p>



<p>The numerous shimmering memories with her in his memory.</p>



<p>Precious, beautiful, and valuable memories.</p>



<p>Her actions, her numerous statements, seemed to smear such memories.</p>



<p>And it seems to irritate Kamome’s nerves.</p>



<p>His head is burning.</p>



<p>His chest tightens.</p>



<p>Is the girl in front of him really Tsuyu?</p>



<p>「I’m the one saying this, but I’m pretty confident in my body… Just kidding.」</p>



<p>Without guessing Kamome’s thoughts, Tsuyu continues her words.</p>



<p>As she said this, she took off the T-shirt she had just put on.</p>



<p>She shows off the valley of the twin hills covered with a bra, her chest.</p>



<p>Then, she moves her face as if to meet Kamome’s gaze that was directed there and met his upturned eyes.</p>



<p>Please stop…</p>



<p>Please don’t…</p>



<p>Kamome’s expression twisted in pain.</p>



<p>「What do you think? I have grown up, haven’t I? Isn’t the current me more attractive than the old me?」</p>



<p>「───」</p>



<p>That was the decisive blow.</p>



<p>Those words that Tsuyu uttered cut something in Kamome’s head.</p>



<p>The sound of a precious wire being torn apart echoes through his skull.</p>



<p>Her words were, without a doubt, words that tainted and insulted Kamome’s cherished jewel-like memories.</p>



<p>「Of course not!」</p>



<p>Kamome strongly pulls away Tsuyu’s body.</p>



<p>「Wai…!」</p>

<p>Kamome suddenly shouted loudly and pushed Tsuyu away with all his might.</p>



<p>At that action, Tsuyu widened her eyes in surprise.</p>



<p>There, she looked directly into Kamome’s eyes and stiffened her body.</p>



<p>She was confronted by the angry, overheated glare of his eyes, and could do nothing but become speechless, unable to move in fear.</p>



<p>To such a Tsuyu, Kamome makes a statement, as if to close the conversation.</p>



<p>Without considering the conversation before and after, he simply uttered the words that came into his mind to his heart’s content.</p>



<p>「What I admired was the old Tsuyu! I don’t think the current Tsuyu is good at all!」</p>



<p>The words were clearly stated as he looked into her eyes.</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s eyes widen in shock, and her expression stiffens.</p>



<p>As if appalled.</p>



<p>Her brain was shaken upon receiving Kamome’s direct statement, just like a person when hit on the head by a blazing fastball.</p>



<p>Silence filles the room.</p>



<p>Both Kamome and Tsuyu, forgetting about their current attire and situation, simply stood still, facing each other.</p>



<p>There──</p>



<p>「Tsuyu-san? Kamome-kun?」</p>



<p>The door of a room opened.</p>



<p>Kamome had gone to the bathroom but never returned to Himawari’s room.</p>
<p>And it was probably because she heard his loud voice coming from the next room.</p>



<p>That Himawari came to Tsuyu’s room to see what was going on.</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>And there, in the room, she found Kamome and Tsuyu, without her t-shirt, facing each other.</p>



<p>「Eh? Eh? Eh?」</p>



<p>Himawari’s face turns pale and falls into a panic.</p>



<p>「Ah……」</p>



<p>The appearance of Himawari brings Kamome back to his senses.</p>



<p>「Y-You’re wrong! Himawari! This situation! Let me explain this situation!!」</p>



<p>Kamome’s expression of anger from earlier dissipated, and he began to panic.</p>



<p>In front of Tsuyu, who was stunned by his figure, Kamome rushed to explain the situation to Himawari.</p>
