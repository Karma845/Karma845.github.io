<h2>Chapter 1: Takane Saki</h2>

<p>…Have you ever heard of the &#8220;3-Month Confession Rule&#8221;?</p>
</p>
<p>&lt;”The &#8220;Super Love Psychology Course&#8221;, also known as &#8220;Imamote&#8221;.”&gt;</p>
</p>
<p>According to Chapter 1, &#8221; The Mechanism of Love You Don&#8217;t Understand&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Surprisingly&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>(I really was so surprised I fell out of my chair.)</p>
</p>
<p>The longer you wait after meeting someone, the less likely you are to succeed in confessing your feelings to them!</p>
<p>This was truly a revelation out of the blue.</p>
</p>
<p>(I was really, really surprised and let my mind drift for a while.)</p>
</p>
<p>It was a revolutionary concept.</p>
<p>Because usually, the longer you know each other, the better you understand each other, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
</p>
<p>Then you can fall in love with each other more, right?</p>
<p>Beginners in love like me might think so… But this is a theory backed by data&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>According to statistics by Imamote, the most successful pattern of confession is &#8220;within 3 months of the first meeting&#8221;.</p>
</p>
<p>The success rate peaks in the third month and then declines steadily.</p>
<p>In other words…</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;I have to con-c-…confess my feelings to Mashima-kun within the next three months!”</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t even say the word &#8216;confession&#8217; properly, can you?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka pointed this out to me in a half-amused tone, and I felt my face heat up.</p>
</p>
<p>…By the way, this was my room, where Yuka and I were having a meeting after school to reflect on the painful failure of that morning&#8217;s rumor campaign…</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan and I were sitting on my bed reading manga.</p>
<p>…Well, I can&#8217;t say I had the right to complain because I was asking her for advice on my love life, but she could have helped me out a little more. I&#8217;ve known her since junior high school, after all&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;I need to get back on track.</p>
</p>
<p>“I have less than two and a half months to go, to be exact. It was April 7 when I spoke with Mashima-kun at the bicycle parking lot, and today is April 25, so&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“How short~!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan said as she flipped through the pages of her manga.</p>
<p>Is it really that interesting? The manga…</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;Hmm? But didn&#8217;t Mashima-kun go to junior high school with us in the first place? I think it&#8217;s been more than three months since it happened.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Back then… I didn&#8217;t know much about romance or anything like that, so no thank you!&#8221;</p>
<p>“The longer you wait, the more like a friend you&#8217;ll become, rather than a romantic partner. I agree with you that it&#8217;s better to settle things early and sometimes that stinky book of yours has some good things to say.”</p>
<p>“I! Ma! Mo! Te! It&#8217;s not some stinky book!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Saki Saki won&#8217;t ever confess unless we set a deadline.”</p>
<p>“Oh… You can’t be so sure about that&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I can bet on it.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan looked at me with a sideways glance.</p>
</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been at Kamimura High School for a year now… Saki Saki, have you been able to speak properly with anyone in high school other than me?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ugh!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>My eyes involuntarily started to move around, as I was struck in a painful spot. She was completely right.</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan let out a deep sigh.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what Mashima-kun thinks of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>“W&#8230;W-what!? What Mashima-kun thinks of me!!”</p>
<p>“Close, close, close, close!! Mysterious! He thinks you&#8217;re mysterious!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!? Could it be that he also likes… me?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations! Kora! Don&#8217;t smirk! It&#8217;s not a compliment! I&#8217;m perceived as &#8216;someone who doesn&#8217;t know better&#8217; because I&#8217;m so outspoken at school!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I was unintentionally subjected to the Windsor Effect myself.</p>
<p>I was too shocked to find the next words to say&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>“Look! That&#8217;s it! Whenever you don&#8217;t know what to say, you immediately shut up with a serious face! Unless you fix that, you&#8217;ll be mysterious for the rest of your life!”</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“No, it seems that it’s impossible.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka said in a dazed manner and went back into the world of manga again.</p>
<p>I know that, too&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>If I am just shy and timid, it&#8217;s okay, but if I don&#8217;t even talk much like this, even the things that are supposed to be communicated don&#8217;t get through&#8230;</p>
<p>But still…</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s much better than spouting mindless words&#8230;”</p>
</p>
<p>That was my true feeling, which I squeezed out over a long period of time.</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan looked at me again with a sideways glance.</p>
<p>Phew… and she let out a long sigh and said.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I get it! I get it!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>After all, Yuka-chan has been my only close friend since junior high school.</p>
<p>Although sometimes she says terrible things.</p>
</p>
<p>“Well, let me hear it!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>In the end, we always end up going along with my selfishness.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Imamote&#8221; says &#8220;How do we get that obtuse, serious, public morality freak to fall for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I have a plan&#8230; And please don&#8217;t call Mashima-kun strange nicknames.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry for the long introduction, but the time has finally come for me to unveil the plan.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned from Imamote, my winning strategy to win in love.</p>
</p>
<p>The day after the meeting (two of us), during the slightly longer break between 2nd and 3rd periods.</p>
</p>
<p>I was watching from the shadows, trying to carry out the winning strategy that I had stressed to Yuka-chan yesterday.</p>
<p>It was not very difficult to find Mashima-kun on campus.</p>
</p>
<p>Because his voice comes through so well, and his imposing stance is one-of-a-kind.</p>
<p>…It’s purely because he stands out.</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;There! Yuya Kotani, Class 2C! The student handbook&#8217;s dress code, section 4, &#8220;Ornaments&#8221; states that ear piercings are forbidden!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Geez! How can you see them from that distance!? But these are ear cuffs! Too bad!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, okay then! But change it to something a little less conspicuous, and take it off during class! Wait there! Class 2A, Yashiro Shinaraya! Using your phone while walking and using your phone in the hallway are both forbidden!”</p>
</p>
<p>Even if it was recess time, Kengo Mashima, the Discipline Committee President, was in full force.</p>
<p>Walking down the corridor, Mashima-kun would instantly spot anyone violating school rules with his blade-like sharpness and cut them down with a wry smile.</p>
<p>I could not help but let out a sigh when I saw his serious expression&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;I can&#8217;t get close to him.”</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;What should I do? The gap is too big.</p>
<p>I was second-guessing with all my might here.</p>
</p>
<p>“Rika Kanaya! You&#8217;re folding your skirt again! How many times have I told you that in the Student Handbook Dress Code, Section 1, &#8220;Clothing,&#8221; the skirt length should be knee-length&#8230;”</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;Mashima-kun seemed to be busy, so I’ve decided to try again some other time.</p>
<p>The winds of timidity have begun to blow.</p>
</p>
<p>But&#8230; I shook my head vigorously to rid myself of my cowardice!</p>
<p>Imamote says, &#8216;Action is the only way!&#8217;</p>
</p>
<p>Look! Now is my chance, now that there are no more people around Mashima-kun!</p>
<p>I gathered up all my courage and jumped out from the shadows!</p>
</p>
<p>“Hello, Mashima-kun!”</p>
<p>“Yes&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>When he turned around, his gaze was as dignified as ever.</p>
<p>As soon as he turned to me, my heart leapt and I felt a choking sensation in my throat&#8230;</p>
<p>I tried to keep a poker face in accordance with the teaching of the Imamote, which said, &#8220;Avoid revealing your love for someone at an early stage as much as possible.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>“Oh, Takane Saki.”</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun called my name.</p>
<p>As usual, in a quiet but clear and calm tone of voice.</p>
<p>His expression, behavior, and mood were extremely&#8230; usual.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t he care a little bit about me after what happened the other day?&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of unfair that I&#8217;m the only one who&#8217;s upset!</p>
<p>I almost pouted, but I must have a poker face, a poker face&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>“Can I help you?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun wrinkled his eyebrows in a suspicious manner.</p>
<p>And I have been waiting for this very moment!</p>
</p>
<p>“No, it&#8217;s nothing serious&#8230;”</p>
<p>I also put all my energy into my eyebrow roots and wrinkled them!</p>
</p>
<p>…The mirroring effect.</p>
<p>Also known as the &#8220;tuning effect&#8221; or &#8220;postural echo&#8221; it is a psychological term.</p>
</p>
<p>According to Imamote, &#8220;Humans unconsciously perform the same behavior as people they like. It refers to the psychological effect of unconsciously feeling a sense of familiarity and liking toward people who perform the same actions as oneself.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>There is a psychological technique to shorten the psychological distance between a person and another person by intentionally mirroring (imitating) the other person&#8217;s behavior, aiming for this effect!</p>
</p>
<p>In other words, if the other person crosses their legs, we cross our legs too.</p>
<p>If they scratch their cheek, we scratch our cheek.</p>
<p>If they wrinkle their eyebrows, we wrinkle ours, too!</p>
</p>
<p>By simply imitating the other person&#8217;s movements and gestures, the other person will feel a sense of familiarity with you&#8230; Next thing they know, they&#8217;re in love!</p>
</p>
<p>This is a winning strategy that even an awkward girl like me can execute!</p>
</p>
<p>I call it the &#8220;Mirroring Strategy&#8221;!</p>
</p>
<p>It was supposed to be like that, but…</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Did I do something to offend you?&#8221;</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
</p>
<p>I was at a loss for words because of the unexpected response.</p>
<p>I felt like we were even a little bit further apart, rather than closer to each other&#8217;s hearts.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s ridiculous&#8230;? That&#8217;s not what I was planning&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>“If it&#8217;s about the incident in front of the school gate the other day? I thought I was doing my duty as the Discipline Committee President, but if I have unknowingly hurt you, I&#8217;m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, no, no, it&#8217;s not like that.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you glaring at me with such intensity?”</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m, you know, staring at you, it&#8217;s just that, you know, it&#8217;s not, you know, a mirror.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Mirror?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun tilted his head curiously.</p>
<p>Ah! Mirroring!</p>
<p>I inwardly panicked, but I ritually tilted my head at the same angle as Mashima-kun&#8217;s!</p>
<p>I tilted my head 30 degrees to the right, glared upward at Mashima-kun and started fidgeting&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>It would be a long time before I would notice how terribly strange it looked from another person&#8217;s point of view.</p>
</p>
<p>“No, I, well, I, I wanted to talk to you today, Mashima-kun.”</p>
<p>“What do you want to talk about? If it&#8217;s something you don&#8217;t want people to hear, we can move to a different location&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun suddenly looked around, and I followed his lead.</p>
<p>And then&#8230; before I knew it!</p>
</p>
<p>There was no one here a moment ago, but now a crowd had gathered around me and Mashima-kun!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Takane-san is getting tangled up with Mashima again.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Could it be that he&#8217;s trying to confess again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, he&#8217;s so passionate. I thought Mashima wasn&#8217;t interested in romance.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Isn&#8217;t Takane-san staring at him?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I heard such voices from the crowd, and I felt my face heat up.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on, but I&#8217;m attracting attention!? Perhaps a confession!?</p>
</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand, but am I going to get a confession from Mashima-kun!?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying my best to keep a poker face, but inside my head I&#8217;m already in a complete panic!</p>
</p>
<p>“You really do get people&#8217;s attention.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun said sincerely and scratched the area above his temple.</p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s not it! It&#8217;s Mashima-kun who stands out, not me&#8230;!</p>
<p>&#8230;Oh! Or rather, mirroring!</p>
<p>I reflexively tried to imitate Mashima-kun and scratched my head…</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!?”</p>
</p>
<p>…I stop my hand just in time.</p>
</p>
<p>Careful! The bangs I worked so hard to style in order to talk to Mashima-kun were about to be ruined!</p>
</p>
<p>But if I don&#8217;t do the mirroring, the strategy I&#8217;ve learned from… Following Imamote is a winning strategy!</p>
</p>
<p>“Damn&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>After such a struggle, my fingertips scratched at the empty void.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make complete sense anymore.</p>
</p>
<p>“What are you&#8230; doing?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>“What am I doing, I&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I finally spoke up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting a lot of attention from everyone, and my embarrassment has long exceeded the boiling point.</p>
<p>I bet Mashima-kun thinks I&#8217;m weird&#8230;!</p>
</p>
<p>Oh, if this is what it&#8217;s like, I shouldn&#8217;t have done the mirroring in the first place.</p>
<p>In front of everyone watching me, I was&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>“Ugh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Embarrassed, embarrassed, embarrassed!</p>
<p>As soon as I became aware of the gazes around me, I felt so much embarrassment that my eyes were burning.</p>
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no good. I know I shouldn&#8221;t be doing this, but I&#8221;m supposed to be doing this.</p>
<p>Regardless of my intentions, a hot drop of water started to trickle down from the back of my eyes, and I couldn&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>I finally lost control and a large drop fell from my right eye.</p>
<p>At that moment&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Don&#8217;t move.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I thought I heard a small whisper from Mashima-kun.</p>
</p>
<p>“Eh&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>The next moment, a handkerchief was placed on my right cheek.</p>
<p>The people surrounding us all burst out in unison, &#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I could do nothing but stare wide-eyed at Mashima-kun and freeze.</p>
<p>Huh? What happened to me just now?&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, it was a spur-of-the-moment conversation. I don&#8217;t know what happened, but I don&#8217;t think you want to be seen.”</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun muttered in a volume that only I could hear.</p>
<p>&#8230;That calm tone of voice, as usual.</p>
<p>His right hand, held behind a handkerchief.</p>
<p>It was so warm.</p>
</p>
<p>“The handkerchief is cheap, don&#8217;t give it back, let&#8217;s just move somewhere else for now.”</p>
</p>
<p>I just&#8230;</p>
<p>My right hand…</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun raised his voice.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Everyone around us peeled their eyes away.</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
</p>
<p>And I just froze, unable to comprehend the scene before me.</p>
<p>Time passed slowly, in slow motion.</p>
<p>And in the slow motion of time, I remembered a sentence from Imamote.</p>
</p>
<p>─ ─ The mirroring effect.</p>
<p>─ ─ Humans unconsciously perform the same behavior as those they like.</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;A…Ah…!?”</p>
</p>
<p>I finally understood the situation and my face turned pale.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because I had unconsciously placed my right hand on his cheek, just as Mashima-kun had wiped away my tears with a handkerchief.</p>
</p>
<p>What a strange scene!</p>
<p>A man and a woman facing each other, each with their right hand on the other&#8217;s cheek…</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Takane Saki&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>As expected, Mashima-kun could not hide his bewilderment at my strange behavior.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; eh, it&#8217;s different, Mashima-kun, this is&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>What is the difference? I don&#8217;t know either.</p>
<p>The only thing I am sure of is that shame and embarrassment like hot magma is bubbling up from the bottom of my stomach&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Eh? Are those two going to kiss?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>…The moment I heard such a voice from somewhere, the magma inside me finally erupted.</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;Kesaran Pasaran.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kesalan Pasalan is on&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kesalan Pasalan is on&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Bye, goodbye!!”</p>
<p>“Saki Takane!?</p>
</p>
<p>(TLN: Kesaran Pasaran… This is that white seedball from dandelions that floats. In some cultures you can make a wish with it. Japan treats them as living things… idk what to say. She probably wanted to say there was one on his cheek.)</p>
</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t stand even one more second under the eyes of the people around me, especially the curious eyes of Mashima-kun.</p>
<p>I turned on my heels as quickly as I could and ran down the hallway.</p>
<p>But…</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Saki Takane! Don&#8217;t run down the hallway!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I heard Mashima-kun&#8217;s voice calling out to me from behind.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Even in my panicked state of mind, I had enough time to think about the fact that Mashima-kun would hate me if I violated the school rules.</p>
</p>
<p>I panicked and applied the emergency brake, but this was not a good idea.</p>
</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
</p>
<p>I fell down in the middle of the hallway in front of everyone.</p>
<p>There was a huge gasp among the gathered crowd.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!? She fell!?”</p>
<p>&#8220;It looked like it hurt&#8230;”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What happened to Takane-san?”</p>
</p>
<p>I could hear everyone&#8217;s voices and I was no longer even embarrassed.</p>
<p>In addition, I even twisted my ankle when I fell, and the misery almost brought tears to my eyes again.</p>
</p>
<p>“Ugh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>What am I really, really doing&#8230;?</p>
<p>I just want to vanish into thin air&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>My mind was filled with such thoughts, and that&#8217;s when it happened.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Are you okay, Takane Saki?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Whaa!?”</p>
</p>
<p>I heard Mashima-kun&#8217;s voice from above,</p>
<p>I was honestly glad for his kindness, but at the same time I couldn’t&nbsp; let him see my face right now&#8230;!</p>
</p>
<p>“Sorry for yelling all of a sudden. You twisted your ankle, didn&#8217;t you? Can you stand?&#8221;</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
</p>
<p>I couldn’t even answer him because I was afraid if I opened my mouth I would start crying.</p>
<p>Then he, the kind man, probably assumed that I was &#8220;unable to speak because of the pain&#8221; or something like that.</p>
</p>
<p>“All right, hold on.”</p>
<p>“Whaa…?”</p>
</p>
<p>Before I could even comprehend what he meant, my body was lifted into the air.</p>
</p>
<p>“Eh…”</p>

<p>I could see everyone&#8217;s surprised faces.</p>
<p>I could see the two arms supporting my body.</p>
<p>Mashima-kun&#8217;s face was right there.</p>
</p>
<p>…I was being carried like a princess.</p>
</p>
<p>“~~~~~~~~Wha!?”</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll carry you to the infirmary! Everyone, scatter! Get out of the way!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>While everyone&#8217;s eyes were fixed on us, and strange cheers were pouring down on us.</p>
<p>I did not see Mashima-kun&#8217;s face even once until I was brought to the infirmary.</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun&#8217;s treatment was surprisingly fast and precise.</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;Yeah, this is about right.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>In no time at all, my ankle was patched and bandaged.</p>
</p>
<p>“When I was in junior high school, I used to do this a lot in club activities, and my hands remember it.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I was made to look rather obnoxious.</p>
<p>In front of everyone, I was princess-carried.</p>
<p>And had my bare feet treated by the person I liked.</p>
</p>
<p>I was indeed over the embarrassment threshold with a series of events that allowed me to experience a lifetime&#8217;s worth of embarrassment as a girl.</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Sitting on the bed in the infirmary, I thanked Mashima-kun for going out of his way to kneel on the floor to tend to my leg.</p>
</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry about it. By the way&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“You wanted to tell me something, right?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I kept my poker face on and smacked my forehead internally, &#8220;Ouch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The main purpose of talking to Mashima-kun this time was to practice the mirroring effect, and I had no idea what I wanted to &#8220;talk&#8221; about.</p>
</p>
<p>Mirroring each other&#8217;s hearts and minds, but with some kind of a lived, witty talk&#8230;</p>
<p>I could only resent my own shallowness in thinking such a thing.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Uh, you know,&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re going out of your way to talk to me, it&#8217;s probably about the last rumor, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard to say? But we&#8217;re in the infirmary and Shinjuku Sensei is out and won&#8217;t be back for a while. No one will hear you now.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;It definitely was hard to say.</p>
<p>It was getting to the point where I could no longer say, &#8220;I just wanted to have a chat with Mashima-kun!&#8221; in confidence!</p>
</p>
<p>Or rather, I was! I didn&#8217;t realize it, but I was alone with Mashima-kun in the infirmary right now!</p>
<p>Oh no! I&#8217;m getting nervous all of a sudden!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mashima-kun, um, I&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“If there&#8217;s anything I can do to help you, please don&#8217;t hesitate to tell me.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
</p>
<p>Aaahhh, I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t!</p>
<p>There is absolutely no way I can honestly communicate with Mashima-kun with such a serious expression on my face!</p>
<p>Above all, I don&#8217;t want to worry him any more!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I&#8217;m used to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m used to having strange rumors spread about me, so don&#8217;t worry about it, Mashima-kun. The Discipline Committee President is very busy and has other things to do&#8230;”</p>
<p>“&#8230;This is not true.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun looked me straight in the eyes and stated clearly.</p>
<p>&#8230;Oh, I forgot.</p>
<p>He was unashamedly, and to no end, straight to the point.</p>
<p>That he is someone who can say such cool things.</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;But since I&#8217;m not a psychic either, I can&#8217;t respond to something I wasn&#8217;t asked to consult about.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun stood up and turned his back to me.</p>
</p>
<p>“I will go for now, just let me know when you&#8217;re ready and I&#8217;ll be happy to talk to you. Take care.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>And with that, he left the infirmary.</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
</p>
<p>Left alone in the infirmary, I dropped my shoulders and sighed in relief.</p>
<p>I was so nervous all the time, and as expected, I was tired too…</p>
</p>
<p>“It was really embarrassing…”</p>
</p>
<p>Operation Mirroring was a complete failure.</p>
<p>The only redeeming thing was that apparently Mashima-kun still barely disliked me.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;What in the world went wrong?</p>
</p>
<p>“I need to go over it again&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I picked up the Imamote that had fallen under the bed&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;Strange.</p>
<p>Huh? Come to think of it, did I bring my Imamote to the infirmary?</p>
</p>
<p>In fact, this Imamote had no sticky notes on it, and it looked older than mine&#8230;?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, um&#8230; that&#8217;s my book…”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
</p>
<p>I turned towards the voice&#8230;</p>
<p>My eyes met those of a girl with long hair peering at me from behind the cream-colored curtain that separated my bed from the one next to it.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyaaaaaah!?”</p>
</p>
<p>I screamed.</p>
</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to scare you!”</p>
</p>
<p>She had long hair and she lowered her head in a panic.</p>
<p>My heart nearly stopped, but she…</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; H-&#8230;Hi-…Hirabayashi-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Haha, yes&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>The one who answered in a trembling voice was Keiko Hirabayashi, a student from Class 2A.</p>
<p>I had never spoken to her directly, but I had the impression that she was a mature girl&#8230; who was usually sitting in the corner of the classroom, always reading quietly by herself.</p>
</p>
<p>“I got a stomach ache during gym class, and I&#8217;ve been staying in here sleeping since then, but it seemed like Mashima-kun and Takane-san were going to start talking about something serious, I couldn&#8217;t leave the room…”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see…”</p>
</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t notice at all&#8230; and Mashima-kun didn&#8217;t seem to notice her either…</p>
<p>No, more importantly…</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;Is this yours, Hirabayashi-san?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I pointed to the Imamote I had just picked up from the floor.</p>
<p>She nodded her head and I immediately smiled!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hirabayashi-san, do you read this book too? Imamote?”</p>
</p>
<p>I asked, leaning forward.</p>
<p>Hirabayashi-san seemed surprised by my change at first.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yeah&#8230; for the time being.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I smiled even more when she answered.</p>
<p>Normally, Yuka has been constantly berating me about my book, saying things like, &#8220;stinky book&#8221; and &#8220;What is a romance creator?&#8221; but&#8230; I finally have a friend that reads Imamote!</p>
</p>
<p>I even felt like we&#8217;ve been friends for a decade, even though I&#8217;ve almost never actually spoken to her before!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m kind of glad to hear it, you&#8217;re like me&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, are you crying&#8230;? I heard rumors about you, Takane-san, but you are different from the person I had heard about…”</p>
<p>“I cry too! But more than that! It&#8217;s a great book, isn&#8217;t it!?”</p>
<p>“Is it? I guess so…”</p>
<p>“I knew it! Finally, someone who understands everything finally appeared&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
</p>
<p>I was moved and trembled with emotion.</p>
<p>Seeing me, Hirabayashi-san became silent and pondered for a moment, then suddenly&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Takane-san, do you like Mashima-kun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!? How did you know that&#8230;!?”</p>
</p>
<p>I started to think.</p>
<p>But then I thought back to the fact that it would be obvious if she saw me holding Imamote in my hand right after my earlier exchange with Mashima-kun.</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;Yes, that&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m ashamed to admit it.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Imamote&#8217;s goodwill.</p>
<p>I confided my secret to her, whom I had never spoken to before.</p>
<p>Then she said…</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230;Mashima-kun, I don&#8217;t think you should&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“Heh?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I felt like I was being poured cold water on my head by the shocking words uttered by Hirabayashi-san.</p>
<p>She looked somewhat downcast.</p>
<p>Could it be that…</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me that you’re also trying to get Mashima-kun to fall for you using the techniques you learned from Imamote?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s not true, I can&#8217;t stand guys taller than me.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Oh, I see…”</p>
</p>
<p>That&#8217;s unusual.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that, I warned you because Mashima-kun himself is the problem&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>As I was blushing from the failure of my theory, Hirabayashi-san spoke up again with a shocking line.</p>
</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s the problem?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t seem to know about it, but I&#8217;ve heard rumors about Mashima-kun…”</p>
<p>“Rumors about Mashima-kun…?”</p>
<p>“Takane-san is from&#8230; I believe it&#8217;s Kamikami Village, Murahigashi Junior High School, right? If so, don&#8217;t you know about it? That rumor&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>She said with a hint of dread in her voice, as if she was telling a ghost story, but unfortunately, this was really the first time I had heard of it.</p>
</p>
<p>“By the way, may I ask what kind of rumors you are referring to?”</p>
<p>“I heard that Kengo Mashima was such a delinquent in junior high school that even the teachers couldn&#8217;t handle him!”</p>
</p>
<p>The quiet and reserved Hirabayashi-san raised her voice, turning pale.</p>
</p>
<p>“He would break the windows of the school building and destroy other people&#8217;s belongings because he didn&#8217;t like them! I even heard a rumor that he was suspended from school for almost killing a classmate right in front of the teacher! I know they call him the &#8220;public morals freak&#8221; now, but that&#8217;s just a cover! His eyes are like a mad dog&#8217;s!”</p>
</p>
<p>She said in a single breath, and her shoulders rose and fell.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, was stunned.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mad dog&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I repeated Hirabayashi-san&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>Mad dog, mad dog&#8230; Mashima-kun, mad dog?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Pfa, ahahahaha!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry Hirabayashi-san, but I couldn&#8217;t help but burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Because it was just too funny! I couldn’t believe that story came across that way!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, what&#8230;!?”</p>
<p>“Sorry! I&#8217;m just trying&#8230;! I know where that rumor is from! I&#8217;ve never heard of &#8220;Mad Dog Mashima&#8221; before, but&#8230;!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“&#8230;Of course it&#8217;s a hoax! Mashima-kun is not that kind of person! In fact, I wouldn&#8217;t fall in love with someone that horrible! Not me!&#8221;</p>
<p>“A hoax&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s right!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>When I affirmed this, Hirabayashi-san&#8217;s shoulders relaxed.</p>
<p>I had an idea of the source of the rumor fire, but then I witnessed an amazing conversation&#8230;! My stomach is almost twisted&#8230;!</p>
<p>As I was laughing like this, Hirabayashi-san looked like she had been tricked by a fox.</p>
</p>
<p>“I think I may have misunderstood you, Takane-san.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221; I ask back, trying to hold back my laughter.</p>
</p>
<p>“I had an image of Takane-san as being calmer and not at all interested in romance…”</p>
<p>“Eh? Is that so?”</p>
</p>
<p>I unintentionally let my mouth hang open lazily.</p>
<p>Heh, I guess I seem cool to people, ehehehehehe, aren&#8217;t you a little taken back, Hirabayashi-san?</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8230; Oh, and I was also wrong about Mashima-kun. It&#8217;s a hoax&#8230;, isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m ashamed that I believed that hoax&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t remind me&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Kengo Mashima of Murahigashi Junior High School.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really too funny. I&#8217;ll have to tell Yuka about it later&#8230;!</p>
</p>
<p>“But I&#8217;m glad we cleared up the misunderstanding, because&#8230; it&#8217;s pretty scary if the current Discipline Committee President would have been suspended from school after almost killing a classmate…”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Oh, that much is true.”</p>
<p>“Wha…”</p>
</p>
<p>Hirabayashi-san&#8217;s face suddenly turned pale.</p>
<p>I was so amused by her reaction that I burst out once again.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>■Chapter: Kengo Mashima■</strong></p>
</p>
<p>After I finished treating Saki Takane, I came out of the infirmary.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; &#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I met with Kawariku Arakawa, who was leaning against the wall looking bored, and Tatsuki Iwasawa, who seemed to have just put his ear to the sliding door of the infirmary.</p>
</p>
<p>After a few moments of tension.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;It-&#8230;it&#8217;s different!?”</p>
</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t said anything yet, but Iwasawa started making excuses on his own.</p>
</p>
<p>“I was genuinely worried about Mashima-kun and Takane-san!&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t eavesdropping or anything! I wasn&#8217;t trying to be funny!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Eh? You told everyone that Kengo kissed Saki earlier, didn&#8217;t you?”</p>
<p>&#8220;You idiot, Arakawa, you&#8217;re squishing me!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>No questions asked, I shut down my short, gossipy, chatty best friends.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Don&#8217;t you ever mention such a ridiculous rumor again.&#8221;</p>
<p>“P-painful.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-oh&#8230; Tatsuki&#8217;s face is turning white like tofu…”</p>
<p>&#8220;Takane Saki just took a kesaran pasaran from my cheek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230;It is not Gezalan Bazalan&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Student Handbook, Section 1, “Daily Principles”. Always maintain dignity in speech, action and behavior, and do not be crude.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s selfish&#8230; It&#8217;s already funny and weird rumors are exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Okay.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I finally let go of Iwasawa.</p>
<p>Aside from Iwasawa crumpling to the floor like kelp washed up on the beach…</p>
</p>
<p>“Arakawa!”</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s wrong Kengo?”</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a strange rumor going around again!?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Eh? I was watching it too, but I thought you were going to kiss her rather seriously&#8230; Oh, no! I wonder why! That&#8217;s so weird!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Damn, what am I supposed to do&#8230;!”</p>
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to stop all the rumors about her since the incident at the school gate…</p>
</p>
<p>“Somehow! Every time I take action, there&#8217;s a new rumor!”</p>
<p>“Pure standouts, both Saki and Kengo.”</p>
<p>“&#8230; I had a&#8230; blind spot!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Arakawa&#8217;s statement was absolutely spot on. It was not only Saki Takane who was the center of attention.</p>
<p>I was no different in the sense that I am a bad publicity seeker.</p>
</p>
<p>“I wonder if it would be better for Saki Takane if I didn&#8217;t get involved with her at all in the future…”</p>
</p>
<p>There is a saying that goes, ‘A rumor lasts 75 days.’</p>
<p>After all, what else can we do but sit back and watch?</p>
<p>As I racked my brains like that, I heard&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>“No, I don&#8217;t think so&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Arakawa said matter-of-factly.</p>
</p>
<p>“Why, why?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve heard some of the rumors about Saki before, but many of them were terrible, you know? Something like that.”</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Well, I can&#8217;t deny that.”</p>
<p>“But the rumors about Saki that are going around now are pretty cute compared to that, aren&#8217;t they? Kengo confessed his feelings for her, kissed her, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>“&#8230;Mmm.”</p>
</p>
<p>That being said, is that so?</p>
<p>Certainly the rumors and accusations being circulated did nothing to discredit Takane Saki herself&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230; Or perhaps the subject of the rumors has somehow been switched from &#8220;Takane Saki&#8221; to &#8220;me&#8221;!</p>
</p>
<p>Also, I never tried to kiss her!</p>
</p>
<p>“I think your actions may have helped to overwrite the rumors.”</p>
<p>“Even if that&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s dishonest to overwrite one false rumor with another! And nobody wants to be the subject of a rumor about a person they don&#8217;t like!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm~~~ well, in general, that&#8217;s true…”</p>
</p>
<p>Arakawa seemed somewhat baffled.</p>
</p>
<p>“I wonder what Saki came to talk to Kengo about after all…”</p>
<p>“Again with the obvious.”</p>
</p>
<p>There is only one reason why Saki Takane would approach me, the Discipline Committee President.</p>
</p>
<p>“Of course she came to me for advice about the last rumor. I&#8217;m sure she must have summoned up a lot of courage. And when the onlookers were swarming around her, she was so emotional that she started cr-…”</p>
<p>“Oh, what?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I decided to keep the crying part to myself.</p>
<p>I was unworthy. When I thought of how Saki Takane was feeling, I felt ashamed of my inability to even consult with her. What was I supposed to do &#8220;to improve public morals and maintain public order on campus&#8221; after making a student cry?</p>
<p>I must fulfill my duties as the Discipline Committee President.</p>
</p>
<p>“In any case, the Discipline Committee members must continue their investigation into the defamation of Saki Takane! That&#8217;s all! Now, go away!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey.&#8221;</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
</p>
<p>I told Arakawa (and Iwasawa, who was stretching), and&#8230; slowly touched my own cheek.</p>
</p>
<p>“Eh? Kengo, what are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I was wondering if there was any more Kesaran Pasaran left&#8230;&#8221;</p>
