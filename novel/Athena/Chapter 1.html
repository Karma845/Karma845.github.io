<h2>Chapter 1: Why Is It Bright Red?</h2>

<p>“…It’s the girl who just walked into the classroom. …You know, I’ve been thinking of asking her out to hang out. Not with everyone, just the two of us…!”</p>
<p>“Wow… I’ve heard you talk about it, but finally.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! …So please! Give me courage, Kuuya!”</p>
<p>With a clap, my friend from middle school put his hands together in prayer.</p>
<p>“I know it’s pathetic, but I want to know if I have a chance… Please! Use your special skill to help me!”</p>
<p>“Of course, leave it to me. …Just go and have a casual chat with her. I’ll watch from here.”</p>
<p>“Whoa, thank you! I owe you one! —Alright! Let’s do this…”</p>
<p>After the home room at the end of the day was over, in the classroom after school.</p>
<p>My friend, Hatsuse Yūji, gathers his courage and walks toward the girl he’s interested in.</p>
<p>“Ah, Nakabayashi, I submitted those committee documents to the teacher earlier. He said to check them by next week.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Hatsuse. Thanks~. So, how did the teacher react? Does it seem okay?”</p>
<p>“Mmm… well…”</p>
<p>“What? It doesn’t sound good?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry, just teasing. It seemed fine.”</p>
<p>Yūji laughed as he said that. The girl, his love interest, playfully slapped his shoulder, saying, “Geez, you meanie—!”</p>
<p>She’s definitely from the next class over, right? For now, Yūji seems to be friends with her. …But what about as the opposite sex?</p>
<p>I—Miyashiro Kuuya—focused my attention from my seat, observing the two as they talked intimately.</p>
<p>My focus wasn’t on Yūji but the girl he was talking to. From her, a misty haze began to appear within my field of view.</p>
<p>The mist was orange-colored. Oh, this is…!</p>
<p>Eventually, Yūji returned to where I was.</p>
<p>“Kuuya! How… how was it?”</p>
<p>He asked in a hushed voice. I responded in kind.</p>
<p>“Yūji, well, mmm… well…”</p>
<p>“What? It doesn’t look good?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry, just teasing.”</p>
<p>“Come on! That’s the same trick I pulled on Nakabayashi earlier.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you noticed. I thought it’d serve as proof that I was really watching you two.”</p>
<p>As I said that, “I don’t need that!” Yūji shook his head.</p>
<p>“But to give you a straight answer… it looks promising.”</p>
<p>“! …Really?”</p>
<p>“It’s not quite at the level of outright liking you as the opposite sex, but it’s close. It’s definitely within the realm of possibility. …Ah, but of course, this is just what I think, no guarantees.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no, your ability to judge these things has a proven track record, I trust you. How many times have you been consulted before?”</p>
<p>“Uh, about thirty times?”</p>
<p>“And how often were you wrong?”</p>
<p>“…So far, not once.”</p>
<p>“See! There you go! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!”</p>
<p>Yūji was clearly elated, repeatedly doing victory poses. Watching him, I couldn’t help but smile too.</p>
<p>Yūji is a really good friend. He’s kind and considerate, though I’m too shy to say it often, I’m always grateful to him.</p>
<p>I’d be happy if things worked out for him.</p>
<p>“I wish you luck, Yūji.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Thanks a ton! Just like I declared, I’ll ask her out!”</p>
<p>After a bit more light conversation, Yūji left. He seemed to be heading to club activities.</p>
<p>Well, it’s about time I get going too.</p>
<p>After-school time is precious, and it’ll be gone before you know it. There are lots of things to do before tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thinking this, I reached for my bag hanging beside my desk when…</p>
<p>“Data processing looks pretty heavy.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you tired? Being made to observe such non-linear things as humans and human emotions.”</p>
<p>The one who spoke was the girl sitting next to me.</p>
<p>“…Ah, eh, you’re talking to me, right?”</p>
<p>“Is there any other reasonable possibility?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, it’s just been a while since I heard your voice. …About a week?”</p>
<p>“By my recollection, it’s been eleven days since I last spoke to Miyashiro-kun, and by extension, anyone in this class.”</p>
<p>“No wonder. I was surprised. So, what was it? Are you asking if I’m tired? Well, not really… Did you hear our conversation just now?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I just happened to overhear.”</p>
<p>“I see. That makes sense.”</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine her eavesdropping on purpose, so it must have truly been by accident.</p>
<p>She was seated in seat by windows, even though we were talking she doesn’t face me during our conversation, looking outside instead.</p>
<p>It seems less about wanting to see the outside scenery and more about not wanting to observe the classroom’s interior. That’s just the kind of person she is.</p>
<p>“Your ‘chance of success’ judgment is quite a special skill.”</p>
<p>“More like… well, yeah.”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/00007.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>There aren’t many people who know the details about that special skill of mine.</p>
<p>To those around us, it’s perceived as “being able to somewhat guess whether a relationship between a non-dating man and woman will develop.” It’s sort of like fortune-telling.</p>
<p>Because of its accuracy, like Yūji earlier, I’m occasionally asked to judge the potential of a relationship.</p>
<p>…In reality, it’s not just about seeing if there’s a chance or not. But explaining it all might scare people off, so I refrain from doing so.</p>
<p>“It’s just me sharing my impressions based on a gut feeling. It’s not that big of a deal.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? I think it’s quite significant. To be able to gauge the chaotic nature of human romantic feelings from the outside…”</p>
<p>“Chaotic?”</p>
<p>“Not just chaotic. Not limited to romantic feelings, but human emotions… or rather, the human system itself is frankly chaotic.”</p>
<p>With a nonchalant tone, it’s clear this is her honest opinion.</p>
<p>She rested her cheek on her hand. Then, for the first time, her face turned slightly towards me.</p>
<p>“Dealing with another as an input-output system, there are too many parameters, no power-law behavior, and the initial condition sensitivity is ridiculously high. System identification is impossible. Unstable, non-linear, unreasonable… Don’t you think humans are just too difficult to handle?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, what you’re saying is a bit too complex for me…”</p>
<p>She’s the top in the nation for science subjects in mock exams. Apparently, she also has practical technical skills, though I don’t know the details. Rumor has it she makes a lot of money with some computer-related work at night while still in high school.</p>
<p>Her vocabulary often includes words unfamiliar to my ears, leaving me puzzled at times.</p>
<p>“Communication with others is just a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p>“People often say communication is troublesome, but it’s rare to find someone who barely talks to their classmates to such an extent. For most of the class, the only words they’ve heard from you are ‘Sorry, I’m not interested.'”</p>
<p>“It’s made people less likely to talk to me.”</p>
<p>Moreover, there’s another reason why she’s not approached much by our classmates.</p>
<p>Simply put, they’re intimidated.</p>
<p>…Meeting her taught me that humans can indeed feel overwhelmed by beauty.</p>
<p>Her long eyelashes frame her slender eyes, her skin seems to glow faintly, and her straight nose and cherry-colored lips are perfectly placed on her face.</p>
<p>Her beautiful black hair, which sometimes appears red depending on the light, suits her terribly well.</p>
<p>No matter how many times I see her, having such a universally acknowledged genius beauty next to me in class seems like a mistake.</p>
<p>—However.</p>


<p>But even so, her nickname in school wasn’t about her intelligence or her beauty…</p>
<p>“Human-hater. Hey, Miyashiro-kun, I’m called that by everyone, right? I’m rather grateful for it. If they keep their distance, it reduces the noise in my daily life. A good S/N ratio is maintained.”</p>
<p>This is her, Kujo Kurenai.</p>
<p>“If you say so…”</p>
<p>“Yes. Besides, it’s not like I don’t talk at all. Look, I’m talking with you, Miyashiro-kun, right now.”</p>
<p>“It’s been eleven days. If you can talk like this when you want to, you should do it more often.”</p>
<p>“Miyashiro-kun, ‘being capable if I try’ and ‘so exhausting I never want to do it again’ are mutually independent. They can coexist.”</p>
<p>“That’s certainly true.”</p>
<p>“Right?”</p>
<p>Sighing wearily, Kujo-san let out a sigh. Her beauty and proportions added allure to her gestures.</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s right. I wanted to say thank you to you, Miyashiro-kun. It’s been sixty-two days since I last talked with any classmate other than you.”</p>
<p>“That’s almost as long as summer and winter vacations combined.”</p>
<p>“The reason I can go so long without talking to others is all thanks to you, Miyashiro-kun. Everyone in the class communicates with me through you.”</p>
<p>“Since we sit next to each other, and we talk from time to time. Can you pass this on for me?” —I’m frequently asked like that.</p>
<p>Even if I say they could just tell you themselves, everyone awkwardly smiles and says, “No, well, you know, uh… it’s kind of nerve-wracking…”</p>
<p>“Does that mean I’m doing the talking with the classmates that Kujo-san should be doing?”</p>
<p>“I’d like you to think of it as doing me a favor. It’s much easier to communicate with just one specific person, Miyashiro-kun, than dealing with various people each time. It’s extremely efficient. The best strategy for school life.”</p>
<p>Kujo-san paused, turning her face clearly towards me. Her beautiful eyes captured mine.</p>
<p>“Thank you, I’m really grateful.”</p>
<p>“O-oh…”</p>
<p>“I’ve been meaning to say thanks for a while… sorry, it’s just been too much trouble.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>The mood was completely ruined by the end. I thought so but didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>Whether she sensed my dismay or not, she then said, “Please relax.”</p>
<p>“I’m not shameless enough to settle for just words of thanks. I’ve prepared proper compensation.”</p>
<p>“Compensation?”</p>
<p>“If Miyashiro-kun takes the messages for me and relays them here, how about I pay you 10,000 yen per message?”</p>
<p>“I think that’s a bit much.”</p>
<p>“Ah, do you prefer a subscription model? Very modern. How about 50,000 yen a month?”</p>
<p>“It’s not about the method. The amount just feels too unreal.”</p>
<p>She seemed serious, so I had to firmly refuse.</p>
<p>“Kujo-san, I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>
<p>“Is it the exchange of money?”</p>
<p>“It’s the way you’re mention it that makes it feel worse.”</p>
<p>“If money is not acceptable then… no, sorry, I’d really appreciate it if you could spare me the physical compensation.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want anything like that.”</p>
<p>I’m not so noble as to demand physical recompense from a female classmate.</p>
<p>“If you’re talking about thanks… well, you lent me your power bank that time, right? When my phone was about to die. That’s more than enough.”</p>
<p>“That was… no, it’s nothing. But that’s not enough.”</p>
<p>“Plus, Kujo-san, whenever we talk, you always ‘by the way’ give me some insider information. Like sales on things I wanted, or limited tickets for interesting exhibitions. Stuff like that.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m really grateful for that, so let’s call it even. I don’t know how you always have information that hits the mark for me──”</p>
<p>“I’m a social misfit who wanders the internet all year round, so I have a lot of information. That’s all there is to it. That’s the kind of social misfit I am.”</p>
<p>“Don’t throw such heavy self-deprecation at me so fast, I can’t catch it all.”</p>
<p>“And I also do stocks, so I get a lot of information from that. Stocks are important.”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay, I get it! My bad, I understand! Kujo-san, you sometimes talk so fast…”</p>
<p>“Talking fast increases the amount of information transmitted per unit of time, making it more efficient.”</p>
<p>Though she spoke with a cool expression, her hands were restlessly moving.</p>
<p>I might have stepped on a landmine I shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>“Anyway, if you want to thank me, that kind of stuff is the most helpful.”</p>
<p>“Is that so. Well, for my peaceful high school life, please continue to support me in the future. By the way, you’re happy with the museum ticket info, right? That interest is typical of an artist.”</p>
<p>“I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Modesty. Maybe I should say, Japan’s number one genius high school artist.”</p>
<p>“Please stop… It was just a fluke last year.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? I don’t understand art, so I wouldn’t know.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Kujo-san picked up her bag and stood up.</p>
<p>“I’ve said what I needed to, and my daily communication energy is depleted, so I’ll be going home.”</p>
<p>“I see. …Goodbye, see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Goodbye. Let’s talk again in about ten days, if necessary.”</p>
<p>“We’re sitting next to each other, we could chat even if it’s not necessary.”</p>
<p>“I’m not that kind of creature. Sorry.”</p>
<p>Kujo-san walked towards the classroom exit with her long legs. As she passed by me, a sweet scent wafted through the air.</p>
<p>Kujo-san, huh.</p>
<p>She feels distant.</p>
<p>Despite only becoming neighbors by chance and conversing more than with other students, our interactions were still limited to about once every ten days. Her way of speaking was blunt, and her expression, cool.</p>
<p>A genius girl who dislikes humans, that’s Kujo Kurenai— or so it should be.</p>
<p>“…Hey, Kujo-san.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>At the classroom entrance, Kujo-san stopped and turned around, her gestures lazy, her expression bored.</p>
<p>Now, there were no other students in the classroom. Her attention was undoubtedly focused solely on me.</p>
<p>I concentrated hard and “looked” at her.</p>
<p>From within my field of vision, and emanating from Kujo-san’s body, the color of the haze that appeared was…</p>
<p>“Miyashiro-kun? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“…No, it’s nothing. See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“…? Okay, see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>With her soft, long hair swaying, Kujo-san left.</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>Shaking my head, I rubbed the area around my eyes.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a misunderstanding before, maybe I saw it wrong… While thinking this, no matter how many times I checked, the result was the same.</p>
<p>The color that appeared from Kujo-san, when she directed her consciousness towards me, was the one I feared the most among the myriad colors of this world.</p>


<p>Why, why? Why…</p>
<p>Why is it bright red?</p>
<p>I couldn’t understand the reason at all.</p>
<p>The same color as her name, a deep and vivid red like blood.</p>
<p>It’s a color that shouldn’t appear from a blunt, human-disliking classmate—a definitive sign of interest, the color of love and affection.</p>
<p>If my “eyes” aren’t mistaken, it means that I am liked by Kujo-san as a romantic interest.</p>
<p>…That’s supposed to be impossible. After all, we don’t even talk that much. It must be some mistake. Maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>Even if, hypothetically, that color was true, I am—</p>
<p>“…Nah, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Shaking my head, I stood up from my seat.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>

<p>“Alright, there.”</p>
<p>I set up the canvas on the easel and prepared the rest of the tools. I’ve also changed into overalls that I don’t mind getting dirty.</p>
<p>The place is the art room. I’m the only one here.</p>
<p>After school, I spend most of my days here painting.</p>
<p>There’s no art club at the prefectural Itozumi High School I attend, but the school has given me special permission to use this room.</p>
<p>If I can’t produce results this year, I wonder if I’ll lose access to this place. If that happens, I guess I can’t help it.</p>
<p>In a corner of the art room, there’s a trophy on display. Engraved on its base are the words, “First Shinsei Sansen Prize, Grand Prize.”</p>
<p>This trophy was won by me last summer at a newly established national art competition meant to determine “Japan’s best high school artist,” in the oil painting category.</p>
<p>The reason I can use this art room is mainly due to this achievement.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m surprised I won it as a first-year. It must have been mostly luck.</p>
<p>“…The painting for the competition, huh?”</p>
<p>I muttered to myself as I scratched my head.</p>
<p>It’s mid-June now. The deadline for the competition entries is the beginning of August. I should have started painting my entry by now.</p>
<p>I know, but… hmm…</p>
<p>The painting I’m currently focused on isn’t for the competition.</p>
<p>It’s another painting that I feel I must finish first, no matter what.</p>
<p>“…Yeah, no.”</p>
<p>I’ve decided to finish what I’m currently working on first. The competition painting can wait. No matter how much I agonize over it, I always come to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>After lightly slapping my cheeks with both hands, I gripped the paintbrush and held up the palette.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I started painting. Once I entered that state, my sense of time vanished.</p>
<p>“Hmm… and…”</p>
<p>As my consciousness returned from the world of painting to reality, I stretched out.</p>
<p>──Wow, I did quite a bit.</p>
<p>Checking the clock on the wall, about two hours had passed. The painting was nearing completion. Things were going smoothly.</p>
<p>“Hmm… huh? Oh no!”</p>
<p>While basking in a sense of satisfaction, I noticed a sound from outside the window.</p>
<p>Rushing to the window, I checked outside. Just as I thought, it was raining.</p>
<p>Opening the window and sticking my hand out, I found the rain wasn’t too heavy. On the opposite ground, the formidable baseball team was practicing as if to say, “This isn’t even considered rain.”</p>
<p>But rain is rain… I didn’t bring an umbrella!</p>
<p>It takes about twenty minutes to walk home from here. Even if it’s just a drizzle, I’ll be soaked by the time I get home.</p>
<p>While the painting is going well, this situation isn’t good.</p>
<p>“Ah… this isn’t good.”</p>
<p>Sadly, I’m not very confident in my physical condition. Even getting soaked on the way home might easily affect my health.</p>
<p>That would interfere with my painting.</p>
<p>My parents have been gone for years, and my grandparents live far away. Living alone, I don’t have family members who could come to pick me up.</p>
<p>“…What should I do?”</p>
<p>However, given the circumstances, my only option might be to make a break for it before the rain gets worse.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to resign myself to that fate…</p>
<p>“Kuuya, are you there~!? Can I come in~!?”</p>
<p>Konkonkonkon! With the energetic sound of knocking, such a voice could be heard.</p>
<p>“Oh? Yeah, I’m here. Come on in.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m glad you’re still here! Excuse me for intruding!”</p>
<p>The one who opened the door and entered was a female student.</p>
<p>Her wide-eyed gaze was full of energy, and her brightly colored hair accentuated that impression.</p>
<p>Though petite, her figure had curves in all the right places, exuding a healthy charm.</p>
<p>However, what captivated me the most was her always straight and neatly extended posture. It revealed a refinement and good upbringing that couldn’t be completely hidden by her vivaciousness.</p>
<p>Seeing what she was holding in her hand, my eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>“…Ah, that.”</p>
<p>“Yes! I’m so glad you haven’t left yet, Kuuya, I made it in time!”</p>
<p>The girl said, raising the umbrella she was holding.</p>
<p>“Let’s go home together! This umbrella is big enough for both of us!”</p>
<p>A brilliant smile bloomed, so bright it could be recognized from a hundred meters away. Even though it was rainy and gloomy outside, her surroundings seemed bright.</p>
<p>“That’s a lifesaver! Thank you, Suika!”</p>
<p>Ado Suika.</p>
<p>She’s a first-year student, one year junior to me, and my childhood friend.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for making you hold the umbrella…”</p>
<p>“Let me do this much. I’m taller than you, after all.”</p>
<p>We changed our shoes at the entrance and walked under one umbrella through the rainy school grounds. The school premises were vast, so the school gate was a bit far.</p>
<p>“What were you doing until this time, Suika?”</p>
<p>“I was explaining the quiz to my classmates! Then, I went to help the girls’ basketball team, and in between, I had some student council work too.”</p>
<p>“As always, you’re being pulled in every direction. Being able to go home together with such a popular person, I feel unworthy. How lucky am I?”</p>
<p>“You don’t think that at all!”</p>
<p>“I do, I do. How grateful I am.”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah-wwww! Stop it, Kuuya!”</p>
<p>When I put my hand on her head and ruffled her soft hair, she made a sulky face and glared at me with a “Enough!”</p>
<p>Suika’s expressions are always comically clear.</p>
<p>“It’s true that Suika is popular. A celebrity in the school.”</p>
<p>“That’s not… anything special…”</p>
<p>Despite her modesty, Suika is indeed well-known within the school, even as a first-year. She is beloved and admired.</p>
<p>Even without my bias as her childhood friend, I think it’s natural.</p>
<p>Bright and light-hearted, yet a serious hard worker and a top student across all subjects. Moreover, she’s good at any sport, attracting constant requests for help from sports clubs due to her athletic abilities.</p>
<p>Her communication skills are outstanding, making friends across classes and grades, well-liked and active. She was even scouted for the student council executive committee right after enrollment.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it’s quite impressive.</p>
<p>Loving and loved by everyone, always at the center of attention. That’s the girl named Ado Suika.</p>
<p>Incidentally, her family background is also excellent. She’s the heir to the Ado family, renowned in this area.</p>


<p>“…Kuuya? What’s wrong? You’re staring at me.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>Though I joked about feeling unworthy a moment ago, that wasn’t entirely a lie.</p>
<p>“Hmm, are you tired? Were you painting non-stop without any breaks?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I was so focused that I got startled by the rain.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>Suika frowned thoughtfully and spoke in a muffled tone.</p>
<p>“It’s good to be dedicated, but you must take breaks appropriately. It’s no use if you wear yourself out. I’ve always known how you can’t stop once you get focused…”</p>
<p>“Is that so… Yeah, maybe you’re right.”</p>
<p>“That’s right! After all, Kuuya, you always work too hard! I’m really worried about you. The most important thing is to take care of your own body, so please, be more… Ah, there’s a puddle ahead! Be careful.”</p>
<p>“Oops, thanks.”</p>
<p>“No problem. Also, please tilt the umbrella more towards you. If your shoulder gets wet, it’ll be bad for your health! If you’re already wet, I have a handkerchief.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, I’m not wet.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. Suika has always been like this since we were kids.</p>
<p>Worrying about me, who’s not very physically robust and tends to neglect self-care when engrossed in painting, she always takes extra care of me.</p>
<p>However, I shouldn’t worry her too much or cause her trouble… Just as I was thinking that.</p>
<p>“Sorry, move out of the wayyyy!!”</p>
<p>──What!?</p>
<p>A loud voice echoed from the ground. I turned towards the voice, my body freezing.</p>
<p>A baseball was hurtling towards us with great force. The strong baseball team, continuing their practice despite the rain, must have hit a foul ball or something.</p>
<p>It was on a direct collision course. In less than a second, it would hit my head. All I could do was predict that. It seemed unavoidable.</p>
<p>In a corner of my mind, I thought, “I’m glad I was walking on the ground side.”</p>
<p>It’s a small mercy; Suika won’t get hit──</p>
<p>“…Hmph.”</p>
<p>Bachin, a powerful sound echoed.</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/00008.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>It wasn’t a scream that escaped my mouth. After all, the ball hadn’t hit me.</p>
<p>“Really! It’s fine to be dedicated to club activities, but, uh, no, putting others in danger is not commendable!”</p>
<p>Suika, who had somehow moved to the ground side without me noticing, had… caught the baseball with her bare hand. She didn’t drop or deflect it, and she did it with one hand.</p>
<p>“Ah,” she let out a voice and turned back to me in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Kuuya, did any mud splash on you!?”</p>
<p>“…No, no, no! What are you worrying about me for! Catching a baseball with such force barehanded…! Is your hand not injured!?”</p>
<p>Even as I said that, I knew. Still, she was concerned about me, my childhood friend.</p>
<p>…And then.</p>
<p>“Injured, you say? How insulting! It’s extremely insulting, Kuuya!”</p>
<p>Suika sharply raised her well-shaped eyebrows.</p>
<p>“──As if! As if a mere soft ball could best the well-trained right hand of an Ado woman!”</p>
<p>Gichigichigichigichii, the baseball in Suika’s grip let out a noise.</p>
<p>…Yes.</p>
<p>My childhood friend, who takes great care of me with her kindness, boasts an extraordinary physical ability far beyond the norm. That’s Ado Suika.</p>
<p>“…Soft, you say… That’s a hardball, right?”</p>
<p>“Melon bread doesn’t contain melon, and crab bread doesn’t contain crab. Names and reality are different.”</p>
<p>“True, cucumber rolls don’t have cucumbers wrapped in them, but I’m not sure about that logic…”</p>
<p>“Ah, but Kuuya, you must never catch a ball barehanded! It’s dangerous! And you’re not dirty, right? Show me your face and clothes. I hope everything’s okay…”</p>
<p>“I’m not dirty, I’m not, so it’s not me but Suika that… I know Suika is strong or, how should I say, extraordinary, but ah, my clothes got a bit wet from the rain…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about my clothes… Oh, I need to return the ball!”</p>
<p>Suika swiftly turned towards the baseball field. A baseball team member, looking apologetic, was running towards us.</p>
<p>“Um, sorry about that! Are you hurt!?”</p>
<p>“We’re fine! Here it goes!”</p>
<p>“Eh? O-Okay… Woah, seriously!?”</p>
<p>Along with a satisfying sound, the baseball player’s voice of astonishment reached us.</p>
<p>It was understandable.</p>
<p>Despite the considerable distance from us to him, Suika’s throw reached him without a single bounce, almost in a straight line rather than a parabola.</p>
<p>What’s more incredible is that the ball, without deviating in the slightest, was sucked straight into the glove of the baseball player, who had been called out by Suika. It wasn’t just power, but precise control.</p>
<p>“…Bravo.”</p>
<p>“It’s a tradition of the Ado women. In times of need, to be able to crush the head of a rascal with a stone rolling nearby…!”</p>
<p>“That’s impressive, but your worldview is kind of off.”</p>
<p>Notably, Suika wasn’t joking.</p>
<p>Her family, the Ado, had built their fortune in business during the Meiji era, but they were originally a renowned samurai family.</p>
<p>This spirit and tradition are still passed down today, and as the heir, Suika has been rigorously trained in all manner of martial arts. Whether stone throwing is included among the martial arts, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>“Well, that settles that. Let’s get back to our conversation.”</p>
<p>“What were we talking about again? That shocking scene just wiped my memory…”</p>
<p>“It’s a very important conversation about taking better care of yourself!”</p>
<p>“Why are you saying that after catching a hardball with your bare hands…”</p>
<p>Muttering that, I realized I hadn’t conveyed something crucial yet.</p>
<p>“Sorry, before that. Suika, thank you. You really saved me.”</p>
<p>“It’s for moments like these that Ado women train!”</p>
<p>Suika smiled cheerfully, wiping what seemed to be a slightly dirty hand with a handkerchief she pulled out.</p>
<p>The gesture was elegant, making the scene of her catching the hardball with her bare hand seem like a lie.</p>
<p>“Look, Kuuya, you really should take better care of yourself… You’re always overdoing it, especially when someone asks for your help.”</p>
<p>“Well, I do it because I love painting…”</p>
<p>“But, is the painting you’re currently working on at school really for yourself?”</p>
<p>That question made it hard for me to respond sharply.</p>
<p>“Well, that one is also one of the paintings I wanted to do… but.”</p>
<p>“It’s not something you chose to do on your own, right? Because you were asked to do it again, weren’t you? Where is it for this time? Last time it was a hospital, right?”</p>
<p>Suika sees through everything concerning me. Resigned, I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“The one I’m working on now is for an orphanage… or I guess they don’t call it that anymore, a child welfare institution. You know, the place just off the national road.”</p>
<p>“I see… Kuuya, that’s a wonderful thing to do.”</p>
<p>“I hope so.”</p>


<p>The paintings I work on are often commissions from others.</p>
<p>My clients include kindergartens, nurseries, community centers, hospitals, and child welfare institutions.</p>
<p>I’ve completed dozens of such projects.</p>
<p>It all started when a doctor friend of mine shared his concern: “It would be nice to have something that can reassure my patients…”</p>
<p>Wondering what I could do, I came up with the concept of healing paintings that could calm viewers, and donated a piece that was well-received.</p>
<p>The painting, displayed in the waiting room, was highly praised by patients for its calming effect, seemingly working wonders.</p>
<p>From there, word of mouth led to requests from various facilities that cater to people prone to anxiety, and I’ve been asked to create more paintings ever since.</p>
<p>“Putting the competition piece aside, pushing through even when you’re feeling unwell… You’ve always been that kind of person.”</p>
<p>“…I understand a bit of the loneliness of not having parents and the pain of being sick. If I can be of help, I want to be.”</p>
<p>“That’s very admirable. There’s no painting that touches people’s hearts as much as yours.”</p>
<p>As we spoke, we passed through the school gate and walked down the gentle slope.</p>
<p>“I’m not exaggerating. Many people, including myself, have been saved by your work. And there will be more in the future. The paintings you’ve donated surely bring peace to many.”</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Inserting those words, Suika said quietly, very seriously.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice yourself for it. Absolutely not. Please, take care of yourself.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you. I’ll try to be more careful.”</p>
<p>“Please do!”</p>
<p>Truly, I think… If it weren’t for me, it might have been a problem.</p>
<p>Anyone would misunderstand if they received such kindness.</p>
<p>Suika is caring towards everyone, but she offers a special kind of attention to me, distinct from others.</p>
<p>One might normally think, given all her kindness, that she harbors romantic feelings…</p>
<p>But I’m certain that the feelings Suika harbors for me are not of romantic love.</p>
<p>I quickly concentrate and “see” Suika. The haze emanating from her is a deep green.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s always been this color.</p>
<p>—My eyes can “see” human emotions as colors.</p>
<p>More precisely, I can recognize the feelings a person has towards someone else as colors.</p>
<p>For example, green for friendship, purple for hostility, blue for dislike. And red for love.</p>
<p>I can understand who thinks what about whom.</p>
<p>This isn’t some kind of psychic ability but rather a kind of synesthesia born from observational skills, I believe.</p>
<p>From gestures, expressions, tones of voice, and more, I unconsciously gauge people’s feelings, which my brain then recognizes as colors.</p>
<p>I’m confident in my observational skills, and it makes sense to me that I perceive the results as colors. After all, I’m a painter.</p>
<p>I dedicate my life to observing the world and recreating it in colors.</p>
<p>“Kuuya? What’s wrong? …Ah, are you cold? Don’t tell me you’re feeling unwell…”</p>
<p>“No, I’m fine, really fine. Sorry, just lost in thought for a moment.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>Suika sighs in relief.</p>
<p>The green emanating from her signifies friendship, and its deep intensity shows the strength of her feelings.</p>
<p>Suika has, without ever wavering, continued to direct unwavering friendship towards me.</p>
<p>Despite often being misunderstood by those around us, the possibility of Suika harboring romantic love or affection for me, as far as the colors I “see” are concerned, is virtually nonexistent.</p>
<p>And that’s something I’m grateful for.</p>
<p>Not because it would be a nuisance if Suika felt that way about me. It’s not about Suika at all, but rather…</p>
<p>I’m frightened of love itself.</p>
<p>It’s a terrifying, monstrous thing that once took my parents away from me.</p>
<p>…But if that’s the case.</p>
<p>“Kuuya?”</p>
<p>Having Kujo-san by my side is dangerous for me… No, but Kujo-san being red, that must surely be some kind of mistake, right?</p>
<p>“Kuuya, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Doubting the colors I see is something I find inherently difficult… But surely, that must be an exception.</p>
<p>No, however, but… Hmm…</p>
<p>“Kuuya!”</p>
<p>“Oops, ah, my bad my bad.”</p>
<p>“Really, you’ve been acting strange since a while ago. That’s worrying!”</p>
<p>“Fair point. But it would be rude to call it a worry.”</p>
<p>“Rude? So, it’s about someone then.”</p>
<p>Suika can be shockingly sharp sometimes, it makes me jump.</p>
<p>“Who is it? …I won’t force you to tell me, though.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, well, I have my own stuff going on. Don’t worry, it’s not trouble or anything.”</p>
<p>“If you say so… Kuuya.”</p>
<p>Suika smiles brightly.</p>
<p>“I’m always on your side, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve been saved by you since way back.”</p>
<p>“It makes me happy to hear you say that. So, …if something happens, make sure I’m the first one you talk to, okay!”</p>
<p>Truly, Suika is reliable and incredibly kind.</p>
<p>She’s a very good friend who cares deeply about her friends. That’s something I believe without a doubt.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>“It’s a movie that both of you wanted to see, and it just so happens to be playing. It might be a cliché date plan, but hey.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine. Clichés are classic, right?”</p>
<p>“Right? Hehe, seriously, thank you, Kuuya.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome.”</p>
<p>At night, in my room.</p>
<p>The call was from my friend, Yuuji, who had just managed to set up a date with the girl he liked.</p>
<p>“What movie are you guys watching?”</p>
<p>“The remake of ‘Dead or Hard.’ Nakabayashi likes action movies, it seems.”</p>
<p>“That one, huh. You wanted to see it too.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. I’ve been saying I wanted to see it, and… you kept turning me down every time I invited you!”</p>
<p>“My bad.”</p>
<p>I apologize with a wry smile to Yuuji, who sounded a bit grumpy.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re busy. Your paintings are popular after all, Kuuya. But I get it, I don’t know much about art, but even I can tell your work is something special.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s nice to hear. How about it then? Would you like to make a purchase?”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll buy it cheap and sell it for a fortune later! …But seriously, it might really become a treasure in the future, you know…?”</p>
<p>“No way.”</p>
<p>“It will! There’s no way it wouldn’t. You’re definitely going to be a famous artist in the future.”</p>
<p>Yuuji’s voice carried a serious tone. He occasionally says things like this with sincerity.</p>
<p>Flattered and a bit embarrassed, I changed the subject.</p>
<p>“So, what’s the plan after the movie?”</p>
<p>“I was thinking of grabbing some tea somewhere. After that, no plans. Do you know any good spots around the cinema? I don’t go around there much, so I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Well, I often go there because there’s an art supply store, but if we’re talking about places that girls might like…”</p>
<p>“You know plenty of places! You hang out with Ado-san a lot.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, but it’s not like we’re dating.”</p>
<p>“It’s weird, though. You two get along so well.”</p>
<p>“It’s just Suika being considerate.”</p>
<p>She says it’s worrying to let me go out alone.</p>
<p>“Some people even think you two are dating.”</p>
<p>“Yuuji, how accurate do you think my ability to sense interest is?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Yuuji seemed to nod in agreement over the phone.</p>
<p>“Hmm… then, what about Kujo-san? Do you hang out with her?”</p>
<p>“No way, man. Who do you think she is?”</p>
<p>“I know, but still. I think you’re probably the only one in school who can talk to Kujo-san normally.”</p>
<p>“I’m just the class relayer because our seats are next to each other. She says it’s more efficient than talking to everyone in the class. She even thanked me for it today.”</p>
<p>“Huh, Kujo-san really is something else.”</p>
<p>Yuuji wasn’t mocking her; his voice genuinely expressed admiration.</p>
<p>“I had her in my class during the first year, you know. Kujo-san isn’t bad at talking or anything. If she needs to, she’ll speak up in class. She just doesn’t bother with small talk because she’s not interested in people.”</p>
<p>“Right, she talks quite normally when we’re exchanging class messages.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Sometimes she talks so fast, it’s like, ‘I’m speaking with someone super smart!'”</p>
<p>“…Ugh, that’s exactly it.”</p>
<p>“What’s up?”</p>
<p>When I asked, Yuuji replied with a slightly troubled voice.</p>
<p>“I was thinking back to our first year, if she ever talked like that to the person next to her. I don’t think she did… So, as far as I know, you’re the only one in school who can talk to Kujo-san like that.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Our class hasn’t changed seats since April, so I’m the only one who’s been next to Kujo-san.”</p>
<p>“Now, because you’re next to her, everyone asks you to relay messages, right? But back in the first year, we didn’t do that, so we had to muster our courage to talk to her.”</p>
<p>“Really? …Don’t you just need not to be scared? I get it, though.”</p>
<p>“Easy for you to say… It’s intimidating, alright? She’s so beautiful it’s almost surreal to have someone like that in real life.”</p>
<p>“Her presence does feel a bit unreal.”</p>
<p>“Right? And if you try to talk to her, you get that super formal, bureaucratic response. Not like she’s ignoring you, but you only get the bare minimum necessary… Makes you want to apologize for even speaking.”</p>
<p>“Formal, huh… I guess she is cool, but Kujo-san actually does share quite a bit with me.”</p>
<p>“How do you even communicate with her…? Everyone else gives up before getting to that point! How come you… really, why? Maybe Kujo-san likes you or something?”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>“Laughable.”</p>
<p>We both laughed heartily for a moment.</p>
<p>…While laughing, the image of the red color I saw from her flickered in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>“Right, back to you, Yuuji. If you’re looking for a place to hang out around the cinema, how about an arcade? It’s clean, and there are quite a few couples there.”</p>
<p>I occasionally go there with Suika on our way back from the art supply store. Mostly, it’s to watch Suika dance energetically on the dance game. It’s fun, so I’m pretty satisfied.</p>
<p>“Oh, an arcade. Nakabayashi might like that. Okay, okay, thanks!”</p>
<p>“Alright, good luck.”</p>
<p>“Thanks!”</p>
<p>Yuuji’s voice was filled with determination. I told him I was rooting for him and tapped the end call button.</p>
<p>An arcade, huh? I haven’t been there in a while.</p>
<p>I haven’t been playing games much lately, either. Yuuji and I used to play some obscure mobile game, but it was so obscure it ended up getting shut down.</p>
<p>That game had fun co-op play. I wonder if there’s something similar now.</p>
<p>I searched on my smartphone for “recommended mobile games cooperative play.”</p>
<p>“Ooh…”</p>
<p>I found a title that was just recently released. It has pretty good reviews. It’s an action game where you fight in robots.</p>
<p>Since it’s free to play, I decided to download it… when another call came in.</p>
<p>Yuuji again, or maybe Suika? Assuming as much, I checked the screen—</p>
<p>“Huh!?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but let out a sound of surprise.</p>
<p>Because the caller ID read Kujo Kurenai. I remember we exchanged contacts once, saying it might be useful for something.</p>
<p>Though we did exchange them…</p>
<p>“What’s this about…?”</p>
<p>It was surprising that she, acknowledged by both herself and others as “Human Haters,” would call me.</p>
<p>Maybe she doesn’t consider me a human? With such a silly thought for a moment, I tapped the call button.</p>
<p>“Miyashiro speaking. Kujo-san?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…Eh, Kujo-san, right? Or is this a wrong call?”</p>
<p>Could it be a mistaken tap? While I waited, just in case, a response came after a few seconds.</p>


<p>“Good evening…”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, good evening. What’s up?”</p>
<p>“…Um, no, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>It felt like an international call with the lag in her responses.</p>
<p>“…Er, do you like games?”</p>
<p>“I did play occasionaly.”</p>
<p>“…Do you have time right now?”</p>
<p>“I’m not particularly busy.”</p>
<p>The lag in her responses gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>“I see. Then, could you keep me company for a bit? I’d like you to be a tester.”</p>
<p>Finally speaking in her usual tone, I asked Kujo-san.</p>
<p>“A tester? What for?”</p>
<p>“I recently helped develop a game that’s just been released. I want to check its actual performance. The game features cooperative play, so I need someone to play with.”</p>
<p>“I see. Wait, you helped develop a game? That’s pretty amazing… Aren’t you a pro?”</p>
<p>“I told you, I earn my keep.”</p>
<p>“That’s cool. But are you sure I’m the right person? I’m not particularly good at games, and I don’t know anything about programming…”</p>
<p>“Miyashiro-kun, you know, Miyashiro-kun, the thing is, Miyashiro-kun, it’s important to get feedback from general users, not just hardcore gamers or people from game companies. That’s why I chose you, and there’s absolutely no other intention, please understand.”</p>
<p>Her rapid-fire speech was impressive. Thankfully, her clear enunciation made it easier to understand, but what’s with the “please understand”?</p>
<p>“Got it, got it, got it, understood.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know anyone else who fits the bill of a general user to ask for such a favor because I don’t have friends. Especially not male high school students, who are right in the target demographic, except for you. This is request from a girl devoid of social skills, <em>do you understand</em>?”</p>
<p>“<em>Understood</em>, <em>understood</em>. Sorry about that. I’ll help as much as I can.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Of course, I’ll pay you, so give me your bank account details. You don’t need to issue a receipt.”</p>
<p>“Do classmates normally ask for your bank account? I’ll help, but I don’t need the money.”</p>
<p>After all, I’m just a high school student who doesn’t even know the difference between a receipt and an invoice.</p>
<p>Following Kujo-san’s instructions, I began to assist as a tester.</p>
<p>“Wait, is that the title I just downloaded a while ago?”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? …What a coincidence, a huge coincidence.”</p>
<p>“I’ve started it up, should I just begin playing normally?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Cooperative play will unlock after you progress a bit.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Before the tutorial starts, I’m instructed to choose a mech.</p>
<p>“Sword-wielding mechs, gun-wielding mechs, and ones with wings, huh? Then maybe this one.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you chose the sword mech. It’s the easiest to control; I think it’s a good choice.”</p>
<p>“Really? That’s good then.”</p>
<p>Yuuji is good at these things, but I’m not confident in action games. Lucky to have chosen a character that’s easy to handle.</p>
<p>With that thought, I notice something off. Wait, did I say which mech I chose?</p>
<p>Oh, the tutorial has started.</p>
<p>Well, it must be my imagination. With that, I focus on the game.</p>
<p>After successfully completing the tutorial, I began cooperative play with Kujo-san.</p>
<p>“Miyashiro-kun, the enemy attacking you now has a weak point on its head. If you slash it, you can defeat it in one hit.”</p>
<p>“Alright, charge!”</p>
<p>“Also, your special attack gauge should be full by now… I think you can use your special move.”</p>
<p>“Really? Let’s unleash it!”</p>
<p>Kujo-san, as expected of a developer, occasionally gives precise instructions as if she can see my screen.</p>
<p>Thanks to her, everything goes smoothly, and I really enjoy playing. Before I know it, it’s gotten quite late.</p>
<p>“Let’s call it a day. Sorry for keeping you up late. Playing together was very helpful; I got to see how beginners move.”</p>
<p>“No, I had fun too. This is a good game. It’s definitely going to be a hit.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Then, goodbye.”</p>
<p>Leaving her usual cool and curt reply, Kujo-san ended the call. Even though we enjoyed the game together, she remained true to herself.</p>
<p>Maybe this will make us talk a bit more at school… or not.</p>
<p>I chuckle to myself at the thought. After all, it’s Kujo-san we’re talking about.</p>
<p>The next conversation might be ten days later, and that wouldn’t be strange at all for her.</p>
<p>…Wow, it’s really late. Time to sleep.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Saturday. No school, but I have plans early in the morning. I want to go to bed early to avoid oversleeping or feeling unwell.</p>
<p>I turn off the light and set my alarm on my smartphone… Before closing my eyes, I double-check the route and travel time to tomorrow’s destination.</p>
<p>Alright, good. If I wake up at the set time, I’ll make it. It’s not a place to get lost.</p>
<p>Feeling reassured, I fall asleep.</p>
<p>“Thank you, then.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>

<p><strong>Kujo’s PoV</strong></p>
<p>After ending the call, I—Kujo Kurenai—let out a big sigh.</p>
<p>“Haaa… aaaaaah…”</p>
<p>My strength leaves me, and my body slides off the chair. Right now, in my room, in front of my desk, I’m in a somewhat strange pose.</p>
<p>After a while, the door opens with a click.</p>
<p>“Nee-chan, my tablet’s acting up… What’s with that pose? You’ll hurt your neck, you know?”</p>
<p>“Maybe…”</p>
<p>“Ah, I get it! It’s about ‘Miyashiro-kun,’ right? What happened? Any progress?”</p>
<p>My sister, two years younger and in her third year of middle school, is sociable, loves rumors, and is a gossip fiend. She exerts that spirit greatly towards me, her sister, and thanks to her, things I had no intention of revealing have already been laid bare.</p>
<p>“…Touko, your sister is very tired right now, having just made a great effort. So, I’m going to sleep. Goodnight.”</p>
<p>I crawled to my bed and wrapped myself in a towel blanket. This is a sleeping posture; I’m going to bed for the night.</p>
<p>“What what what what! What happened!? Don’t sleep, don’t sleep, wake up, wake up, tell me, tell me, tell me!”</p>
<p>“Shut up, shut up, just be queit…”</p>
<p>My sister jumps around on top of me, bouncing up and down. It’s heavy and painful. Despite her graceful and slender build, unfortunately, I am frail.</p>
<p>“I’ll keep going until you talk! So, you might as well spill it now. That’s your beloved best move!”</p>
<p>“It might be, but hearing it from the person who created this situation is irritating… I just called him.”</p>
<p>“And then and then!?”</p>
<p>“I called him and… played a game together.”</p>
<p>“And then and then!?”</p>
<p>“That’s it.”</p>
<p>“Ha… WHAT!?”</p>
<p>Though I say that’s it, for me, it was quite an adventure. However, my sister stretches her soprano voice in exasperation and presses further.</p>
<p>“What, you’re giving off that accomplished vibe just for that!? Whaaaaat! Nee-chan, that’s like elementary school level! No, below elementary school!”</p>
<p>“If it’s below, then elementary school is still included.”</p>
<p>“Worse than elementary school!”</p>
<p>“Its really harsh…”</p>
<p>It should simply be “less than.” No, being told I’m less than elementary school level is harsh too.</p>
<p>“Look, Nee-chan, just aggressively charm him and win him over. A direct approach is fine! It’s super annoying, but compared to me, who is incredibly cute, you have an even better face! And how come someone with your facial deviation value doesn’t have a boyfriend?”</p>
<p>“I don’t… necessarily want a boyfriend.”</p>
<p>Not exactly that.</p>
<p>Wrapped in the blanket, I uttered those words.</p>
<p>“…I just… want to… get… closer to Miyashiro-kun.”</p>
<p>“That’s so pure! So maidenly! Wanting to get closer is like something from the Taisho era! Your thinking is HAHAHAHA hilarious! Oh, sorry, sorry, just kidding!”</p>
<p>I want to smack her down (first of all, what does she even know about the Taisho era…), but I don’t have the energy.</p>
<p>I’m truly exhausted now. I didn’t know calling someone you like could be so nerve-wracking. I nearly passed out several times during the call.</p>


<p>After all that, where would I find the energy to fight back against my sister?</p>
<p>“Besides, with your zero love skills on full display, doesn’t the other person already know?”</p>
<p>“That’s unlikely.”</p>
<p>Indeed, I have no such thing as love skills, and more so, the other person is Miyashiro-kun, who has a special talent for detecting interest.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>“Because I have an excellent poker face. No way it’s been noticed.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>“Even you always tell me, you can’t tell what I’m thinking just by looking at my face.”</p>
<p>“I do say that, but… Although your face is hard to read, you… tend to react quite obviously in other ways.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you think so, that’s fine.”</p>
<p>My sister said, sounding as though she had given up, and then started bouncing on me again.</p>
<p>“But seriously, it’s a miracle! That you’re interested in someone else! And you even fell for them! And it’s such a cliché crush! You can’t let this go!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>While being told this, I look at his photo on my smartphone from within the blanket.</p>
<p>There’s a significant increase in my heart rate. And my face breaks into a grin.</p>
<p>A huge grin.</p>
<p>…It’s utterly ridiculous, this thing called romantic feelings.</p>
<p>“I’m worried, you know… You have no common sense… Did you properly send it to Miyashiro-kun?”</p>
<p>“Send? What? A pull request?” (tln : lmao. G*thub related jokes. )</p>
<p>“Not a pull request. A lovin message, obviously! Like ‘thanks for playing with me,’ ‘I had fun,’ or ‘let’s play again soon!'”</p>
<p>By the way, “Lovin” is a popular chat app that almost every Japanese person uses. (tln :LINE -&gt; LOVIN )</p>
<p>“…Impossible.”</p>
<p>“Coward…”</p>
<p>I couldn’t retort.</p>
<p>“You said you played a game together, what did you play?”</p>
<p>“That game I helped develop.”</p>
<p>“Oh. The one with cooperative play as its selling point, right? Perfect. …But didn’t you say something like, ‘It’s a project with an insanely impossible schedule that’s going up in flames, and they begged me to help, but I’m thinking of turning it down’?”</p>
<p>“…I changed my mind.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Oh, did you help with the development foreseeing this? So you could play with Miyashiro-kun because it’s something you can do together?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“OMG!! How cunning~~~!! Onee-chan, that’s super cute~~~!”</p>
<p>Without answering, my sister gets excited on her own… Well, she hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>“Wow! Wow! So, how did you invite him? How could you say let’s play together? You didn’t chicken out?”</p>
<p>“That’s because it seemed like Miyashiro-kun had just searched for and downloaded that game, and if I missed this timing… then…”</p>
<p>I thought it would be impossible forever. So I called him with a “Now or never!” mindset.</p>
<p>“Wow! Talking about this with nee-chan feels super fresh!! …Hmm, but how did you know Miyashiro-kun had searched for and downloaded that game?”</p>
<p>“My intuition was sharp. A sister has such intuitions, you know. I sensed it. That’s how much I can sense. Or rather, what else could there be but sensing it? I’m sleepy, going to sleep now.”</p>
<p>“Ah, she’s talking fast! That’s evidence she’s hiding something! Wait a minute!”</p>
<p>But I couldn’t reveal this to my sister, no matter what.</p>
<p>Eventually, she seemed to give up due to my silence and changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Does Miyashiro-kun have any rivals aiming for him? Or does he already have a girlfriend?”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t have a girlfriend, I believe. But…”</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>“There’s a girl one year younger than him, a childhood friend, who’s very close to him.”</p>
<p>“Really? Is she cute?”</p>
<p>“Very.”</p>
<p>She often comes to the classroom for Miyashiro-kun, and both their closeness and her loveliness are quite noticeable.</p>
<p>“Wow, a childhood friend, huh? Cute and close… There might be a secret relationship already, and you’re losing, nee-chan~.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Ah, kidding, kidding, I don’t know! …But seriously, I’m curious about Miyashiro-kun, who turned nee-chan into such a lovesick girl! He’s good at drawing, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I love men with talent! Even better if they have muscles!”</p>
<p>My sister seems to have a thing for muscles. It’s a preference I don’t quite understand.</p>
<p>“So, how about Miyashiro-kun? Does he have muscles? Is he well-built? What about his biceps and triceps?”</p>
<p>“No, not really… I haven’t paid attention to his muscles by parts.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but he’s an artist, right? I don’t imagine him having muscles. More like a bit skinny, I guess. Hmm, I might not like that…”</p>
<p>“?”</p>
<p>“Ah?”</p>
<p>“Touko.”</p>
<p>“Huh, yes?”</p>
<p>“Did you just… make fun of Miyashiro-kun? Hmm…”</p>
<p>“No, no, no, I didn’t! It’s just a slip of the tongue, a slip! S-scary, scary, scary! What, what, what!?”</p>
<p>Despite her protest, there’s something I can’t reveal, even to my sister.</p>
<p>As she struggle on, I escape from beneath her and crawl out of the blanket. I pull something from the back of a drawer in my desk.</p>
<p>“What’s that…? It’s a smartphone charger, right?”</p>
<p>“Correct. To be precise, it’s a charging AC adapter. It looks perfectly normal, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it normal…?”</p>
<p>“I’ve tinkered with it a bit inside. Simply put, once a smartphone is connected to this, an inappropriate voltage will be forcefully applied, and the device will be done for. This is an AC adapter type smartphone destroyer.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Wait, you don’t mean…”</p>
<p>“Touko, I hope the AC adapter in your room hasn’t been switched with this at some point.”</p>
<p>“Wha… That’s… That’s terrifying! What kind of high school girl threatens like that!?”</p>
<p>“Your sister.”</p>
<p>“The worst!!”</p>
<p>As my sister trembles in fear, I press on.</p>
<p>“Hey Touko, from now on, every time you charge your phone, you’ll live in fear, wondering, ‘Is this the smartphone destroyer…?'”</p>
<p>“That’s like a curse! You’re making me anxious and slowly killing me with stress!”</p>
<p>“Please, go back to the Heian era…,” she mutters weakly.</p>
<p>This sort of exchange is fairly common in the Kujo household.</p>
<p>I talk about various things with my family like this.</p>
<p>But beyond that, I’ve never been interested in other people. I didn’t feel the need to talk, and at school, I was known as someone who “Human Haters.”</p>
<p>I thought that was accurate and was fine with it.</p>
<p>I thought.</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>“Eek… What kind of sigh is that…? Thinking you were a cute, lovestruck girl was a mistake…”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>I’m sorry, Touko.</p>
<p>I’m an even worse person than you think, several levels down…</p>
<p>I can’t say it, but I can’t tell anyone.</p>
