<h2>Chapter 1: After the Streaming Incident</h2>

<p class="calibre2">“Uh-oh. This is really bad…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was 8 AM in the morning after the streaming incident.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Nakayama Haruto, also known as “Oni-chan”, had his eyes glued to the PC while running his fingers through his brown hair. With furrowed brows and a pale face, he was sweating nervously.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Upon cautiously opening Twitto, he found an overwhelming number of messages, too many to go through at once.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The main content of these messages was about the streaming incident.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Onii-chuaan~! Make sure to eat the meal your imouto made, okay~?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [You were such a kind brother~!!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Would you mind if I took your imouto as my wife?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post:</strong> [Please bring back imouto-chan next time!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">As if it was payback for all the taunting done, these messages were all teasing in nature.</p>



<p class="calibre2">There was also some positive feedback on the stream such as “Yesterday’s stream was interesting”.</p>



<p class="calibre2">However, messages teasing Haruto were piling up so much that they blurred out all those positive messages.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ugh…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He clutched his head while being speechless, realizing once again the frightening nature of the internet. He understood that he had committed a serious mistake.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In Haruto’s case, he was taunting as a form of entertainment. As a result, it was only natural that the repercussions were more widespread than those for an ordinary streamer. In other words, he reaped what he sowed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>. This is really bad. How should I conduct my streams from now on… Seriously. Giving up on streaming is not an option…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">If he were to choose to go on a hiatus after the incident, his income would be significantly decreased. If that happened, he wouldn’t be able to save up for his sister’s university expenses, and she might not be able to attend the university she wanted.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He couldn’t let that happen. It was something he absolutely couldn’t compromise on.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He wanted to step in as a substitute for their deceased parents and firmly support his sister’s life and future. That was the extent of Haruto’s strong determination.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Okay, calm down me. I already deleted yesterday’s stream, so the damage might be limited to just Twitto. As long as the story doesn’t spread to my main channel, there might still be hope…” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-15" class="calibre2">Trying to soothe himself by taking deep breaths, he opened <a href="#calibre_link-14" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">MouTube<sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a>, the source of his income, and checked the latest videos he had posted so far.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Not noticing that his channel had gained 40,000 new subscribers and an increase in likes due to this incident was a sign of how overwhelmed he was.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As his heart raced, he moved the mouse down to the comments section&mdash;.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-no way…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">There, he was confronted with the worst sight for a toxic streamer like himself.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Seriously, this guy is disgusting. Stop taunting people, you piece of crap.”</p>



<p class="calibre2">Hate com&mdash;no, expected comments like these were met with viewers defending him with comments like, “This guy is doing his best for his little sister. Shut up.”</p>



<p class="calibre2">But that wasn’t all.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If you scrolled through the latest comments, there were even those who warned others, “This person is provoking others for his business. Let’s not misunderstand.”</p>



<p class="calibre2">While the comments defending him were the truth, for Oni-chan, who had made a name for himself by acting toxic, this felt like an interference to his channel.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that it was like his neck was being strangled.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“……” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-16" class="calibre2">His only wish was simple: to keep the <a href="#calibre_link-14" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">status quo<sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a>, maintaining a certain number of views and income.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Changing his streaming style after the incident was out of the question. The viewers who had been watching him would most likely be confused and drift away.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Since his income was closely tied to the number of views, there was no room to be adventurous and reveal his true self.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well, I definitely need to do a stream explaining things before going for my part-time work… If I keep procrastinating, it’ll only get harder to continue streaming. Not to mention, with the situation as it is, I won’t be able to focus on my part-time job…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This was the seed he had sown. He had to reap it himself.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If he were to run away from this, his career as a streamer would be over.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Let’s prepare breakfast for now… and think about how I should explain things…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a heavy heart, Haruto checked the clock for the first time as he attempted to move from the gaming room to the living room.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was 8:10 AM. Yuno, his younger sister, should already be on her way to school.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh, it’s already this late!? Ugh… I couldn’t even see her off…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Due to the anxiety from the streaming incident, he struggled to fall asleep yesterday night. As a result, he ended up oversleeping by an hour and a half compared to his usual wake-up time.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Not even noticing his alarm go off was a testament to how mentally strained he was.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Not only did I cause a streaming incident, but I also put Yuno’s voice on the internet… I really screwed up, haven’t I?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Letting out yet another sigh, he walked into the living room with his shoulders slouched.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The moment he opened the living room door, he spotted a dish covered with plastic wrap and a neatly folded letter on the table.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Approaching the table cautiously, Haruto quickly opened the letter.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-17" class="calibre2">“(Good morning, sleepyhead. I’ve prepared breakfast for you, so heat it up and eat it, okay? If you don’t, you’ll get a <a href="#calibre_link-14" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">knuckle sandwich<sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a> next time. Well then, I’m off to school. Good luck for today!)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Perhaps to convey her feelings, she even took the trouble of handwriting the letter.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Reading the handwritten letter with its round and girlish handwriting to the end&mdash;</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, ahaha… Yuno, seriously.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He let out a wry smile, then returned to a serious expression.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah… I’ll do my best today.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It seemed like the perfect words for the current situation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a clenched fist, Haruto responded with a newfound determination.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After finishing breakfast and hanging up the laundry, Haruto scheduled a stream at 10 AM with the title “Regarding Yesterday’s Incident”. He prepared himself mentally in the gaming room, contemplating in silence.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>. It’s, it’s finally time…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Whether it was because he felt cornered or just because of the tension, he realized that there were less than 3 minutes left until the start of the stream.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But still, having 1,200 people waiting for my stream to start is way too much…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Having such a large number of viewers waiting for the stream to start was highly unusual for his channel, especially on a weekday at 10 AM. It was a first.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It goes without saying that this is a direct result of the streaming incident.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Everything will be fine. Come on me, do your best.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre6">*Thump-thump*</em></p>



<p class="calibre2">His heartbeat echoed in his body like a drum.</p>



<p class="calibre2">When it reached 10 AM, tensions were so high that he felt like his heart would leap out of his mouth.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto, or rather, Oni-chan, started his stream.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“O-Okay. The stream has started. First… good morning, everyone.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As he greeted the viewers, the comment section was filled with “lol”. But that wasn’t all.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Good morning, Onii-chan!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [We’ve been waiting for your stream, Onii-chan!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Don’t tease him too much LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Oni-chan, don’t cry! Oh, sorry, I meant Onii-chan.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Your voice is shaking lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2">There were more comments teasing and provoking him compared to the usual.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While the viewers seemed to find it amusing, this flow of banter was a relief.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Rather than someone immediately writing something like “Talk about the streaming incident already,” it was much better to have jokes and light banter.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Thanks to this kind of cushion, he could loosen up the tension a bit.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uh, hey, you guys. Just call me Oni-chan, seriously. …Huh? What’s the origin of the name ‘Oni-chan’? W-Well, that’s not really important… Wha?! It’s not because I’m called ‘Onii-chan’ by my sister!” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He knew he would be bombarded with questions. However, this particular question wasn’t something he had anticipated.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He found himself stumbling over his words.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Hit the nail on the head LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [This guy is so bad at covering up lmao]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [I bet there was a script for this]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Just show your true self already! It’d be easier for you]</p>



<p class="calibre2">If he had a calm mind, he might not have picked up every comment he saw. He would have chosen selectively.</p>



<p class="calibre2">But right now, if he didn’t pick up on the comments that caught his eye, he’d fall into silence, creating a funeral-like atmosphere.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In such a stream where he was going to explain himself, that was a no-go.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was crucial to maintain the stance of “It’s not a big deal, right? It doesn’t bother me at all, haha”, and carry it onto the next stream.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Oh, just to let you know, I won’t be doing a gaming stream today. It’ll just be a short stream, and as the title suggests, I’ll only talk about yesterday’s incident.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The longer he went on, the more viewers would join. There was also the possibility of digging himself into a deeper hole. He decided to get to the main point early.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“And seriously, let me complain first. Why the hell did you guys spread the word about yesterday’s incident? Seriously. We made a promise not to spread it. It’s getting featured on summary sites and even trending on Twitto.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [We didn’t promise anything!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [What are you talking about?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [You’re always provoking people, so it’s inevitable]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Isn’t this the good kind of controversy that boosts your reputation?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Despite the scolding, none of the viewers were affected in the least.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, after this stream, I won’t touch on yesterday’s incident anymore. And seriously, viewers who keep spamming ‘Onii-chan’ cut it out. I’m not your big brother.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [His getting mad lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [He probably only wants to be called that by his imouto…]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Looks like explaining the streaming incident is impossible LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Sorry no can do. You just have to accept it, Onii-chan.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">The usual bickering with the regular viewers. Thanks to this, he was gradually getting back into his usual groove.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Look, there are people saying all sorts of things about me being kind or reconsidering things because of this incident, but I’m not some great person. If I were, I wouldn’t be acting toxic… Huh? Aren’t I considered good because I’m supporting my sister? Are you an idiot? She’s an important family member, so it’s natural to support her.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Such words came out smoothly, not for the purpose of livening up the stream or as a joke, but from his genuine feelings.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Of course, these words resonated with the viewers.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Oi oi, he’s giving off that big bro vibe]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [What is this guy really lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [I don’t even know if he’s trying to make excuses anymore…]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [I wish I had an onii-chan like this.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">The comment section flowed at a rapid pace.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Unable to keep up with the speed, Oni-chan stopped the comments momentarily to answer a question that caught his eye.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh? Why is the donation for today’s stream turned off? …Well, this is an explanatory stream, so I’m not here to entertain you guys, and also because I’ll end the stream soon. I’m not expecting any money for something like this.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Did he just reveal his true self?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [At the very least, that last part felt real. It’s that voice he used during the streaming incident.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Maybe he’s mistaken us and think we’re his sister LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Seriously, he was very committed to being toxic with this kind of personality… Oh, did he have a script for this?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">That’s correct. Without a script, he wouldn’t have been able to deceive the viewers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hm? Congratulations on 150,000 subscribers on your channel? No, I haven’t gained that many. I’m still at 100,000. I’m still ways off.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [No, it’s increasing]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [It increased by 50,000 because of the incident]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Did you not check…?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Maybe he went to bed without checking?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Huh? Seriously? Is it really increasing that much? You guys aren’t lying, are you?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Similar comments filled the screen, and while thinking it might be a lie, he checked.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Huh!? It’s real? Wait… I’m muting for a moment.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Pfff, what’s up with that lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Muting?!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Just show your true self already!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Let us hear your happy voice!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“S-Shut up. Just be quiet.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The toxic Oni-chan, due to the streaming incident, found himself in the position of being constantly teased. His true human nature and natural kindness were further exposed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">What was supposed to be a stream ending in about 10 minutes continued for 30 minutes due to unnecessary exchanges.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Well, a lot happened yesterday, but I’ll keep the streaming style as it is. After all, this is my true self.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [I think it’s okay to go all out, but I guess there’s no other way for you to earn money for your sister’s tuition huh?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [If you change your style, there’s a possibility that the views won’t increase, as Oni-chan mentioned]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Just keep doing what you’re doing. Every time you do, I’ll rewatch the streaming incident video]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Do it in moderation~ I’m cheering for you!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…No, don’t suddenly be nice to someone like me… Yeah. Well, with this, I’ll end the stream. For my next stream, it’ll be a regular gaming stream, so those who have time, please join me.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Okay~]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [I’ll be back to tease you again, onii-chan!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Me too!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Take care of yourself~]</p>



<p class="calibre2">It ended with warm comments.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto cut off the mic first, confirming three times that he didn’t make the same mistake as yesterday, and ended the stream. Then, he let out a deep sigh.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Whew. That was close…! Really close! I feel like I showed a super dumb side of myself, but I somehow got through it!!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Repeating fist pumps while sitting in the chair, the joy of having protected his source of income was extraordinary.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Now, well… I’ll shift my focus on increasing the number of subscribers I have…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Today’s part-time job starts at 3:00 PM.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Until then, Haruto’s work consists of something other than streaming. He needs to stock up on gameplay videos for MouTube uploads.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He immediately launched ABEX and started recording.</p>



<p class="calibre2">By doing it privately instead of streaming, he could focus more.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even if he couldn’t win, if he made a good play in that match, he could use it as a highlight clip.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The more he played, the more clips he accumulated for uploads.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After playing ABEX and recording for about an hour.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Huh!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Haruto exclaimed in surprise and leaned in closer to his PC.</p>



<p class="calibre2">On the screen displaying his allies before the match, there was a username he recognized.</p>



<p class="calibre2">[Ac_Ayaya]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“This… this person… is it for real!? Man, it’s been a while…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The ally he matched with this time wasn’t just an ordinary player.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Not only was she a member of the professional gaming team Axcis Crown, but she is also a female VTuber who surpassed 300,000 subscribers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-I need to do my best… This is a chance to get some great footage…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Clasping his fists together to pump himself up, Haruto was unaware that Ayaya was currently streaming.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Not only that, but on Ayaya’s screen, the username ‘Oni_chan’ was displayed, and the comment section was buzzing with excitement.</p>



<p class="calibre2">This wasn’t the first time Haruto and Ayaya had crossed paths. They had been matched up as allies before by chance and had a few casual exchanges.</p>


<p><strong>Ayaya's Pov</strong></p>


<p class="calibre2">“Pfft, ahaha! Look, everyone! Can you believe it, Oni-chan is here! This has to be the real deal, right!? If it is, then we’re in good hands!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Looking at the ally screen, Ayaya, a pro gamer and VTuber, reacted faster than any of her 3,200 viewers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She spoke in the dialect of her hometown, and her smile was filled with genuine joy as she continued to stream.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [He might be a fake, right?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [But this is a high-ranked match, so there’s a possibility that it’s the real deal.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Looks pretty authentic. The username matches up.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Did he start playing immediately after ending his stream LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2">The comments section is buzzing with excitement about the unexpected appearance of Oni-chan, the person who caused the streaming incident yesterday&nbsp;</p>



<p class="calibre2">In the past, Oni-chan would never have been welcomed in this way; the comments would have been overflowing with negativity. However, due to the recent incident which brought many things to light, more people have learned about Oni-chan’s family situation and the reasons behind his persona.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Now, he has turned into somewhat of a comedic figure, and even the streamer, Ayaya, is jumping on the bandwagon with this topic.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, I saw clips of Oni-chan’s streaming incident. His good-brother aura was definitely showing.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Don’t bring that up; you might get scolded LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Well, he did give off that kind of aura, didn’t he?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Damn, this match is gonna be something!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [I hope you can talk with Oni-chan!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">While enjoying the comments, Ayaya throws in an unexpected remark.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh? Oni-chan’s main character is the attacker, Octane, right? This time, he’s using the support, Gibraltar.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In this game, each character has its own abilities, and it’s not possible to use the same character within a team.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In other words, the system is such that characters are either selected on a first-come, first-served basis, or through negotiation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The viewers started forming theories about the unusual pick.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Maybe he’s letting you have it? After all, Ayaya’s main character is also Octane.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Is he trying to support you with Gibraltar? He’s Oni-chan after all.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [He should at least know about Ayaya’s main character]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ayaya, who quickly picked up on these comments, nodded in agreement.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, that’s true! Maybe he was just being considerate of me. Don’t you all think so too?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [That’s probably the case.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Considering how he’s a caring onii-chan, maybe it’s the natural move for him.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [That’s how they usually are]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [That’s true.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">In response to Ayaya’s prompt, many comments expressed agreement. While there were a few differing opinions suggesting that he might be causing inconvenience by playing an unfamiliar character, they were a minority. Ayaya, unaffected by the minority opinion, continued with a reminiscent smile.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You sure are a kind brother eh, oni-chan? Well then, I’ll graciously accept your favor… here we go.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">And, right at that moment, the character selection time came to an end. As the in-game music changed, Ayaya, like a true professional gamer, switched to her serious tone.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Now then, let’s avoid the highly contested areas for now.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">If the entire team is wiped out, the game ends immediately. Going with this strategy ensures that our early-game survival isn’t dependent on luck, and it serves the dual purpose of extending the playtime with Oni-chan to entertain the viewers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">And with the countdown of [3, 2, 1, 0,] the match began.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As the airship carrying all the players glides across the vast map, Ayaya marks the landing spot, communicates her plan with her ally, and they jump out together.</p>



<p class="calibre2">During the descent, Ayaya quickly confirms that there are no enemies nearby and flashes a smile, saying, “Alright!”</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ayaya had been hoping for this situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, everyone, pay attention from here! If this is the real Oni-chan, he’s definitely going to pull off that move.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With no enemies in the vicinity, it means they can safely gather resources. Ayaya, who has watched Oni-chan’s streams, knows that he has reconnaissance skills comparable to a pro.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If this was him, he would surely showcase his pro skills at the game. With such thoughts, the moment they landed on the ground…</p>



<p class="calibre2">[Oni_chan] acted exactly as expected.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Without taking a step forward, [Oni_chan] turned toward Ayaya, and performed an incredibly quick maneuver as if saying, ‘Hello’.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, yup, that confirms it’s the real deal!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was a stunt made possible because of his experience.</p>



<p class="calibre2">But that’s not all&mdash;</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ouch!?… Hey!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre6">*Bashin*&nbsp;</em></p>



<p class="calibre2">A dull sound echoed from the game.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As if to say, ‘Of course I’m real,’ Oni-chan punched Ayaya’s Octane and quickly ran away as if he were in a game of ping-pong.</p>



<p class="calibre2">And then, he headed straight for looting supplies.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The only streamer who would do something like this was him, and Ayaya, who was left behind, dramatically tilts her character’s head downward, seemingly to emphasize the shock of being punched.</p>



<p class="calibre2">This is something that can only be done when the surroundings are safe.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“D-Did everyone see that!? That idiot Oni-chan punched me!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Although taking damage when hit by a teammate is not a mechanic in the game, this behavior is representative of trolling.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [That idiot is hilarious. Cut him some slack!]</p>



<p id="calibre_link-53" class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Seriously, doing such a low thing, <a href="#calibre_link-52" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">smh<sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a>]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Oni-chan sure is committed to his character.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Looks like Ayaya is having fun too lol.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments </strong>hitting the mark start flooding in.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Pff! Haha, I can’t concentrate anymore!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s because Ayaya knows the background and intention of Oni-chan that the earlier act turns into something amusing.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ayaya, who was laughing, soon received a chat message from Oni-chan.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oi, hurry up and loot, Ayaya-san)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hee~ Haha, I can’t take it anymore. My stomach hurts!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Despite the strong tone, the message ends with a polite ‘-san.’</p>



<p class="calibre2">Her comment section was soon flooded with “LOL” and “LMAO”.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But yeah, you’re right. We should loot quickly before enemies come. Pfufu.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While suppressing her laughter, Ayaya finally moves her character and enters a building to gather supplies.</p>



<p class="calibre2">To keep the viewers engaged, she reads comments that catch her eye.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ayaya and Oni-chan seem like they’ve known each other for a while, are you close off-stream? Ah, Oni-chan and I got randomly matched in a game once, and we became friends since then.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Eh!? Really?!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [How unexpected!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [If you were streaming at that time, I would’ve definitely watched it! I wish I could have seen it!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [I would have skipped work if I could have watched it!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Jokes and serious comments were blended together in the chat.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, but Oni-chan played normally during that time. He even sent a private message afterwards saying that he was recording so he was sorry if he caused any inconveniences.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Well, he seems like a reasonable person, huh?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Don’t expose him!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Is this your revenge for getting punched by Oni-chan!?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [His behind-the-scenes side is being exposed LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, forget what I just said! That was a private matter, wasn’t it?! Cancel that!! Forget you heard anything!!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [It’s too late!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [You’re slowly becoming like Oni-chan lmao]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [My impression of Oni-chan’s is changing more and more…]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [If Ayaya says so, then it must be true, right?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Feeling overwhelmed by the comments, Ayaya quickly tried to shift the topic to something else.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Ayaya! If possible, can you voice call with him?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm. That’s a bit tricky… When streamers run into each other by coincidence, there’s an unspoken rule to not directly interfere with each other, especially through voice chat, so as not to disrupt each other’s streams!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ayaya, expressing her view from a streamer’s perspective, caused a stir in the comments.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Onii-chan isn’t streaming!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [But he’s not streaming right now!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Wait, he’s not streaming!? Could it be…]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [A sudden collaboration!?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">This is how a streamer gets their chat to do the research for them.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“So, Oni-chan isn’t streaming!? Well then… if a lot of you guys are okay with it, I’ll try to get permission. I’ll put up a poll, so please vote.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ayaya quickly set up a poll with options ‘Yes!’ or ‘No!’ and let viewers cast their votes for several seconds.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The result&mdash;was an unexpected 90% voted in favor of ‘Yes!’</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Everybody loves Oni-chan, huh? LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Why is he so popular lmao]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [These numbers are dangerous…]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [It wasn’t even close LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Alright! Let me go ask him. I won’t force anything, so if he declines, no complaints, okay?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a polite risk disclaimer, Ayaya then used the in-game chat to make her proposal to Oni-chan.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-54" class="calibre2">“(Hey, Oni-chan, is it possible to <a href="#calibre_link-52" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">VC<sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> now?)” she asked while closing the distance as usual.</p>


<p><strong>Haruto's PoV</strong></p>


<p class="calibre2">After delivering a punch to Ayaya, Oni-chan typed in the chat, “Oi, hurry up and loot.”</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Are you not mad, Ayaya-san…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Despite currently recording for a video, Oni-chan seemed weak and anxious, as if forgetting that he was even recording.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Of course, he would.</p>



<p class="calibre2">This is the second time he has played a game with her. Just his second time.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Although they are technically friends, their interaction has been limited to simple email exchanges. It would be an overstatement to say that they were close.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Despite this, he delivered a punch and a message with a rough tone to such a person.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“B-But, if I don’t do this much, I can’t maintain my character…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">That streaming incident was a fatal mistake for his career as ‘Oni-chan’. He managed to survive thanks to the explanatory stream earlier, but the mistake was still not completely erased.</p>



<p class="calibre2">To cover up such a failure, there was no choice but to leave new marks.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Oni-chan had a single goal in mind.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It didn’t matter if it was done as a joke or whatever.</p>



<p class="calibre2">But if Ayaya could spread that she ‘got punched’ or ‘got provoked’ by him, he would be able to make a comeback as a toxic character. The best-case scenario would be that she mentioned this during her stream.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“This is also to survive as a content creator…” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-89" class="calibre2">In this industry, the moment you lose the interest of viewers, your income drops drastically. However, it is also possible to pull off an <a href="#calibre_link-88" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">uno-reverse card<sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a> to recover from the situation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Because his channel was a valuable source of income, it’s natural to want to recover from the current situation as quickly as possible.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I feel bad for, Ayaya-san, but maybe I should punch her one more time if an opportunity shows itself…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While earnestly gathering resources and having such reckless thoughts, a chat message arrived.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Hey, Oni-chan, is it possible to VC now?)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The message came from Ayaya, whom he had been trying to exploit.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Eh? A voice chat invitation from Ayaya-san…!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He stretched his neck, bringing his face close to the screen.</p>



<p class="calibre2">To ensure there were no misreads, he checked two or three times.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s quite hard to swallow, considering that the other person is a big creator with over 300,000 channel subscribers, in other words, a top-tier streamer.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Moreover, despite the troubles he caused earlier, he received a friendly invitation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Confused by the unexpected situation, he was speechless, but being invited by a pro is a rare opportunity&mdash;and though he keeps it a secret, he also respects Ayaya-san as a fellow Octane main.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well, there’s no point in trying to act rude if she’s being this friendly to me… If she’s inviting to voice chat, it means she wants to interact outside of streaming.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Someone like Oni-chan is seen as a bothersome figure by other ABEX streamers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">No one comes near him, and he has never been invited to casual tournaments for streamers before.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He never even received collaboration invitations.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even someone like him is aware of the reason as to why.</p>



<p class="calibre2">And yet… He received an invitation to voice call from Ayaya-san.</p>



<p class="calibre2">There’s an unspoken rule that even if you accidentally run into other streamers, you don’t directly interfere with their business.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The fact that she’s not following this rule suggests that she must have looked into whether he’s streaming or not, and she is likely playing games privately without streaming.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She probably checked Oni-chan’s channel, confirmed that he was not streaming, and then sent the invitation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, if she’s playing outside of stream I suppose there’s no need to try so hard acting rude… And since it’s just a duo match, Ayaya-san is my only ally.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Although he initially acted rudely, it was potentially because Ayaya might be streaming, and he intended to showcase the real ‘Oni-chan’ to her viewers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If she isn’t streaming, there’s no point in trying so hard.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Switching his mindset, Oni-chan replied to the chat in a genuine manner.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Yeh, sure!!)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Really!? Then let’s talk!)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ayaya, renowned for her social skills, quickly went into voice chat with an energetic voice, seemingly waving her hands.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oii~ Oni-chan! Can you hear me?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He also turned on his voice chat.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, yes! Long time no see, Ayaya-san. Thank you so much for that day. I expressed my gratitude in a private message, but it was truly an honor to be able to play with you.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He responded with a polite acknowledgment.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, sorry. Can you not hear my voice?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-no, I can hear you… Sorry, Oni-chan. I’m currently streaming… you know?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He had thought their conversation was private. Because of this unexpected development, his mind went completely blank.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If Oni-chan had been doing a face reveal during the stream, he might have inadvertently exposed a surprised face.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, oh, I see. You’re streaming, huh… Well, I already knew that. It’s kind of a bit of a joke, you know.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [He definitely didn’t know lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Probably regret not checking for her stream.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [His tone suddenly changed a lot.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Impressive how fast he switches gears.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ayaya’s comment section is flooded with comments teasing him on his awkward excuse.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Oni-chan, unaware of the comments, continued to talk in his new tone and asked something that was bothering his heart.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Hey, um, is it really okay to interact with someone like me while you’re streaming? Isn’t your stream getting chaotic? It is, okay?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No! Not at all!! On the contrary, there were a lot of comments asking me to talk with you.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“R-really? Well, if you say so…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Oni-chan’s usual streaming style garners both support and criticism.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Knowing his own position, he makes sure to be careful to ensure that the criticism or comments don’t spill over onto other streamers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He doesn’t want to involve them if something goes wrong.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Ah, uh, anyways! Ayaya, you use the R-301, right?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah! You know about that huh?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, uh… it’s here, so I’ll ping it for you.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thanks! By the way, Oni-chan, aren’t you using it? I saw a clip of you saying, ‘R-301 is so strong!’ a while ago.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh… I already picked one up.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Really!? I’ll take it then! I’m close to you, Oni-chan.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Sure. Do it fast.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As he looked back, Ayaya’s Octane was rushing towards him with high-speed dashes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">They passed each other as she swapped in, but then he heard a puzzled “Hmm?” from her.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Wait, Oni-chan, do you really have the R-301?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-well, yeah, I have it.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As soon as he was asked, he instinctively started moving away from her.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Really? To me, it looked like a shotgun and a pistol.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I do have the R-301, really…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Surprised by her ability to accurately identify the weapons he was carrying, he quickly escaped.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Then, can you show me your back for a moment?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No. I don’t have time to show you. And stop chasing me!” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Why! I just want to make sure!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I don’t have time for that, hurry up and loot… Wait, footsteps! Right corridor!” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh!?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">At that moment, an enemy burst out of the double doors, appearing near Oni-chan.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, a firefight ensued, but it was a favorable 1v2 situation in an open area. Furthermore, Oni-chan had a shotgun effective at close range.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Despite losing 40% of his health, with Ayaya providing cover, they easily took down the enemy.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Nice cover. Thanks. That enemy had really good character control…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“There’s definitely another enemy, right?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“There probably is, but how about we retreat for now? They might be waiting to ambush or trying to get a positional advantage.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Okay! Sounds like a plan!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Oni-chan was able to convince Ayaya of this because he possessed the same level of knowledge as her.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, we don’t actually have much loot.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, I left behind some earlier. And the enemy we took out earlier didn’t have much loot either, right?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“S-sorry! I may need to borrow something.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“What do you need?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Healing items!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Alright, then take these two. I could have given you more if I hadn’t taken damage, sorry about that.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While apologizing, Oni-chan dropped healing items on the ground.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Not at all, not at all! You really helped chip away at the enemy’s health just now, Oni-chan! So, is it okay if I take this!?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I have one too. Oh, but I’m worse at the game, so it’s probably better for balance if you give one back.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, no, I’ll take them all because I appreciate your sentiment!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, don’t steal them! You already picked them up?!” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I didn’t steal them! Oh, enemy behind us!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh!?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As they were bantering, the remaining enemy closed in. Oni-chan quickly turned around and fired a few shots, and with Ayaya’s support, they eliminated the threat.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh! That was a pretty nice headshot!” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s not as impressive as you make it out to be~” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The head is the most vulnerable area for dealing damage to an enemy, but it’s also the hardest to hit.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While it could have been a lucky shot, considering the speed at which the enemy went down, there’s a good chance it was deliberately aimed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You’re really good. Pros are amazing, seriously.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, thanks! So, shall we move?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Got it.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Oni-chan’s character was already falling apart at this point.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While paying with someone he respected, Oni-chan had almost forgotten that Ayaya was streaming.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Maintaining his nonchalant attitude, they enjoyed three games together over the span of an hour.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, I’m gonna log off soon. I’ve got some stuff to do.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I said I’ve got stuff to do.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-90" class="calibre2">“Not that, but… did you just switch to <a href="#calibre_link-88" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">your dialect<sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a>?” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“What are you talking about? Must be your imagination.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">If they were playing privately, he might have been able to brush it off, but she had a lot of viewers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You switched! There are tons of comments saying so, onii-chan~” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Shut up. And don’t call me onii-chan! I don’t want that incident to be brought up again.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Sorry! Hehe.” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“As long as you understand. Well, it’s getting late, so see you. I had fun today.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Me too! Let’s play together again when we both have time!” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Sure thing. Look forward to it.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">After a brief farewell, they ended the game.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Then, while immersed in the afterglow of enjoying the game with the professional gamer, Ayaya, Haruto started prepared for his part-time job.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Today was a really good day~” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Humming a tune, he continued with his tasks.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Thanks for reading!</p>



<p class="calibre2">In the end, she never checked what weapon MC was using. Well, the stream is probably archived, so anyone could go and check lol.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Maybe I should play Apex to understand things better…</p>
