<h2>Chapter 1</h2>


<p>The woman standing in front of my house—Eto Kanzaki-san.</p>



<p>Even though she claimed to be an acquaintance of my mother, and while lies could be easily told, it was hard not to believe her when she showed me old photos of her with my mother. Considering the time and that my mom would be home soon, I decided to let her into the house.</p>



<p>“So you know~ the moment Ane-san got a boyfriend, she became incredibly mellow. The woman who was once called the ‘Yasha Princess’! It was so shocking I thought I might die on the spot.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-san spoke nostalgically about the past.</p>



<p>From what Seina-san had told me about the nickname “Yasha Princess,” it was clear that Kanzaki-san really was an acquaintance of my mother.</p>



<p>In fact, just from the nickname and the way she called my mom Ane-san, it was becoming clear what kind of relationship she had with my mother.</p>



<p>“Um… Kanzaki-san, were you perhaps my mom’s underling?”</p>



<p>“That’s right! Back then, Ane-san was as sharp as a freshly honed knife! She terrorized the local delinquents and groups left and right.”</p>




<p>“…Mom.”</p>



<p>“…Akemi-san… was quite something.”</p>



<p>Ayana and I were dumbfounded.</p>



<p>For Ayana, hearing about my mom’s heroic stories, or even the nickname “Yasha Princess,” must have been a first.</p>



<p>(Even though this is probably something my mom considers a dark chapter in her life, having my girlfriend hear about it is incredibly embarrassing… even if it’s not directly about me.)</p>



<p>Still… Kanzaki-san really was my mother’s acquaintance, huh.</p>



<p>While my mom still looked quite young, Kanzaki-san appeared even younger. She could easily pass for a college student, with her dazzling blonde hair and ear piercings giving her a flashy, somewhat delinquent appearance.</p>



<p>“Oya, what’s the matter? You’re staring at me.”</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s nothing.”</p>




<p>Unable to help staring, Kanzaki-san leaned in with a grin.</p>



<p>I was momentarily taken aback by the perfect blend of pressure and beauty in her face, but Ayana quickly intervened to shield me from Kanzaki-san… wait, Ayana!?</p>



<p>“Please keep your distance from my boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“Hmph?!”</p>



<p>Not just stepping in, Ayana actually pressed her hand against Kanzaki-san’s face.</p>



<p>The sound she made was reminiscent of a pig, which might be rude to say, but Ayana, snorting, glared at her… apparently displeased with how close Kanzaki-san got to me.</p>



<p>“That’s rather harsh… all of a sudden.”</p>



<p>“As I said earlier, keep away from my boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“Oya oyaa, could it be that you’re worried I might steal him away?”</p>




<p>“Not at all. I just found it unpleasant. Besides, you’re not exactly of an age to be tempting a high schooler, are you?”</p>



<p>“…Ayana-chan, was it? You’ve got quite a sharp tongue, don’t you?”</p>



<p>I was quite impressed that Ayana could be this assertive with someone she just met, especially a woman who exuded a certain aura of intimidation.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Kanzaki-san didn’t get angry at all. In fact, she seemed amused and impressed by Ayana’s actions.</p>



<p>“You’ve got quite a presence. Despite being the same age as Towa-boy, you’re something else.”</p>



<p>“Thank you.”</p>



<p>“……………”</p>



<p>I felt a bit left out.</p>



<p>Not that I was particularly lonely, but it was a strange sensation—Ayana and Kanzaki-san had just met today, yet they seemed to have a compatibility that suggested they had already spent considerable time together.</p>




<p>(…It’s strange.)</p>



<p>What kind of feeling is this…? Just then, my mother finally came home.</p>



<p>“I’m home~ Oh, Eto!?”</p>



<p>“I’m intruding, Ane-san!”</p>



<p>Despite my mother’s surprise, Kanzaki-san responded normally, and it seemed she really was an acquaintance without a doubt.</p>



<p>“Isn’t this a bit sudden, huh?”</p>



<p>“It’s a surprise tactic! Hey Ane-san, I’m starving, so I’d like some delicious food!”</p>



<p>“…Seriously. Well, it’s okay, but what about Towa?”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind.”</p>




<p>Well, if she’s really an acquaintance of my mother’s, I have no reason to refuse. At this rate, it seemed Kanzaki-san would be staying for dinner, so I decided to take Ayana home a bit earlier.</p>



<p>“Ayana, I’ll take you home now—”</p>



<p>“Akemi-san, may I join you for dinner?”</p>



<p>“Ayana too? Sure, no problem.”</p>



<p>“Thank you♪”</p>



<p>Without any opportunity for me to say anything, Ayana ended up joining for dinner as well. Ayana apologized softly, but if it meant spending more time with her, I didn’t mind at all, gently patting her head.</p>



<p>As Ayana narrowed her eyes like a cat, her cuteness made my heart flutter inwardly. Meanwhile, my mother and Kanzaki-san seemed to be whispering about something.</p>



<p>“Ane-san, Ane-san, I heard on the phone that Towa-boy is doing great!”</p>



<p>“I know, right? He’s handsome and kind, just like that person… He’s truly my proud son♪”</p>




<p>They’re talking in whispers… or so they think.</p>



<p>But… seeing my mother enjoying herself with someone other than Ayana and me is oddly rare. Recently, it’s been similar with Seina-san, but it feels like there’s a deeper bond there.</p>



<p>Well, the years my mother has known Kanzaki-san and Seina-san are different, so comparing them doesn’t really make sense, though.</p>



<p>“Alright! Then, shall we prepare dinner?”</p>



<p>“Akemi-san, I’ll help too.”</p>



<p>“It’s okay, Ayana-chan. Let me handle everything today.”</p>



<p>“…Alright.”</p>



<p>Ayana looked disappointed when her offer to help was declined, and both my mother and I couldn’t help but smile at Ayana’s demeanor.</p>



<p>Ayana likes to cook with my mother, so when she’s here during dinner time, she usually helps out… Ah, she looks so reluctantly okay with it.</p>




<p>“I was turned down…”</p>



<p>“Well well, my mom just wants to treat you, that’s all.”</p>



<p>“I’m happy about that, but… next time, I’ll definitely help out.”</p>



<p>Ayana’s eyes were burning with a fighting spirit, and it was clear she was determined to do so next time.</p>



<p>Thinking that far, I gently patted her head. Ayana let out a purring sound and snuggled up to me.</p>



<p>“By the way, for such a cute girl to be Towa-boy’s girlfriend… It’s not just a good match, but you really caught a good one, huh?”</p>



<p>I was about to say something to that effect, but before I could, Ayana, who had been as affectionate as a cat, cut in and boldly declared to Kanzaki-san.</p>



<p>“I’ve been caught from the very beginning, heart and soul! So there’s absolutely no room for anyone else to intervene!”</p>



<p>Perhaps not expecting such a strong declaration, Kanzaki-san looked bewildered, eyes wide open.</p>




<p>Ayana snapped back to reality and buried her face in my chest, muttering with embarrassment.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry… It’s just a little jealousy. I understand that Kanzaki-san is an old acquaintance of Akemi-san’s, but I don’t like seeing a woman who just met today getting along with Towa-kun… Haa, I have to fix this.”</p>



<p>“Is that so… But she’s around the same age as Mom, right, Kanzaki-san?”</p>



<p>“I mean, Towa-boy, are you trying to imply I’m old?”</p>



<p>“Not in that sense…”</p>



<p>“Hey, Towa? If that’s true, does it mean I’m old too?”</p>



<p>“Mom, please stop, it’s getting confusing.”</p>



<p>Am I surrounded by women who are particular about age…? Well, I guess I’m at fault for bringing up such associations. Talking about age and wrinkles with women is taboo; it’s written in the Chronicles of the Heart.</p>



<p>“There, there, there’s nothing to worry about.”</p>




<p>“Yeah… Hafuu♪”</p>



<p>I wonder what expression Ayana is making as she presses her face against my chest.</p>



<p>“That’s nice. Scenes like this truly make people around smile.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“It’s hard for me to say that though, since I don’t have a boyfriend.”</p>



<p>Well, there’s not much I can say about that. But… after chatting with Kanzaki-san for a bit, both Ayana and I seem to have opened up quite a bit.</p>



<p>We’re kids and she’s an adult… there’s obviously a difference, but maybe it’s because she, like Mom, exudes some kind of reassuring presence or something similar.</p>



<p>“Do you have someone you’re interested in, Kanzaki-san?”</p>



<p>Though I felt it might be rude, when I asked, Kanzaki-san’s expression quickly turned lively and joyful.</p>




<p>“I actually prefer women over men.”</p>



<p>“…Eh?”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>I’m not one to deny same-sex love, and even if there were someone like that, I wouldn’t belittle them… But still, I was surprised when she suddenly came out like that.</p>



<p>I thought it was just a light joke! And wasn’t Ayana a bit harsh? She didn’t need to run away so fast…</p>



<p>“I’m sorry… I just…”</p>



<p>“…That genuinely apologetic reaction is kind of quietly hurting me.”</p>



<p>Although Kanzaki-san let out a heavy atmosphere with a sinking feeling, she didn’t seem to be genuinely upset.</p>



<p>Having spent such a lively time, it was finally time for dinner, the long-awaited moment.</p>




<p>Fried chicken, nikujaga, and even stew… They all looked so delicious. [TL: Nikujaga is meat and potatoes]</p>



<p>“Eh, it’s been a while since I ate Ane-san’s cooking… The smell itself exudes a scent of excellence!”</p>



<p>“I agree with Kanzaki-san.”</p>



<p>“Yes, indeed. Akemi-san’s cooking is really delicious.”</p>



<p>“Ara ara, you’re not going to get anything done if you praise me.”~”</p>



<p>“The best dishes are already here that you can tell before you eat.”</p>



<p>As I said that, Mom came in front of me and hugged me with all her might.</p>



<p>It seemed that my recent word was somewhat emotional to my mother, and even though Ayana and Kanzaki-san were there, it was embarrassing to let go.</p>



<p>After that, Mom kept it as she liked it for a while, and then the four of us surrounded the table and started eating dinner. Like with Seina-san, once two adults appear, the alcohol is going to come out, too.</p>




<p>“Puhaa~! The beer I drink with Ane-san is always the best!”</p>



<p>“Me too. I feel bad for Towa and Ayana-chan, but I can’t help but enjoy drinking!”</p>



<p>As we advanced with the meal, when the second can of beer was opened, this happened.</p>



<p>Even though it doesn’t seem to be completely ruled by the power of alcohol, we kids can’t keep up with the excitement of the two.</p>



<p>“Ayana, could you pass the soy sauce?”</p>



<p>“Yes, here you go.”</p>



<p>“Thanks.”</p>



<p>“You’re welcome.”</p>



<p>Therefore, I decided to temporarily ignore the drunken pair and focus on the cooking. However, if I left Mom and Kanzaki-san alone like this, they might just start feeling lonely and come bother me.</p>




<p>“Towa has really grown up well… He’s gotten so big, has a cute girlfriend, and always supports me… Everything is just wonderful!”</p>



<p>“H-Hey, Mom! You smell like alcohol…”</p>



<p>“Oh no! That’s so mean!”</p>



<p>W-what a pain!!</p>



<p>There was talk earlier about age and stuff, and since then, Mom seems to have become quite sensitive about smells. This is all because of the alcohol, and normally Mom smells nice… well, it’s awkward to say it like that.</p>



<p>“You’re not jealous, Mom?”</p>



<p>“I’m Towa-kun’s mother, so of course not. There’s no need for that.”</p>



<p>“But your pupils are dilated, though?”</p>



<p>“Did you say something?”</p>




<p>“Hii!? N-no, I didn’t say anything!”</p>



<p>I sighed internally, but I don’t really dislike this kind of lively atmosphere; in fact, it feels quite enjoyable. While I do want to spend quiet moments sometimes, when people gather like this, it’s lively… I was thinking such things when it happened.</p>



<p>[…Hey, Eto, am I really able to properly interact with Towa as a parent?]</p>



<p>[What are you talking about, Ane-san? Towa-boy’s smile is proof enough, isn’t it?]</p>



<p>[But what if that smile is fake? Since… since the accident, Towa has been… always…!!]</p>



<p>For an instant… truly just a moment, an unseen scene floated in my mind.</p>



<p>As if tormented by powerlessness, Mom was shedding tears, and Kanzaki-san seemed to be consoling her. And Kanzaki-san, who was looking at Mom like that, had an expression so frightening that it couldn’t be imagined from the woman I had met today.</p>



<p>“…?”</p>



<p>“Towa? What’s wrong?”</p>




<p>“…N-nothing.”</p>



<p>Because I was absentminded, it seemed to have worried Mom.</p>



<p>Even though just a while ago, I was in a state of astonishing drunkenness due to the power of alcohol, Mom’s face immediately changed to a gentle one as soon as she noticed that something was off with me.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“Towa-boy?”</p>



<p>It seemed to have caught the attention of Ayana and Kanzaki-san, who were watching me and Mom. Especially Ayana, who immediately came over to me and snuggled close.</p>



<p>I don’t intend to spoil such a fun time even a little, so somehow I managed to cover it up. I decided to forget what I had just seen for now.</p>



<p>There’s really nothing going on so it’s fine, and Kanzaki-san seemed to have picked up on my desire to change the atmosphere as she asked Ayana this question.</p>



<p>“By the way, Ayana-chan, did you have any rivals when you started dating Towa-kun?”</p>




<p>“Rivals…?”</p>



<p>In other words, this question is about whether there were any competitors trying to win my affection. Certainly, I… Towa Yukishiro am handsome, but there was no floating talk, and I was always with Ayana, so there was no specific girl other than her.</p>



<p>After thinking about it for a moment, Ayana smiled softly and answered.</p>



<p>“Rivals are mainly used to describe equal or competitive opponents, right? Regarding Towa-kun, there’s no one who can rival me.”</p>



<p>“Ooh… That’s quite confident.”</p>



<p>“On the contrary, I’m just confident. It’s true that back in elementary school and middle school, there were some idiots… some idiots who foolishly tried to express their feelings to Towa-kun even though I was right there, but there’s no way I could forgive them, there’s no one like that, there’s no one like that, not anywhere!”</p>



<p>Ayana… You managed to say it all at once very well.</p>



<p>I’m surprised to hear there were things like that going on without my knowledge. But well, I guess that’s how much you care about me… It doesn’t bother me or scare me, okay? I mean it.</p>



<p>“Well, for starters, Towa-kun is definitely handsome, so he gets attention. But since I’m always by his side, you know? I don’t know if there’s a term like ‘mistress’ for a woman, but no other girl can get close.”</p>




<p>“Oh… As expected.”</p>



<p>“As expected of you, Ayana-chan!”</p>



<p>From there on, it was Ayana’s stage.</p>



<p>Talking about how much she thinks about me, what she always thinks, Mom and Kanzaki-san got really excited listening to Ayana’s stories, and their drinking progressed even further.</p>



<p>As for me, I couldn’t really join in their conversation between women, blushing at the embarrassing topics about me, I quietly picked at the food Mom made for me.</p>



<p>“…The meat and potatoes are delicious.”</p>



<p>It’s not like I was neglected or anything… definitely not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>“Thanks for the company today, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Yeah… I’m exhausted in so many ways.”</p>



<p>Dinner time, full of lively conversation, had finally ended, and now I was walking Ayana home since we had school tomorrow. </p>



<p>Although she had some clothes over at my place and had stayed over even on school nights before, tonight was different since it was sudden, and she didn’t want to leave Seina-san alone, so she decided to go back. </p>



<p>Knowing how Ayana’s relationship with Seina-san used to be, it almost brought tears to my eyes.</p>



<p>“…Haha.”</p>



<p>“What’s so funny?”</p>



<p>“No, just thinking how it’s nice to see you caring about Seina-san.”</p>




<p>“Oh… Fufu, she is my mom, after all ♪”</p>



<p>… I didn’t actually cry, but I was on the verge of it. I wouldn’t claim to have mended their relationship myself, but being involved, it genuinely made me happy to see how things had turned out.</p>



<p>“By the way, Kanzaki-san… she’s quite a force of nature, isn’t she?”</p>



<p>“Yeah… Maybe I met her briefly in the past, but I honestly don’t remember.”</p>



<p>It’s possible that it’s just my consciousness not recalling it, while Towa himself might still remember. Still, it didn’t seem like an important detail.</p>



<p>“……………”</p>



<p>However, thinking about it now, that scene kept coming back to me. That brief moment where I saw Kanzaki-san comforting my mom… The look on Kanzaki-san’s face back then, even in hindsight, was so terrifying that it made my shoulders tremble just recalling it.</p>



<p>Guiding Ayana along the dark street, we finally arrived at her home. Naturally, Shu’s house was also in view, and the light in his room was still on.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, I know you’re curious, but focus on me now, okay?”</p>




<p>“Ah, sorry…”</p>



<p>Realizing she was right, I laughed awkwardly and moved to embrace her at the front door. Despite the relative coolness compared to the daytime, the occasional warm breeze was a bit uncomfortable, but once I started hugging Ayana, I didn’t want to let go. She had that kind of magnetic pull.</p>



<p>“It’s getting pretty hot at night too.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, which means we won’t be able to hug like this during the day or night.”</p>



<p>“I don’t like that! Even if we get all sweaty, I still want to do this.”</p>



<p>“Well, I feel the same way.”</p>



<p>Our somewhat loud conversation must have caught attention because the front door opened, and Seina-san peeked out.</p>



<p>“So it was you two, Ayana and Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Oh, Mom.”</p>




<p>“Good evening, Seina-san.”</p>



<p>Seina-san looked at us, embracing, with a slightly exasperated expression.</p>



<p>“Choosing the right time and place… But I guess that’s too much to ask from you two, huh?”</p>



<p>“What are you talking about, Mom? It’s our goodbye moment, so cut us some slack.”</p>



<p>Ayana said this, tightening her embrace around me even more, ignoring her mom’s comment and enjoying the hug. Seina-san sighed in a resigned manner but then turned to me with a smile.</p>



<p>“It’s late, but why don’t you come in, Towa-kun? I’d like to chat a bit more, though you probably need to head back.”</p>



<p>“Yes… I’m really disappointed, but since I’ve escorted Ayana home, I think I should get going.”</p>



<p>Hearing this, Seina-san visibly showed her disappointment. I knew she looked forward to talking with me and wanted to spend more time together. </p>



<p>While I felt bad about not meeting her expectations, it was deeply moving to see how our relationship had evolved.</p>




<p>“Well then… Would you come again sometime?”</p>



<p>“Of course. How about this weekend then—”</p>



<p>“I’ll be waiting. How about you stay for dinner as well?”</p>



<p>“Uh, okay.”</p>



<p>“It’s settled then!”</p>



<p>…And just like that, it was decided. Her radiant smile, full of anticipation, made me feel like I’d made a great suggestion, and I couldn’t help but smile back. </p>



<p>Honestly, whether it’s my mom, Kanzaki-san, or Seina-san right here, their youthful and beautiful smiles make you forget their actual ages.</p>



<p>“I feel like my mom’s going to steal you away from me, Towa-kun…!”</p>



<p>“That’s not going to happen, don’t worry.”</p>




<p>“She’s right, Ayana. I wouldn’t steal my daughter’s boyfriend… right?”</p>



<p>“Could you stop winking suggestively when you say that?”</p>



<p>After this fun exchange, I headed home. Without Ayana by my side, walking alone through the dark streets felt unusually lonely, especially after the lively dinner. </p>



<p>Reflecting on the fun I had with Ayana and Seina-san was part of it too.</p>



<p>As I continued walking, I approached my house and noticed something strange. Standing in front of the house, just like earlier in the evening, was Kanzaki-san. </p>



<p>When Ayana and I had left, she had been sleeping with drool on her face, but now she looked quite refreshed, smoking a cigarette.</p>



<p>(She smokes? She didn’t smoke at all in the house.)</p>



<p>Right, Kanzaki-san hadn’t smoked at home. Maybe it was because my mom doesn’t smoke, or because Ayana and I were around?</p>



<p>“Well, welcome back, Towa-boy.”</p>




<p>“Thanks.”</p>



<p>We exchanged glances slowly, just like earlier. Honestly, Kanzaki-san looked cool smoking a cigarette. It really suited her.</p>



<p>“Did you drop Ayana off at her house?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Is my mom asleep?”</p>



<p>“She is. Aah, and I carried her to her room.”</p>



<p>“Thanks for that.”</p>



<p>“No problem.”</p>



<p>She waved her hand dismissively and exhaled a plume of white smoke. The smoke spiraled up into the sky, slowly becoming transparent. </p>



<p>As I watched it drift away, Kanzaki-san spoke up.</p>




<p>“I think I’m done with the cigarette. Towa-boy, how about we chat for a bit?”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind.”</p>



<p>I nodded at Kanzaki-san’s suggestion and stood beside her. I wondered what we’d talk about. I glanced at her, but she just stared at the starry sky, lost in thought. </p>



<p>After a few seconds, maybe a few dozen seconds, she finally began to speak.</p>



<p>“Ane-san… she really seemed happy today. The painful expression I once saw on her face was nowhere to be seen.”</p>



<p>“………”</p>



<p>“I think it’s because of you and Ayana. Especially your presence as her son—it makes her smile just seeing you enjoy yourself.”</p>



<p>My mom… yeah, she’s been smiling a lot lately. Even after a tiring day at work, the moment she sees me at home, her face lights up. </p>



<p>Compared to my memories, she’s always smiling these days, looking genuinely happy.</p>




<p>“To me, she’s someone I admire. Back in school, I was quite the punk—there were more delinquents back then, and I was no exception. My family was a bit unusual too, so I got pretty cocky.”</p>



<p>Her family was unusual… well, I’ll leave that alone.</p>



<p>“I heard there was someone older and tougher, so I couldn’t resist picking a fight… and got completely beaten.”</p>



<p>“Excuse me, Kanzaki-san… This is real, right? This is Japan and it’s reality? Not a story from a drama or something?”</p>



<p>“It’s real.”</p>



<p>Yeah, that’s hard to believe. It sounds more like something out of a TV drama or a made-up story… but Kanzaki-san doesn’t seem like she’s lying, and knowing my mom, it actually seems plausible.</p>



<p>“Well, after that, I admired her. I begged her to take me on as her disciple, and here I am today. It’s quite nostalgic to think about. Of course, I can’t do the same things I did back then at my age.”</p>



<p>“I guess that’s for the best.”</p>



<p>If she were still like that, it would be scary. I said this, and Kanzaki-san laughed heartily. She continued to tell me stories about my mom—taking full advantage of her absence.</p>




<p>And then it happened. The atmosphere around Kanzaki-san changed, becoming strangely intense.</p>



<p>“Not only did she soften up after getting a boyfriend, but she also got married, had you, and became a truly wonderful woman. That’s why I couldn’t forgive them—the people who spoke ill of Ane-san or of you, Towa-boy.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>I felt as if my heart was gripped tightly. The intensity wasn’t directed at me, but it was powerful enough to make me want to rub my chest.</p>



<p>(Ah…)</p>



<p>This intensity, this expression… I remembered seeing it in that bizarre vision. It was the same expression Kanzaki-san had when she was comforting my crying mom. She noticed me staring and flashed a sharp smile with her prominent canine teeth.</p>



<p>“That’s why I was determined to use all my power to make them pay. Remember the guy at the gym I mentioned earlier? I have that kind of power.”</p>



<p>“……………”</p>



<p>“Do you find it frightening?”</p>




<p>“… A little.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t just a little; it was pretty scary. But this fear wasn’t ongoing or directed at Kanzaki-san herself. Given her connection to my mom and her demeanor, I felt more reassured than afraid.</p>



<p>“Yes, it’s a bit scary… but I also feel reassured. Watching you interact with my mom, and with Ayana and me, gives me a sense of security.”</p>



<p>“… I see.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-san exhaled, seemingly relieved. Maybe she thought I would be scared and distance myself. That would be a normal reaction, but I understood she was on my side, which outweighed the fear.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-san smiled and put her arm around my shoulder, looking up at the sky.</p>



<p>“I had decided—if Ane-san had ever expressed any resentment or if anything sad had happened because of those people, I would have destroyed them completely.”</p>



<p>I had a strong hunch that she was talking about Shu’s family. And maybe… Ayana’s mother might be included in that too.</p>


<img src="https://i0.wp.com/soafp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-1.jpg?w=608&ssl=1" alt="" />


<p>“But you know…  I met Ane-san after so long, she’s been smiling all this time. Whenever she talks about Towa-boy, it’s with such fondness, like he’s the most precious thing to her. Makes me want her to pay attention to me too, just a little.”</p>




<p>“Mom…”</p>



<p>“Yes-yes♪ Being smiled at like that… Being talked to about the present so happily, you couldn’t possibly do anything about it. With Ane-san, Towa-boy, and Ayana-chan around… today was really fun.”</p>



<p>It sounded like she was saying as if today were the first and last, but it doesn’t seem that way.</p>



<p>From now on, she wants to meet Mom and us frequently.</p>



<p>“Fuwaa… I’m getting sleepy. I drank a lot too, so I think I’ll go to bed soon.”</p>



<p>“Shall we go inside then? Where will you sleep?”</p>



<p>“Is it okay if I sleep in Ane-san’s room?”</p>



<p>“Even if Mom says no, I’ll allow it. I’ll bring a futon.”</p>



<p>“Thank you, Towa-boy! I love you!”</p>




<p>This time, she didn’t just cling to me; she even tried to kiss my cheek, but I guarded it perfectly.</p>



<p>I think only Ayana and… maybe Mom, at worst, should allow such things, and Ayana would probably understand even if she weren’t here. I’m scared of her… yeah, that girl is scary.</p>



<p>“Well then, Towa-boy, tomorrow… I don’t know if I’ll wake up, but see you later.”</p>



<p>“Yes. Good night, Kanzaki-san.”</p>



<p>With that, I parted ways with Kanzaki-san and finally returned to my room.</p>



<p>It seemed like we had talked for quite a while, and a message from Ayana had arrived some time ago confirming that we had safely arrived home.</p>



<p>“…It’s been thirty minutes since then. I might have worried her quite a bit.”</p>



<p>As soon as I sent a message apologizing for not noticing and confirming I had arrived safely, I got a reply in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>‘[As long as you’re safe, that’s all that matters. You were probably talking to Akemi-san or Kanzaki-san, right? Besides, I would know immediately if something happened to Towa-kun!]</p>




<p>Well, she knows everything.</p>



<p>No matter what we talk about, I’m happy to feel Ayana’s deep love… no, honestly, it makes me happy.</p>



<p>“Ayana seems to be thinking about me all the time, but she doesn’t try to control me or anything.”</p>



<p>Ayana’s love is heavy… but it’s a comforting kind of heaviness.</p>



<p>Terms like yandere or mentally unstable are often used for such intense love, but Ayana’s love truly envelops me… well, I guess I’m quite something to think this way.</p>



<p>After continuing to exchange messages with Ayana for a while, we said good night and decided to go to sleep.</p>



<p>“…I’m more tired than I expected. Well, it’s natural after dealing with a drunk person… it was like this when Seina-san came over before.”</p>



<p>After that, I turned off the lights, lay down on the bed, and waited to sleep.</p>



<p>But at that moment, what I was thinking about wasn’t Ayana, Mom, or Shu… it was Kanzaki-san, whom I met today.</p>




<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>I’ve lived in this world where everything was taken from me, as Towa Yukishiro, and I’ve had many dreams. Dreams about Towa’s past, Ayana’s past, and another version of myself that could be called a past life… Originally dreams were meant to organize my thoughts, but now they teach me many truths and help me.</p>



<p>And today too, it seems they’re going to teach me another truth.</p>



<p>“…It’s a dream again.”</p>



<p>Yes, a dream.</p>



<p>It’s strange to be able to assert that it’s a dream… If I were asked to explain this feeling in words, it’s difficult, but if I had to, I’d say it’s a floaty sensation.</p>



<p>Don’t understand? I don’t understand it either.</p>



<p>But this is a dream—so I asserted in my mind, and instantly, Ayana and Kanzaki-san appeared before my eyes.</p>



<p>“…Ayana and Kanzaki-san.”</p>



<p>Given what happened today, this combination wasn’t unusual anymore.</p>




<p>However, Ayana’s aura was filled with thorns… and the atmosphere around Kanzaki-san looking at Ayana was also peculiar.</p>



<p>The two of them gazed at each other before Kanzaki-san spoke first.</p>



<p>“So, you’re really okay with this? Borrowing my power?”</p>



<p>“Yes… I want to show hell to those who made Towa-kun sad and those who made Akemi-san sad.”</p>



<p>“Hahaha! I didn’t expect a student to be so determined. It shows how strong your feelings are for Towa-boy.”</p>



<p>“Of course.”</p>



<p>This… no, I’ll think about it later.</p>



<p>I don’t know what this scene wants to show me, but for now, I’ll focus on their interaction.</p>



<p>“Ayana-chan… are you really prepared?”</p>




<p>“Eh? Of course I am. There are limits to what a student like me can do… That’s why I’m asking an adult like you, who has power.”</p>



<p>“I see. Well, I told you I intend to do this, but my idea of being prepared is about being able to live with darkness. Can you bear that?”</p>



<p>“Live with darkness…?”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-san nodded, took a step closer to Ayana, and continued speaking.</p>



<p>“Of course—by entrapping them, you’ll have to live with that truth hidden in your heart. Without Towa-boy or Ane-san noticing, right? You definitely wouldn’t want them to know.”</p>



<p>“That’s… yes.”</p>



<p>“Even if you start thinking if this was really the right thing, or if there was something else you could have done, it’ll be too late, and you’ll surely suffer. You’re someone who can be ruthless for the sake of your loved ones, but conversely, that love and kindness towards Towa-boy will also torment you.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>Ayana looked down, contemplating something in response to Kanzaki-san’s words.</p>




<p>I couldn’t approach the two in front of me… and it seemed Ayana was in pain, but I couldn’t even speak to reassure her that I was there and that she didn’t need to do such things because I was nearby.</p>



<p>“Are you still going to do it? To drag those who said horrible things to Towa-boy and Ane-san into hell, is that what you’re saying?”</p>



<p>In essence, prompted by Kanzaki-san’s provoking words, Ayana… nodded.</p>



<p>“Yes… I will. Because I cannot forgive them.”</p>



<p>Stop… Ayana, please stop.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-san, please don’t say such things to Ayana… I want to shout at the top of my lungs to stop her, but I’m powerless to do anything.</p>



<p>“Well said. Shall we get into the details then? Nice to meet you, partner-in-crime-chan.”</p>



<p>“Nice to meet you too.”</p>



<p>After Ayana and Kanzaki-san shook hands, the scene before me changed again.</p>




<p>Time seemed to fast-forward like a video being sped up, and once again Ayana and Kanzaki-san stood in the same place.</p>



<p>“It’s over.”</p>



<p>“…Yes.”</p>



<p>“I feel relieved too. Well, I’m used to it, so I don’t really care, but it seems different for you.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>“That’s why I said, didn’t I? That it would turn out this way.”</p>



<p>Judging from their conversation, it could be likened to the ending of a game.</p>



<p>I’ve never seen such a scene in a game, so it’s probably behind the scenes… teaching me that such things existed.</p>



<p>Well, this is all a dream anyway, so I don’t know if it’s true or just my imagination.</p>




<p>“…What do you mean by ‘turn out this way’? I’m satisfied… I’ve finally avenged the grudge I’ve held since the past.”</p>



<p>“I see. Then I won’t ask why you’re crying. We’re partners-in-crime; if anything happens, I’ll be here to listen. So, our scheming about them ends here… Let’s both return to our original daily lives.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-san’s figure disappeared, leaving Ayana alone in that place.</p>



<p>I drifted in the flow of thoughts, but I couldn’t just leave Ayana crying… Even if my voice couldn’t reach her, even if this wasn’t the Ayana I knew.</p>



<p>“…Haa, it’s over… isn’t it?”</p>



<p>Ayana looked up at the sky.</p>



<p>Unaware of me standing beside her, she continued to stare into the empty space, tears streaming down her face.</p>



<p>“…Ah.”</p>



<p>At that moment, it began to rain.</p>




<p>Large drops of rain poured down on Ayana, soaking her in her black parka.</p>



<p>“Raining… huh”</p>



<p>It almost seemed like this rain was reflecting Ayana’s heart, so much so that I couldn’t tell if the drops on her face were rainwater or tears… Wait a moment, I know this scene… Yes, this is it!</p>



<p>“The title screen of the fan disc… So this was it.”</p>



<p>Although I feel like I’ve seen this scene several times in the main game, maybe this connection was real after all.</p>



<p>Well, in the end, it’s just a story in a game, and since this is also a dream, there’s no way to confirm… Unable to do anything for Ayana who continued to cry before me, I woke up.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>“I… remember it all clearly.”</p>



<p>I muttered as soon as I woke up.</p>



<p>The contents of the dream remained vivid in my memory, along with the sense of powerlessness I felt for not being able to do anything for Ayana.</p>




<p>“But… I can be reassured. It won’t turn out like that dream, that much I can guarantee.”</p>



<p>Yes, I can affirm that it won’t turn out like that dream.</p>



<p>I don’t know why I had such a dream now, but I’m no longer worried about Ayana… Even if something bad were to approach, I would handle it before it could affect her — to protect her, and to walk with her into the future.</p>



<p>“And above all… Ayana did have an ally after all — Kanzaki-san.”</p>



<p>It might be explained by the game, by the scenario… But realistically speaking, Ayana, just a high school student, should have had her limitations.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-san was the one who assisted Ayana, helping her seek revenge.</p>



<p>“…Hahe~.”</p>



<p>Whether such a setup was concealed or if Kanzaki-san was prepared to maintain consistency in reality, I don’t know. But through the form of a dream, I learned something I didn’t know before… Ah, well, come to think of it, it’s not like I’m particularly happy about it.</p>



<p>“…I want to see Ayana.”</p>




<p>I murmured softly.</p>



<p>Despite feeling reassured that things wouldn’t turn out that way after seeing such a dream, I couldn’t help but desperately want to see Ayana.</p>



<p>Even though those words came from such feelings, I never expected to get a response.</p>



<p>“Yes, did you call for me?”</p>



<p>“…Eh?”</p>



<p>At that moment, I felt like I lost all sense of time.</p>



<p>Slowly, the voice came from the edge of the bed… and there was Ayana, sitting on the floor with her chin resting on the edge of the mattress… Ayana!?</p>



<p>“?!?!?”</p>



<p>Suddenly, seeing her in my field of vision startled me so much that I jumped and hit the back of my head hard against the wall.</p>




<p>“Gu…! Guuuuuaaaaaa!”</p>



<p>“Are you okay, Towa-kun!?”</p>



<p>No, it’s because of you… I wanted to say, but the pain was so intense that all I could do was groan… And the noise just now seemed to have echoed loudly, as footsteps hurriedly approached from beyond the door.</p>



<p>“Towa!?”</p>



<p>“Towa-boy, what happened!?”</p>



<p>It was my mother and Kanzaki-san who came rushing in, apparently alarmed by the noise they heard.</p>



<p>“S-Sorry… just hit my head a bit…”</p>



<p>I said, relieved that it wasn’t serious, and my mother and Kanzaki-san left the room. However, Ayana remained, bowing her head apologetically.</p>



<p>“I-I’m sorry for surprising you like that…”</p>




<p>“You certainly did startle me, didn’t you…?”</p>



<p>“Um… Was it because you simply wanted to see me?”</p>



<p>“…Well, I guess so.”</p>



<p>Ayana’s slightly shy demeanor made me chuckle wryly. She’s so adorable… Even though I’m relieved that the Ayana I saw in that dream won’t exist anymore, I couldn’t help but embrace her tightly.</p>



<p>“Wawa!?”</p>



<p>“Ah… My headache won’t go away at all…”</p>



<p>“W-What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“It’s not like I hit my head and went crazy or anything. But, yeah, this is how it is… Bright and cute Ayana is the best.”</p>



<p>“…Towa-kun, are you sure you’re okay?”</p>




<p>Am I going overboard with this? Well, I’ve said it many times, but this Ayana is the best… This Ayana who isn’t dark like in the dream, who isn’t crying.</p>



<p>“Thanks for waking me up early. You could have just woken me up.”</p>



<p>“No no, it was fun just watching you! I didn’t blink for tens of minutes!”</p>



<p>That’s a bit scary… But honestly, I was glad to see Ayana first thing in the morning, and above all, I felt reassured.</p>



<p>Alright, today marks the beginning of another day with Ayana.</p>
