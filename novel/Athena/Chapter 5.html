<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>We exited the Labyrinth.</p>
<p>“Well then&#8230;I’m thinking of exchanging the Behemoth for money, do any of you know where the guild is?”</p>
<p>In my previous life, it was customary to exchange monster materials for money at the Adventurer Guild.</p>
<p>“Exchanging monsters for money in a guild feels like that makes us adventurers! But I’m sorry. I don’t know where the guild is&#8230;”</p>
<p>“In that case, allow me to guide you there. When I arrived in the royal capital, I checked for the location of the guild after checking out the magic academy. The royal capital’s Adventurer Guild is quite famous after all”</p>
<p>“That helps us out a lot”</p>
<p>Marise then led us to the Adventurer Guild.</p>
<p>“Is this the place?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Let’s go in immediately”</p>
<p>Marise didn’t hesitate at all and walked into the guild.</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;?</p>
<p>She has a lot of guts.</p>
<p>In my previous life, the Adventurer Guild was an assembly of ruffians.</p>
<p>If children like us entered the guild, we would be immediately spotted and at best our possessions would be stripped off, or at worst we would be burned with magic.</p>
<p>Now&#8230;I wonder how interesting the adventurers in this era are.</p>
<p>With excitement, I followed after Marise.</p>
<p>“…Hmm?”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Kurt?”</p>
<p>Marise tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Is this place really the Adventurer Guild?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Are you doubting me by any chance? I’m sure this is the place”</p>
<p>said Marise, with her cheeks puffed out.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>From my point of view, the guild is too quiet.</p>
<p>Certainly, I can hear the sounds of people that look like adventures talking.</p>
<p>But when they see us, they just say, “Oh? It’s unusual to see children here, isn’t it?”. There wasn’t a guy who would suddenly attack either.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of&#8230;peaceful”</p>
<p>“As expected of Kurt, so brave. I’ve been so nervous ever since I got here!”</p>
<p>“Me too”</p>
<p>In my eyes, both of them should be more cautious.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Well anyway, let’s head towards the reception”</p>
<p>While feeling uncomfortable, the three of us headed for the reception desk.</p>
<p>“Is this your first time in the guild?”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>“In that case, we will start with creating an adventurer license…”</p>
<p>“No, we have the Rosanlila Magic Academy’s student ID card. We can use it as a substitution here, right?”</p>
<p>Marise appeared from the side and took out her student ID card.</p>
<p>The receptionist smiled as soon as she saw it.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s definitely the magic academy’s student ID card. Even so&#8230;if you are first-year students, then isn’t it still your first day of school? What can I do for you? Would you like a guild tour?”</p>
<p>“No, we have exterminated some monsters, so we came here to exchange them for money”</p>
<p>After I said that, the receptionist replied, “Exchange monsters for money…?”, with blinking eyes.</p>
<p>“W-Well, it’s still your first day of school and you’ve already defeated some monsters? That’s amazing! Come to think of it, I heard that there are three geniuses in the magic academy this year. Could it be that it’s you guys?”</p>
<p>The receptionist said in an excited tone.</p>
<p>So talks like that have been going around already, huh.</p>
<p>Due to the receptionist being so loud, it caught the attention of other adventurers in the guild.</p>
<p>“However&#8230;I don’t see anything that looks like a monster material?”</p>
<p>“Well, I can get it out right now&#8230;but I don’t think it will fit on this table, so let’s take it out outside”</p>
<p>“? Understood”</p>
<p>The receptionist followed and we went outside.</p>
<p>Some of the adventurers who were there at the guild also followed us outside, perhaps they, too, were curious.</p>
<p>“I’ll take it out then…”</p>
<p>I took the Behemoth’s corpse out of the storage magic.</p>
<p>To the receptionist and the other adventurers, it probably looked as if a Behemoth had suddenly appeared out of thin air and landed on the empty ground.</p>
<p>“Whoa! Why is there a Behemoth here!?”</p>
<p>“A &lt;&lt;Disaster-Class&gt;&gt; monster is in the city&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“Wait just a minute here. This Behemoth&#8230;seems to be dead already!”</p>
<p>Soon, there was an uproar right in front of the guild.</p>
<p>The guild staff were also flustered and seemed to have trouble dealing with the situation.</p>
<p>“Please be at ease, everyone”</p>
<p>I raised my voice a little to allow the confused people to hear me and continued.</p>
<p>“This is the monster I defeated in the &lt;&lt;Treasure Labyrinth&gt;&gt;. It’s already dead so there’s nothing to worry about”</p>
<p>“You defeated it in the &lt;&lt;Treasure Labyrinth&gt;&gt;&#8230;?”</p>
<p>Everyone then started to fearfully tap the Behemoth’s body.</p>
<p>“It’s true&#8230;it’s certainly dead. Looks like it’s safe”</p>
<p>Apparently, after confirming that it is dead, the adventurers and the guild staff were relieved.</p>
<p>“Yes…it certainly looks like a Behemoth. But where did it come from?”</p>
<p>“From my storage magic”</p>
<p>“Storage magic&#8230;? What’s that? I’ve never heard of it”</p>
<p>Aah, that’s right. Storage magic isn’t common.</p>
<p>But any more fuss will be too much hassle.</p>
<p>I just want to (relatively) live in peace.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the receptionist does not seem to know much about magic.</p>
<p>So instead I said.</p>
<p>“It’s just ordinary magic. Even children can use it. It might be convenient for housewives, too”</p>
<p>““It’s not ordinary!””</p>
<p>Lara and Marise voiced in unison and denied.</p>
<p>Come on, you two.</p>
<p>While I’m trying my best here to deceive them, don’t say anything unnecessary from the sidelines!</p>

<p>Since it is a Behemoth of the &lt;&lt;Disaster-Class&gt;&gt;, it will take some time to exchange it for money.</p>
<p>So I figured I’d have some time to spare, but….</p>
<p>“Kurt-san. The guild master wants to meet you. Would you mind meeting her?”</p>
<p>“The guild master?”</p>
<p>What does the guild master want?</p>
<p>“G-Guild master!? That’s Angelica-san, right?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that she rarely appears in public and that only a few people have seen her…”</p>
<p>Apparently, the guild master is a famous person.</p>
<p>Well, I will probably depend on the guild a lot in the future, so it wouldn’t hurt to meet her.</p>
<p>We were guided by the receptionist to a room deeper inside the guild.</p>
<p>“Are you the one? The outrageous person who brought the Behemoth’s corpse here”</p>
<p>When we got there, there was a beautiful woman sitting on the sofa, exuding a mature aura.</p>
<p>She was wearing a long, captivating purple skirt, and an off-shoulder dress top.</p>
<p>She looked as if she was about to go to a party.</p>
<p>“Wah! It’s the real Angelica-san…!”</p>
<p>“I had hoped to see you at least once, but I never thought that I would see you so soon”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise were nervous.</p>
<p>“So&#8230;what do you want from us?”</p>
<p>“The Behemoth that was brought here using storage magic…moreover, I also heard that it was a child who brought it, so how could I not want to meet him, don’t you agree?”</p>
<p>As if astounded, the guild master ── Angelica, I believe ── sighed.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that an outrageous genius was enrolled in the magic academy this year&#8230;but I never thought it would be this much”</p>
<p>“The information is coming in fast, huh?”</p>
<p>“There are many people who become adventurers after graduating from the magic academy after all. Information comes in whether you like it or not. Moreover, it seems like you’ve defeated that combat maniac, Desmond, during the entrance exam”</p>
<p>Desmond?</p>
<p>Oh, that former S-rank adventurer.</p>
<p>He was the man with the most backbone so far, so I remembered him.</p>
<p>“Desmond may have retired, but he’s still the man who was famed as the strongest adventurer in the royal capital’s history, you know? To have won against him…it’s kind of hard to believe that”</p>
<p>Desmond was certainly strong.</p>
<p>However, if Desmond is the strongest ever in the royal capital’s history&#8230;let’s say, 1000 years ago, then what would I be?</p>
<p>I feel bad for Desmond, but if it’s me from 1000 years ago, I’m confident that I can win even if I fought with only one hand and one leg, and with no magic, too.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I wonder in what way do they pass down my stories from my previous life in this era?</p>
<p>When I was in the village, I did some quick research, but I couldn’t find any of those stories.</p>
<p>“Angelica-san”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Do you know of such a person?”</p>
<p>I decided to ask Angelica about it by telling her my name from my previous life.</p>
<p>I thought that the guild master might know something about it.</p>
<p>However….</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t know of such a person. Is that someone an acquaintance of yours?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that. It’s okay if you don’t know”</p>
<p>Well, since the magic revolution that should have happened 1000 years ago seemingly disappeared, so I was vaguely aware that I would be getting this kind of answer.</p>
<p>“Now. Let’s cut to the chase”</p>
<p>said Angelica, joining her hands together on her lap and continued with a bewitching smile on her face.</p>
<p>“I’ll get straight to the point. Do you intend to leave the magic academy right now and become an adventurer?”</p>
<p>As I thought, this is what she was going to talk about.</p>
<p>In this era, even that Behemoth has become a &lt;&lt;Disaster-class&gt;&gt;.</p>
<p>And I defeated it in 3 seconds.</p>
<p>It’s only natural that I would be recruited by the guild master.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“I refuse. I’m still a student”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s too bad. I somewhat expected that”</p>
<p>Angelica drops her shoulders.</p>
<p>But she doesn’t look too discouraged.</p>
<p>It seems that she has somewhat already expected this.</p>
<p>Or rather, why would she recruit a student who has just enrolled in an academy?</p>
<p>Besides, I can always become an adventurer at any time.</p>
<p>That’s why I want to enjoy the interesting academy life that I didn’t experience in my previous life.</p>
<p>“I wonder, is there anything for Kurt to learn at the academy?”</p>
<p>“F-For someone like me, I’ll learn a lot from studying with Kurt, so that offer was&#8230;foolish!”</p>
<p>“Me too! I’m not giving the guild, Kurt!”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise, both grabbed my arms from the sides.</p>
<p>That’s great and all&#8230;but I can feel the softness of their breast on my arms and I just can’t calm down.</p>
<p>For me, this is a lot more stressful than meeting the guild master.</p>
<p>“But, Kurt. I’m sure you are aware of this as well, a student ID card from the magic academy can be used as a substitute for an adventurer license, too. You can accept requests in accordance with your ability, so you should definitely take advantage of that”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course”</p>
<p>“Besides&#8230;if things get out of hand in the guild, I might ask Kurt to do me a favor&#8230;would you be willing to lend me a hand?”</p>
<p>“Well, as long as it’s reasonable”</p>
<p>I don’t want to make a huge fuss out of it, but if there’s a chance that I can meet someone who is stronger than Desmond ── or even stronger than me, then I’ll go anywhere.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to hear that. Let’s shake hands as a token of acceptance”</p>
<p>There was no reason to refuse after all.</p>
<p>When Angelica and I shook our hands, she suddenly put her face close to my ear and whispered.</p>
<p>“&#8230;You’re a pretty good man. I can’t believe you’re 15 years old. Feel free to come to this room anytime. And of course, alone next time”</p>

<img title="TRM_Vol1_08" alt="TRM_Vol1_08" src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/trm_vol1/cache/TRM_Vol1_08.jpg-nggid0233-ngg0dyn-800x800x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg" width="563" height="800" style="max-width:100%;">

<p>As her breath flowed over my ear, I felt a thrilling sensation.</p>
<p>“H-Hey! What are you doing!?”</p>
<p>“That’s right! Kurt is ours after all. We’re not giving him to you!”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise forcefully pulled my arms towards themselves.</p>
<p>When Angelica saw this, she wore a relaxed smile and said, “Oh, you have two lovely girlfriends”.</p>
<p>She is quite an interesting woman.</p>
<p>If I’m not careful, I’ll be eaten in many ways. I must be vigilant.</p>
<p>“Thank you for waiting! The money exchange is done!”</p>
<p>While we were talking, the receptionist from earlier came into the room winded.</p>
<p>“How long has it been?”</p>
<p>I do not know what is the position of a &lt;&lt;Disaster-Class&gt;&gt; in this world.</p>
<p>But I’ve defeated a monster that seems to be recognized as being quite strong.</p>
<p>The way I see it&#8230;the reward is going to be one gold coin!</p>
<p>A single gold coin is about half a month’s worth of living expenses. I’ll be able to buy a sword, too.</p>
<p>“Y-Yes! Here it is!”</p>
<p>The receptionist placed a bag on the table in front of the sofa with a thud.</p>
<p>It looks heavy.</p>
<p>Could it be that it’s all copper coins?</p>
<p>“Phew…”</p>
<p>“C-Could it be that you are feeling dissatisfied?”</p>
<p>I seem to have freaked out the receptionist by unconsciously letting out a sigh.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that”</p>
<p>After making a follow-up, I looked inside the bag without much expectation.</p>
<p>Hmm, this doesn’t look like a copper coin. Or rather, it’s a gold coin.</p>
<p>1 gold coin, 10 gold coins&#8230;hmm? It looks like there are more than a hundred of them.</p>
<p>“300 gold coins! This is the price of a Behemoth!”</p>
<p>Is this for real?</p>
<p>It was 300 times more than what I had originally expected.</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve seen this much money!”</p>
<p>“This amount is reasonable. That’s what it means to defeat a &lt;&lt;Disaster-Class&gt;&gt; monster after all”</p>
<p>Lara’s eyes widened in surprise, but Marise looked calm.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>There is one thing I learned from this incident.</p>
<p>If I can get this much just for defeating a Behemoth, it looks like I won’t have to worry about money in the future.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“Now then…. I’ve finally gotten some money. With this, hopefully, I can get a good sword”</p>
<p>I murmured after leaving the guild.</p>
<p>“Three hundred gold coins is just&#8230;some money!? Kurt, just how rich are you!? You must have lost your sense for money”</p>
<p>No sense for money, huh?</p>
<p>Three hundred gold coins is a lot of money.</p>
<p>It seems that the monetary value hasn’t changed much since my previous life, so I can understand that much.</p>
<p>However, if I really want to buy a good sword, then three hundred gold coins just isn’t enough.</p>
<p>For example, a thousand years ago, the ‘Magic Sword, <strong>Riadojiku</strong>’ had a value of two hundred million gold coins.</p>
<p>It is said that a single swing with that magic sword can destroy a country, though that’s only limited to places that do not have a decent barrier.</p>
<p>…Well, I did make that magic sword myself.</p>
<p>“Kurt. It’s a silly question, but didn’t you think of making one yourself?”</p>
<p>asked Marise.</p>
<p>“Marise-chan! There’s no way a sword can be made that easily!”</p>
<p>“That’s true&#8230;but somehow I feel like Kurt can do it”</p>
<p>“That’s just impossible! After all, Kurt is a mage, remember? He is not a blacksmith ──”</p>
<p>“I can make one”</p>
<p>“Ehh!?”</p>
<p>Lara widened her eyes.</p>
<p>Hmm. Lara’s reactions are so amusing that I never get tired of watching it.</p>
<p>“I’ve had swords before, but they never felt right. So I learned that it’s faster to make one myself”</p>
<p>Of course, this is a story from my previous life.</p>
<p>“It’s faster to make one yourself…. I don’t think that’s normal”</p>
<p>“It is said that one will require more than twenty years of rigorous training to become a full-fledged blacksmith”</p>
<p>Marise replied with her arms folded.</p>
<p>“I can also make it now. But there isn’t enough material. To create a sword that can satisfy me, I might need to at least dive through one hundred layers of the &lt;&lt;Treasure Labyrinth&gt;&gt;”</p>
<p>But then again, it’s a small labyrinth, so it is a question of whether there are materials that I need even if I go up to a hundred layers.</p>
<p>Buying a sword now is just a means to an end.</p>
<p>“So&#8230;do any of you know of a good weapon store in the royal capital?”</p>
<p>When I asked, Lara and Marise almost simultaneously replied.</p>
<p>“I know! It’s No.1 in the royal capital&#8230;no, the weapon store is said to be the best in the world!”</p>
<p>“That weapon store is famous. That’s why people from all over the world came looking for their weapons there”</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>That sounds promising.</p>
<p>“Then, let’s get going, shall we? I’m counting on you two to guide me there”</p>

<p>We arrived at the weapon store they had mentioned, but I was shocked when I walked into the store.</p>
<p>“This is the best weapon store in the world&#8230;?”</p>
<p>From my point of view, none of them look like much.</p>
<p>“As expected of the work of the famous craftsman, Vera-san”</p>
<p>“These are all magnificent items”</p>
<p>Lara held a sword, and Marise held a bow. Their eyes were sparkling.</p>
<p>Do they really think that the weapons are good?</p>
<p>…Neither of those two weapons has been enchanted with magic, you know?</p>
<p>“Doesn’t this armor look amazing?”</p>
<p>As we walked around the store, Lara spotted a piece of armor.</p>
<p>“Even if a Behemoth were to trample it, it wouldn’t budge”</p>
<p>Marise is also admiring the armor.</p>
<p>Indeed, the iron armor is so sturdy in appearance that it seems capable of withstanding attacks from all sides, too.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“That armor is nothing much, you two. This one over here is much more impressive&#8230;than that”</p>
<p>I picked up the armor on the opposite side of the iron armor.</p>
<p>“Huh? That’s…”</p>
<p>“I-It’s just a swimsuit, isn’t it!? You can’t defend against an attack with that…. Kurt is ecchi!”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>This is the protective gear known as ‘bikini armor’.</p>
<p>“Don’t be fooled by its appearance. It seems that this bikini armor has been enchanted with magic resistance. This armor will protect you from attacks better than that merely heavy and hard to move armor over there”</p>
<p>However, the magic that it has been enchanted with has many defects and far from useful to me&#8230;but still, it is somewhat more useful than the armor that Lara and Marise focused on.</p>
<p>“Really? You are not just distracted by ecchi thoughts, are you&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“In that case, you should try it on. Because then Marise might understand, too”</p>
<p>“Eh…? W-Well, easier said than done now, isn’t it&#8230;?”</p>
<p>I’ve heard that it takes girls a long time to get dressed. So let’s use magic to get her changed in an instant.</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply from Marise, I snap my fingers.</p>
<p>Then, Marise was enveloped by light in an instant, and there she was, wearing the bikini armor.</p>
<p>“Whoa, Marise-chan! It looks good on you!”</p>
<p>Lara got excited.</p>
<p>“What just happened!? Ugh&#8230;it feels drafty here, I’m feeling a little restless”</p>
<p>For some reason, Marise, with tears in her eyes, tries to cover herself with both of her arms.</p>
<p>As Lara said, the bikini armor looked good on her with her good figure.</p>
<p>She has slender white limbs and small but well-shaped twin hills. Her buttocks are firm and supple.</p>
<p>Hmm. Not only magic, but I can see that she also trains her body. She really does have a good body.</p>
<p>“So, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;It’s amazing. Somehow, I can feel the magic power all over my body. It’s like I’m getting warm&#8230;aah, the feeling is kind of addicting”</p>
<p>“I see. If you like it, shall I buy it for you?”</p>
<p>“B-But it’s still embarrassing after all! Besides, I don’t want to rely on Kurt all the time. If I want to buy one, I’ll save up and buy it myself!”</p>
<p>“That’s the spirit”</p>
<p>With another snap of my fingers, I returned Marise to her original dress.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not here to buy protective gear this time. I came here to buy a weapon.</p>
<p>I look away from Marise, who is blushing with embarrassment, and walk around the store again.</p>
<p>It was hard to find anything good, though.</p>
<p>“Do you have any weapons that&#8230;oh?”</p>
<p>Still looking for a weapon, I found it in an inconspicuous corner.</p>
<p>“Oh&#8230;? This seems to be serviceable”</p>
<p>I held the sword and was about to use my analysis magic, <strong>Analyse</strong>, to find out more when ──</p>
<p>“Mm, the boy over there. You’ve noticed that sword?”</p>
<p>I turn around.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, there was a girl with a striking pair of big, round eyes standing in front of me.</p>
<p>“Oh, just now, you must have thought I was a child, didn’t you!? That’s not true. I’m the owner of this store, you know?”</p>
<p>The girl puffed with pride.</p>
<p>However ── perhaps because I’d just met Angelica ── I couldn’t believe that the petite body, flat-chested girl was telling the truth.</p>
<p>“It’s Vera-san!”</p>
<p>“Hm, Lara. Is this child the one you called the famous craftsman?”</p>
<p>“She’ll get angry if you talk like that. She has been out in public a lot, so I know her face”</p>
<p>Hmm, it seems that this girl ── Vera, is telling the truth.</p>

<img title="TRM_Vol1_09" alt="TRM_Vol1_09" src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/trm_vol1/cache/TRM_Vol1_09.jpg-nggid0234-ngg0dyn-800x800x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg" width="563" height="800" style="max-width:100%;" >

<p>“Do you believe me now?”</p>
<p>“Yeah”</p>
<p>“Then that’s good! Well, let me tell you something…. That’s the best weapon in the store. I’ve been keeping it out of sight for a while now…, but how did you notice it?”</p>
<p>The store owner looked at me suspiciously.</p>
<p>“First of all, processing the material Orichalcum is good, and that must have taken a lot of time. It’s been done with such care that it’s still eighty-seven percent pure, and it’s clear just by looking at it that every micrometer of it has been taken care of”</p>
<p>“Boy, you know your stuff! I’ve heard your earlier exchange about the bikini armor, too. Most people only look at the armor on the other side. However…, you’ve found a really good piece of protective gear out of all of them. I thought it was just a coincidence when you noticed the bikini armor, but it looks like that wasn’t the case”</p>
<p>Vera was all smiles.</p>
<p>“I like you! I didn’t expect you to see through it so much at a mere glance. If it’s you, I’ll sell you that sword!”</p>
<p>As she clenched my hands tightly.</p>
<p>This sword is definitely the most decent thing I have seen so far after I have reincarnated.</p>
<p>This gave me a sense of Vera’s ability as a blacksmith.</p>
<p>And so I asked her.</p>
<p>“Yes. Then I’ll buy this one. What’s the price for it?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be surprised when you hear it. It’ll cost&#8230;a hundred gold coins! Not a cent less!”</p>
<p>“Here’s one hundred gold coins. Please check to confirm”</p>
<p>“Fufufu, was a hundred gold coins a little too much for you? But do continue to work harder to buy this sword, boy! As for you who have seen my excellent sword, you should be able to buy it if you work hard as an adventurer for three years&#8230;no, one year&#8230;wait, eh!?”</p>
<p>Vera, who was talking pleasantly, suddenly looked surprised when she saw the pile of gold coins in the bag.</p>
<p>“A-Are you a child of nobility…? In that case, that makes sense. You have received special education ever since you were a little boy. So that probably explains why you were able to see right through the weapons I’ve made. Haha, hahaha!”</p>
<p>Vera gave a nervous laugh and stepped back.</p>
<p>I’m not a noble, though. She seems to be mistaken.</p>
<p>“Well then, from now on, that sword belongs to you! Take good care of it”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much”</p>
<p>I bowed.</p>
<p>I gripped the sword again and held the blade up to the light.</p>
<p>“Kurt, good for you! It really suits you!”</p>
<p>“Yes, it sure is cool…, rather than that, Lara! You don’t need a cool weapon! Functionality is more important!”</p>
<p>“Ehh&#8230;, isn’t it better to be cool or cute?”</p>
<p>While Lara and Marise were fussing about something, I had finished analyzing it.</p>
<p>“All right, let’s go work on this sword at once”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“I’ll improve it”</p>
<p>When I said that, Vera’s eyes couldn’t have been more widely opened.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“Improve it&#8230;?”</p>
<p>Vera&#8217;s eyes opened widely, and tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>“W-W-What do you mean!? Why do you need to improve it!?”</p>
<p>Vera asked, leaning forward.</p>
<p>“It would be useless if I were to use it in this state&#8230;. No, I thought I could make it a better sword”</p>
<p>“You bought it, so you’re free to do what you want with it, but are you sure about that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah”</p>
<p>I nodded, and Vera crossed her arms with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re an interesting boy. Good. I&#8217;ll lend you my smithy. You can use it to your heart&#8217;s content!”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s all right. I’m done”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Vera almost fell.</p>
<p>“W-When did you do that!?”</p>
<p>“While we were talking.”</p>
<p>Vera was so absorbed in talking that she didn&#8217;t seem to notice, so I had taken the magic stone obtained in the &lt;&lt;Treasure Labyrinth&gt;&gt; and inlaid it into the sword.</p>
<p>By doing so, it was enchanted with magic.</p>
<p>It took me less than a second to do this. So it&#8217;s no wonder that she didn&#8217;t notice.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s changed?”</p>
<p>“It doesn&#8217;t look any different…”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise put their faces close to the sword.</p>
<p>Are they&#8230; doubting my skills?</p>
<p>I’ve indeed been relatively bad at such production magic since my previous life.</p>
<p>Although I was not good at it, there was only one blacksmith in the world who was maybe a little better than me.</p>
<p>In the first place, Gold Magic is not really suited for production jobs.</p>
<p>“Right, let’s see&#8230; store owner. Do you have anything that I can use to try out the sword?”</p>
<p>I asked.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s a Mud Doll in the back of the store. It&#8217;s a very tough doll. No matter how many times you slash at it, it&#8217;ll be fine!”</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, it&#8217;s one of those fragile dolls used in the entrance examination.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good enough for trying out the sword.</p>
<p>We immediately went to the back of the store where the Mud Doll was kept.</p>
<p>When we looked at the Mud Doll, we saw that it was covered with countless cuts.</p>
<p>As the store owner had said, it seemed to be used as a doll for trying out swords.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t put too much strength on it, okay? Some people broke their bones because the Mud Doll was too tough”</p>
<p>Vera warned.</p>
<p>“I understand. I&#8217;ll try not to put too much strength on it”</p>
<p>I held my sword in one hand and gazed at the Mud Doll.</p>
<p>“Hmph”</p>
<p>As it is, I sloppily slashed the Mud Doll horizontally half-heartedly.</p>
<p>Then ── the Mud Doll was slashed into two.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Huh?”</p>
<p>The store owner kept her mouth partially opened.</p>
<p>“Hmm… that’s about right”</p>
<p>All I used was a single magic stone, after all. So something like this is to be expected.</p>
<p>While I was deep in thought, I returned the sword to its sheath.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. Well then, I shall take my leave”</p>
<p>“W-Wait a minute!”</p>
<p>I was held back.</p>
<p>“W-Why did the sharpness become so much better!?”</p>
<p>“Right. After inlaying the magic stone, I enchanted it with magic such as <strong>[Sharpness +500%]</strong>, <strong>[Physical Strength Support +500%]</strong>, <strong>[Light-weight]</strong>, and so on”</p>
<p>There are more than that, but if I tell her that, I think Vera might collapse. So let’s stop here.</p>
<p>“Enchant magic in an instant? Besides, I&#8217;ve never heard of someone being able to enchant two or three magic! And no matter how much you try… a light swing like that can’t split a Mud Doll in half!”</p>
<p>“Right, I&#8217;m sorry. If I remember correctly, Mud Dolls are expensive. I&#8217;ll fix it right away”</p>

<p>“Eh!?”</p>
<p>Vera&#8217;s eyes popped out in surprise when I restored the Mud Doll to its original state with Restoration Magic.</p>
<p>“T-That’s&#8230;! It should have taken ten years of training to be able to enchant magic! And yet&#8230; why&#8230; why&#8230;”</p>
<p>Perhaps out of surprise, Vera repeated the word <em>“Why”</em>.</p>
<p>Hmm. In that case, I think I can make money as a blacksmith. Well, I don&#8217;t intend to become one right now, though.</p>
<p>“Well, it&#8217;s Kurt, after all&#8230;. As I thought, he did the same thing when he worked on my ring”</p>
<p>“Of course. I can&#8217;t be surprised every time. It&#8217;s Kurt, after all”</p>
<p>The two of them didn&#8217;t seem too surprised, but their dumbfounded stares were a mystery.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve bought a sword, fixed the Mud Doll, and I&#8217;m done.</p>
<p>As I was about to leave the weapon store again.</p>
<p>“Wait, wait!”</p>
<p>Vera hugged me from behind and restrained me.</p>
<p>“F-Five of my best…. No! Just one! Just one sword, can you do what you just did? I&#8217;ll pay you whatever you want!”</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but it’s not possible. Besides, I don&#8217;t have any magic stones left, so I can&#8217;t do what I did just now”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s fine! So&#8230; please! For the wish of my lifetime!”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Can’t you do it?”</p>
<p>Vera grabbed her collar with both hands and showed her chest.</p>
<p>It was a flat chest.</p>
<p>However, the pink-colored buds at the top of the two summits do give off certain femininity.</p>
<p>“Y-You can do whatever you want to me if you like. So…”</p>
<p>“H-Hold on! Don’t teach Kurt anything weird!”</p>
<p>Lara intervened from the side and pressed her chest against my right arm.</p>
<p>Big.</p>
<p>Vera is not bad, but as I thought, I feel more comfortable with the tender Lara.</p>
<p>That being said.</p>
<p>“Haa, fine. Just one sword, okay? But I can&#8217;t guarantee the quality”</p>
<p>Vera wasn&#8217;t going to back down at this point, so I let out a sigh and replied.</p>
<p>“T-Thank you!”</p>
<p>“But I don&#8217;t need the money. Let’s see… if you have any good materials or swords, or if you have any information, please let me know first, okay?”</p>
<p>“Are you fine with just that!?”</p>
<p>“I can do it in one second, so I don&#8217;t need to get paid that much”</p>
<p>“O-One second!?”</p>
<p>Getting information should be a higher priority than money right now.</p>
<p>After that, I enchanted the store owner’s prized sword with <strong>[Slashing Speed +500%]</strong> and left the store for real this time.</p>
<p>◆　◆</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s quite a splendid building”</p>
<p>I had already finished my business, so I dined out with the two of them and then returned to the front of the dormitory.</p>
<p>Rosanlila Magic Academy is a boarding school.</p>
<p>The dormitory, located right next to the school building, is a gorgeous building.</p>
<p>“Such a stylish building, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s beautiful!”</p>
<p>“The dormitory of Rosanlila Magic Academy has won several famous Architecture Awards. There are even people who want to join the Magic Academy just to live here”</p>
<p>Lara&#8217;s eyes lit up while Marise crossed her arms and said calmly.</p>
<p>Hmm….</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a splendid building. I really do mean that.</p>
<p>But it seems that there are no barriers?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m worried about that, so let’s set one up…. No-no, it&#8217;s a bad habit of mine to meddle like this. I&#8217;ll stop now.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s Eri-chan!”</p>
<p>In front of the dormitory, Eri-chan&#8230; our class homeroom teacher, Erika-sensei, was standing there.</p>
<p>She looked a little grumpy.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re the last of the new students to come back”</p>
<p>She said with a stern look.</p>
<p>“Eh!? When did it get so late!?”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been to the labyrinth, the guild, choosing weapons&#8230; and so on, after all”</p>
<p>Time flies when you&#8217;re doing something, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>“So&#8230; why is Sensei here?”</p>
<p>“I’m your homeroom teacher and the dormitory chief executive. I&#8217;m here to give you a list of the dorm’s rules and your assigned room number”</p>
<p>said Erika, handing us a thin booklet and a piece of paper with our room number written on it.</p>
<p>It seems that my room is located on the eighth floor of Building A.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m on the third floor of Building A!”</p>
<p>“Me too&#8230;. Is it the same building for men and women?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s a mixed dormitory. We don&#8217;t have the budget to build two separate dormitories. But don&#8217;t get any weird ideas, okay? Illicit sexual relationships are forbidden, after all”</p>
<p>What a surprise.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t read through the academy’s rules yet, but I didn&#8217;t know there was such a thing.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Did we have an academy rule like that?”</p>
<p>Marise asked Sensei.</p>
<p>But Sensei was firm.</p>
<p>“Even if there were no such academy rule, it would be unacceptable for you to engage in illicit sexual relationships while training in magic! What&#8217;s more, you guys are first-year students! If you have time for that, you should be learning some magic!”</p>
<p>said Sensei.</p>
<p>“Well then, I&#8217;ve got some work to do, so I&#8217;m going back to the academy. A-And don&#8217;t you dare do anything indecent, understand?”</p>
<p>With that, Sensei left us.</p>
<p>She is quite a strict teacher.</p>
<p>But I agree with her that illicit sexual relationships are a hindrance to magic training.</p>
<p>In my previous life, I continued to train my magic without paying attention to women.</p>
<p>&#8230;It’s not because I didn’t dare to talk to the girls.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Sensei was kind of angry. Is it because we didn&#8217;t come back early?”</p>
<p>“No&#8230; probably not”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise were talking in hushed tones so that the departing teacher could not hear them.</p>
<p>At any rate, I think I&#8217;ll go to bed now.</p>
<p>I still have enough stamina, but as I thought, I&#8217;m tired from all the events that occurred today.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been good with crowded places, even in my previous life.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The dormitory room was quite spacious.</p>
<p>“As expected. Well, I’ve heard that it’s a prestigious academy&#8230; Oh? The bathroom is spacious as well.”</p>
<p>I like taking a bath.</p>
<p>A millennium ago, I often set out for unexplored secluded hot springs as a hobby.</p>
<p>I remember the first thing I was relieved about was that the bathing culture still existed after my reincarnation.</p>
<p>“All right… Let&#8217;s get some hot water going.”</p>
<p>I muttered and used magic to fill the bathtub with water and then heated it with fire magic.</p>
<p>In no time, the bathroom was filled with steam. When I dipped my hand into the water, the temperature was just right.</p>
<p>Feeling my heart was pounding, I took off my clothes and got into the bath.</p>
<p>“Haa&#8230; I feel alive again.”</p>
<p>Soaking myself in the bathtub of hot water, I watched the steam gather at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8230;Hm?</p>
<p>Someone seems to have entered this room.</p>
<p>“Wait&#8230;! I didn’t know he’s taking a bath ── I&#8217;ll come back later ──”</p>
<p>“Just in time. Let’s give him ── a massage ──”</p>
<p>“It’s shameless ── casually borrowing towels ──”</p>
<p>I can hear their intermittent voices.</p>
<p>Then ──</p>
<p>“Kurt, we’re coming in!”</p>
<p>“P-Please wait, Lara. I&#8217;m still not mentally prepared yet&#8230;”</p>
<p>While saying that, Lara entered the bathroom while pulling Marise&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>“H-Hey there&#8230; What are you guys doing here?”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise have their towels wrapped around them, but they would be naked if they took them off.</p>
<p>I could see a glimpse of their cleavage, and that made me feel a tad excited.</p>
<p>“I was just talking to Marise-chan about how much Kurt has helped us. We want to do something for Kurt, too.”</p>
<p>“Kurt looks tired. So I was thinking of giving you a massage, but&#8230; I didn&#8217;t expect you to be taking a bath&#8230; We are a nuisance, right? We&#8217;ll leave right away!”</p>
<p>“N-No, you’re not a nuisance…”</p>
<p>I never thought they would come in with their clothes off.</p>
<p>Lara’s huge bosom looked as if it was about to burst out of the towel. Whenever she made the slightest movement, the two bulges would shake.</p>
<p>Marise also has her hair tied up and her cheeks blushing slightly in embarrassment. She looked so fascinatingly elegant that I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off her.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t be so shy, Marise-chan! I&#8217;m embarrassed, too…”</p>
<p>“Ugh&#8230;”</p>
<p>Marise blushed and cast her gaze downwards.</p>
<p>Lara, on the other hand, peered at my face.</p>
<p>“Why don&#8217;t you look at us, Kurt?”</p>
<p>She asked curiously.</p>
<p>Oh, Lara, please do not move your face so close to me.</p>
<p>A large bulge of breasts appeared right in front of me, and it was increasingly difficult to look at her.</p>
<p>“Kurt, let us wash your back! It’s going to feel good. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll take the edge off Kurt&#8217;s fatigue.”</p>
<p>“I-Is that so. T-Then thank you.”</p>
<p>I was a little bewildered because I did not have a towel wrapped around me, but&#8230; they were offering to wash my back. It would be tactless to refuse.</p>
<p>I slowly got out of the bathtub and sat down on a stool in the bathroom.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll wash your back then. Marise, too! Stop being shy!”</p>
<p>Lara&#8217;s breath hits my back.</p>
<p>The thought of a naked girl right behind me made my heart pound.</p>
<p>“Ugh&#8230; I got it. I just don&#8217;t like the thought of owing a debt to someone. I also don&#8217;t like the one-sided&#8230; relationship of having Kurt teach me magic, after all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lara grabbed the soap that was in the bathroom.</p>
<p>“Wah, Kurt&#8217;s back is solid!”</p>
<p>Lara lather up the soap and brushes my back with both hands.</p>
<p>“That’s because I&#8217;ve been training.”</p>
<p>“It’s amazing. It&#8217;s really solid. I can feel the muscles tightening up inside.”</p>
<p>“I-Is that so… More than that, you can brush it a little harder if you want, Lara. It&#8217;s a bit too soft till it kind of tickles a little.”</p>
<p>It was as if I was being brushed through my downy hairs. An indescribable feeling ran through my skin.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a bad feeling, though.</p>
<p>“Ah, I&#8217;m sorry. Hurry up, Marise-chan!”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m&#8230; ready!”</p>
<p>Marise also took the soap and lathered it up with both hands.</p>
<p>She then washed my chest with her shaky hands without looking forward.</p>
<p>It is not just my back anymore, but&#8230; if they are willing to wash my entire body, I will just leave it to them.</p>
<p>“Eek… T-This is Kurt’s body. It&#8217;s solid&#8230; But when I touch it, it feels gentle.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sure this will get rid of the stiff muscles! Let’s keep it up!”</p>
<p>&#8230;At any rate, Marise is also being too soft to the point that it makes me shiver. I almost moaned.</p>
<p>“Hmm, but I still don&#8217;t feel relaxed.”</p>
<p>So Lara said:</p>
<p>“How can we get you to relax? I don&#8217;t think I can satisfy Kurt.”</p>
<p>“Not really. I&#8217;m not tired anymore.”</p>
<p>“If Kurt says so&#8230; But you still look tired&#8230; Ah, that’s right!”</p>
<p>Lara clapped her hands as if something had struck her mind.</p>
<p>Right after, I heard what sounded like a towel falling to the floor.</p>
<p>&#8230;A towel falling?</p>
<p>“What the hell are you doing, Lara?”</p>
<p>Marise thrashed her hands around as she looked away.</p>
<p>“I-I&#8217;m embarrassed, too.”</p>
<p>I could tell from her voice that Lara was blushing.</p>
<p>“B-But&#8230; I want Kurt to feel satisfied… And I&#8217;m sure scrubbing Kurt with something soft will soften up his body.”</p>
<p><strong><em>*Rub*</em></strong></p>
<p>A soft feeling on my back.</p>
<p>This is&#8230; Lara is pressing her body against me!?</p>
<p>This caused a continuous feeling of her soft breasts to travel down my back.</p>
<p>“How is it, Kurt? Does it feel good?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Great. I&#8217;ll try harder then!”</p>
<p>Lara continued to move her body up and down, trying to wash my body with her entire body.</p>
<p>The feeling of slimy foam and the softness of Lara.</p>
<p>It was rubbed against me, and an indescribable feeling of pleasure reverberated in my brain.</p>
<p>“Wha-? But I think it’s getting stiffer. Why?”</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I had never experienced anything like this, even in my previous life. So I was mentally strained. It was to the point that my body became stiff.</p>
<p>“Lara! You’re being shameless! That&#8217;s shameless! Kurt is troubled. So stop it right now ──”</p>
<p>It was at that moment that Marise immediately stood up and reached out to stop Lara&#8217;s conduct.</p>
<p>“── !”</p>
<p>I was speechless.</p>
<p>It was probably because she moved in a hurry.</p>
<p>With that momentum, the towel that was wrapped around Marise&#8217;s body came off.</p>
<p>“Kyaa!”</p>
<p>Marise quickly covered her body with her arms.</p>
<p>But in that split second, I saw it.</p>
<p>Marise&#8217;s beautiful naked body.</p>
<p>Her skin is white and vivacious, and her arms were not enough to cover it all.</p>
<p>“W-W-Where is the towel!?”</p>
<p>She looked around for the towel, but she could not seem to find it right away due to the steam.</p>
<p>“Where! Where is it!?”</p>
<p>The towel is right beneath her, but it seems like she is having a hard time noticing it.</p>
<p>While she is looking for the towel, her breasts and buttocks keep coming into my view.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“H-Hey… It&#8217;s right down there ──”</p>
<p>I said, as I reached out to take the towel.</p>
<p>“Kurt ── ! Please don’t look, it’s shameless!”</p>
<p>“W-What!?”</p>
<p>Perhaps out of panic, Marise hugged me from the front.</p>
<p>── !?</p>
<p>“Ugh&#8230; I’m so embarrassed&#8230; I’m about to go crazy here.”</p>
<p>Marise&#8217;s whispers reached my ears.</p>
<p>With Lara hugging me from behind, Marise hugging me from the front, and my body being wrapped in incredible softness.</p>
<p>I cannot see Marise&#8217;s face, but the image of her naked body has burned into my mind and made me stiffer.</p>
<p>── What the hell is this situation!?</p>
<p>Being sandwiched by two girls was something I could never have imagined in my previous life.</p>
<p>“Kurt…”</p>
<p>“W-What is it?”</p>
<p>said Lara with a lonely voice.</p>
<p>“You seem to be preoccupied with Marise for a while now.”</p>
<p>It cannot be helped.</p>
<p>After all, this was the first time I had ever seen a girl naked.</p>
<p>“Kurt.”</p>
<p>Lara pulled herself away from me and instead grabbed my hand to turn me around.</p>
<p>“Kurt, look at me too. It pains me that Kurt keeps looking at Marise-chan.”</p>
<p>Lara&#8217;s naked body was right in front of me.</p>
<p>The two ‘mounds’ on her breasts. A slightly thicc body. However, the waist and ankles were thin and looked like a work of art.</p>
<p>“My breasts… are bigger.”</p>
<p>“What ── !”</p>
<p>Lara pressed my hand against her left breast.</p>
<p>My hand sank into her breast.</p>
<p>It was many times softer than what I had just felt on my back.</p>
<p>“I had read in books that boys like girls with big breasts better.”</p>
<p>“H-Hey&#8230; Lara. I understand, so let go of my hand…”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t want to. T-The truth is, this is very embarrassing, you know? But I thought that it would be nice if it were Kurt… So I&#8217;ll put up with it for Kurt, even if I’m feeling embarrassed.”</p>
<p><strong><em>*Grope, Grope*</em></strong></p>
<p>Lara further pressed my hand against her breast.</p>
<p>I tried to remove my hand immediately but could not move my body. It was as if I was under a powerful restraining spell.</p>
<p>“Kurt. L-Look at me too!”</p>
<p>This time, Marise takes my other hand.</p>
<p>And like Lara, she slowly pressed my hand against her right breast.</p>
<p>“W-What are you doing, Marise?”</p>
<p>“I-I don&#8217;t know either. But when… Lara and Kurt were like that, I felt kind of lonely&#8230; Like Lara said, does Kurt prefer girls with big breasts?”</p>
<p>“T-That&#8217;s not ──”</p>
<p><em>True ──</em>, but I could not make out the words.</p>
<p>Marise’s small breasts still have a certain feminine softness to them.</p>
<p>“A-Anyway, that&#8217;s it! I’m getting out of the bathroom!”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because I tried to shake them off with all my might.</p>
<p>“Hyaa!”</p>
<p>“Kyaa!”</p>
<p>I heard them both yell.</p>
<p>I had used the wrong amount of force, and my hands had ── groped their breasts.</p>
<p>“Kurt, you’re so bold. I can&#8217;t believe you fondled them so hard…”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t planning on doing that…”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m feeling embarrassed too. But it&#8217;s okay if it&#8217;s Kurt. Because I don&#8217;t want Lara to hog Kurt all to herself.”</p>
<p>I could not let go of my hands altogether, as if they had been drawn to the two of them.</p>
<p>Each time I moved my hands, their breasts freely changed their form.</p>
<p>It was a strange sensation.</p>
<p>It was as if I was being manipulated, my fingers started to latch on the protruding ‘mounds’ of their breasts.</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>Lara&#8217;s seductive voice.</p>
<p>“K-Kurt! I-It kind of tickles there. But somehow, it also feels good…”</p>
<p>Lara’s eyes seem to show that she’s being bewitched by this.</p>
<p>Her hair was disheveled, and she looked different from her usual cheerful and energetic self.</p>
<p>Since it has come to this.</p>
<p><strong><em>*Chomp Chomp*</em></strong></p>
<p>“Nnnn, aahh ahhhh! Kurt, Kurt! Fondle it more!”</p>
<p>As I played with Lara&#8217;s breasts, her chin gradually rose.</p>
<p>“Kurt! Please do the same for me! As what you did for Lara!”</p>
<p>Marise’s tone was almost pleading.</p>
<p>“Y-Yeahh.”</p>
<p>Since she has insisted that much, let’s do it for her.</p>
<p>While fondling their breasts, I sometimes caressed the protruding ‘mounds’ of their breasts.</p>
<p>“Aaahhhh!”</p>
<p>“Mmph ── there ── Aaah!”</p>
<p>I felt that their grip on my arms was getting stronger.</p>
<p>The two of them let out seductive breaths, and the breaths gradually became faster.</p>
<p>── Are they okay?</p>
<p>Their heavy breathing had me worried for a moment, but they did not look like they were in pain.</p>
<p>On the contrary, they seemed to enjoy themselves to their heart&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>“Kurt, more! I&#8217;m almost there!”</p>
<p>“Haa, haa. Kurt, me too. I&#8217;m also feeling something is coming!”</p>
<p>Every time I moved my hand, their bodies twitched.</p>
<p>Both of them seemed to be enduring the approaching climatic pleasure.</p>
<p>Lara stares blankly at the ceiling, while Marise is bending slightly forward with her mouth agape.</p>
<p>“Should we stop now?”</p>
<p>Seeing the two of them looking so adorable, I could not help but tease them.</p>
<p>As I asked them that,</p>
<p>“No! Don&#8217;t stop! T-Touch me more. I won&#8217;t lose to Marise-chan.”</p>
<p>“I won&#8217;t lose to Lara either! I&#8217;ll do my best until the end, so please touch me harder! ── Aaaahhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Since they have insisted, and I&#8217;m a man too. Let&#8217;s take responsibility until the very end.</p>
<p>As if it were the last spurt, I resumed my fondling of their breasts.</p>
<p>I felt their breasts getting softer, perhaps because I had fondled them too hard.</p>
<p>“Aaaahhhhh! Mmphh ──”</p>
<p>“Aah, just a little more ── aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Intermittent seductive voices emanated from them.</p>
<p>Their voices and movements gradually became more intense. And their figure was so glamorous that it was hard to imagine them from their usual appearance.</p>
<p>“Aah!”</p>
<p>“Nnnn!”</p>
<p>Short voices.</p>
<p>Lara straightened her back, and Marise, who had been looking down the entire time, raised her chin, and that was when ──</p>
<p>““Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh ── !!&#8221;”</p>
<p>The two shrieked.</p>
<p>And at the same time, their body spasms.</p>
<p>“H-Hey, you two…”</p>
<p>I called out to them.</p>
<p>They did not answer me, but separated themselves from me and laid their backs slowly against the bathroom wall. And they sat slumped next to each other on the floor.</p>
<p>“Are you okay? Your face is all red…”</p>
<p>“Haa, haa… I&#8217;m tired.”</p>
<p>“Me too. I didn&#8217;t realize that washing another person&#8217;s body was such hard work… haa, haa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are they not going to cover their body at this point?</p>
<p>They seem to be struggling to catch their breaths and savoring the lingering sensations in their bodies.</p>
<p>“Kurt, how was it?”</p>
<p>“Are you feeling better?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yea. T-Thank you. It worked.”</p>
<p>I nodded in response to their questions.</p>
<p>In fact, I felt like many parts of my body had loosened up and relaxed.</p>
<p>It feels good to be washed by others, but&#8230; I&#8217;m still not used to being touched by girls.</p>
<p>After that ── I couldn&#8217;t get out of the bathroom until the two of them returned to normal.</p>
