<h2>Chapter 5: You’re Still the Same as Back Then</h2>


<p>Himawari’s birthday is approaching.</p>



<p>It’s her first birthday that they would be celebrating together.</p>



<p>And Kamome has prepare the first birthday present he would ever give to her.</p>



<p>We are talking about that Himawari.</p>



<p>She might not be so concerned about such things.</p>



<p>Her invitation to her birthday was probably just a small wish to spend a pleasant time with Kamome.</p>



<p>Still, that doesn’t mean he should ignore it.</p>



<p>「Hmm…」</p>



<p>In the classroom, Kamome sitting in his seat, was pondering with his arms crossed.</p>



<p>「Oh, what are you worried about?」</p>



<p>Seeing Kamome like this, Kensuke and Misaki approach him.</p>



<p>「Well, it’s almost Himawari’s birthday…」</p>



<p>「So that’s why you’ve been worried all morning?」</p>



<p>Misaki looks at Kamome, who is groaning, and gives him a dumbfounded look.</p>



<p>「When’s her birthday?」</p>



<p>「In three weeks.」</p>



<p>「She invited you quite early. Maybe she’s not used to this sort of thing either? Yo’, innocent couple.」</p>



<p>「Stop teasing.」</p>



<p>Misaki pokes Kensuke.</p>



<p>「Well, jokes aside, there is still time. Do you have any idea of what you’re going to give her?」</p>



<p>「Well, before that, there’s a financial issue…」</p>



<p>「Ah, so you don’t have funds for the present」</p>



<p>Not that he doesn’t have any…</p>



<p>Kamome receives a monthly allowance from his parents.</p>



<p>Using that, he has been able to take care of various things such as entertainment expenses, necessary items for his studies, personal appearance, and other necessary life experiences during his high school years.</p>



<p>But what he needs this time is a birthday present.</p>



<p>If it’s a birthday present, of course he wants to give her something nice.</p>



<p>「That being said, what does Shishido like? I don’t know about that area.」</p>



<p>「Let’s see, she likes manga, anime, games, and… cute things.」</p>



<p>What would be a good present for Himawari?</p>



<p>Despite discussing it with Kensuke and Misaki, they didn’t reach a conclusion in the end.</p>



<p>「Let’s start homeroom.」</p>


<p>While they were at it, the homeroom teacher came to the classroom.</p>



<p>「Well, there’s still time, so get something you’re satisfied with.」</p>



<p>After being told this by the two, Kamome found himself even more troubled, mumbling, “Yeah…”</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>「Let’s work!」</p>



<p>It’s a present for my girlfriend.</p>



<p>I want to properly buy her a present with my own hard-earned money.</p>



<p>Kamome concluded so first of all and decided to start a part-time job.</p>



<p>However, due to school regulations, he needed his parents’ permission to start working part-time.</p>



<p>At home, Kamome decided to express his desire to start a part-time job to his father.</p>



<p>「…I made up my mind, but how should I explain it to my father?」</p>



<p>Will he be convinced if he honestly tells him “I want to work because I want to prepare a present for my girlfriend”?</p>



<p>How should he bring it up?</p>



<p>As he was wondering that──</p>



<p>「What’s wrong? Kamome, you look troubled.」</p>



<p>Kamome, who was wandering around the living, was called out.</p>



<p>「Ah, dad.」</p>


<p>A sturdy man appears from behind Kamome.</p>



<p>「Is there something you want to tell me?」</p>



<p>He has a solid build and short, neatly combed hair.</p>



<p>While his son Kamome has a slightly childish face, he has a fearless face and a beard on his chin.</p>



<p>He is Kamome’s father.</p>



<p>「H-How did you know?」</p>



<p>「It’s the bond between father and son… I’d like to say, but in your case, your emotions show on your face right away, so it’s easy to tell.」</p>



<p>As expected of a police officer.</p>



<p>His observational skills are sharp.</p>



<p>Kamome’s father laughs at his admiration.</p>



<p>「I know, it’s about your girlfriend, isn’t it?」</p>



<p>Furthermore, his father hit the nail on the head and Kamome was taken aback.</p>



<p>「What is it? Aren’t things going well?」</p>



<p>「No, I think we’re getting along great.」</p>



<p>「I envy your youth to be able to say that clearly.」</p>



<p>Laughing, his father continues.</p>



<p>「Then, why are you worried?」</p>



<p>「Well, actually…」</p>



<p>Despite thinking about it a lot, in the end, he had no choice but to tell him honestly.</p>



<p>In the first place, he’s that kind of person.</p>



<p>「Dad, I want to start a part-time job.」</p>



<p>「…Do you have a reason?」</p>



<p>Kamome’s father looks at him straight in the eye and asks.</p>



<p>He basically respects the wishes of his son, Kamome.</p>



<p>He is rather laissez-faire and allows Kamome to be free to do what he wants.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to part-time jobs, going out into society and working, he’s a bit cautious, or rather, basically takes an opposite stance.</p>



<p>Perhaps it is because of his profession as a police officer.</p>



<p>Even if you’re still underage, you’ll inevitably come into contact with all sorts of people once you go out into society.</p>



<p>Not all people are good humans.</p>



<p>It’s probably because he knows well that there’s a good chance Kamome might get caught up in something strange without realizing it.</p>



<p>「Actually, it’s Himawari’s birthday soon. So, I’d like to give her my first present, and I want to save up the money for that. More importantly, I’m not up to the idea of buying a present with the allowance I get from my parents.」</p>



<p>「Hmn…」</p>



<p>Kamome’s father thinks for a moment with his hand on his chin.</p>



<p>「…Is it really that bad thing to buy a present with the allowance you get from your parents?」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Eventually, he asked that question.</p>



<p>「The reason I give you an allowance every month is not just because I think you need money because you’re a high school student. Kamome, you’re living healthy and well every day. Your grades aren’t bad, you’re not delinquent, you live a life with a serious attitude, and your reputation in the neighborhood is good. You’ve built friendships and a romantic relationship that you can be proud of.」</p>



<p>Kamome’s father states seriously with a very serious expression on his face.</p>



<p>「Think of the allowance I give you as a sort of salary, a compensation for you living a decent life. It’s no different from the money you earn from working, so there shouldn’t be anything wrong with it.」</p>



<p>「Dad…」</p>



<p>He hadn’t realized his father felt that way.</p>



<p>Kamome is a little touched.</p>



<p>「Thanks, dad… But…」</p>



<p>However, there, Kamome clearly says.</p>



<p>「After all, I feel it’s pathetic for a man to buy a present with the allowance he got from his parents! It’s simply shameful!」</p>



<p>「I see, well, that’s certainly true.」</p>



<p>It seems that Kamome’s honest and heartfelt voice seemed to resonate with his father.</p>



<p>「After all, I want to buy a present with money I’ve earned myself. That’s what I want to do.」</p>



<p>Kamome says with firm determination.</p>



<p>In front of his straight and unyielding attitude, his father “Fue” let out a sigh.</p>



<p>「Whether you’re serious or stubborn… You’re still in your first year of high school, so I think you should be more lenient. Really, I wonder who you take after.」</p>


<p>「I don’t think it’s you, dad. Probably mom, I guess.」</p>



<p>「Don’t be so blunt.」</p>



<p>“Well, but that’s probably right～…” with that, Kamome’s father made a loose face, as if looking far away ── no, as if immersing himself in happy memories.</p>



<p>His virile countenance is ruined.</p>



<p>「You mom was a very straight and honest person. Even in the middle of a date, if she found a pregnant woman who went into labor, she would call an ambulance and accompany her, trying her best.」</p>



<p>「Dad, you’d immediately start reminiscing about mom.」</p>



<p>Even now, his father still seems to be head over heels in love with his mother.</p>



<p>For Kamome, that’s not a bad thing at all…</p>



<p>「By the way, Kamome, for reference, the first present I ever gave your mother was a set of 10 free tickets to a luxury hotel buffet.」</p>



<p>「I see, Himawari is a small eater, so I don’t think it’s much of a reference, but thanks.」</p>



<p>Anyway, he got permission from his father to work part-time.</p>



<p>He will need his sign on the parental consent form for the school, which he’ll get once he has decided on a specific part-time job.</p>



<p>「Well then.」</p>



<p>Leaving aside his father, who is still talking about his love story with his mother, Kamome immediately changes into his shoes at the entrance to go looking for a part-time job.</p>



<p>Just then, from the back of the house, there is the sound of something running towards him──</p>



<p>「Ah, Barry.」</p>



<p>What came was a large dog whose whole body was covered in white fur.</p>


<p>He’s Barry, the Samoyed that Kamome keeps at home.</p>



<p>Perhaps he thought he was going for a walk.</p>



<p>Kamome soothes Barry, who energetically sticks to him, saying, “No, we went for a walk this morning.”</p>



<p>Barry has a spoiled personality that doesn’t match his big body.</p>



<p>「I’m going to look for a part-time job now. Dad gave me permission.」</p>



<p>Kamome then asks Barry, stroking his face.</p>



<p>「…Hey Barry, what would be a good present for a girl?」</p>



<p>But of course, such a question was like a breeze to Barry, who only licked Kamome’s face, begging to play.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this and that, Kamome, who had received permission to start working part-time, immediately began looking for a job.</p>



<p>There aren’t many days left until Himawari’s birthday.</p>



<p>However, there was no need to worry about finding a good job in such a short time.</p>



<p>That’s because he was promptly introduced to a sports store where an acquaintance works.</p>



<p>「I look forward to be working with you!」</p>



<p>In a sporting goods store with a sign that reads “Kedogawa Sports”.</p>



<p>Kamome greets the afro-haired man standing in front of him with energy.</p>



<p>He is Kedogawa-san, the owner of this store.</p>



<p>「Amane-chan introduced you and I wondered what kind of kind you were, but you’re very energetic You said you’re starting today?」</p>



<p>「Yes!」</p>



<p>「That’s good. I’ll have you work hard.」</p>



<p>Manager Kedogawa seems to have taken a liking to Kamome.</p>



<p>「Well, it’s a short-term job, but I’m looking forward to working with you. Oii, Amane-chan, teach Ooshima-kun how to do his job.」</p>



<p>「Okay.」</p>



<p>Called by manager Kedogawa, a female clerk wearing an apron came over.</p>



<p>A woman with a sister-like aura, wearing glasses and with her hair tied in a bundle behind her back.</p>



<p>Her name is Katsumata Amane.</p>



<p>Although she doesn’t go to the same high school, she was Kamome’s senpai during junior high school.</p>



<p>「I was surprised when you suddenly asked me to introduce you to a part-time job. If I remember correctly, you started working to buy a birthday present for your girlfriend, right?」</p>



<p>Amane places her hand on Kamome’s shoulder with a grin on her face.</p>



<p>「I never thought that the simple-minded Ooshima-kun would be able to have a girlfriend. Time flies so fast, doesn’t it?」</p>



<p>「Thank you, Katsumata-senpai, did you get the boyfriend you’ve always wanted?」</p>



<p>「You don’t have to ask me that.」</p>



<p>Kamome gets punched in the side by Amane.</p>



<p>Apparently, she still hasn’t managed to get a boyfriend.</p>



<p>「That being said, your shift is almost every day. Well, I suppose it’s natural since it’s short term.」</p>



<p>Amane looks at the shift schedule in her hand and expresses surprise.</p>



<p>「You’ve leaving your girlfriend alone, is that okay?」</p>



<p>「It’s fine. It’s not like we have to be together all the time. Besides, Himawari has her own plans just like I have mine.」</p>



<p>That’s right.</p>



<p>Unlike Kamome, Himawari is a member of a club.</p>



<p>Technically, it’s a literary club, so it’s a club activity.</p>


<p>「Heeh, she’s a literary girl, that girlfriend of yours, Himawari-chan.」</p>



<p>「Yes, but from what I’ve heard from Himawari, that Literature Club is actually “a club for learning and enjoying diverse cultures and a wide range of academic fields’”, they seem to play games and engage in outdoor activities, which is not what I thought it would be.」</p>



<p>「…It’s just a group of people who have spare time after school and just hang out.」</p>



<p>「But apparently according to Himawari, she and the president get along well, and the two of them seems serious about writing novels and doing literary activities.」</p>



<p>「Heeh.」</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>Like that, Kamome spent his days working hard at his part-time job.</p>



<p>The purpose was to get a birthday present for Himawari, so he kept the fact that he had started a part-time job a secret from her.</p>



<p>Because it’s a surprise.</p>



<p>However, if he spent every day like that, it was only a matter of time before Himawari found out.</p>



<p>「By the way, Kamome-kun, have you been busy lately?」</p>



<p>One day after school.</p>



<p>The two were going home together today, because both his part-time job and her club activities were off.</p>



<p>In the middle of that, Himawari asked Kamome</p>



<p>「Ah… Yeah, because I started a part-time job.」</p>



<p>「Eh, really?」</p>



<p>Himawari was surprised.</p>


<p>And right after that, her face turned worried.</p>



<p>「You seem to be working almost every day… Is there something you want?」</p>



<p>「No, it’s not like that… The place I work at is a sporting goods store called Kedogawa Sports, introduced by one of my seniors from middle school…」</p>



<p>As Himawari asked with concern, Kamome tried to maintain his calm and carry on the conversation normally, while thinking about how to dodge the question.</p>



<p>But he can’t come up with a good excuse.</p>



<p>「I mean… There’s no need to worry. Or rather, it’s for Himawari…」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>In his hesitation, he let his mouth slip.</p>



<p>At Himawari, who has a blank expression on her face after hearing these words, Kamome continued his words with a stutter.</p>



<p>「I mean… It’s your birthday soon, right?」</p>



<p>Upon hearing that, Himawari must have guessed the reason why Kamome started working part-time.</p>



<p>Her face flushes and she looks down.</p>



<p>「E-Eh… R-Really?」</p>



<p>It seems he has been found out.</p>



<p>But it can’t be helped if it was already conveyed.</p>



<p>「…I’m sorry, if I were better at dodging the question, I might have surprised you that day.」</p>



<p>「N-Noo! That’s not it at all! I’m, so happy, right now!」</p>


<p>With a change in her tone with high tension., Himawari said so.</p>



<p>Seeing her like that, Kamome also felt a sense of satisfaction.</p>



<p>I’m glad.</p>



<p>What I was doing was not wrong, he thought.</p>



<p>「Himawari. That’s why, I want you to look forward to it.」</p>



<p>After conveying that, Himawari nodded and replied, “Yes, I’m looking forward to it.”</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>──That night.</p>



<p>In the Shishido household.</p>



<p>「…Uuu.」</p>



<p>In her room, Himawari is writhing on her bed.</p>



<p>She was holding her smartphone, and the screen displayed a photo taken during their date the other day.</p>



<p>Looking at it, her face softened with happiness.</p>



<p>She remembers what Kamome said in the evening.</p>



<p>She thinks that he, who had recently started a part-time job, was trying to prepare a present to celebrate her birthday.</p>



<p>The conversation was too fluffy, but it must be like that.</p>



<p>It might be her overthinking… There’s a possibility that she might be misunderstanding, and if it’s not actually like that, it would be too painful.</p>


<p>But the more she thinks about it, the more her heart beats, her head seems to boil with heat… filled with excitement.</p>



<p>She’s so happy that she is about to go crazy.</p>



<p>「Mou… Kamome-kun, you are so cool.」</p>



<p>She was flopping around on the bed, going right and left.</p>



<p>She loses her balance there and falls off the edge of the bed with a thud.</p>



<p>But Himawari was so giddy, like a drunk, she didn’t even notice that she had fallen off the bed.</p>



<p>「He even started a part-time job for me, trying to make me happy… I wonder if it’s okay for such a cool guy to be my boyfriend…」</p>



<p>「…What are you gushing about by yourself?」</p>



<p>Before she knew it, Tsuyu had opened the door to Himawari’s room and came to check on her.</p>



<p>「Hewaa!? T-T-T-T-Tsuyu!? Why!?」</p>



<p>「Well, I heard a loud noise. I wondered what happened.」</p>



<p>「N-Nothing at all…」</p>



<p>She hurriedly tried to cover it up, but Tsuyu had completely caught on the reason for that.</p>



<p>“Fuun…” Tsuyu mumbles and looks at Himawari.</p>



<p>「…Kamome, started a part-time job.」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Perhaps she had heard her soliloquy just before.</p>


<p>Himawari was surprised that Tsuyu continued the conversation about that matter.</p>



<p>At the same time, her face stiffened a little because of the topic of Kamome.</p>



<p>「Y-Yeah. It seems he got introduced to a sports store called Kedogawa Sports by one of his senpai from middle school…」</p>



<p>「Heeh…」</p>



<p>Ther, Tsuyu probably guessed why Kamome started his part-time job from Himawari’s previous comments and outburst.</p>



<p>「…I see, your birthday is coming up soon, right?」</p>



<p>Saying that, she tries to close the door.</p>



<p>「Ah, Tsuyu-san.」</p>



<p>Just before she did, Himawari stopped Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「What?」</p>



<p>「Well… Umn…」</p>



<p>At Tsuyu’s question, Himawari was lost for words for a while and then gave a poor response, “I-It’s nothing after all.”</p>



<p>「…What? Were you told to pry into my affairs by those people again?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu said, sounding a bit annoyed.</p>



<p>Himawari has been asked by his father and mother-in-law to find out about Tsuyu’s recent situation.</p>



<p>Tsuyu doesn’t talk much about herself to her family.</p>



<p>So, if there is an opportunity to talk to her, she was asked to subtly probe into her friendships and see if she was involved in anything strange.</p>


<p>「I-It’s not like that…」</p>



<p>「I’m not doing anything strange or dangerous. They worried too much.」</p>



<p>「It’s not about that…」</p>



<p>What Himawari wants to ask the most, is not about that.</p>



<p>She presses her clasped hands tightly against her chest.</p>



<p>As if to hold down her heartbeat that jumps up with nervousness.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu-san… How do you feel about Kamome-kun?」</p>



<p>At that question, Himawari knew Tsuyu turned back to her.</p>



<p>However, Himawari was looking down and couldn’t directly see her expression.</p>



<p>The other day, Kamome said that Tsuyu had followed him around at the amusement park and suddenly kissed him.</p>



<p>After returning home from the date, she thought about asking Tsuyu about it, but Himawari always finds it difficult to interact with Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Even though they have the most opportunities to talk among family members, they only have the bare minimum of casual conversation.</p>



<p>Therefore, was unable to discuss the matter with Kamome in great detail, and due to her natural timid nature, she tried not to think too deeply about it.</p>



<p>However, no matter how she thought about it, that behavior itself was strange.</p>



<p>Perhaps, from the beginning.</p>



<p>When she invited Kamome to this house and Tsuyu met him…</p>



<p>At that time, when she went to Tsuyu’s room, Kamome and Tsuyu were facing each other at a close distance…</p>


<p>How do they feel about each other?</p>



<p>Are they really just childhood friends who have just reunited after several years?</p>



<p>If they harbor feelings that aren’t just that…</p>



<p>「I don’t feel… anything about him.」</p>



<p>After a short silence, Tsuyu said so.</p>



<p>「Himawari… Don’t tell me you’re thinking I’m interested in Kamome?」</p>



<p>「T-That’s…」</p>



<p>「No way, that can’t be. The other day, I just teased him because I was bored, and it was half in fun. I won’t do it again, so don’t worry.」</p>



<p>After saying that bluntly, and closing the door this time, Tsuyu went back to her room next door.</p>



<p>「Ah…」</p>



<p>Tsuyu left before she could stop her.</p>



<p>The inflection of her words was no different than usual.</p>



<p>Then, is it true…? Should she believe her?</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>She was curious about the relationship between Kamome and Tsuyu, and about the truth.</p>



<p>In proportion to her strong feelings for Kamome. Something prickly began to form in Himawari’s heart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>「By the way, Ooshima-kun, why did you quit track and field?」</p>



<p>One day.</p>



<p>Today as well, Kamome is working hard at his part-time job at Kedogawa Sports.</p>



<p>As he was bringing stock of sports shoes from the back to arrange them in the sales area, Amane, who was cleaning the shelves, asked him a question.</p>



<p>「Doesn’t your current high school have a track and field club?」</p>



<p>「No, there is.」</p>



<p>Kamome was on the track and field club team until middle school, but he has already quit.</p>



<p>「You did pretty good, didn’t you? What a waste. Maybe you got bored? Or was it because you wanted to spend more time with your girlfriend?」</p>



<p>「No, it’s not like that…」</p>



<p>There, a shadow fell across Kamome’s expression.</p>



<p>「…Originally, the reason I started track and field was because there was someone I admired who was also doing track and field.」</p>



<p>And then, he then began to talk about his reasons for leaving track and field.</p>



<p>「That person was a famous athlete who was even featured in newspapers. I started track and field myself by secretly following and aiming to be like that person. But at some point, I stopped hearing about or hearing rumors about that person…」</p>



<p>Proportionately, he realized that his passion, or rather his feelings, for track and field had cooled down.</p>



<p>「That’s when I realized. The reason why I was so passionate about track and field was because I wanted to meet that person. Since that person was also doing track and field, I thought that as long as I kept going, we would meet somewhere. I thought that when we met at some competition, I would be able to show my growth. I thought that reason was impure and that I wasn’t sincere about track and field, so I quit when I entered high school.」</p>

<p>「Fuuun, I wonder if you’re sincere or an idiot.」</p>



<p>He was given an honest impression from Amane, who listened to his story.</p>



<p>「So, Katsumata-senpai, why did you quit track and field?」</p>



<p>「Because I wasn’t popular. I had to practice every day, it made me sweat, and it left me with no time to make a boyfriend.」</p>



<p>「Why didn’t you go out with someone who also was in track and field?」</p>



<p>「I thought so, and as a result of devoting myself to it for three years in middle school, I couldn’t date anyone, though?」</p>



<p>「I see, don’t worry.」</p>



<p>「Don’t encourage me with a bright face.」</p>



<p>He ended up getting punched in the ribs.</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>──Night.</p>



<p>「Thank you for your hard work!」</p>



<p>Kamome had finished his part-time job for the day and it was time for him to clock out.</p>



<p>He prepared to leave and went out the back door.</p>



<p>Then…</p>



<p>「…Hmn?」</p>



<p>He could see someone standing leaning against the wall of the alley behind the store.</p>


<p>As if they were waiting for someone.</p>



<p>As he got closer, he realized who it was.</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu?」</p>



<p>She was wearing a black hoodie over a tube top and light-colored damaged denim underneath.</p>



<p>She was holding a handbag in her hand, which appeared to contain a small box.</p>



<p>The figure of a such woman, Tsuyu, was there.</p>



<p>On the other hand, she also noticed that Kamome had come out.</p>



<p>「Why are you here, Tsuyu…」</p>



<p>「Himawari told me you were working at a store called Kedogawa Sports… And when I actually came to see, I saw you really working there…」</p>



<p>She mumbles hesitantly, avoiding his gaze.</p>


<div><img src="https://sinkuredtranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/knav1ilus5.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div><p></p>


<p>“I see, you heard it from Himawari…”, Kamome was almost convinced for a moment, but then became suspicious again.</p>



<p>「You knew I was working here… Why were you waiting for me to come out?」</p>



<p>Until today, Kamome has been in constant fights with her.</p>



<p>From his anxiety and tangled emotions, his imagination took a negative turn.</p>



<p>Tsuyu must also hold a grudge against Kamome…</p>



<p>「Don’t tell me, you’re trying to lure me again to take a strange picture, and complain to the store or something like that?」</p>


<p>In a blunt manner, he said such rude things.</p>



<p>「Ha-haa!?」</p>



<p>At Kamome’s words, Tsuyu became emotional.</p>



<p>「I don’t have those intentions at all! I just…」</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s voice becomes quieter.</p>



<p>「…I just wanted to apologize.」</p>



<p>With a fading voice, she said that at last.</p>



<p>However, Kamome now can’t quite believe those words.</p>



<p>「Really? If that was the case, you should have just come inside the store and apologized when you found me.」</p>



<p>「That’s…」</p>



<p>「I can’t trust Tsuyu now.」</p>



<p>When he clearly told her how he feels now, Tsuyu’s expression turned sad as if she was hurt.</p>



<p>And immediately after.</p>



<p>「I’m done!」</p>



<p>In a fit of rage, she threw the handbag she was holding at Kamome.</p>



<p>The box inside hit Kamome’s body.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu!」</p>

<p>He called out to her, but Tsuyu was no longer in front of him.</p>



<p>「…What the hell was that?」</p>



<p>He picks up the bag that had fallen at his feet.</p>



<p>And wonders what this is.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a sweet smell waft up.</p>



<p>When he took out the box inside as if he couldn’t believe it, there was a crushed cake inside.</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu.」</p>



<p>Seeing this, Kamome was shaken.</p>



<p>Did she really come to apologize?</p>



<p>「…No way.」</p>



<p>If so, he has done something really terrible.</p>



<p>He hurt her with his preconceptions.</p>



<p>The sense of guilt that sprouted spread through his heart in an instant.</p>



<p>Ashamed of himself, Kamome rushed out of the place.</p>



<p>However, when he looked around the main street, Tsuyu figure was nowhere to be seen.</p>
