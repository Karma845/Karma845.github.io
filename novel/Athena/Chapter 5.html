<h2>Chapter 5: Aya’s Gratitude</h2>

<p class="calibre2">“So, this is the current fashion trend, huh…? I wonder if this would suit Yuu.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Today, as usual, Haruto is working at the book cafe and he is currently on his 7 PM break.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While muttering to himself and flipping through women’s magazines, Haruto uses his smartphone to research on the latest fashion trends.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Of course, there’s a reason for this. It’s to bring up topics like, “I found this outfit, what do you think? Want to go look for clothes together next time?” with his sister.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even though Yuno works part-time twice a week, she allocates all her earnings into her savings account.</p>



<p class="calibre2">No matter what Haruto says, she only buys the bare essentials and hesitates to indulge in fashion, despite being interested in it.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’d be happy she could indulge in it for a bit… I’ll figure out the money situation somehow.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The older brother’s true desire is for his sister to live a comfortable life, so he occasionally becomes pushy.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, this one looks really good!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As he imagines Yuno wearing the outfit, his expression unconsciously softens.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While he was being immersed in his own world, 10 minutes or 20 minutes quickly past.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmmmmm. Are you interested in this black dress?” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">A voice comes from the side.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m thinking about this one too, but it shows a bit too much skin… I know it’s almost summer, so it can’t be helped.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, could it be for your girlfriend?” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I don’t have a girlfriend. I just thought I’d like to buy it for my sister.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I see! I see! As usual, you’re the same as ever, Oni-chan. Hehe~” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Huh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">After being called ‘Oni-chan’, he finally notices the situation he is in.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Blinking rapidly, he turns his head to look at the person next to him&mdash;</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Cold!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, good evening~” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Shirayuki-san!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was Aya, with a grin on her face, pressing a chilled matcha latte against his neck. It was the first time she had done something like this.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, you seem to be in a good mood?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah! I got some good information, so I’m in a great mood! I’m glad I came today!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, really…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Is Haruto-san on break now?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, for about 15 more minutes. Oh, sorry for not noticing you earlier. Please, have a seat.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Is that really okay? Won’t I be getting in the way of your break?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, quite the opposite. I was actually hoping for some company since I was bored.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Then, I’ll take you up on that offer!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Please, go ahead.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a cheerful shout, Aya sits down next to him, placing the matcha latte on the table and settling down while facing him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, it’s rare for Shirayuki-san to come on a weekend. You usually visit after your classes on weekdays, right?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I just wanted to see Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“R-Really?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Dangerous. He almost gets fooled by her sincere tone. If he had taken it seriously, he would have been teased.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, you see, since I finished my work earlier than usual, I decided to treat myself. Although, I might still have some editing work to do later.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, I see. Did you enjoy your work?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course! It was fun, but it’s more tiring than usual. After all, the comments today were different from the norm .” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh? You mean there were more negative comments?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Not really, but for some reason, most of the comments were talking about the same person. Dealing with that was quite a challenge.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“T-That’s, could it be…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even though the way she phrased it was vague, he has his suspicions.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He wishes he was wrong. As he tilts his head, hoping that he was mistaken, more details are revealed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Someone named ‘Oni-something’ was praising me.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“He also said some pretty harsh things.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, no… That’s…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“He also mentioned something about using me as a stepping stone.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, haha… Is that so…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s how it is~” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even though she phrases it in a way that avoids directly revealing the person’s identity, her expression screams, “Oi, you! I’m talking about you!”</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It seems that that person also got spanked by his sister with a shoe.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hu-huh… They must have done something really bad for that to happen…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s all information one wouldn’t know unless they watched his stream yesterday. And clearly, Aya knows about yesterday’s stream.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I never thought Ayaya-san would watch my channel… Wait, could it be that a viewer snitched on me…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Looking back, he left a lot of negative comments about her during the stream.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Saying that Ayaya, a popular streamer with over 300,000 subscribers, has no cute qualities, or claiming that nothing about her is likable will certainly not sit well with some viewers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In hindsight, he feels there could have been a better way to express his thoughts.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, in my defense, those weren’t my true feelings. Especially the part about the insults… Shirayuki-san probably understands, but it would be bad if the viewers speculate that I see you as a member of the opposite sex.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You say that, but what if it that was actually your true feelings?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No no, absolutely not!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, you’re kinda cute when you’re flustered.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…S-Stop messing with me.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She smirks as she narrows her eyes, holding a straw in her mouth.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He only just realized that he was being teased.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way… did you watch the actual stream? Or did someone tell you about it?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She scratches her cheek, avoiding eye contact.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I received intel from my fans, so I did my own research afterwards.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, I see. I’m sorry for causing any trouble. I’ll try to keep myself in check next time.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry about it. If anything, I’d like you to talk about us more. Thanks to Haruto-san, I had double the number of viewers today.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Twice the usual? So, around 10,000 people?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehehe~ That’s right! I never thought I’d surpass my goal like this.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a triumphant smile, she shifts to a softer expression.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ayaya usually gathers around 10,000 viewers during collaborations or tournaments. Judging from her tone, it seems that she had set a specific goal in mind for solo streams.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, no, it’s not because of me. Being able to retain 10,000 viewers is a testament to Shirayuki-san’s skill. You should be more proud of yourself.”&nbsp;(Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha, Haruto-san is really kind.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m just stating the obvious. Oh, how about the haters? With more viewers, there might be more of them.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“See, you’re kind after all.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t ‘Huh’ me! Coming from the person who was stating the obvious, you should be more self-aware. You’re worried about me, aren’t you?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, it’s natural, right? We’re friends, and we share a common secret.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“……With that kind of personality, why did you choose to base your channel on being toxic? Haruto-san, now that I think about it, it really doesn’t suit you, you know?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha, my sister told me the same thing.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">When Yuuno first found out about his online persona, it was quite a tough situation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She wanted to have an “important discussion” during dinner, and with a serious expression and intense look of concern, she said, “Are you okay, onii-chan? Please tell me what happened.”</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even when he tried to explain that it was a misunderstanding, she didn’t believe him at all, and they spent over an hour discussing it.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But I’m really grateful that she understands. Since my voice sometimes echoed throughout the house, it wouldn’t be strange for her to hear that and start disliking me. Well… I don’t deny that I’m doing some questionable things to gain viewers.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, well, if your sister is on your side, then there is nothing to worry about.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, I guess so?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As the conversation comes to an end, he checks the clock and realizes there are less than three minutes left until the end of the break.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, I should get back to work soon.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Okay. Since I plan to stay until the end, want to go home together?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">To be honest, he was genuinely happy with this offer.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Not only because he enjoyed spending time together, but also because, as fellow content creators, there were things he wanted to discuss with her.</p>

<h4>◆◆◆◆</h4>


<p class="calibre2">“Good job today.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah! Good job to you too, Haruto-san!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">At 22:00, having finished the part-time job without any issues, they change into their regular clothes, exchange their usual greetings, and start walking home together.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey~ let me I’ll walk you back home today, Haruto-san!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ll pass.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Why!? I gathered up the courage to say that!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, it’s not that I don’t want to. It’s just that today is a special day for Shirayuki-san, so let me walk you home instead.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While there might be some mixed feelings about being escorted by a younger girl, the spoken sentiment was stronger.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“A special day for me?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. Didn’t you surpass the viewer goal you set for today’s stream? 10,000 viewers.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, hehe… If you put it that way, I’ll have no choice but to accept it.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She gives him the biggest smile of the day.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Alright then, I’ll be the one to walk you home.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Okay!… Whoa!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre6">*Thud*</em></p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, are you okay!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m okay, I’m okay! I just stumbled a bit.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Be careful, it’s dark outside.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah! Thanks.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She’s not only a streamer but also part of a professional gaming team. It would be bad if she got herself injured in such a way.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s the one thing she has to be careful about.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But still, you achieved quite an incredible goal.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m the one most surprised. Getting true thatI I couldn’t have done it without Oni-chan, but honestly, I never thought I could achieve the goal… for a long time.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“For a long time?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. I haven’t told anyone this, but recently, I’ve been struggling a bit lately. Both my channel subscribers and viewers have remained stagnant for a while now.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, I see. I never thought of it that way at all.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Some might argue, “As long as it’s not going down, it’s fine,” but the motivation for every content creator is always, “I want to become more famous!”</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I tried my best to hide it. It’s a bit discouraging to show it with my kind of character, you know?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I totally understand. With that kind of happy-go-lucky character, it might be awkward to show it. Besides, if someone with over 300,000 subscribers talks about such things, it might piss off other content creators. The situation doesn’t resonate with everyone, after all.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe~ As expected of you. You know exactly what I’m talking about.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“We’re working on the same field, so I can understand it to some extent.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Despite having different numbers of subscribers, they share a lot of common ground because they’re in the work in the same industry.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“This is actually why I decided to shift from just streaming to posting videos. I thought relying only on streaming would be tough, so I wanted to establish another pillar.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“In that sense, finally achieving my goal felt really rewarding.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She wasn’t a famous streamer for nothing. Despite being young, she thinks and acts carefully without becoming complacent.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I owe a lot to Oni-chan. It was only after getting involved with him that I started to grow again.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m glad that I could help.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">(I didn’t know about the stagnation issue though…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Haruto-san, do you have any troubles or anything? I’d like to repay you if there’s something I can do.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“As a matter of fact, I do.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Really!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Just as she was eager to hear more…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, umm! Sorry! It’s not that I’m happy you have troubles or anything!!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, don’t worry, I didn’t think of it like that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She frantically waves her hands, clearly in a state of panic.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…I’ve been thinking about consulting with Shirayuki-san about something for a while now. There’s hardly anyone I can talk to openly about streaming matters, so you’re the only one.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ll do my best to help you, so fire away!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thank you. That’s reassuring.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya clenches her fist, showing determination. It’s a bit embarrassing to consult with someone younger, but when it comes to this matter, there’s no one more reliable than her.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“So what I want to ask is&mdash;” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Lately, I’ve been having trouble thinking about the direction my channel should be taking…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“In other words, whether to keep that toxic persona or change to a more natural personality, right?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Exactly.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Knowing the situation makes her the perfect person to consult with. With just a brief explanation, she grasps the situation accurately.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-27" class="calibre2">“My current number of subscribers is around 180,000… The fact that my channel is close to<a href="#calibre_link-26" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"> doubling in size<sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a> ever since the incident makes me think a lot about what I should be doing in the future. Especially because the growth has been so rapid.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Are you thinking of graduating from the toxic content around your 200,000 subscribers milestone?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Something like that… Maybe. Lately, I’m not sure what kind of character my viewers want.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">What has been built up over more than a year can be caught up to in just a month. While it’s a situation that a content creator would normally be happy about, it also introduces uncertainty about the direction of the channel.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If I were in Haruto-san’s position, I’m sure I’d have the same worries. The growth is extraordinary, after all.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Ah, haha. Yeah, you’re right.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“As a third party, I can offer my perspective on things. But it’s up to you to make the decision.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With such a considerate line of words, she starts speaking in a calm and relaxed tone.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Firstly, what Oni-chan has built up so far is by no means wasted. If you hadn’t built up that toxic persona of yours, the current results wouldn’t have been possible, right?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“So, all the hard work you’ve put in so far hasn’t been wasted.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“… ” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Her words seemed to penetrate right through his heart.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Deep down, he felt uncomfortable that the various struggles he went through in the past to reach 100,000 subscribers were easily overtaken in such a short amount of time.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It went from:</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;(There’s no way I can reach 100,000 subscribers.)</p>



<p class="calibre2">To:</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;(If I can reach 200,000 subscribers this easily, what was the point of all the effort I’ve put in until now.)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, I see… I should have thought about it that way.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He understands that this was the source of his troubles. His perspective had been narrow.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was all about his own perception being misguided.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Actually, I’ve also had the same thoughts when I first started.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“R-really?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. I was working hard but my channel wasn’t growing much, and I even considered retiring. Then, I coincidentally matched up with a famous streamer and saw an unprecedented amount of growth… It made me happy, but I couldn’t help but wonder what all my previous efforts were for.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But if I think about it, without putting in all that effort, the people who watched me might not have become fans. When I started thinking that way, it became much easier to cope.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">A shy, small smile appeared on her face. It was an expression that lightened her heart.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, to get back on topic, I think you should continue with your current character as it is. If you were to change it now, you might only retain about half of the number of fans that you have since that is what they signed up for. You could end up going through a period of stagnation similar to mine. Moreover, the unique charm that only you have now might disappear, right? Teasing the viewers and being teased by them&mdash;that’s what suits you the best.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Being able to speak so accurately about someone else’s situation suggests she has thoroughly analyzed strengths, selling points, and elements that resonate with viewers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Is she really 18? It was a moment where I couldn’t find words to respond.</p>


<h4>◆◆◆◆</h4>

<p class="calibre2">“I have a lot to learn…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, I have my reasons&mdash;I want to monopolize Oni-chan’s true self as much as possible, you know?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What’s that supposed to mean?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t mind it. It’s just a personal interest of mine~” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a sly smile, she made a joke, sensing that the counseling session had ended.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With just this, the somewhat heavy atmosphere that lingered during the consultation was dispelled, and the usual cheerful mood returned.</p>



<p class="calibre2">This is probably a skill she honed as a streamer. Despite being younger, she still excels in many aspects.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Watch out. After surpassing 200,000 subscribers, my next goal is to surpass Ayaya-san!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If you can achieve that goal, I’ll grant you any one wish, whatever it may be.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s quite ambitious.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, I have no intention of losing!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, I see.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto was glad that he consulted with her on this today. And before they knew it, they reached the usual crossroads. It was at that moment…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Are you okay?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, that was close! Stumbling over a step like that, I’m so clumsy.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">For the second time today, she stumbled and almost fell. It must have been quite a scare, judging by her wide-open eyes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">And she didn’t trip over a small stone this time. She tripped over herself.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s unusual. Constantly stumbling like that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, you know!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Hm?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It doesn’t seem to be a coincidence. She averted her gaze for a split second.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Shirayuki-san, is there something you’re hiding?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This time, she even seemed to hold her breath.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, you know, is it possible that you’re sick, Shirayuki-san? I heard that repeatedly stumbling could be a sign of an illness.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m not sick at all!! It’s not an illness, it’s just…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s just…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She hesitated in her words, which was unusual for her. When pressed on, his worries turned out to be unfounded.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, you see, when I was waiting for you, I lost one of my contacts…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“C-Contact? Ah, I see. So that’s why you seemed a bit off.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah… Maybe I misplaced them? It happens occasionally.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I wonder…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya turned towards Haruto, tilting her head with a troubled expression. It was a cute gesture, but he was genuinely troubled by the question she posed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“At least it would be better if it were daytime right now…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, I can see with one eye, so it’s okay!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Even though you’ve already stumbled twice?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“T-That was an accident!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The reliability she showed earlier seemed to have disappeared. It was moments like these that reflected her age appropriately.</p>



<p class="calibre2">(But I guess everyone has moments like these…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With such thoughts, those words slipped out of his mouth unintentionally.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If it’s okay with Shirayuki-san, how about we hold hands? You can just grab my wrist if you want.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Otherwise, you might stumble again, right?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uuu…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If you fall and get hurt, it might affect your streams. It’s better to be safe than sorry, right?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ugh…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Whether she understood it or not, every time she speaks, there’s a groan that seems to suggest that she agrees.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course, I won’t force you, but what do you think?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As Haruto offered his hand, Aya remained still and started fidgeting.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-61" class="calibre2"><a href="#calibre_link-60" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Etto</em>, um, then, is it okay to… hold the hem of Haruto-san’s shirt…?” (Aya)</a></p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course, it’s okay, but your tone has become more polite than usual. Is there something wrong?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well, you know, I haven’t done something like this since elementary school…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, really…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As if to prove her words through actions, Aya timidly grabbed the hem of his shirt with trembling fingers, seemingly looking down to pay attention to her steps.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Perhaps due to the height difference or maybe because of nervousness, she appeared like a lost child being guided back home.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What!? Surely that’s a lie, right? Since elementary school?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I wouldn’t make up such embarrassing lies… If I can get used to it, I don’t mind holding hands with Haruto-san…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With her cute appearance and gentle personality, there’s no way she isn’t popular. But looking at her blushing so much from just holding the hem of the shirt, there is probably some truth to her words.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“H-Haruto-san is way too used to this… I-I don’t like how I’m the only one affected by this…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m not used to it at all.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I don’t believe you.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She tightens her grip on the hem of the shirt, pulling it a bit. It seems she wants to turn the tables even just a little.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Although her strength is quite weak, you can sense her determination.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a faint smile, Haruto meets her gaze. The moment their eyes meet, the hand pulling on the shirt stops.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Shirayuki-san.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What is it…?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I just wanted to say it again, but thank you for today. Thanks for listening to my troubles.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The direction he should take for his channel was now clear, all thanks to her. He couldn’t thank her enough.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’d like to express my gratitude properly. Do you have something you’d like?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry about it. I’ve already received a lot of help from Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Do you have something you’d like?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-I told you…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uwah, you’re not going to back down now, aren’t you?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You’re absolutely right. If you can’t think of anything now, it’s fine to tell me later. Take your time.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Knowing her personality, he had anticipated this kind of response from her. Still, he wanted to make sure he could give her a thoughtful thank-you gift.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“U-Um, if it’s okay with you… I’d like to go out and have fun with Haruto-san. Is that okay?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Is that what you want the most?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, it would make me really happy.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-I see…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While holding onto the hem of his shirt, her words made his heart skip a beat. It sounded like she was suggesting a date, but she might not have thought about it that far.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haruto-san, your only free day is Saturday, right?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, but you have a stream every Saturday, right? I can rearrange my work schedule to another day.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, Saturday is fine! But I’ll have to check my schedule and contact you again!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thanks. I’ll be looking forward to that day.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Me too!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">By this point, her timidness earlier had disappeared, and her usual cheerful demeanor returned. As they continued walking, they discussed various details about the outing, such as the meeting place, time, and activities.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, this apartment building is where I live!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh? Here!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah! There’s a soundproof room on the upper floor.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She stopped in front of a beautifully designed black and white 20-story apartment building building.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“As expected of a streamer… Living in such a nice place.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I actually wanted to live in a more budget-friendly place, but finding one with soundproof rooms was difficult.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s true… It’s also important to live in a secure place to stay safe.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh! If Haruto-san lives with me, we can split the rent, and security will be even more perfect!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s a good idea. Can my sister live with us too?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course, she’s more than welcome! There are some vacant rooms available!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, in that case, I have no choice but to live here. Anyways, enough joking around, let’s head back.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, you switch gears so quickly!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even if it was a joke, she wouldn’t have said it without trust. Besides, her sharing her home address was also a sign of trust in itself.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thank you for walking me home, Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">And with that, she released the hem of the shirt she had been holding.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Also, thanks for guiding me back, I really appreciate it!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, thank you for helping me with my troubles.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You’re welcome.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a somewhat overly casual “you’re welcome,” she headed towards the entrance of the apartment building.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, let’s meet again at the cafe, Haruto-san!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, see you.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Taking the card key from her bag, she held it up to the authentication device and entered.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After the entrance closed, Aya turned around abruptly one last time and waved ‘bye!’ with a smile.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><a href="#calibre_link-61" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><em class="calibre6">“Etto, um, then, is it okay to hold onto the hem of Haruto-san’s shirt…?”</em></a></p>
