<h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 5: What Red Means to You</h2>


<p>I think it was over ten years ago.</p>
<p>“Suika, do you know what the cutest creature in this world is?”</p>
<p>After the end of practice in our home dojo, my mother suddenly asked me this question.</p>
<p>“…A cat?”</p>
<p>“Well, cats are cute, indeed. But that’s incorrect.”</p>
<p>My mother shook her head at my answer and said with an incredibly serene smile,</p>
<p>“The cutest creature in the world is a man.”</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t you think so, Suika?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so… Because their bodies are big, and they’re strong…”</p>
<p>Adult men have an imposing presence. Even boys my age, with their loud voices and high spirits, were intimidating to me, who was just about to enter or just entered elementary school.</p>
<p>“You see, Suika, men have big bodies and strong strength for a reason. Unlike us women, they don’t have demons inside their hearts.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“Since they don’t have demons inside, they need to be big and strong… otherwise, they couldn’t survive. It’s probably a handicap given by God… That’s why they are adorable.”</p>
<p>At the time, I couldn’t understand what my mother was saying at all. I couldn’t even think if that was the case.</p>
<p>“…Do I also have a demon inside me?”</p>
<p>The scary men don’t have demons, but I, a weak woman, do. I couldn’t quite digest that.</p>
<p>“Yes, you do. Because you’re a woman.”</p>
<p>My mother and I were sitting face-to-face on the dojo floor, sitting properly in seiza. My mother, looking straight at me, said,</p>
<p>“Suika, you’ll come to understand one day. That you have a demon inside you. A greedy demon that wants to protect something precious as well as consume it.”</p>
<p>My mother, with her back straight and in a beautiful posture as she spoke, suggested that even inside such a beautiful woman like her, there was a demon.</p>
<p>“The demons inside the women of the Ado family are particularly terrible… When you find something more precious than your own life, I wonder what you will do.”</p>
<p>◆◇◆</p>
<p>It was all a mystery.</p>
<p>For some reason, the meeting place was a park downtown, and to begin with, the fact that person called me was incomprehensible.</p>
<p>But… it was something I couldn’t just ignore.</p>
<p>“There’s something I need to talk to you about regarding Miyashiro-kun.”</p>
<p>Given that statement, I had no choice but to go.</p>
<p>“…Okay, this is it.”</p>
<p>I arrived at the specified park. For the record, I ran here from my house, which took about fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Entering the park and looking around, I saw several children playing energetically on the lawn under the blazing sun and…</p>
<p>A familiar person was sitting alone on a bench in the shade of a tree.</p>
<p>As she noticed me, she came out of the shade and approached.</p>
<p>“Hello, Ado-san.”</p>
<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting, Kujo-senpai. May I ask what you need from me straight away?”</p>
<p>As I asked with a smile, she—Kujo-senpai also smiled thinly. Her beautiful posture sent shivers down my spine. She didn’t seem human.</p>
<p>“Sure, quick to the point. Do you recognize this?”</p>
<p>“Eh, …that”</p>
<p>Seeing what was in her hand, my eyes widened.</p>
<p>It was Kuuya’s smartphone. The case on it was one we had picked out together. There was no mistaking it.</p>
<p>“It was lying near the roadside… Look, where the vending machine is. Around that area.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>Ah, so that’s why she called me. To have me deliver it to Kuuya’s house.</p>
<p>─I didn’t say that, though. Because there were two things I wanted to ask first.</p>
<p>“How did you know my phone number, Senpai?”</p>
<p>“That must be the same answer to the next question you’ll ask me.”</p>
<p>Her response was odd, but I went along with it and asked another question.</p>
<p>“Did you just happen to find Kuuya’s smartphone?”</p>
<p>“I’m a bit of an oddball, you see.”</p>
<p>Straightforwardly, she said. As if stating something obvious.</p>
<p>“There’s a bit of a risk for me in telling this story. So, let me confirm something on my end first.”</p>
<p>“…What is it?”</p>
<p>“Do you know what Miyashiro-kun was doing today? Did he have any plans to go out somewhere that you heard about? Is there any way to contact him now?”</p>
<p>She fired off a series of focused questions. Somehow, I thought, ah, she seems like a science person.</p>
<p>Of course, most of my mind wasn’t occupied with such trivial thoughts.</p>
<p>“…I didn’t hear about any plans for today. Nor about any plans to go out… If”</p>
<p>As I spoke the following words, I felt disgusted with myself.</p>
<p>“If he had plans to go far, he almost always tells me.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm, I see. So at least we can rule out a planned outing.”</p>
<p>“If Kuuya is not reachable now… I’ll try calling his home.”</p>
<p>Without his smartphone, the next option was the home phone.</p>
<p>The call rang several times but eventually switched to the answering machine. Kuuya usually answers the phone if he’s at home.</p>
<p>“He’s not answering, …Hmm… So, it seems…”</p>
<p>“Um, could we have a more detailed conversation, please?”</p>
<p>From my perspective, Kuuya might have just dropped his smartphone while out on a short errand nearby—the expected situation.</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea? …Though I hate to think about it, something serious might be happening.”</p>
<p>“Yes. …Well, yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>This was the best course of action.</p>
<p>Kujo-senpai muttered quietly, then said,</p>
<p>“I’m a stalker of Miyashiro-kun.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Oh, but I’m not the type who physically follows him around. The goal of a stalker is to gather information, right? So, I track him electronically, not physically.”</p>
<p>“…What? I mean, wait, um”</p>
<p>I couldn’t catch up. …What?</p>
<p>“I’ll disclose the detailed methods, but I’ve been extracting various information from his smartphone and smartwatch daily. GPS data from his smartphone is one of those. That’s how I knew his smartphone was dropped here.”</p>
<p>“…What…”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, his smartwatch isn’t a cellular model that’s always connected to the net, so now that he’s dropped his smartphone, I can’t extract GPS or other data… Ah, right, and the data I got from his smartwatch around noon today is crucial.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Though my brain still hadn’t caught up with the situation, I understood this was something I needed to hear.</p>
<p>“The heart rate data from the smartwatch can give us some idea about the state of the autonomic nervous system. Roughly speaking, it can tell us the “Stress Value.”</p>
<p>“The value was incredibly high around noon. And then, according to the location data, he left his house and walked into the city… probably on foot, based on the speed… and likely dropped his smartphone along the way. That’s all I can tell from the data I have.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>If.</p>
<p>If I were to take everything she said at face value, it could indeed indicate that something might have happened.</p>
<p>“…So”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s why I called you. I thought you might know something. …Ah, you understand why I knew your phone number without me having to explain, right?”</p>
<p>If she’s extracting data from Kuuya’s smartphone, getting my number, which would be in his contact list, would be trivial.</p>
<p>“I believe something not so peaceful might be happening.”</p>
<p>“…If something not so peaceful is happening, it’s already happening right in front of me. Because there’s a woman here claiming to be Kuuya’s stalker.”</p>
<p>“That’s true too.”</p>
<p>…What should I do?</p>
<p>Kuuya comes first. Thinking of him, what should I do now─</p>
<p>“Ah, but you know, Ado-san. If there’s really nothing you can do right now, that’s fine too.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“Sorry for suddenly bringing this up. It’s inevitable, isn’t it? Not everyone can immediately provide useful information in situations like this.”</p>
<p>Kujo-senpai said with full confidence.</p>
<p>“Or rather, there’s no one who can provide information I don’t already know.”</p>
<p>I don’t have eyes like Kuuya’s. But something so obvious, there’s no way I could mistake it.</p>
<p>“If it’s about him…”</p>
<p>Kujo-senpai clearly stated, with the face of a woman talking about her own belonging.</p>


<p>“I’m the one who knows the most about him in the world.”</p>
<p>“How long was the smartphone lying on the roadside?”</p>
<p>“About two and a half hours ago, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“A person’s walking speed is about four kilometers per hour; Kuuya is a bit slower. Even if he started running at some point, considering his stamina, he couldn’t have kept it up for long. Subtracting that, and assuming he didn’t use any form of transportation, Kuuya should be within a ten-kilometer radius from here.”</p>
<p>“I agree. Here, take a look.”</p>
<p>Kujo-senpai took a tablet out of her bag and showed it to me. A map was displayed on it, with a circle drawn around our current location.</p>
<p>It was a ten-kilometer radius circle. This person had made the same estimate as I had.</p>
<p>“The problem is whether he took some form of transportation… There are no stations within this range, so it must be a bus or taxi. If Miyashiro-kun took one of those,”</p>
<p>“Taking a taxi is 100% impossible.”</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>Asked in return, the answer was simple.</p>
<p>“Because I wouldn’t know about it.”</p>
<p>“If Kuuya had taken a taxi, especially if something about his condition seemed odd, there wouldn’t be a single driver in this town who wouldn’t contact me.”</p>
<p>“…What are you saying?”</p>
<p>“Regarding the buses, the stops within this range are these and these and these… Within the last two and a half hours?”</p>
<p>Considering the harsh temperatures and sunlight of this season, especially around the hot midday, many people would opt for buses to avoid walking.</p>
<p>If Kuuya was among them…</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>My phone rang. The caller was a familiar woman who runs a bakery with her husband in the shopping district.</p>
<p>“Hello, Suika speaking!”</p>
<p>“Suika-chan, long time no see~! Thanks for coming to the store the other day~”</p>
<p>“No, no, your new creation was delicious!”</p>
<p>“Right~! It’s my masterpiece, after all~! But sorry, let’s put that aside.”</p>
<p>The change in topic made me instantly grasp why the woman had contacted me. Because it was as I expected.</p>
<p>The timing of this call was too perfect to be mere coincidence.</p>
<p>“You see, just before noon today… around eleven, I guess, I took the bus, from Fujimi to Toka Mori. Then, I saw Kuuya-kun on the bus. It’s rare for him to use this route, so when I happened to catch his face, he looked really pale…”</p>
<p>“Whaaat…!”</p>
<p>“I wondered what happened… I thought maybe he was going to the hospital, but he got off at Rinkouzura, and there aren’t any hospitals around there… So I was wondering what happened. That’s why I thought I should at least let you know.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, I’ve been unable to contact Kuuya right now… It seems like Kuuya left his smartphone at home…”</p>
<p>Considering the situation was not yet confirmed, it wouldn’t be right to unnecessarily escalate things. Kuuya might end up troubled later.</p>
<p>Even though I knew it was wrong, I made a seemingly plausible conjecture.</p>
<p>“Ah! I understand, maybe he’s panicking, thinking he dropped his smartphone, and is searching for it.”</p>
<p>“Ah~, I see! So that’s it! But then he might still be looking for it now… It’s so hot outside, I’m worried.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go to the bus stop where Kuuya got off and hand it to him! Thank you very much!”</p>
<p>“No problem, see you~. Come to the store with him again~”</p>
<p>“Yes!” I replied as I hung up the phone and touched Kujo-senpai’s tablet.</p>
<p>“About an hour ago, Kuuya got off at a bus stop called Rinkouzura. That area doesn’t have stations or other bus stops nearby, so Kuuya’s current location is expected to be within a four-kilometer radius from there.”</p>
<p>“…Hey, your character was like how you were on the phone just now, right? But now you are… No, never mind that. Ado-san, you are,”</p>
<p>“In this town, the Ado family is somewhat well-known.”</p>
<p>I interupted before Kujo-senpai could continue.</p>
<p>“I’ve been making friends with many people since I was young, using that to my advantage. Not just in the town, but at school too. I made sure people remembered my face, made friends with them… and let them know what’s important to me.”</p>
<p>Conveniently, though I certainly wouldn’t say it’s a good thing, the fact that he was physically weak also worked positively in this situation.</p>
<p>No, saying it’s a coincidence would be wrong.</p>
<p>I utilized the fact that there are people who think, “He’s physically weak, so I’m worried about him.”</p>
<p>“I won’t say it’s as much as a mountain, but I receive a considerable number of contacts every day. Mixed in with various small talks, naturally, there are messages like, ‘By the way, I saw Kuuya-kun around this place at this time.'”</p>
<p>This is the first time I’m revealing this to someone else. But now, it’s necessary.</p>
<p>“It’s not just sightings. Rumors and various stories also reach me.”</p>
<p>I stated that clearly.</p>
<p>“As long as Kuuya is in a place where people can see him, he’s under my surveillance.”</p>
<p>By the hands of the townspeople, none of whom think they’re actually keeping watch.</p>
<p>“…You”</p>
<p>“I’ve intentionally created this situation, of course… To keep track of as much about Kuuya as possible, for that reason.”</p>
<p>A battle of oddballs, I wonder who comes out on top.</p>
<p>Kujo-senpai didn’t respond to my words but instead asked a question.</p>
<p>“…I want to ask. Hey, you once brought up a discussion during the sports festival committee meeting about changing the mixed-gender setup to separate genders, right? What about that?”</p>
<p>“Putting aside how you, who weren’t supposed to be there, know about its outcome… I heard from several sources that there were girls who liked Kuuya.”</p>
<p>“When you entered the library while I was studying there with Miyashiro-kun, what was that about?”</p>
<p>“It couldn’t possibly be a coincidence, could it?”</p>
<p>I had been checking on this person since around April. Despite being rumored to dislike people, she seemed to talk only with Kuuya, who sat next to her.</p>
<p>“A library committee member contacted me saying, ‘She’s unusually in the library… and she’s with a pretty senpai.'”</p>
<p>The people who contact me don’t necessarily think I’m dating Kuuya, but at the very least, they recognize that I have special feelings for him.</p>
<p>Kujo-senpai sighed deeply.</p>
<p>“I regret this. It’s highly regrettable… Women’s intuition is right, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“What kind of guess?”</p>
<p>“That you and I are similar.”</p>
<p>Kujo-senpai muttered and sighed again. To her, I said,</p>
<p>“What you’re doing is very wrong. It’s a crime, and having someone like you sitting next to Kuuya is truly the worst.”</p>
<p>“You’re blunt.”</p>
<p>“Yes. But I’m equally, if not more, terrible. I’m not decent, not pretty. I’m scum, using people’s kindness for surveillance and manipulation behind the scenes.”</p>
<p>I extended my right hand to the person in front of me.</p>
<p>“Scum should work together for now. Let’s use each other effectively.”</p>
<p>“I intended that from the start. I’m the one who called you out, after all.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but please correct one thing.”</p>
<p>Holding her hand, I looked straight into her eyes, smiling as I said,</p>
<p>“When it comes to knowing the most about Kuuya in the world, that would be me.”</p>
<p>“Ah?”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/00020.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>A gaze filled with hostility and malice flew towards me, and I immediately returned the same.</p>
<p>Under the bright sunshine, in a peaceful park, two good-for-nothing women were glaring at each other.</p>
<p>…The children who had been playing looked at us with frightened eyes. I’m sorry, we’ll move soon…</p>
<p>For now, the two of us headed to a nearby bus stop. The bus from here stops at the place where Kuuya got off.</p>
<p>“There’s something very important I haven’t asked you yet.”</p>
<p>Kujo-senpai posed that question to me.</p>
<p>“In the end, you do love Miyashiro-kun, don’t you?”</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Ah, right. Except for my family, this is the first time I’m clearly putting it into words.</p>
<p>“I love him, more than anyone else.”</p>
<p>The summer’s heat was pouring down from above. Along with the piercing heat and pain, the sensation of voicing those words felt etched into me.</p>
<p>“…So. Well, I’m still superior.”</p>
<p>“What? In terms of years and seasons, we’re different.”</p>
<p>“All those years, and you’re still just friends in the end? Is that something to be proud of?”</p>
<p>“Coming from someone who can’t even be friends, even just sitting next to him, I can’t say much.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>While waiting for the bus, our conversation was somewhere between assessing the situation and provoking each other.</p>
<p>“…By the way, Miyashiro-kun can predict how other feels, right? Considering you’re always together, he must be completely aware of how you feel, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s impossible. Kuuya sees me only as a very caring childhood friend… Otherwise, we couldn’t have stayed so close, for so long.”</p>
<p>“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Anyway, what you’re doing is strange, isn’t it? Despite being so obsessed with Miyashiro-kun, you never try to move beyond the childhood friend position… Honestly, at first, I thought you two were dating.”</p>
<p>With a calm tone, never looking directly at me, Kujo-senpai continued.</p>
<p>“You seemed perfect for each other, from any perspective. It was clear you understood each other. That’s why I don’t understand your risk management. If you have such a relationship, it seems to me the realistic risk to be wary of is not being rejected, but being stolen by another girl while you’re dawdling.”</p>
<p>I hesitated whether I should explain the situation to this person. Kuuya’s past isn’t something I should discuss with others based on my own judgment.</p>
<p>But the current situation might indeed be connected to that story… The slightly stiff expression on Kuuya’s face yesterday flickered in my mind, igniting a sense of urgency within me.</p>
<p>…This person next to me took the risk of her crimes being exposed to act in this manner. In that regard, I think she should be trusted, and perhaps I should disclose the information that needs to be disclosed.</p>
<p>─I’m sorry for doing this on my own.</p>
<p>While apologizing to Kuuya in my heart, I began to speak.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a bit of a long story.”</p>
<p>“The bus will take a while to come anyway.”</p>
<p>“Right, then──”</p>
<p>As I spoke to her, I dove deep.</p>
<p>Sinking my consciousness into my own past.</p>


<p>I was still young, about a second-grader in elementary school.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>Whenever I left the dojo after giving thanks to my mother, I was always staggering.</p>
<p>The Ado family’s training was rigorous. Striking, throwing, finishing moves, swords, spears, bows—mastering them all was the mark of a Ado woman. The training was harsh, to say the least.</p>
<p>However, frankly speaking, I didn’t like fighting or anything like that at all. There was no joy in becoming stronger for me.</p>
<p>Why do I have to do this?</p>
<p>That’s what I thought all the time back then, but still, I felt a sense of duty because “I am a child of this house.” If I was born into the Ado family, then it was something I should do, and I wanted to meet my mother and grandmother’s expectations.</p>
<p>My heart was caught in a vice of emotions, and my body was worn out from fatigue.</p>
<p>There was a special place of solace for me.</p>
<p>Near our house, on a small hill, there was a single large tree. Only when I was there, I could forget about things I had to do or didn’t want to do.</p>
<p>That tree was incredibly certain in its existence. It felt like it would surely always be there, a tree that existed long before I was born and would continue to exist long after I was gone.</p>
<p>A certain something that never wavered. In hindsight, I must have found comfort there because I had nothing like that in my life at the time.</p>
<p>I often literally leaned on it and fell asleep. As a child, that’s how I endured the daily training.</p>
<p>A fluttering, unstable spirit without something to anchor on. Easily swayed by even the slightest thing, losing sight of where to go, a timid and fragile existence. That was me at the time.</p>
<p>“Suika~!”</p>
<p>“…Kuuya-kun.”</p>
<p>He often came to call for me, a boy one year older living nearby.</p>
<p>“It’s dinner time! They say it’s some really good meat!”</p>
<p>He was incredibly bright, unlike me. His large smile could be recognized from a hundred meters away, his trademark.</p>
<p>Our fathers had been friends since the old days, and our families were close, often dining together.</p>
<p>“Let’s go back!”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>He was someone who, without fail, helped and pulled me along, shy and poor at expressing my own thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>Always the center of attention with his sunny disposition, and perhaps because of his keen observation skills, he quickly sensed what I wanted to say and took care of everything.</p>
<p>I was very grateful, admiring, and thought he was amazing.</p>
<p>There might have been a vague sense of affection, but it wasn’t to the extent that I was consciously aware of it as a romantic feeling.</p>
<p>“Did you draw today too, Kuuya-kun?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>In addition, at that time, I harbored another feeling towards him.</p>
<p>That was “envy.”</p>
<p>Spending time calmly drawing pictures inside the house or in the garden. While he was doing that, I was enduring harsh training in the dojo, which inevitably made me think, “I wish I could do that too.”</p>
<p>It seemed free from pain and suffering.</p>
<p>…That was the world surrounding me, and a significant upheaval happened in the summer of that year.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Suika. It just has to be done.”</p>
<p>I clearly remember my grandfather, now passed away, apologizing to me at the time.</p>
<p>Due to some land readjustment or something, I didn’t understand the details as a child. All I knew was that the tree had to be cut down, no matter what.</p>
<p>“…It’s okay if it can’t be helped.”</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry,” my grandfather repeatedly stroked me. I strongly believed it wasn’t his fault. There are things in this world that just can’t be helped.</p>
<p>That tree was on the Ado family’s land. If the Ado family, with its strong influence, had insisted, it might have been possible to save the tree.</p>
<p>But the Ado was not such a family.</p>
<p>The family worked for the development of the surrounding area and the community, serving as a model. I am proud of my grandfather’s decision at that time.</p>
<p>As planned, the tree was cut down (it seems it was difficult to replant it somewhere else), and the hill was leveled. I couldn’t bring myself to watch it happen at all.</p>
<p>I had to keep going strong even without that tree, so I devoted myself to training. But it was just a façade, and even my usually strict mother and grandmother seemed concerned during that time.</p>
<p>And then, about a month after the tree was cut down.</p>
<p>“Suikaaa, Suikaaa!”</p>
<p>I heard a voice calling me from the entrance. It was a familiar boy’s voice.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the Ado house, Kuuya and his parents were there. My parents and grandfather were also there.</p>
<p>But my eyes didn’t go to them. They were drawn to a single point, inexplicably there, the tree that should have already been gone.</p>
<p>I don’t know how many breaths I took or how many times I blinked. After some time passed, I finally realized it was a painting of that tree.</p>
<p>It was a strange sensation. Different from a photograph. The reality of the tree’s presence was cut out in the form of a canvas, right here, now.</p>
<p>Along with that incomparable sense of security.</p>
<p>“…This?”</p>
<p>Kuuya-kun had.</p>
<p>When I asked, I finally noticed his complexion was terribly pale.</p>
<p>“Will you accept it?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes…”</p>
<p>The framed painting was heavy. Not just the weight of the object, but something more.</p>
<p>“Kuuya-kun,”</p>
<p>“I’m glad I could give it to you… Sorry, I’m a bit… haha, sleepy…”</p>
<p>“Kuuya-kun!?”</p>
<p>After handing me the painting, he collapsed. By the time his father and mother supported his body, he had already lost consciousness.</p>
<p>“We’ve caused a commotion, sorry, Daisuke. We’ll take Kuuya home now.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a commotion, but… is Kuuya-kun okay…?”</p>
<p>“He’s my son, after all,” Kuuya’s father said with a smile to my father. There seemed to be some resolve in his expression.</p>
<p>Kuuya’s father was also a painter. His paintings were like delicate glasswork that seemed to shatter if touched carelessly by rough humans, incredibly ephemeral, delicate, and stunningly beautiful.</p>
<p>And perhaps, just as his paintings suggested, he wasn’t very physically strong.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Suika-chan, for the suddenness. If you like it, this child would be happy too.”</p>
<p>Those were the words of Kuuya’s mother, also a painter. A beautiful woman with distinct features, her voice and expressions always carried a strange vibrancy.</p>


<p>Her artworks were mostly themed around love, characterized by flamboyant, vividly bright reds. Like her, they were brimming with vitality, irresistibly capturing people’s attention with an undeniable attraction. They were said to contain the most vivid reds in modern Japan.</p>
<p>She often said, both in public and private, “My paintings, my red, are all my feelings for my husband.” My parents were quite close, but Kuuya’s parents were equally matched in their affection for each other.</p>
<p>Even after Kuuya and his family left, I remained frozen in the entranceway.</p>
<p>Facing the painting in my hands, unable to move.</p>
<p>I felt I shouldn’t take my eyes off it. Because this painting, this painting contained…</p>
<p>“Suika.”</p>
<p>“Grandfather…”</p>
<p>“Grandpa isn’t well-versed in art. Honestly, I don’t understand much about paintings. But, living a long life means you meet all sorts of people.”</p>
<p>My grandfather squatted down to meet my eye level, gazing at the painting with me.</p>
<p>“Among them, very rarely, you’ll encounter someone who’s fighting a battle with everything on the line. Even in an era without arrows or guns flying. Someone who risks their life, and somehow, achieves something by shaving off their own life. You could say they exchange their life for something else.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I had no choice but to nod. Because I understood.</p>
<p>With parents like his, Kuuya was bound to be talented. But the painting before me wasn’t just about talent.</p>
<p>The painting exuded the scent of life. Not just paint and oil, but something else layered and poured into it, reaching my nostrils with a dense intensity.</p>
<p>That’s why it was so beautiful, certain, raw, and dear to me.</p>
<p>Something miraculous, now in my hands. Drawn by him, given to me.</p>
<p>Risking his life.</p>
<p>Something stirred within me.</p>
<p>“…Daisuke-san, Kuuya-kun is…”</p>
<p>“Just as Masataka said. No doubt, he’s his son. The same, capable of the same things.”</p>
<p>My father’s voice in response to my mother was somewhat stiff.</p>
<p>As if to reveal the reason for that stiffness, ──then, Kuuya didn’t wake up for three days.</p>
<p>“Kuuya-kun!!”</p>
<p>“…Suika? …Ah.”</p>
<p>On the third day of my daily hospital visits, just when everyone else had left, he woke up.</p>
<p>The weather outside was beautiful, casting deep shadows in the hospital room due to the contrast.</p>
<p>“Where is this…?”</p>
<p>He coughed several times after speaking abruptly, and when I handed him a cup of water, he drank a little.</p>
<p>“Thanks… a hospital, huh. Why am I here…?”</p>
<p>“For me! You drew…! And then…!”</p>
<p>“…Ah~! …Right, sorry, I was just tired. That’s why!”</p>
<p>He laughed off lightly.</p>
<p>“Just tired… Kuuya-kun, you’ve been unconscious for three days…”</p>
<p>“Was I asleep that long? Seriously? …Hey.”</p>
<p>Then, Kuuya looked extremely anxious. Perhaps the fear of having been unconscious for so long hit him─</p>
<p>“How was the painting?”</p>
<p>My expectations were completely off the mark.</p>
<p>“I was wondering if I managed to paint a good one… I haven’t heard what Suika thought about it.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Suika, you’ve seemed so lonely all the time. I was thinking if there was anything I could do… How was it? Did it help at all? …Did it cheer you up?”</p>
<p>“Kuuya-kun, weren’t you… in trouble?”</p>
<p>“Me? Well, I was… I knew going all out would end up bad. My dad even said, ‘If you keep it up, it might be irreversible.’ …Waking up in three days, I guess I’m pretty strong, huh?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But, I wanted to paint that. Well, no, it’s like this.”</p>
<p>Shyly, awkwardly, he said,</p>
<p>“I just hoped it would make Suika smile. I love it when Suika smiles.”</p>
<p>“That’s… all?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, pretty much.”</p>
<p>“Ah, saying that makes me sound stupid!” Kuuya said, breaking into his usual broad, hundred-meter recognizable smile.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p>After painting something like that, in such a manner.</p>
<p>Why, why is he…</p>
<p>Why is he, oh, so…</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“I’m not scared anymore. Because Kuuya-kun gave me the greatest thing in the world.”</p>
<p>“…Really?!”</p>
<p>In front of his delighted face, I felt deeply ashamed.</p>
<p>I had envied him for painting, thinking he didn’t have to endure pain or suffering.</p>
<p>In the dojo, both my mother and grandmother were strict, but it was still just training. I never felt like my life was being shaved away, because it wasn’t a real battlefield.</p>
<p>But the person in front of me was different.</p>
<p>He fought, possibly shaving away some, or all, of his life in the process. He fought for me.</p>
<p>“That’s great, then! I’m glad!”</p>
<p>On the hospital bed, his smile was pale. Pure white.</p>
<p>There was another thing I was ashamed of.</p>
<p>That was not giving my all to the training until now. I looked at my hands.</p>
<p>With these frail fists, can I protect someone precious? …No.</p>
<p>“…Uh, …Uh.”</p>
<p>“…Suika?”</p>
<p>“Uh, …!”</p>
<p>“Suika!? What’s wrong, does it hurt somewhere!?”</p>
<p>“Uuuuu!”</p>
<p>Shaking my head vigorously, tears spilled from my eyes. Unstoppable.</p>
<p>Embarrassed, frustrated, pathetic. What have I been doing all this time?</p>
<p>“Ku-Kuuya-kun… Kuuya!”</p>
<p>No more hiding behind a younger girl.</p>
<p>“…? Suika…?”</p>
<p>“I, I, I will!”</p>
<p>“Alright, what…? I’m listening…!”</p>
<p>“Get stronger! So strong that it’ll surprise Kuuya!”</p>
<p>I squeezed his hand tightly, vowing.</p>
<p>Something unshakable, certain, was born within me at that moment. Something I had always wanted, giving me a profoundly happy feeling.</p>
<p>“I will! Become that!”</p>
<p>While speaking in front of Kuuya, I made an additional vow in my heart.</p>
<p>Someday, to become someone who can protect you from everything in the world, no matter what.</p>
<p>──And then.</p>
<p>In the end, I didn’t make that vow in time.</p>


<p>It really happened so suddenly that I think no one could fully grasp the reality of it.</p>
<p>Two years had passed since Kuuya gave me that painting. I was in the fourth grade of elementary school, and Kuuya was in the fifth.</p>
<p>It was a hot summer that made you wonder if something had gone wrong, the kind that made you tilt your head in confusion.</p>
<p>Since that day two years ago, I had devoted my entire being to training, feeling myself grow day by day. Therefore, I believed it wouldn’t be long before I could truly protect Kuuya.</p>
<p>“…Dad, is that… really true?”</p>
<p>Even though I knew he wasn’t someone who would lie, I had to ask again. The fact that my parents called me to tell me was just too much to bear.</p>
<p>“But… how can that be?”</p>
<p>“…Suika, it’s true. It’s incredibly, incredibly sad.”</p>
<p>My mother was the one who said it. Contrary to her words, her voice seemed to carry more strong anger than sadness, at least to me.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s true, Suika. That’s why your father is going to visit Kuuya’s dad as much as possible for a while.”</p>
<p>The sadness seemed more apparent in my father than in my mother.</p>
<p>“Abandoning Masataka… and leaving Kuuya behind. I can’t believe it, not even a little.”</p>
<p>My father murmured softly.</p>
<p>Kuuya’s mother had vanished, leaving behind her husband and son—essentially, her family—for another man.</p>
<p>The details weren’t shared with me, but the undeniable fact was that she had left for another man.</p>
<p>The person who had passionately and vibrantly painted her love for her husband had, one day, suddenly acted as if everything up to then had been a lie.</p>
<p>My first concern was, unavoidably, for Kuuya.</p>
<p>From that day on, my father frequently visited Kuuya’s father—Uncle Masataka, and I always went with him.</p>
<p>“Hey, Masataka! Have you eaten yet? Got some great fish, criminally good.”</p>
<p>“Daisuke, you’re here again? …Fish, sounds good. Let’s be criminals together.”</p>
<p>“Alright, partners in crime it is!”</p>
<p>Though their casual banter seemed light-hearted, I distinctly felt a profound sadness. I easily understood why my father frequently visited his friend.</p>
<p>The man who had been betrayed in the worst way by his beloved wife seemed to have become much frailer. Not just physically, but in more ways than that.</p>
<p>Originally delicate and not very strong, he often joked, but surely meant it seriously, that “I live supported by the energy of my contrasting wife.”</p>
<p>“Dad, I’ll help out. I’m joining the criminal gang too…!”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Alright, then.”</p>
<p>── Kuuya always laughed brightly. He faced forward with determination, standing straight and tall.</p>
<p>It was hard to believe that he had lost his mother in such a manner.</p>
<p>Was Kuuya okay? I once foolishly asked him, and he answered, “Because I have to support Dad.”</p>
<p>What could I do? What could I possibly do?</p>
<p>I wanted to be of help. I had gained strength. But the skills I honed in daily training seemed utterly useless now.</p>
<p>How could I… What should I do…</p>
<p>Without knowing, yet the days kept passing.</p>
<p>Autumn left, winter came, and then it was spring.</p>
<p>Just as the snow that barely held on through spring finally succumbs to the natural order and melts away, it seemed there was no other conclusion but the one we reached.</p>
<p>In a building where everyone wore black, I believe my father was probably the person who had most prepared for this ending.</p>
<p>And yet, he cried louder than anyone else. It was the first time I saw my father cry.</p>
<p>Much later, Kuuya said it made him “very happy.” “Because I couldn’t cry,” he added.</p>
<p>On that day, Kuuya indeed hadn’t cried.</p>
<p>More than not crying, he seemed empty.</p>
<p>I understood that something very important had vanished from Kuuya. In the end, I couldn’t protect it.</p>
<p>── Uncle Masataka, one morning, didn’t wake up even when Kuuya tried to rouse him. It was as if all the warmth that kept him alive had vanished, leaving him cold but with a peaceful expression.</p>
<p>Kuuya was taken to live with his grandparents in a distant region, reachable only by boat or plane.</p>
<p>I called him every single day. I truly wanted to visit him every day (I did try once but was caught midway).</p>
<p>I was terrified. I feared that Kuuya, like Uncle Masataka, might one day choose not to wake up, to stop living.</p>
<p>That fear was so strong because Kuuya, after losing Uncle Masataka, seemed so fragile that he might vanish if I looked away.</p>
<p>At first, Kuuya would answer the phone but wouldn’t even offer a grunt of acknowledgment. The faint sound of his breathing was the only lifeline I felt connected us.</p>
<p>I kept talking every day.</p>
<p>About the funny things that happened yesterday, the fun experiences of today, the interesting things that might happen tomorrow.</p>
<p>I had to convey that the world still had bright places and that it was worth it for Kuuya to wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>I wasn’t much of a talker and was shy, but what did that matter? I traveled to various places, talked to many people, and gathered all the wonderful things in the world to tell Kuuya.</p>
<p>I learned that bright places attract bright stories. So, I became a brighter me.</p>
<p>If needed, I would do anything. Become anyone.</p>
<p>And Kuuya, who had mostly just listened to me, gradually began to respond with acknowledgments.</p>
<p>He started to ask back, dig deeper, and gave me more words bit by bit. He became interested in the world again.</p>
<p>Apparently, where he was taken, he met someone who painted beautiful paintings. A significant reason for Kuuya’s recovery was probably those paintings. My stories might not have had much effect.</p>
<p>But that’s okay. If my efforts had even the slightest impact, it was all worth it.</p>
<p>And I heard about it from him towards the end of summer.</p>
<p>“…I started ‘seeing’ colors. The colors of people’s… emotions, I think. The feelings someone has for the person in front of them become visible in colors… Sorry, it’s a weird story, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Not weird at all. …How do they appear to you?”</p>
<p>“Like a mist, I guess. With colors. Friends are green, people they dislike seem blue… And then…”</p>


<p>Listening to him, I was surprised, but I didn’t doubt him for a moment.</p>
<p>“Love looks… red.”</p>
<p>I intuitively understood that recognizing this emotion and its color was the root of the power that had emerged in Kuuya.</p>
<p>I thought it was a curse.</p>
<p>“And then, when I see that red, I get really cold. My fingertips freeze, and my body stops moving.”</p>
<p>“…Kuuya.”</p>
<p>“I also draw here, with grandpa and grandma. But, I can’t use red…”</p>
<p>Kuuya’s mother—the woman who often painted with red, the color of love. To Kuuya, those were empty falsehoods, a cruel betrayal that took his father from him, a detestable poison.</p>
<p>That was what had cursed Kuuya.</p>
<p>“…Suika, I’ve decided to come back there when I start junior high. I’m persuading grandpa and grandma right now.”</p>
<p>“…That’s…”</p>
<p>“It’s been kind of tough. Because grandpa and grandma love me… Even when I’m not trying to see, sometimes, it just appears. When I think those colors are directed at me, my body… just won’t move. It’s too hard.”</p>
<p>“…────”</p>
<p>At that moment, I’ve never hated someone so much. As long as my life continues, I will never forgive that woman.</p>
<p>Could there be anything more sorrowful?</p>
<p>Being loved makes Kuuya feel pain. The warmest feeling in the world is the coldest to Kuuya.</p>
<p>Is there a worse curse in living in this world?</p>
<p>“Kuuya coming here is a big welcome from me! The entire Ado family welcomes you!”</p>
<p>I spoke in a ridiculously bright tone, the only way I knew to hide a voice that threatened to shake and blur.</p>
<p>“Really? …Thank you, that’s reassuring. …I wonder what color uncle Daisuke and aunt Ran appear as. Yellow, maybe? The hospital doctors who take good care of me, the painter I’ve become friends with, the color of people who watch over me feels like that.”</p>
<p>Then, Kuuya said.</p>
<p>“I wonder what Suika is.”</p>
<p>“It’s obvious, isn’t it!”</p>
<p>I answered instantly, my hand holding the receiver trembling.</p>
<p>“You’ve always been my best friend, Kuuya! So, the color of friendship, of course!”</p>
<p>“Really, that’s right.”</p>
<p>Kuuya’s voice sounded happy, not doubting at all, to which I declared confidently, “Of course!”</p>
<p>After talking a bit more, we hung up, and… I collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p>“…Ah, ah, …ahhhhh!”</p>
<p>My heartbeat was loud, the sweat on my body felt disgusting.</p>
<p>“Oh, oh, …ahhhhh!”</p>
<p>How do I appear to him? It’s obvious—definitely red.</p>
<p>The color that chills his heart.</p>
<p>The color that will torment him when he returns here.</p>
<p>What do I do, what should I do? What can I do?</p>
<p>I was certain Kuuya wasn’t lying about his story. So, what can I do? Think of Kuuya as a friend? I do, but… the feelings of love and affection in my heart are overflowing, incomparable to just friendship.</p>
<p>“Suika? What’s wrong, are you feeling ill?”</p>
<p>“Dad… ah…”</p>
<p>Seeing me in distress, my dad rushed over, and I had a revelation. An idea that, once conceived, seemed like the only thing to cling to.</p>
<p>“…Dad, you always record videos for every occasion, right?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s my hobby…”</p>
<p>“Please show me all the videos of Kuuya’s dad and mom! All of them!”</p>
<p>Sensing something from my demeanor, my dad provided me with a multitude of video data, including old ones that required specific equipment to play.</p>
<p>“If… if this ‘seeing emotions as colors’ ability that Kuuya awakened is some sort of supernatural power, there’s nothing I can do.”</p>
<p>But I was convinced that wasn’t the case. It must be that Kuuya, with his exceptional observation skills, makes very accurate predictions based on visual information.</p>
<p>I watched the videos of Kuuya’s parents over and over. Although one’s feelings have changed now, the deepest example of love imprinted in Kuuya’s mind must be this.</p>
<p>Including unconscious actions—no, perhaps those are the most critical indicators.</p>
<p>I studied their expressions, gestures, gazes, and atmospheres towards each other in the videos.</p>
<p>So that I would never show those to Kuuya.</p>
<p>Watch, over and over. Watch, watch, watch, watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch watch…</p>
<p>Even the face of a woman I despise enough to want to kill, I watched over and over.</p>
<p>“Kuuya! It’s been a while!”</p>
<p>“Suika.”</p>
<p>Kuuya returned to town just as junior high started.</p>
<p>In front of him, whom I hadn’t seen for a year, in front of him who would “see” me with those eyes, I didn’t break a sweat.</p>
<p>Control over one’s body is the foundation of all Ado techniques.</p>
<p>No matter how anxious or frightened my heart is, I won’t show it.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, …it’s just as you said. Suika’s color is a beautiful green, I thought.”</p>
<p>…Yes!!</p>
<p>I nearly lost all strength in my joy, but of course, I didn’t let it show.</p>
<p>Naturally, I smiled.</p>
<p>“I told you!”</p>
<p>Yes, Kuuya.</p>
<p>The girl in front of you is a long-time friend, a childhood friend, Ado Suika—nothing more.</p>
<p>Hiding the truth of red under the guise of green.</p>
<p>“Ah. …Yeah, deep and kind, Suika’s green.”</p>
<p>With a gentle smile, Kuuya laughed. It was a look very similar to his father’s.</p>
<p>The large, recognizable smile from a hundred meters away, once Kuuya’s trademark, was lost to him.</p>
<p>“So from now on, I’m still your best friend!”</p>
<p>So, I smiled like the Kuuya of old, so that someday he could reclaim that smile for himself, to teach him, “This is how you smiled.”</p>
<p>──And there was one more thing I had to do.</p>
<p>“All the friends from elementary school are mostly going to the same junior high, right? Do you think they remember me?”</p>
<p>“It’s only been a year; there’s no way they’ve forgotten you.”</p>
<p>“I hope so.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Don’t worry, all your friends are waiting for you!”</p>
<p>Yes, waiting for a “friend.”</p>
<p>No matter what, there must not be any girl around him seeking more than that relationship, not allowing any harmful red emotions to be directed at him.</p>
<p>I never slacked off before, but after Kuuya returned, I threw myself into studying, sports, and extracurricular activities even more thoroughly.</p>
<p>To make my external specs seem higher.</p>
<p>That way, I can easily fit in anywhere. The social connections I initially built to tell Kuuya bright stories could be expanded into something more vast and intricately detailed.</p>
<p>Kuuya is approachable and has exceptional talent in art… now, there’s a shadowed ambiance about him. Some girls are drawn to that kind of thing. The network I built doesn’t miss out on information about those girls.</p>
<p>The heightened specs also served as intimidation. To make them think… if such a girl is by his side, they better step back.</p>
<p>In any case, to ensure that no careless red chills him, I did everything I could to eliminate such possibilities. I built fences to prevent contact.</p>
<p>To protect him.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>That’s not a lie. It’s not a lie, but…</p>
<p>At the same time, I was also aware. The reason I built fences to protect him was—to not let him escape, to encage him.</p>
<p>I want to protect him, I don’t want him to get hurt anymore, I want him to be happy.</p>
<p>…Then, the one who should stay away from him the most is me. Because I’m the one who harbors the greatest love for him in this world.</p>
<p>But I can’t do that.</p>
<p>I don’t want to hand him over to anyone. I want to make him mine. I want him to look only at me. If he’s to be happy, please, let it be within these hands.</p>
<p>I want to protect him, I love him, but I also want to confine him, I want everything.</p>
<p>I finally understood my family, the Ado clan. My mother, my grandmother, all the women of the Ado family through the generations… must have lived with this ugly demon of uncontrollable possessiveness.</p>
<p>To obtain the man they love by any means necessary.</p>
<p>That’s why the women of Ado are strong. We are… not normal.</p>


<p>◆◇◆</p>
<p>Sitting next to me on the bench at the bus stop, Ado-san, while omitting some details, finally finished explaining his situation to me.</p>
<p>“There’s something I must say.”</p>
<p>She continued quietly.</p>
<p>Her voice was colder than one could imagine from the bright and cheerful demeanor she had shown at school. Her eyes looking at me were as dark as if they had been steeped in shadow.</p>
<p>“If something happens to Kuuya, and if it’s caused by you, I will eliminate you from his surroundings. By any means necessary.”</p>
<p>“…I don’t intend to trouble him either, but you’re saying there’s a possibility?”</p>
<p>“As I’ve explained, Kuuya feels pain when red—when love is directed at him from others. Your affection could potentially be causing him mental strain.”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait, I have a poker face, as you see. I can’t believe it’s noticeable…!”</p>
<p>“…Unfortunately, it’s quite obvious. Indeed, your expression may be neutral, but, senpai, you’re too easy to read in other aspects.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, no way.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a lie. In fact, you’re on the easier side to read.”</p>
<p>Regrettable as it is, the woman next to me is an expert on this. If she says so… then it must be true.</p>
<p>…Is it really?</p>
<p>…Ah!</p>
<p>I covered my face. It’s embarrassing, and… I feel sorry for Miyashiro-kun.</p>
<p>“To evade Kuuya’s gaze, you have to pass through numerous checkpoints.”</p>
<p>“…But you’ve been doing that for about four years already, right?”</p>
<p>“I’m good at controlling my body.”</p>
<p>But is that really possible? It’s not just about skill, but constant self-control is undoubtedly required.</p>
<p>I look at her face again.</p>
<p>Ado Suika. With her large, striking eyes, she has a doll-like adorable appearance.</p>
<p>But probably, this woman belongs to the category of monsters.</p>
<p>Despite entering that realm, she still wants to protect him.</p>
<p>…I often see Ado-san talking with Miyashiro-kun. Just yesterday, I saw them in the infirmary.</p>
<p>Honestly, I thought it was overprotective. Although I understand he’s not very physically strong, I wondered why she would go to such lengths for an older male and thought it was just Ado-san’s personality.</p>
<p>However, after hearing her story just now, I fully understand Ado-san’s feelings.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Certainly, you wouldn’t want to let anything harmful get close to him.”</p>
<p>“…Kuuya already doesn’t take very good care of himself.”</p>
<p>Ado-san’s words bring back the scene I saw in the art room that day. Miyashiro-kun was painting with a heavy body but with a determined back.</p>
<p>──In this world, …even if it’s not beautiful, it would be good if there was one more painting that could accompany someone’s pain, suffering, or loneliness. That’s what I think.</p>
<p>──That’s why I paint. That’s all there is to it.</p>
<p>…While saying such things.</p>
<p>“I want him to be happy.”</p>
<p>The woman sitting next to me, not looking at me but somewhere far away, muttered softly.</p>
<p>“He’s had enough hardship. And yet, he still tries to make others happy at his own expense. …That shouldn’t be.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I want him to be happy. I want him to be happy. I want him to be happy. …Even though I think that, I can’t suppress it.”</p>
<p>Her voice, sounding indifferent, therefore revealed her inner conflict.</p>
<p>“I can’t suppress the feeling of wanting him. Even though such feelings are terrifying for him. …Really, the one who should be furthest from him is me, more than anyone else.”</p>
<p>“…You’re in a complicated love, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“…Could you please keep this between us?”</p>
<p>A bus arrived from down the road. It was fairly crowded but not too much to get on.</p>
<p>“Of course. …Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Standing up, I boarded the bus that had stopped in front of us. Ado-san followed immediately.</p>
<p>We didn’t speak a word inside the bus.</p>
<p>Upon reaching our destination, we got off. It was an ordinary place. A bus stop facing a major street, with narrow paths nearby.</p>
<p>“Now, the question is where Miyashiro-kun went from here. Any ideas?”</p>
<p>“…Around here, there’s nowhere in particular that Kuuya would likely go… If we’re going by process of elimination, he probably didn’t go that way. It’s not certain, though.”</p>
<p>Ado-san pointed towards the east side of the main street.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“If you go that way, you’ll reach a shopping district. If the people there saw Kuuya wandering alone, they would definitely contact me. Especially if something seemed off. Since I haven’t received any calls, I guess he didn’t go that way.”</p>
<p>“Hey, can I say what I’m thinking?”</p>
<p>“…Please do.”</p>
<p>“Your human surveillance system is honestly creepy…”</p>
<p>“…I, I don’t want to hear that from a stalker who illegally collects personal information!”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true.”</p>
<p>Sadly, I couldn’t deny it.</p>
<p>“By the way, I consider myself a stalker, but what should we call someone like you? Hmm… Humanity hasn’t discovered enough of your kind to categorize you yet, so I can’t find the right word.”</p>
<p>“…Perhaps you’re right.”</p>
<p>“Let’s temporarily call you a biased, malicious yandere woman.”</p>
<p>Ado-san bit her lip and looked down in defeat.</p>
<p>“Using people around you to thoroughly monitor and manipulate Miyashiro-kun’s environment, you’re really a top-tier troublemaker.”</p>
<p>“…S, S, Shut up! I don’t want anything dangerous getting close to Kuuya! Like you!”</p>
<p>“Don’t treat me like a hazardous material. At least for now, I’m somewhat useful.”</p>
<p>“What use does a criminal have?”</p>
<p>“Quiet, you’re violating human rights. I don’t think Miyashiro-kun went in the direction you’re pointing, either.”</p>
<p>I said, pointing in the opposite direction to the west, which Ado-san had indicated.</p>
<p>“Why do you think that?”</p>
<p>“Miyashiro-kun’s smartwatch can connect to free Wi-Fi, a model without much discretion. And there’s a game center a little further from here, right?”</p>
<p>The building with a slightly stylish exterior was visible even from our current location.</p>
<p>“They spread strong free Wi-Fi that even reaches a bit away from the store. Miyashiro-kun has connected to it before with his smartwatch, and the settings should automatically connect him again if he gets close.”</p>
<p>I took out my smartphone and launched the Miyashiro-kun monitoring app. Checking the “current location” information, there were no updates.</p>


<p>“If the Wi-Fi… I mean, if he connects to the net, then the latest ‘current location’ information should be sent to me immediately. But it hasn’t come. So, Miyashiro-kun probably didn’t go that way… the likelihood is, well, high, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Can I say what I’m thinking?”</p>
<p>“…Please do.”</p>
<p>“I’ll say it as many times as necessary, you’re simply a criminal.”</p>
<p>“…Good kids shouldn’t try this at home, okay?”</p>
<p>Misusing technology is wrong. I’m a bad example.</p>
<p>“…When I think about it calmly, we’re really something, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>“…I feel sorry for Kuuya.”</p>
<p>“But, there are two bad women here, so, maybe two negatives make a positive?”</p>
<p>“…Senpai, you’re an interesting person. No, I don’t mean that in a bad way.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, surprisingly so.”</p>
<p>While having such a conversation, we decided on the direction to head. If it seemed unlikely he went east or west on the main street, then it was the path that led south.</p>
<p>Rushing together, we moved down the path flanked by groves…</p>
<p>“I don’t know how far Kuuya has gone, but it’s best to find him as soon as possible. Let’s hurry. Beyond this point is… oh, wait, Senpai?”</p>
<p>“Tha, thaT’s a tEmpLe oVer thEre isn’t iT…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>What? No!</p>
<p>“I, it’s too fast…! I, I can’t, move, that, fast, what, what are you…?”</p>
<p>She’s too fast. Does this woman have an engine in her legs?</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m, sorry…”</p>
<p>“Going out with, Kuuya, and, …haa, ha, oh, it can’t be, like this, right…?”</p>
<p>“I don’t do that when I’m with Kuuya! I walk at the optimal speed that matches him! I can usually tell his physical condition by his facial expression, tone of voice, and gestures on that day!”</p>
<p>“Eww, that’s creepy…”</p>
<p>“Watch your words!”</p>
<p>“Oops, the truth slipped out. But, you know, Miyashiro-kun, he’s not, very good at sports, right…? Haha, we’re alike, …ehehe.”</p>
<p>“Eww, that’s creepy…”</p>
<p>“Mind your language…!”</p>
<p>Before we knew it, the day had already started to fade, and the world was being dyed red by the sunset.</p>
<p>The color he fears. It felt as though the world was cornering him, not just because of the exercise, but also an uncomfortable sweat formed on my back.</p>
<p>Ado-san beside me seemed the same. Despite our bickering, her expression was tense.</p>
<p>It would be fine if nothing happened. If all of today’s concerns turned out to be needless worry. …But if something had happened.</p>
<p>“…Ado-san, there.”</p>
<p>“Ah, …right, so this path leads there.”</p>
<p>What came into view was probably the tallest building in the area. I don’t know how many floors it has, but it’s a strangely elongated grey building.</p>
<p>“That’s supposed to be abandoned now, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It used to house some company, but due to various issues with the landowner, it’s now uninhabited and unmanaged.”</p>
<p>In rural towns, it’s not uncommon for such buildings to continue standing without being demolished. That building is likely one of them.</p>
<p>“…He might be there.”</p>
<p>I thought I was the one who said it, but it was Ado-san’s words.</p>
<p>“High places are closer to the sky. Kuuya likes the sky.”</p>
<p>I had heard that too.</p>
<p>“Though, the current color of the sky isn’t something Kuuya would want to approach…”</p>
<p>“No, but I think we should check it out.”</p>
<p>We agreed on that at least.</p>
<p>Soon, we arrived at the base of the building. The entrance was technically sealed, but various broken windows made it meaningless.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Ado-san entered through the largest broken window without making a sound. It was so seamless it almost seemed like the official way in.</p>
<p>“You’re like a ninja. You don’t sneak into Miyashiro-kun’s house like that, do you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t! I have a key!”</p>
<p>“Deny the sneaking part, not the key. To think he gave you a key…”</p>
<p>How terrifying. Maybe I should change the locks on my own initiative.</p>
<p>Thinking this, I carefully entered the building, mindful of the glass shards. The strange mugginess made me grimace.</p>
<p>“Ah…! There are footprints!”</p>
<p>“No way, …Ah? Where…?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t see them. After all, it’s a deserted building with no lights, and the only thing we could rely on for visibility was the fading sunlight.</p>
<p>“The dust accumulated on the floor has definitely been disturbed in the shape of feet. And this size… it’s like Kuuya’s… The pattern of the soles of the shoes Kuuya often wears is… I kind of remember… but probably…”</p>
<p>Ado-san muttered to herself. Standing beside her, I had to reassess my opinion of her. Even I hadn’t noticed the pattern on the soles of shoes…</p>
<p>“Anyway, the footprints are heading towards the stairs! Let’s go!”</p>
<p>No sooner had she said it than Ado-san headed to the staircase and began ascending. I was left behind, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>I hurried after her.</p>
<p>First floor, second floor, third floor… and more. We raced up the dim and dangerous staircase, littered with broken glass, to what seemed to be the top floor, the seventh.</p>
<p>“Here…? No, probably not…”</p>
<p>“Yes, the footprints go up further.”</p>
<p>So, even if it was the top floor, there was still somewhere else to go.</p>
<p>The place closest to the sky, the rooftop.</p>
<p>At the end of the last set of stairs, there was a door. Broken glass was scattered around the feet, reflecting the sunset and staining red like blood.</p>
<p>And the door was ajar.</p>
<p>As Ado-san touched it, it creaked open.</p>
<p>──On the rooftop, he was there.</p>
<p>“…Kuuya!”</p>
<p>His familiar back. Even I recognized it immediately, so for Ado-san, there was no doubt.</p>
<p>He was standing near the edge of the rooftop, gazing absentmindedly at the sky. There was a fence to prevent falls, but it was low and rusted, unreliable.</p>
<p>“Kuuya, it’s dangerous there! Let’s go home with me, ”</p>
<p>Ado-san’s voice froze mid-sentence. Behind her, I felt the same chill run down my spine.</p>
<p>“…Suika? And Kujo-san too…?”</p>
<p>He turned towards us. His voice was unnaturally flat.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>As he asked us that, his hands were stained red. The red dripped onto the floor, slowly increasing its surface area.</p>
<p>It was a piece of glass. Miyashiro-kun was clutching it in his right hand, and blood was overflowing from the torn areas.</p>
<p>His right hand was his dominant hand.</p>
<p>“Ku-…Kuuya, what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>I honestly thought it was amazing.</p>
<p>“It’s getting dark soon, it’s time to go home. How about dinner at Ado’s house tonight?”</p>
<p>With a single breath, she completely suppressed her own movements and spoke to Miyashiro-kun in a tone as if she were making casual small talk.</p>
<p>The flowing blood, the proximity to the rooftop’s edge, the cold, flat voice, and the dimly shining eyes.</p>


<p>Recognizing the extremely precarious situation from his behavior, Ado-san quickly decided that any undue stimulation must be avoided. She reflected this decision in her actions immediately.</p>
<p>“Thank you. But, I’ll refrain today.”</p>
<p>Miyashiro-kun smiled as if he were crying and shook his head.</p>
<p>“…It’s a bit cold.”</p>
<p>“…Cold?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s cold, so cold… I thought it would be warmer outside since it’s supposed to be hot, but it was still cold when I left the house. I thought the place closest to the sky in this town would be the warmest, so I came here, …but it wasn’t. It wasn’t very warm.”</p>
<p>Ado-san asked, and Miyashiro-kun began to speak in bits and pieces.</p>
<p>…Even though it’s already July, and the rooftop of the building should be sufficiently hot, he muttered, “It’s cold, you know.”</p>
<p>“It’s red.”</p>
<p>He said, looking at the sky, and gripped the shard tighter. The flow of blood increased.</p>
<p>“Kuuya,… let’s go home. Dad wants to discuss a trip! Where do you want to go, Kuuya? Let’s discuss it over delicious food, all of us together!”</p>
<p>Ado-san smiled brightly. Despite wanting to scream and run the most, she didn’t allow herself such liberties.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Suika. I have something to do.”</p>
<p>“Something to do…?”</p>
<p>“Today, I tried using the color red. For the first time in years. Since mom was here.”</p>
<p>But it was no good.</p>
<p>Miyashiro-kun said as if spitting it out.</p>
<p>“It didn’t look beautiful or even ugly, just incredibly empty,… cold. …My body kept getting colder.”</p>
<p>“Kuuya…”</p>
<p>“But, …I can’t stay like this forever.”</p>
<p>His voice, which had been flat, clearly showed emotion.</p>
<p>“I can’t stay like this forever. I have to change. …I can’t be dragged down forever.”</p>
<p>It was anger.</p>
<p>“I’ll make myself able to use that color properly.”</p>
<p>He’s facing his past wounds head-on, trying to breakthrough. It’s a noble and lofty endeavor, …but, like the blood flowing from his hand, terribly heart-wrenching.</p>
<p>Probably, this is both his strongest and most fragile aspect.</p>
<p>“…I realized, I have that color inside me too. It’s packed in there. So, …I’m going to stay here and look at it until I get used to it. If it’s a color that comes from within me, it surely won’t be cold.”</p>
<p>Miyashiro-kun glared at his own hand gripping the shard.</p>
<p>“It should be warm, there should be heat. I haven’t been able to feel it since that day, but it should be there. If I understand that, this color won’t feel empty. So I’m going to do it, I’ll stay here until I understand.”</p>
<p>His unwavering determination reached even me, as did an understanding of how deep the wounds he had suffered were.</p>
<p>Because, despite his strong resolve, his past continues to rob him of his sanity. Quietly, deeply, and horribly.</p>
<p>“…Please.”</p>
<p>Finally, Ado-san’s voice shook.</p>
<p>“Kuuya, please. Please come with me…! Let’s treat your hand! I, I’ll be with you, so, please, please…!”</p>
<p>The blood from Miyashiro-kun’s hand wouldn’t stop. How deep must it have cut into his hand? …What if it had even reached the nerves?</p>
<p>“Don’t carry it all by yourself… don’t get hurt, please… Kuuya, please!”</p>
<p>Ado-san’s voice was so pained it felt like my heart would burst just listening.</p>
<p>—And I, with all my might, was racking my brain.</p>
<p>Frankly, I am… I’m nothing but an outsider here. The best of being out of place is Kujou Kurenai.</p>
<p>But, therefore, I must think, think, think, think.</p>
<p>After all, the situation has probably always been like this. For years, Miyashiro-kun has quietly remained broken, and Ado-san has always been there, touching his side so he wouldn’t crumble.</p>
<p>And now, it has come to a point where she can no longer support him.</p>
<p>The two of them, just the two of them, are quietly crumbling away.</p>
<p>That’s exactly why my presence here, as an outsider, must be of use. I’ll make sure of it, definitely.</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>“Kuuya! I, I’m here for you! You’re not alone, so…! I’ll do anything if I can! So, please…! Please!”</p>
<p>“…Thank you, Suika. But, I have to do it myself.”</p>
<p>What couldn’t Ado-san do alone, that Miyashiro-kun needs?</p>
<p>“Kuuya!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Suika.”</p>
<p>The current situation… there’s not just her here, but me as well. In other words, there are two troublemakers here…</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Something caught in my mind. “There are two troublemakers here,” I said that today, didn’t I?</p>
<p>And there was a continuation to that. I’m sure, it went…</p>
<p>—So, maybe two negatives make a positive!</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Minus times minus.</p>
<p>Hit the bad with the worse. And make it a plus…</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I thought of a plan but hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>Considering what would happen if it didn’t work out, …and if it did. If it’s the latter, who would be the most hurt? It’s clear.</p>
<p>It’s clear, but.</p>
<p>“I can’t always be spoiled by Suika’s kindness.”</p>
<p>“Kuuya…!”</p>
<p>I remembered my policy… my way of taking the best course of action.</p>
<p>Additionally, what came to mind was something else.</p>
<p>When I had seen his painting, literally bleeding for it, it stirred something within me.</p>
<p>My knowledge… —About wanting to talk with someone, and how there’s hardly anyone, at least not among my peers, willing to follow along.</p>
<p>But, if there was someone who loved the same things just as much, someone whose conversations matched mine…</p>
<p>Wishing for such feelings.</p>
<p>…I have to admit to the part about liking the same things. Whether it’s just as much, we’ll never yield to each other anyway.</p>
<p>…Not that I think of her as a friend at all!</p>
<p>But, …well, …now, I choose to make this decision.</p>
<p>With resolve, I breathed in the world of twilight and threw my words.</p>
<p>“Thinking you’re being spoiled by kindness, Miyashiro-kun, you’re terribly mistaken.”</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>Under the red sky, her voice resonated well.</p>
<p>“Thinking you’re being spoiled by kindness, what a huge misunderstanding, Miyashiro-kun.”</p>
<p>“Kujou-san?”</p>
<p>With her arms crossed below her chest, Kujou-san spoke in the same tone she used when she explained a math problem.</p>
<p>“You said using red felt cold, right? That it made you feel cold.”</p>
<p>“Kujou-senpai…? What are you…?”</p>
<p>Ado-san raised her voice in confusion. However, her gaze quickly returned to me.</p>
<p>The considerate, deep friendship she has always shown me. Ado-san has always directed that kindness towards me.</p>
<p>“You see, Miyashiro-kun, that’s totally absurd. Not scientifically or anything, but just in terms of the situation. It’s impossible for you to feel that way.”</p>
<p>“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p>I asked, and Kujou-san replied in her usual airy tone.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been providing you with useful information, haven’t I? So, I thought I’d do the same today.”</p>
<p>Then, Kujou-san told me.</p>
<p>“In reality, you’ve always been in contact with red. Just disguised on the surface as green, but deeply, deeply red. So, what’s the big deal about coming into contact with red now?”</p>
<p>“Ha…?”</p>
<p>Kujou-san didn’t address me, who didn’t understand the meaning of her words, but someone else.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ado-san. Miyashiro-kun has always been near something much more dangerous, hasn’t he?”</p>
<p>“…Senpai, what are you”</p>
<p>“I’m exposing it. Pretending to be a friend while being near you, when in reality, you, Ado-san, have been madly in love with Miyashiro-kun as a man.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>At Kujou-san’s words, Ado-san showed no sign of agitation. It was too perfect, a terribly controlled response.</p>
<p>“Kujou-senpai, now is not the time for such strange misunderstandings.”</p>
<p>“It’s also not the time for you to be blabbering excuses. Shouldn’t you stop? Saying things like let’s go eat, I’m by your side, you’re not alone. Is that what you really want to say to him?”</p>
<p>It’s not, right? She continued in a provoking tone.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you furious?”</p>
<p>“About what…”</p>
<p>“Miyashiro-kun has always been obsessed with the red of another woman, not you.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>At that word, …Ado-san clearly bit her lip.</p>
<p>Kujou-san continued.</p>
<p>“A woman with the highest level of possessiveness like you, it’s impossible for you not to be furious. Your guts must be boiling, always have been since long ago.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it about time you made him understand? If things continue this way, you’ll just lose him forever. Have you thought about what your best move should be?”</p>
<p>Ado-san kept silent, looking down.</p>
<p>“…Kujou-san, Ado-san has always been very kind to me, since forever. But,”</p>
<p>“It appears green to you, doesn’t it? When you ‘see’ it with your eyes. The color of friendship,”</p>
<p>“…You knew?”</p>
<p>Did Ado-san tell her?</p>
<p>“What if all of that was just an act born out of ridiculous effort and obsession?”</p>
<p>“…Ado-san has been with me ever since I became able to ‘see’ colors, since I returned to this town. For three, four years. During that time,”</p>
<p>“Continuously controlling her movements in front of you to the extent that she deceives your eyes, is that realistic? Right, it’s not realistic. …But she’s made it reality, that troublesome woman has.”</p>
<p>It’s ridiculous, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Saying so, Kujou-san laughed complexly. It was a smile that couldn’t easily be understood whether it was about who or what.</p>
<p>“Ridiculous, ridiculous, oh, ridiculous. Hey, …I’ll be quiet now, so please continue.”</p>
<p>“…─”</p>
<p>Taking a step back, Kujou-san then…</p>
<p>And then, Ado-san, who had been silently looking down, …my childhood friend who has always been by my side, lifted her face.</p>
<p>“Su, ”</p>
<p>“Kuuya”</p>
<p>I was at a loss for words. Because there was someone I had never seen before standing there.</p>
<p>It meant that she was no longer anyone I knew.</p>
<p>It also meant that I didn’t know anyone else like her.</p>
<p>“Kuuya”</p>
<p>“…Ah”</p>
<p>As she approached me step by step, I instinctively stepped back.</p>
<p>It was her eyes that made me do so.</p>
<p>They were dim. Deep, bottomless, looking like the entrance to something that would be the end if drawn in.</p>
<p>Who is this? Who exactly is this person?</p>
<p>In my confusion, my body, just seeing her silhouette, blurted out reflexively.</p>
<p>“Su, i, ka…”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She probably smiled, I think. Her eyes narrowed, her mouth split like a crescent moon.</p>
<p>Can people smile like that? Beautifully, adorably, as if committing a sacrilege.</p>
<p>Instinctively focusing my consciousness, I “saw” her.</p>
<p>“…Ha”</p>
<p>The familiar green was nowhere to be found, ──my entire field of vision was dyed in deep red.</p>
<p>“Na, …Ah, …Ah”</p>
<p>The mist rising from the woman approaching me was too dense, covering everything else in the world that should exist.</p>
<p>Only she, the source of it, was clearly visible in the red scenery.</p>
<p>My perspective dropped a level. It seems I’ve fallen to my knees.</p>
<p>What is this, what, what is this? I’ve never seen anything like this before.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>There was a clinking sound.</p>
<p>I felt no sensation of the glass shard I thought I was gripping tightly in my hand. I must have dropped it. Probably, it’s rolling on the floor. Covered in the mist, I can’t see it well.</p>
<p>“Kuuya”</p>
<p>For the third time, she called my name and picked up the glass shard, bringing it back into my world.</p>
<p>Ado-san firmly grasped the sharp, gleaming shard in her hand.</p>
<p>“…Ah, Ah”</p>
<p>In front of me, with my eyes wide open, blood dripped down.</p>
<p>“We match now.”</p>
<p>Without showing any sign of pain, she said that.</p>
<p>Then, Ado-san threw away the glass shard and leaned over me, sitting on the floor.</p>
<p>Her bloodied right hand, the deep red hand of Ado-san, caressed my cheek.</p>
<p>And she asked only one thing.</p>
<p>“Is it cold?”</p>
<p>“…That is”</p>
<p>While being asked, what I thought in my head was simple.</p>
<p>…What exactly had I been seeing until now?</p>
<p>Red is, …it was such a color.</p>
<p>“If you don’t know, please say so. I can provide as much as you want.”</p>
<p>Blood from her hand continued to wet my cheek.</p>
<p>“There’s an infinite amount. Women of Ado are… that’s the kind of beings we are. …Hey.”</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>The words spoken while piercing me with those eyes felt like they were stabbing something inside me.</p>
<p>“…No matter how many years it takes, I will definitely make you mine. Absolutely, definitely.”</p>
<p>The lips that uttered those words, their redness, was strikingly captivating.</p>
<p>“If there’s a red for you, …I hope it’s my red.”</p>
<p>Ado-san pressed her lips against mine.</p>
<p>In the world dyed in red, her red lips were… very hot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p><strong>Kujo’s PoV</strong></p>
<p>I must have accumulated good deeds. It must be so.</p>
<p>Alone, I walk through the path between the groves, the same path I ran down while provoking Ado-san.</p>
<p>Leaving the two on the rooftop, I decided to go back alone.</p>
<p>…Ado-san is like me. Sticky, heavy-hearted, and a coward.</p>
<p>She needed a push to take a step forward… And so did he. That couldn’t come from within them; they were waiting for it to be provided from the outside.</p>
<p>Well, well, well.</p>
<p>Isn’t that good enough!</p>
<p>After all, it’s like this. They settled where they should have.</p>
<p>“Hm…”</p>
<p>My phone vibrates. A message from my sister. She’s prompting me for ice cream.</p>
<p>…After all, I’ve been raised in a warm, happy family. Though I sometimes feel lonely due to differences in values with society, I don’t have traumas like Miyashiro-kun, nor do I have the determination like Ado-san, who has always been by his side.</p>
<p>When Miyashiro-kun is saved, when he is rewarded, it should be Ado-san. No matter how you think about it.</p>
<p>The two of them ended with a happy kiss. …Though it was covered in blood, they must be happy.</p>
<p>Exiting the path, I step onto the main street. I hesitate for a moment about taking the bus but decide against it. I’ll walk.</p>
<p>“It’s not about being flashy, in the first place.”</p>
<p>I mutter to myself. Not about the bus, but about that incomprehensible thing called love.</p>
<p>Getting caught up in feeling smitten or swollen with affection for someone else, losing oneself. That’s not my style.</p>
<p>So it’s fine, and I’m not really bothered.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>“…Ah”</p>
<p>I pass by a rather large, countryside-like game center.</p>
<p>If we came to a place like this together, what games would we play? Would we get excited about winning or not winning prizes, or get a little serious about competitive games?</p>
<p>“…Ah”</p>
<p>I pass by a slightly stylish, nationwide chain cafe.</p>
<p>I know he likes sweet things unexpectedly. I’m not against them either, so would we order different cakes and share them, trying each other’s?</p>
<p>“Ah, …uh”</p>
<p>My home is actually not too far from here. So, I often use this road.</p>
<p>I always made hypothetical plans as I passed by.</p>
<p>Convenient, impatient, and happy, my delusions.</p>
<p>My hopeful, flower field-like hopes, I cherished them.</p>
<p>“Ah, …ah”</p>
<p>I’m such an idiot, really.</p>
<p>Idiot… idiot.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah…ah…──────Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!”</p>
<p>…Idiooottttt!!!!!</p>
<p>Everyone’s an idiot! Everyone in the world! All of them, this and that, everything and everyone is an idiot!</p>
<p>“Uuuuuuuuhhhh…! Aaaaaahhhhh!! Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/00021.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!!</p>
<p>My face is a mess, drenched with tears that keep falling, blurring my vision.</p>
<p>“I, I, I don’t know!! About that!!”</p>
<p>That Miyashiro-kun had such a past, that Ado-san had been bravely facing it and persevering from a long time ago.</p>
<p>How could I know, after all, about something like that.</p>
<p>“I don’t know! I don’t know! …────I l-li-like youuuu!!”</p>
<p>I have no heavy past, no built-up bonds either.</p>
<p>But I like him too. The boy in my class who I met in the art room, who sat next to me, whom I could talk to only once every ten days.</p>
<p>It may not be fate, but it was serious. Even now, I still do.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh!! Uuu, uuu, uuuuuu!! Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!”</p>
<p>So, seeing him kiss another girl was super annoying!</p>
<p>I didn’t want to see it, and I didn’t want to know that they would probably date afterward!</p>
<p>Drivers passing by look shocked at me crying and walking.</p>
<p>How surprised humans are… Wondering what’s wrong with that crazy crying girl, thinking if I’m stupid.</p>
<p>The mean me always watched others being swayed by their emotions, thinking, “Humans are so silly.” I believed I was different.</p>
<p>Ah, but congratulations to me.</p>
<p>I’ve joined the human side.</p>
<p>Hey, everyone, how do you manage to lead a normal life while being so disturbed? It’s amazing… How do you do it, tell me later.</p>
<p>Can I do it?</p>
<p>Right now, I feel like I can’t at all.</p>
<p>“I r-really do!! I l-like youuuu!! Idioootttt!!”</p>
<p>Screaming, I walk.</p>
