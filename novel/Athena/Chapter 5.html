<h2>Chapter 5: 90% of the Factors for Fulfilling Love are Courage and Perseverance</h2>

<h3>■ Kengo Mashima ■</h3>


<p>There is a jinx among the citizens of Kamimura that the Kamimura Grand Festival always turns out to be a rainy festival.</p>
<p>First, let me explain about the Kamimura Grand Festival.</p>
<p>The Kamimura Grand Festival is a traditional festival that has been going on for nearly 400 years since the Kan&#8217;ei era, when Kamimura was a castle town.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The festival lasts for three days from July 6 to 8.</p>
<p>Countless stalls line the streets, and the sight of the many &#8220;Oshagiri&#8221; carts parading through the town is truly a sight to behold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today is July 7, the main day of the festival.</p>
<p>This is the most lively day of the year in the rural town of Kamimura.</p>
<p>&#8230; However, at this time of year, Kamimura is in the middle of the rainy season.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Kamimura Grand Festival is usually held in the midst of dampness and long rains, which is why it is called a &#8220;Rain Festival&#8221; &#8230;</p>
<p>Today, however, the weather was clear and sunny, which was truly unusual.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So unusual, in fact, that the citizens of Kamimura mentioned today&#8217;s weather as if it were a dust storm, and even the main topic of the students was &#8220;Today&#8217;s Weather&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, despite the pleasant blue sky, I was &#8230;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh ──────, Kengo ────!&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was sitting at my desk with my cheek resting when I was startled by the sound of Arakawa&#8217;s voice coming near my ears. I looked and saw Iwasawa next to him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ah &#8230; you guys, what&#8217;s up with the classes? Why are you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about, Mashima-kun, homeroom is over.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was surprised and looked around.</p>
<p>There were only a few &#8230; people around. The hands of the clock pointed to 15:30.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see, it&#8217;s after school already&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I said, and Arakawa and Iwasawa looked at each other suspiciously.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Kengo&#8217;s been in a daze for the past month or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been since the day he went shopping with Takane-san and such&#8230;, hasn&#8217;t it? Even at the gymnastics festival, I felt like your mind wasn&#8217;t in the right place, so what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>When he mentioned Takane Saki&#8217;s name, I felt as if my heart had been directly touched.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8230; nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is the fifth time you&#8217;ve said that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we have the big task of making the rounds at the main festival.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8230;The main festival of the Kamimura Grand Festival usually attracts a large number of people every year. The event attracts not only students from Kamimura High School, but also from other high schools in the prefecture and beyond, such as Nakayama High School and Shimokawa High School&#8230;</p>
<p></p>
<p>As such a large scale event, there is always some kind of trouble every year.</p>
<p>It was also the important task of the Public Discipline Committee members to make sure that our Kamimura High School students were not involved in any problems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful day and there&#8217;s a lot of people here, and I don&#8217;t like the way you&#8217;re acting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re gonna have to give up and talk to us, okay?&#8221;<br>&#8220;No, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is no way I would be willing to talk about such a thing to others, for her own reputation&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>Besides, this is a matter for me to solve alone&#8230;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;I know what Kengo&#8217;s thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kengo&#8217;s too easy to understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…I mean, you can&#8217;t solve your problems by yourself, which is why you&#8217;re in this situation right now, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was painful to hear him say that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a difference between telling everyone and asking for help, so trust us and ask for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah, trust us, we won&#8217;t tell anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Tatsuki tells anyone about this, I&#8217;ll beat him up for you, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Hahaha.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You guys&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Trust and consultation, huh?</p>
<p>Sorry, Saki Takamine, I apologize for any number of things.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Let&#8217;s go somewhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>So let me borrow their help this one time&#8230;</p>
<p>In the darkest recesses of the bicycle parking lot.</p>
<p>As a chorus of cicadas and the clouds watched over us, I finished telling them as accurately as I could how I came to have lunch with Takane Saki on the stairs in front of the rooftop, what happened at &#8216;Leo&#8217; a month ago, and what happened on the way home from there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you serious&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first words of Iwasawa and Arakawa were exactly the same.</p>
<p>They were holding their heads in their hands, starting to say something and then stopping, and letting out a sigh.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Wow──Seriously──&#8230;, it&#8217;s getting really complicated&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saki is amazing&#8230; how did she manage to do that much against Kengo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Just to make sure I&#8217;m not mistaken, this is all my fault, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;U&#8230;h&#8230; What do you think &#8230; Arakawa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Personally, I&#8217;d give Saki-chan the benefit of the doubt, but &#8230; Kengo is Kengo, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what he meant by that, and it didn&#8217;t answer my question, but Iwasawa seemed convinced.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, whatever it was, in the end it was Kengo&#8217;s fault for making a girl cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even I knew that much.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;So? Did you respond to her confession?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!? It&#8217;s been almost a month if I remember correctly! You haven&#8217;t spoken to her since then!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8230; know, too, that I have to say something to her. &#8230; But since that day, she&#8217;s been avoiding me. Saki Takane runs away at the mere sight of my face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know how you feel, Saki-chan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;And even if I were able to talk to her, I wouldn&#8217;t know what to say to her.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s typical of me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I&#8217;m more immature than anyone else, so I can only stay on the straight and narrow.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But once I start talking, the weak self that I have been suppressing in my chest inevitably peeks out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;I am an imperfect human being who cannot make any decisions without dividing myself into right and left, white and black, good and evil. &#8230;That is why I thought I had chosen to do only what was right.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But the truth is, I knew.</p>
<p>This is not a digital world of 0s and 1s, but a more analog world of ambiguity and vagueness.</p>
<p>There is an overabundance of the in-between, the near-black, the gray, and the hypocritical.</p>
<p>I knew that there were more of them than anything else.</p>
<p>I knew that, and I thought it would be an act of arrogance for me, an inexperienced person, to judge for myself.</p>
<p>But still&#8230;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It seems I&#8217;ve made a mistake again, I&#8217;ve hurt Takane Saki deeply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arakawa andIwasawa looked at each other.</p>
<p>And &#8230; Arakawa looked at me and said,</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Well, let&#8217;s put that nitty-gritty stuff aside, shall we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it aside!?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but raise my voice.</p>
<p>I thought I was talking seriously, but I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s put that aside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s important right now is what Kengo wants to do, not what&#8217;s right or wrong, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The two of them let out a sigh at the same time and continued in a very theatrical manner.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm? If I remember correctly, Mashimaa-kun also likes Takane-san&#8230; Oh, my gosh, Arakawa, I think I know the solution to this problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a coincidence, I think I know the solution too&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; I had no idea that there was a magic phrase that could repair your relationship with Takana-san with just that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What should we do? Tatsuki, can I say it? Can I say it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…I&#8217;m sorry, but we can&#8217;t help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t do anything about it. Please tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>After I raised the white flag and there was a short play in which Iwasawa gave up the right to answer to Arakawa, Arakawa pointed his index finger at me and said,</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Kengo hasn&#8217;t said anything to Saki-chan yet, it hasn&#8217;t even started yet.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t said anything to Saki Takane yet&#8230;?</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Really.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those were the very words, the magic words.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Well, that&#8217;s certainly true&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I repeat it over and over again, as if chewing on it.</p>
<p>&#8230;Yes, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>What should I say to her?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Saki Takane had conveyed herself so clearly and with so many words.</p>
<p>I have not conveyed a single word of my own to Saki Takane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I have just told her&#8230; how I feel?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I was going to worry, I would have to start first.</p>
<p>It was as if a ray of light had shone into the darkness with no way out.</p>
<p>Arakawa and Iwasawa are smiling with satisfaction at me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8230; Well, trust and consultation are good!</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Arakawa! Iwasawa! Thank you! When I&#8217;m done making the rounds today, I&#8217;ll do whatever it takes to let Takane Saki know how I feel!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;thank goodness, Mashima-kun is finally back to his usual self.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, let&#8217;s just do a quick patrol today, and then we&#8217;ll go to the stalls and think about how we can create a place for Kengo and Saki to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Arakawa, you&#8217;re right. I&#8217;ll have a candy apple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chocolate bananas.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>While Arakawa and Iwasawa were enjoying laying out their favorite street foods, I was still trembling with the lingering emotion of the event.</p>
<p>&#8230;It was so easy.</p>
<p>I just tell her how I feel without any strings attached.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Such a simple &#8230; thing, I can&#8217;t believe I had a crush on someone for three years and didn&#8217;t realize it &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;Baby castella&#8230; hmm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Both of them responded to my casual mutterings.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; 3 Years? You&#8217;re talking about Saki-chan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; No! I have a lot of questions I want to ask you! First of all, did you two know each other for that long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but raise my eyebrows.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking nonsense? Me, Arakawa, Iwasawa, and Saki Takane were all students at the same middle school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You really don&#8217;t remember &#8230; do you? We were together for three years and you&#8217;re a bunch of heartless people, remember the summer of our third year when I got suspended from school, that girl was Saki Takane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The two people, whose faces looked like pigeons that had been shot by a peashooter, froze for a moment in silence.</p>
<p>Then&#8230;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;Oh ──────────!?!?!?&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>They both screamed in unison.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Takane-san was that girl!? No way!? I don&#8217;t know, but if you ask me, she certainly had a name like that&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, the impression I got was so different! I thought she came from some other middle school&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; You really are a bunch of heartless people, you should at least remember the students in the same school, even if they&#8217;re in different classes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but we were… back then, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back then, we didn&#8217;t care about &#8230;, you know, we didn&#8217;t care about school&#8230;? We were kind of a bunch of hotheads&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you? Don&#8217;t act cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but&#8230;! When I heard this story, it all made sense to me! The reasons why Takane-san likes Mashima-kun and everything else&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever, it&#8217;s time to make the rounds, so let&#8217;s cut the idle chatter and get to the event.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;You&#8217;re being too serious───!&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Iwasawa and Arakawa looked as if they were about to have a heart attack.</p>
<p>As I think I have mentioned before, they are an uneven duo, but they are always in sync with each other at times like this.</p>

<h3 class="nextPage">■ Takane Saki ■</h3>


<p>After school, in my usual empty classroom, I was propped up against my desk like a slug left out in the hot sun.</p>
<p>Let me say in advance that this was not done by the summer of Kamimura.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been exactly three months today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan said, looking up at the wide open bosom of her blouse, which was open to the second button, with a flattened bottom.</p>
<p>It was the last thing I wanted to hear in the world right now, which made me even more of a slug.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;…He hates me.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I said in a muffled voice as I slumped down on my desk.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely, I am hated &#8230; I let my temporary emotions get the better of me &#8230; and I told Mashima-kun, such&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Totally hilarious, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>I was going to confess to him within 3 months, but I never expected that he would hate me within 3 months.</p>
<p>Ah, but perhaps there was a possibility that Mashima-kun disliked me from the very beginning, and that he, being kind, had been dismissive of me in a roundabout way all along, right? Haha.</p>
<p>&#8230;Whatever it was, it was all about that &#8220;Sorry&#8221;.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no face to meet with him anymore…&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>In fact, I have not seen Mashima-kun since the incident.</p>
<p>I cannot even read his MINE messages.</p>
<p>I am afraid of that, too.</p>
<p>&#8230;I am afraid of Mashima-kun&#8217;s reaction.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid of being clearly rejected.</p>
<p>But to be spoken to with kind words ── I am even more afraid.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh..s…s…&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I began to sob quietly, but Yuka, perhaps out of concern, didn&#8217;t say anything.</p>
<p>Because I, a beginner in the art of romance, had been so arrogant as to ignore the teachings of Imamote, I had incurred the wrath of the Great Goddess Mori.</p>
<p>When I realized this, it was too late to change things.</p>
<p>Even in Imamote, as I expected, there was no instruction on how to approach a person who dislikes you.</p>
<p>Even Mori-sensei, in her wisdom, would not be able to handle a situation like this.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh, ugh…, I want to go back to 3 months ago&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I want to go back to those days when I could still talk to Mashima-kun normally and start all over again. Then at least things wouldn&#8217;t be worse than they are now&#8230;</p>
<p>I was mentally exhausted to the point of thinking about such an escape from reality.</p>
<p>&#8212; That&#8217;s when it happened.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me for disturbing you~.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sliding door of the empty classroom was opened.</p>
<p>That voice&#8230;</p>
<p>I wiped my tears with the sleeve of my blouse and looked up.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;… Hirabayashi-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there you are after all. I&#8217;ve been looking for you for a while.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>My Imamote companion whom I met in the infirmary &#8211; Keiko Hirabayashi-san of Class 2A, came into the classroom looking more cheerful than before.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s been a while, is something wrong &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here to see Takane-san, is everything alright now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah──&#8230;Keiko, right? We&#8217;re in the same class &#8230;, but right now it&#8217;s a little &#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan said so and glanced at me.</p>
<p>What can I say, Yuka-chan is kind to me, so I like her.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;No, it&#8217;s fine, Hirabayashi-san is my Imamote friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Imamote&#8230;, yes Imamote, we are Imamote friends, aren&#8217;t we? &#8230;I have a present for you today, my Imamote friend, Takane-san&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan tilted her head, &#8220;Imamote friends &#8230;?&#8221; But Hirabayashi-san paid no attention and pulled out two books from a bag she was carrying in her hand.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then&#8230;! Here, these are for you, and since we&#8217;re on a roll, here&#8217;s one for you, too.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Hirabayashi-san offers the books to me and Yuka-chan one at a time.</p>
<p>What is &#8230;?</p>
<p>I looked at the cover of the book I received.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I was astonished.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I-Imamote!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>And not just any Imamote.</p>
<p>This is &#8230; Mori-sensei&#8217;s latest work!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Become popular now! Super Love Psychology Course 2&#8217; !?!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H-how…&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I am a constant checker of Mori-sensei&#8217;s social media.</p>
<p>Of course I knew about the Imamote sequel, &#8230; but this should not have been released yet!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did Hirabayashi-san get this!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>When I asked in a trembling voice, Hirabayashi-san answered matter-of-factly.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;The sample copies have just been printed and I&#8217;m going around handing them out to everyone I know! It&#8217;s called a book offering! I&#8217;m so happy that you two were so enthusiastic about reading my book, so I&#8217;m doing a special reader giveaway!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;<br />&#8220;Hah?&#8221;<br />&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>A strange atmosphere flowed between the three of us. Or rather, that way of speaking by Hirabayashi-san, I never thought &#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that…? Didn&#8217;t I tell you? I&#8217;m Mori, the romance author&#8230; See, my name is Keiko, right? If you want to mask the Ki, you get&#8230; Mori.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;,</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;,</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Eh?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;Whaaaaat!?!?&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>Screaming.</p>
<p>Yuka-chan and I both had no choice but to scream before the shocking revelation.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hirabayashi-san is Mori-sensei!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That means you wrote this book!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right, but &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yes, but &#8230;!</p>
<p>Romance author!?</p>
<p>A strong advocate. What about the strongest, invincible, and popular person, who is well versed in all studies, ancient and modern, east and west!?</p>
<p>Who is the Great Goddess Mori!?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!? Could it be that Hirabayashi-san is in fact the most powerful playgirl who is very popular with the guys with the techniques she has cultivated!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A great athlete is not a great coach, and vice versa, of course. By Mori── I&#8217;m sorry to say that I&#8217;ve never held hands with a boy. I&#8217;ve been on the internet for a while now, and I&#8217;ve been giving advice to a lot of people about relationships, haven&#8217;t you seen the opening notice&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>At this very moment, everything I believed in came crashing down with a rattle, and I collapsed again.</p>
<p>This is exactly what it means to be openmouthed&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no&#8230;, don&#8217;t tell me that&#8230; Mori-sensei does not know anything &#8230; about Love Psychology?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaaahhhh! Saki Saki is going to break!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan shook my shoulder in a panic, but I may not be able to get back on my feet &#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your fault! &#8230; Oh, no, wait a minute! Saki Saki! Hey! Come back to me, quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;───Think about it the other way around! Right now, you&#8217;ve got your dream teacher Mori right in front of you! If that&#8217;s the case, why don&#8217;t you ask her directly for advice about your love life? Maybe she has some secret techniques!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ah!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I was returned to reality in an instant.</p>
<p>Yes, &#8230;Yuka-chan is absolutely right!</p>
<p>Even if Mori-sensei&#8217;s true identity is Hirabayashi-san, it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that the person standing in front of me now is Mori, the romance author I have admired for a long time!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg you, Great Goddess Mori! Please help me, a lowly person like myself, with love advice and teach me how to make romance work for me!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, Saki Saki&#8217;s down on her knees&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And here&#8217;s a little light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so I can give you accurate advice, please tell me everything from your first meeting with Mashima-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My first meeting with Mashima-kun&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>The time when Mashima-kun and I first met.</p>
<p>Then, inevitably, I have to talk about my past, which I wanted to turn away from.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Just remembering those days makes my heart feel crushed.</p>
<p>I did not want to remember if I could.</p>
<p>But &#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will talk, please.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>This is much better than ending my relationship with Mashima-kun like this.</p>
<p>I began to slowly speak.</p>
<p>Those were the days, back then, when I was still around Tokyo.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">■■■■</h4>

<p>Saki Takane, 15 years old, in her third year of junior high school.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t born and raised in a particularly wealthy family, and the only reason I started attending Kamimura City&#8217;s Kamimura Higashi Middle School was that it was conveniently close to my home.</p>
<p>However, this place had a slightly&#8230; okay, maybe more than slightly, bad reputation for its safety.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it, that baldy! Acting all high and mighty just because he can afford to eat out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>One day, as I walked down the hallway, I heard a furious voice and the sound of something being kicked from behind. I immediately hid behind something.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Peering from my hiding spot, I saw two male students in disheveled uniforms exiting the staff room. The tall one was Kawariku Arakawa, and the shorter one was Tatsuki Iwasawa.</p>
<p>They were infamous for all the wrong reasons even at Kamimura Higashi Middle School, and today seemed to be particularly irritable.</p>
<p>That noise earlier must have been the sound of Iwasawa kicking the staff room door.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Tatsuki, stop it! I don&#8217;t want my parents being contacted again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it! Should I report that bald guy to the PTA for what he did to the summer intern last year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…Huh!? Seriously!? That glasses guy? The busty college student?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, seriously! Don&#8217;t underestimate my network&#8230; Oh, I&#8217;m so annoyed that I&#8217;ll spill the beans now! The staff room everyone&#8230;! Class B&#8217;s homeroom teacher, Nuno-san, is having an affair with the intern!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa, you idiot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hahaha&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Before the staff room door opened with a red-faced Nuno-san, the two of them burst into laughter and dashed down the hallway. I watched their antics from the shadows at the hallway&#8217;s corner.</p>
<p>…Well, that&#8217;s the extent of the security issue here.</p>
<p>Other incidents included broken windows, chairs falling from upper floors, and students freely roaming the hallways during class, among others.</p>
<p>This was the everyday life at our Kamimura City&#8217;s Higashi Middle School.</p>
</p>
<p>I should clarify from the beginning that it was just a slightly higher proportion of such people, not everyone in Higashi Middle School.</p>
<p>As expected, I was one of the students who didn&#8217;t fit that description.</p>
<p>And for those who didn&#8217;t fit, there was an important mission: ── figuring out how to survive these three years.</p>
</p>
<p>It was May, after school.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Saki, you&#8217;re late&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I was suddenly called over by my classmates and ran to the back of the school building. Trying to catch my breath.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;S-Sorry&#8230; I got stopped by a teacher.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I forced a smile, not a genuine one, not a natural one, not a smile of friendship. It was just a strained, pathetic smile.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ignore the teacher~, Saki. Our friendship is more important, right~? And I always tell you to leave when I call, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Ai-chan, that&#8217;s harassment!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saki, you should apologize again. Ai-chan gets angry so easily!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>They were teasing me, and I went along with it.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ehehe&#8230;Ai-chan, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Among the many survival strategies, I had chosen this &#8220;smile”.</p>
<p> It was like a flag of total surrender, where I didn&#8217;t assert anything, didn&#8217;t stand out, and simply conveyed that I had no hostile intentions with this smile.</p>
<p>It was my way of navigating through as an inconspicuous middle school girl, neither an asset nor a liability.</p>
<p>They weren&#8217;t monsters, either. If I raised this white flag, they would&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Sure, I might get teased a little, but it wouldn&#8217;t be that bad.</p>
<p>They would even let me into their group.</p>
</p>
<p>Today, Ai-chan invited me to the back of the school building, saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to do something fun.&#8221; But what could be so fun?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8211;Oh, Saki-chan&#8217;s here?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>A too-familiar male voice came from behind, making me flinch.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t realize it until just now, but he&#8217;s definitely&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You, the one from Class A, Haruto Miyanoshita, right?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I hardly knew any boys, or rather, I didn&#8217;t know any at all. However, I knew him.</p>
</p>
<p>Haruto Miyanoshita, 3rd-year Class A.</p>
<p>Probably because he consistently ranked at the top of the regular exams, was the ace of the soccer team, and, not to mention, had good looks.</p>
<p>He had been a frequent topic of conversation among the girls.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh? Saki-chan knows me? I&#8217;m thrilled! Let&#8217;s take a commemorative photo.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Haruto suddenly pointed his smartphone&#8217;s camera at my face and took a snap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, uh&#8230;photo&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it nice? This smartphone has a super high-quality dual-camera, wireless charging capability&#8230; and it&#8217;s in an elegant champagne gold color!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I actually wanted him to delete the photo…</p>
<p>But that wasn&#8217;t my character. I simply put on that &#8220;smile&#8221; again to play it cool.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Haruto, enough with the smartphone show-off, okay? I brought it just like you told me.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Maybe Ai-chan didn&#8217;t like the situation where Haruto was paying attention to me.</p>
<p>She said it in a sweet voice.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I think I heard somewhere that Ai-chan liked Miyanoshita-kun.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my bad, my bad. Let&#8217;s get started then. It would be a hassle if a teacher comes by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously, be careful! I stole it from my brother. Um&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Saying that, Ai-chan rummaged through her enamel bag.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;I had actually sensed it faintly for a while now.</p>
<p>In this deserted corner of the school building, away from the teacher&#8217;s gaze, they were going to do something &#8220;fun”.</p>
<p>I had sensed it but lacked the courage to run away.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Each person gets one, no more, or we&#8217;ll get caught.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Ai-chan took out a small paper box about the size of a palm.</p>
<p>Even I could tell it wasn&#8217;t a box of snacks.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Saki, hold onto this. I&#8217;ll look for the lighter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, but this is, well&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quickly.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Ai-chan&#8217;s forceful words left me no choice.</p>
<p>Feeling pathetic, submissive, and cowardly, I reluctantly replied,</p>
<p>&#8220;…Okay.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Even though what Ai-chan handed me was just a cardboard box, touching it made me feel like I had become a criminal in an instant.</p>
<p>I shivered all over, wanting desperately to let go of it and escape back to my usual daily life.</p>
<p>But my body wouldn&#8217;t move.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, found it!&#8230; Yep, it lights up. Saki, give one to everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I knew very well that this was a bad thing to do, but&#8230;</p>
<p>I was scared, terribly scared.</p>
<p>If I dared to oppose Ai-chan, my position would be&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing? Hurry up.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>With the lighter in hand, Ai-chan urged me on.</p>
<p>I forced my usual submissive smile&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Um&#8230; Can&#8217;t we stop this?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>──For the first time, I rebelled against Ai-chan.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Huh?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Ai-chan&#8217;s voice grew low and menacing.</p>
<p>Trembling with fear, my already strained smile grew even more forced, but I continued.</p>
</p>
<p>“Um…haha, I have a tendency to have shortness of breath, and, uh, besides, I&#8217;ve heard that things like this are bad for your health&#8230; and for your beauty&#8230; and, you know, it&#8217;s all harm and no benefit. And, if, by any chance, a teacher finds out about this in such a place&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? Hey Ai-chan? That&#8217;s different from what I heard, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mi&#8230; Miyanoshita-kun, even though you have good grades&#8230; doing something like this could hurt your recommendations, couldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Saki, give it  quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S-should we stop&#8230;? Right&#8230;? I&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“──Saki!”</p>
</p>
<p>Ai-chan&#8217;s furious voice left me paralyzed with fear.</p>
<p>&#8212;And then, it happened.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>From outside my field of vision, something large and rod-like flew towards us.</p>
<p>It rotated violently as it passed between me and Ai-chan.</p>
</p>
<p>Gshaaaaaaaa.</p>
</p>
<p>With a deafening crash, it shattered one of the school building&#8217;s windows.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What the&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Everyone was suddenly speechless and frozen by this unexpected event.</p>
<p>Peering from beyond the shattered glass was a girl in gym clothes, the one who had thrown the tennis racket.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear, it slipped right out of my hand.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>She said this with a nonchalant tone as Ai-chan was the first to regain her composure.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8230;! What the h*ll are you doing, you almost&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;─Senseeeeiiii! I&#8217;m soooorry! I was practicing hitting the wall with my racket, and it just slipped and broke the window!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the&#8230;! You idiot!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Although Ai-chan was visibly irritated, the girl&#8217;s unexpectedly loud voice left even her surprised.</p>
<p>Ai-chan&#8217;s face contorted in frustration, but she eventually snatched the paper box from my hand.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tsk&#8230; Let&#8217;s go, everyone!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>She led the group of girls, including Miyanoshita-kun, as they hurriedly fled the scene.</p>
</p>
<p>And so, there I was and the shattered window glass&#8230;</p>
<p>And only the petite girl, who I didn’t even know the name of, left behind.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to run away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My&#8230; My legs gave out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>She chuckled innocently, her laughter contrasting with the recent window-shattering event.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re Saki Takane, right? You&#8217;re always hanging around that brat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8230; brat?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I had never heard anyone refer to Ai-chan in such a way.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t imagine saying such a thing about Ai-chan, even when she wasn&#8217;t around.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of always giggling like a fool, you should express your own opinions sometimes. I can&#8217;t go around breaking glass all the time, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you&#8230; help me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really. I was looking for a ball I accidentally hit out of the court, and my racket just happened to slip.&#8221;</p>
<p>“It just happened, heh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>She leaned in closer and peered into my face.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what is it&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…You look pretty cute when you smile normally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, I needed a partner in crime.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>She said, pointing at the shattered window, her expression mischievous.</p>
</p>
<p>“&#8212;I&#8217;m Yuka Senami from the Soft Tennis Club. Let&#8217;s go apologize to the teacher together, Nihihi.”</p>
</p>
<p>And that’s how, Yuka-chan and I became friends in the short time it took for the teacher to rush in, face bright red.</p>
</p>
<p>Since becoming close with Yuka-chan, for some reason, Ai-chan&#8217;s group never bothered me again.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because Ai-chan got caught stealing her brother&#8217;s property right after, or perhaps it was because Yuka-chan and I had earned a certain level of respect among the troublemakers.</p>
</p>
<p>Various reasons crossed my mind, but one thing was certain: this was the most peaceful time I had during my three years in middle school.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;Until that day.</p>
</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>It was the midst of the rainy season in Kamimura, where the constant drizzle made my short-sleeved blouse stick uncomfortably to my skin.</p>
<p>I remember this particular after-school moment vividly.</p>
<p>I was frozen in front of my shoe locker when Yuka-chan approached.</p>
</p>
<p>“──Oh, Saki Saki hasn’t gone home yet?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I hurriedly hid what I was holding behind my back as she approached.</p>
<p>It was Yuka-chan who called out to me.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;? What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh? Oh, um, Yuka-chan, what are you doing here!? Isn&#8217;t it time for your club activities1?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Club activities~? Saki Saki, you&#8217;re such a funny one. What month do you think it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230; It&#8217;s July.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last July of our middle school life, right? Our small and weak tennis club has long been eliminated from the district qualifiers. The third-year students have all retired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same for most clubs. There aren&#8217;t any clubs with potential anyway, except maybe the karate club. They&#8217;re going to the national tournament next month&#8230; Anyway, speaking of rumors, look who&#8217;s coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa.”</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan leaned towards me and pointed to one of the male students coming from across the hallway.</p>
<p>&#8230;He seemed like a rather intimidating person.</p>
<p>Was he in a bad mood, perhaps? He furrowed his brow and glared ahead as he passed by.</p>
<p>Was that &#8230;.?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;…Who is that?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!? You don&#8217;t know, Saki Saki!? He&#8217;s engo Mashima, the captain of the karate club!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Seeing my reaction, Yuka-chan let out a sigh.</p>
</p>
<p>“Kengo Mashima, he&#8217;s like a famous guy around here. To put it simply, he&#8217;s a bit of an oddball, but he&#8217;s unbelievably skilled in karate. He&#8217;s the one who led our weak karate club to the national level for the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, he&#8217;s such an amazing person, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saki Saki, you should try to be more interested in other people&#8230; and maybe make some friends besides me. Seriously, what will you do in high school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to the same high school as you, Yuka-chan, so it&#8217;ll be fine! Ehehe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ehehe isn&#8217;t going to cut it.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Ehehe&#8230; Indeed.</p>
<p>If Yuka-chan was with me, a fun high school life was practically guaranteed.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s get going, shall we? They say the rain will get heavier in the evening&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, but I just remembered I have something to do for a teacher. I need to go to the staff room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, really? Are you sure you&#8217;ll be okay? Do you want me to come with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, it&#8217;s okay! Please go ahead without me, Yuka-chan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright then, good luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you! Goodbye!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to Yuuka-chan, I didn&#8217;t head towards the staff room as I had claimed.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry, Yuka-chan. This was the first lie I had ever told.</p>
</p>
<p>Instead, I went to the third floor, to the classroom of Class A.</p>
<p>As expected, by this time of day, there was no one else in the classroom.</p>
<p>&#8230;Except for him.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;──Oh, Saki-chan, you&#8217;re here! Let&#8217;s take a commemorative photo.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>An empty classroom.</p>
<p>He was the only one sitting at a desk. He immediately snapped a picture with his smartphone when he saw me.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Miyanoshita, it&#8217;s you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You remembered me? I&#8217;m so happy~.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Haruto Miyanoshita.</p>
<p>Since the incident with Ai-chan, we hadn&#8217;t had a chance to exchange words, but he spoke as if we were old friends.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;To be honest, I didn&#8217;t have a very good impression of him.</p>
<p>I really didn&#8217;t want to see his face. But&#8230; I forced a humble smile.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8230; there was a letter in my shoe locker&#8230; What was this important matter?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>──After school, about an important matter in Class 3A, come alone &#8211; Haruto Miyanoshita.</p>
</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the simple letter, just a folded loose leaf, said.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it was an important matter, an important matter.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Haruto Miyanoshita jumped down from his desk and approached me.</p>
<p>I put on a strained smile and prepared myself.</p>
<p>If necessary, I was ready to raise my voice.</p>
</p>
<p>“──Sorry about the other day. I wanted to apologize to you directly, Saki-chan.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>……Eh?</p>
<p>I was completely taken aback by the turn of events, which was completely different from what I had expected.</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-san was bowing his head to me.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really regret what happened the other day. I think I scared you a lot, Saki-chan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, w-well&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, I&#8217;d never done anything like that before. I just did something stupid because I really wanted to get to know Takane-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t even speak in response to this unexpected turn of events.</p>
<p>W-Wait a minute!</p>
<p>Apology is fine, but getting to know me?</p>
<p>Could it be&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;──Saki Takamine, I&#8217;ve liked you for a long time. Would you go out with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>A&#8230;</p>
<p>…Confession?</p>
</p>
<p>I felt a shock as if lightning had struck my brain.</p>
<p>Confession, confession, confession!</p>
</p>
<p>I had always thought I would never experience such an event, but it was happening right here and now!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Umm, w-wait a minute. I mean, it&#8217;s so sudden&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saki-chan, I was serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I was taken aback by Miyanoshita&#8217;s earnest gaze.</p>
<p>W-What should I do!?</p>
<p>It seemed that Miyanoshita was genuinely remorseful about what had happened before.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">■■■■</h4>


<p>He&#8217;s just asked me out&#8230;!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;W-Well, I&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;Of course, I&#8217;m happy about his feelings.</p>
<p>He confessed with such sincerity, and I do feel the temptation to respond in kind.</p>
<p>But&#8230;</p>
<p>I stopped forcing a smile and looked directly into his eyes.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I conveyed my words.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Huh?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it means to like someone like that yet. I&#8217;m really sorry for turning down your confession, even though you were so sincere&#8230; but I can&#8217;t do it right now. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun also expressed his feelings sincerely.</p>
<p>So, I should respond with honest words, free from lies.</p>
</p>
<p>“…I see, haa.”</p>
</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun lowered his head.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;ve never experienced heartbreak, but I&#8217;ve heard that it&#8217;s painful.</p>
<p>I hesitated about what to say, as various thoughts swirled in my mind. I could only stare at him with a serious expression.</p>
</p>
<p>“Huh────, I see, yeah&#8230;”</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun seemed to acknowledge something through multiple nods, and then he muttered,</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;…I probably seemed arrogant because I made the first move, even though I&#8217;m an introvert. Trying to reach for the unreachable flower, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…Eh?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>What&#8217;s happening right now&#8230;?</p>
</p>
<p>Before I could confirm it, Miyanoshita-kun operated his smartphone and showed it to me.</p>
<p>As I peered at the screen, my eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>──Why? The photo on the screen was from that time when I held the &#8220;box&#8221; and appealed to everyone.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;T-This&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;──I took it back then. With a dual camera, the picture quality is quite good, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>And at that moment, I finally realized.</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun was not lowering his head out of shock. He was hiding his own anger.</p>
</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, your face is cute, and it&#8217;s more convenient this way. I was gentle at first, thinking it would work, but I never expected to be rejected. I&#8217;ve never been rejected by a girl before, damn it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That photo&#8230; what do you intend to do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm? It&#8217;s a nice photo, so I guess I should show it off to everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I-but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think? Will they believe it when they see this photo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kamimura High School will probably be out of reach for you. Your parents will be sad too.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>With his words, my veins turned to ice throughout my body.</p>
<p>My mind was overwhelmed by fear, and I felt like I was on the verge of tears.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as long as you keep listening to me, I won&#8217;t do anything. Got it?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun patted my trembling shoulder.</p>
</p>
<p>His hand, full of bones and protruding veins, was terrifying to me, and I couldn&#8217;t hold back the tears streaming down my face.</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun, seeing me like this, genuinely smiled with pleasure.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? There&#8217;s no need to cry. Well, let&#8217;s take a commemorative photo for now, a selfie. Let&#8217;s do a two-shot.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>He whispered in a sadistic tone, and my mind went completely blank.</p>
<p>I wanted to say something, but all that came out were sobs.</p>
<p>Amid my jumbled thoughts, one idea took shape within me.</p>
<p>──Someone&#8230;</p>
<p>Help me&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry; I&#8217;ll take the photo with an app that can make you look better. Come on, Saki-chan, be conscious of your best angle. I&#8217;m taking it now.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun said that much and then&#8230; suddenly, everything went quiet.</p>
<p>The usual camera shutter sound didn&#8217;t come, no matter how much time passed.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I raised my tear-streaked face and looked at Miyanoshita-kun.</p>
<p>There was no smartphone in his hand, and his expression was filled with surprise.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Before practice, my contact lens came off&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>The voice that spoke was neither Miyanoshita-kun&#8217;s nor mine.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I went back to the classroom to get a spare, but I couldn&#8217;t even find that.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>When I turned in the direction of the voice, a male student was standing right behind us.</p>
<p>He had deep wrinkles between his brows and, for some reason, had apparently taken Miyanoshita-kun&#8217;s smartphone and was intently peering at it.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;By the way, Takane Saki, what&#8217;s on this smartphone?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>──Kengo Mashima was standing there.</p>


<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CyH8EeUv0aGL62EgD9sAtVEnc4JcLjYBj0ZvROtrp3aAfyPzJTnNzC5T34qWXAcIUxrauTNwsl061ekMuRlSq4irX5rAquggMbiVyAoOUnRYLAqTxrftCEIPXAp9XsNJP2kV83QYLbyz99pdKYCAFCI" width="624" height="893"></p>


<p>&#8220;Huh? That&#8217;s my latest model smartphone&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun, who had been frozen when his smartphone was suddenly stolen, began to comprehend the situation.</p>
<p>Why is he here? How does he know my name?</p>
<p>Such inconsequential questions seemed to vanish into thin air…</p>
<p>I screamed.</p>
</p>
<p>“──Please help me!!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Without asking for reasons, he said just that and opened the classroom window. With the casualness of playing with a frisbee, he tossed Miyanoshita-kun&#8217;s latest model smartphone out of the third-floor window.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaaaahhhhhh ─────!!!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>The sound of Miyanoshita-kun&#8217;s latest model smartphone smashing into pieces as it hit the flowerbed on the first-floor balcony was drowned out by the rain, and it didn&#8217;t reach us…</p>
</p>
<p>However, the owner&#8217;s piercing scream cut through even the sound of the heavy rain, echoing throughout the entire school building.</p>
</p>
<p>I could only stand there, completely stunned.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8230; What the h*ll are you doing?! Why did you throw the phone out of the window!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did it intentionally, I apologize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apologize my a*s! That thing doesn&#8217;t even have waterproofing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about we exchange it with my phone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me! It&#8217;s not even a smartphone, it’s a flip phone!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Furious, Miyanoshita-kun slammed Mashima-kun&#8217;s flip phone onto the floor, but he just shrugged it off.</p>
</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun then unleashed a barrage of insults, occasionally resorting to violent threats, but Mashima-kun, of all people, remained unfazed, maintaining a stoic composure.</p>
<p>His demeanor, as Yuka-chan had put it, was indeed quite peculiar.</p>
<p>And for some reason, it grabbed my heart and wouldn&#8217;t let go.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;──Woah! Who&#8217;s the idiot who threw the phone out the window!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>While they were doing this, they must have heard the commotion.</p>
<p>Apparently having heard the commotion, my class B teacher, Nuno-san, stormed into the classroom with his perfectly rolled head, veins popping out all over.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had been in the middle of his usual sermon because Arakawa-kun and Iwasawa-kun were there too.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Baldy, can we go home already?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that being scolded too much during puberty can lead to baldness?&#8221;</p>
<p>“You guys are hopeless! Wait there! I&#8217;ll scold you later!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Infidelity bald…”</p>
<p>&#8220;Additional scolding!! Don&#8217;t you dare move from there!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Nuno-san was approaching us with a somewhat angry demeanor (without any ulterior motives), veins popping out of his head.</p>
</p>
<p>Even Miyanoshita-kun, who was usually composed, seemed unable to hide his agitation. However, to my surprise, even at this point, Mashima-kun remained unruffled!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me concisely what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I intentionally threw Haruto Miyanoshita&#8217;s smartphone out of the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>You&#8217;re confessing so confidently!?</p>
<p>Even Miyanoshita-kun and I froze at his overly honest response, but I guess he immediately thought it was convenient.</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun&#8217;s mouth curled into a grin as he agreed with Mashima-kun.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! He&#8217;s the one! He suddenly snatched my phone and threw it out of the window! And he intended to break it from the beginning!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!? Really, Mashima!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes, I apologize. I need to correct my previous statement. I intentionally seized Haruto Miyanoshita&#8217;s smartphone and threw it out of the window with the clear intent of destroying it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Well, so honest that even Nuno-san is confused!?</p>
<p>There should have been some lines or something to corner the culprit in the story, but now, Mashima-kun was confessing everything, and Sensei doesn&#8217;t know what to do!?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; Um, what should we do? Should we contact your parents for now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sen-Sensei. Pull yourself together! This guy still has something he&#8217;s hiding!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, really? What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>“This guy, even though I and Saki-chan were just talking in the classroom, suddenly started picking a fight with me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, that&#8217;s false.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haruto Miyanoshita&#8217;s claim that he was just talking to her is not appropriate. He was trying to blackmail her by using an artificially cropped photo. He deliberately used a manipulated photo and threatened her. While it may be overstepping my bounds, this could potentially be classified as extortion or coercion. There is a high possibility that it would be a crime.”</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Huh?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>This time, Nuno-sensei stared fiercely at Miyanoshita-kun.</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun, on the other hand, suddenly panicked.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Th-That&#8217;s nonsense! He&#8217;s just making things up! There was no reason for him to break my phone&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Falsehood. While I admit that I made a hasty decision to take those measures to stop him after witnessing a criminal act, the reasons are as I mentioned earlier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Huh?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Nuno-sensei regained his usual composure and started to display small blue veins on his forehead.</p>
<p>That keen eye, aimed at punishing wrongdoers, was indeed directed at Miyanoshita-kun.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;W-Why do you believe everything he says?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensei, Mashima-kun doesn&#8217;t seem to be lying&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t that subjective? Eh! What he&#8217;s saying is a false accusation!&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as he sensed he was in a disadvantageous position, Miyanoshita-kun became flustered.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;For one thing, there&#8217;s no evidence to support what he&#8217;s saying, is there? After all, he&#8217;s the one who broke my phone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is certainly&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a valid point.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Why is Mashima-kun also agreeing with him&#8230;? This was not the time to ask, but Nuno-sensei had stopped his spear.</p>
<p>In reality, what Miyanoshita-kun was saying was correct, and Nuno-sensei seemed unsure about his decision&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;So, what do you say, Takane? Is what Mashima is saying true?&#8221;<br />&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Nuno-sensei asked me.</p>
<p>y heart leaped with anxiety.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I, um, well&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>──What Mashima-kun said is true.</p>
<p>──I was threatened by Miyanoshita-kun.</p>
<p>──Mashima-kun helped me.</p>
</p>
<p>That was all I had to say.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Mashima&#8230;kun…&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>My throat tightened up and I couldn&#8217;t get the words out.</p>
<p>I knew it in my head, but my body was too scared to listen to me.</p>
<p>And with Miyanoshita-kun glaring at me with a terrifying look right there&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Takane, calm down and say it slowly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Me, that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m &#8230; pathetic.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not worthy.</p>
<p>My heart continued to tighten with these feelings.</p>
<p>Why couldn&#8217;t I help Mashima-kun immediately, when he had helped me?</p>
<p>Mashima-kun spoke so boldly, but why couldn&#8217;t I utter a single word of truth?</p>
<p>Mashima-kun had so much courage, but why couldn&#8217;t I find it in myself?</p>
<p>If I were Mashima-kun, this would never have happened.</p>
</p>
<p>“Mashima-kun…helped me──!”</p>
<p>“──It&#8217;s all nonsense!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Despite my determination, my words were drowned out by Miyanoshita-kun&#8217;s raised voice.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Miyanoshita, sensei is trying to talk to Takane&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s useless! Everything they&#8217;re saying is a lie from beginning to end!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Falsehood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not true! You guys are the ones who lie! That&#8217;s about it! It&#8217;s suspicious that you&#8217;re so desperate!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you stop, Miyanoshita?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Nuno-sensei warned Miyanoshita-kun, but his anger was unstoppable. His anger was directed at me.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she&#8217;s hiding something too, and that&#8217;s why she&#8217;s trying to cover it up, right!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>In the face of such unreasonable circumstances and fear, my throat tightened once more, and I couldn&#8217;t find the words to speak.</p>
<p>Despite that, tears continued to flow freely.</p>
</p>
<p>See! She&#8217;s trying to cry and deceive us! Women are so sly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miyanoshita!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Why, oh why did things turn out this way?</p>
<p>Was it because I became friends with Ai-chan?</p>
<p>Was it because I didn&#8217;t express my opinions?</p>
<p>Was it because I lacked the courage?</p>
<p>In any case, it was undoubtedly my fault.</p>
</p>
<p>Unable to contain my emotions any longer, tears streamed down my face without restraint, and&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you always smirk! It&#8217;s so annoying! You&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Before Miyanoshita-kun could finish his insult, something unexpected happened. Both Nuno-sensei and the students watching from the corner of the classroom, Arakawa and Iwasawa, widened their eyes.</p>
</p>
<p>Why? Because Mashima-kun punched Miyanoshita-kun in the face…</p>
<p>──With all his might.</p>
</p>
<p>Miyanoshita-kun, who had been struck, didn&#8217;t make a sound.</p>
<p>Flying in a circular pattern,</p>
<p>Involving two or three of his desks,</p>
<p>He made such a loud noise that it seemed like it would break the classroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not a single one of us could utter a word. It was as if time had come to a standstill, and we all forgot to breathe.</p>
<p>We simply stared at Miyanoshita-kun, who had collapsed on the floor.</p>
</p>
<p>Our gazes gradually converged on Mashima-kun, who had gathered himself and&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It was intentional. It&#8217;s highly likely to fall under the category of assault.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>He said it confidently.</p>
<p> Arakawa-kun and Iwasawa-kun murmured in unison, &#8220;So cool&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Thank you for the past three years.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I could hear Mashima-kun&#8217;s voice from inside the faculty room.</p>
<p>…It seemed the discussion had concluded.</p>
</p>
<p>Suppressing my timid emotions, I clenched the hem of my skirt, and suddenly, the faculty room door swung open.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mashima-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;? Ah, Takane Saki.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Majima-kun noticed me standing outside the faculty room, and he approached as if nothing had happened.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up? Do you need something from me?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Honestly, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if he held some resentment against me after all that. But he appeared astonishingly composed.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;…I heard you got suspended for a while, and you were forced to quit the club&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not appropriate to say that I was forced to quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh…?&#8221;</p>
<p>“In fact, the principal tried to persuade me to stay. The Middle School karate club is gaining attention, even from the mayor of Kamimura City. So they wanted to handle this matter discreetly. But I submitted my resignation letter a while ago.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>“W-why!?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? Because someone aspiring to martial arts resorted to violence. At that point, I lost my qualifications.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Why&#8230; It&#8217;s strange how he&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p>Such an amazing thing, can you say it as if it&#8217;s a matter of course?</p>
<p>In those sincere eyes and words, there is no deception.</p>
<p>In his presence, I feel incredibly small and insignificant.</p>
</p>
<p>“…I&#8217;m truly sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you apologizing? I was the one who made a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But…, you helped me, Mashima-kun&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my judgment was wrong. But at that time, I couldn&#8217;t think of any other way to silence Miyanoshita. It&#8217;s my own immaturity; I&#8217;ve let everyone down, the club advisor, our classmates, the club members, my sister, and you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, it&#8217;s not like&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even Haruto Miyanoshita.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…Eh?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>…Why.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he wasn&#8217;t such a bad guy if I told him properly, but I resorted to violence. It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m immature. There must have been a better way.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Why…?</p>
<p>Why, you&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you defending someone like him?&#8221;</p>
<p>“──If you live long enough, everyone has moments when they become unlikable.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;Those words.</p>
<p>More than any words I&#8217;ve heard before, they were kind.</p>
<p>And&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must change too, to avoid making such mistakes again.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;Above all, those words were self-punishing.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you so hard on yourself?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Before I could think it through, the words were out of my mouth.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you did&#8230; may have been wrong in the eyes of the world, but at least you saved me.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will change too, I&#8217;ll change from the timid person I am now, so isn&#8217;t it okay, at least for now?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>“──Please allow me to say &#8216;Thank you’ to you right now!!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;For the first time in my life, it felt like I had put my feelings into words.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun looked at me for a brief moment, his eyes widened in surprise, … but then he spoke in a somewhat sad voice.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;…If, by any chance, you&#8217;re grateful to me, please, forget about me now. …If we meet again, if I&#8217;ve become a better person, then let&#8217;s talk again.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>With those parting words, he, who was kinder to others than anyone else and stricter on himself than anyone else, disappeared from my sight.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;There must have been other words I could have said to him.</p>
<p>Or rather, I should have been able to reprimand Ai-chan strongly, just like Mashima-kun did. I should have been able to confront Miyanoshita-kun clearly, just like Mashima-kun, and prevented Miyanoshita-kun from making that face.</p>
<p>&#8212;I have to change.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;Words can be confusing when there are too many of them.</p>
<p>I was a timid person, so when there were too many words, I used them to protect myself, to hurt, to become submissive, to become bent, to obscure, to deceive.</p>
<p>The more words you pile on, the further you stray from your true feelings.</p>
<p>If only I could express my feelings as boldly as Mashima-kun.</p>
<p>Using concise words, conveying only what I truly want to say&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>From then on, I stopped making smiles that weren&#8217;t true, stopped saying words that weren&#8217;t true.</p>
<p>I decided to speak only what I truly thought.</p>
</p>
<p>“──Hey, is it true that Takane-san is doing compensated dating?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>So, I tried to imitate Mashima-kun by clearly expressing my feelings.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, it&#8217;s okay! We&#8217;re just genuinely interested in it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re embarrassed, you can tone it down a bit, right? Right?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;It seemed like my words were permeated with insecurity.</p>
<p>I couldn’t do as well as Mashima-kun.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m not doing it.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>In the end, my weakness was exposed, and I peeked out from behind my facade.</p>
</p>
<p>“──Guidance ────────!!”</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230; He was different.</p>
<p>Mashima-kun had become even stronger, more righteous, and radiated more than he did back then.</p>
<p>Being exposed to his brilliance,</p>
<p>“Nothing takes precedence over the person&#8217;s own words.&#8221;</p>
<p>──I fell in love with him.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>■Chapter: Takane Saki■</strong></p>
</p>
<p>The story of how I met Mashima-kun during our time in middle school, and everything leading up to the recent confession, I shared it all with Hirabayashi-san without hiding anything.</p>
<p>Hirabayashi-san listened silently, occasionally nodding.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mashima-kun&#8230; he&#8217;s amazing. He never backs down from what he says. Just as he promised, he&#8217;s become an even more incredible person than when we first met.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Kamimura is a small town. The news like “Mashima-kun punched a classmate in front of a teacher and got suspended&#8221; spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure he went through a lot of tough times and had to endure hurtful words.</p>
</p>
<p>But despite such an incident, he achieved something remarkable. Mashima-kun became the first second-year student in the history of Kamimura High School to be selected as the president of the Discipline Committee.</p>
<p>Mashima-kun is truly an incredible person.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I wanted to become that kind of person.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>My self-loathing swelled even further, almost as if it could crush me.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;In the end, I ended up relying on Imamote. I can&#8217;t even express my feelings properly without resorting to the complexities of love psychology. As proof, I can&#8217;t do anything not written in Imamote.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the most pitiful person on Earth, and I&#8217;ve reached a point where I have no choice but to rely on someone else.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Hirabayashi-san&#8230; I mean, Mori-san! What do you think I should do from now!?&#8221;</p>
<p>“…”</p>
</p>
<p>Hirabayashi-san, who had crossed her arms, fell into a silence with a stern expression.</p>
<p>There was a long, long silence filled with a whirlwind of anxiety and hope.</p>
<p>And after this silence,</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hah.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Hirabayashi-san let out a sigh and said one thing.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Takane-san, have you read my book properly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I was taken aback by the unexpected words, and I froze for a moment.</p>
<p>Seeing my reaction, Hirabayashi-san shrugged in a somewhat exasperated manner…</p>
</p>
<p>“──Love psychology is clearly nonsense.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Hirabayashi-san&#8217;s words brought time to a halt.</p>
<p>Both Yuka-chan and I couldn&#8217;t comprehend the meaning of Hirabayashi-san&#8217;s words and could only gape like goldfish.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;…What was that?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>It was a phrase I could barely squeeze out.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8211;So, I&#8217;m telling you, it&#8217;s all fake, it&#8217;s all a sham. I can&#8217;t speak for others, but at least for the books I&#8217;ve written, they are, or rather, if they really worked, I&#8217;d have a harem by now.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;The holy scriptures that I have believed in until now.</p>
<p>I had made them my anchor, something I could rely on.</p>
<p>Suddenly, God had appeared before me and refuted it all with a &#8220;It’s all fake”.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;──!?!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>My feet crumbled beneath me, and I felt myself tumbling headfirst into a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>Is this really happening?</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve believed in all this time&#8230;?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;L…Liar&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I protested with a trembling voice. It was the most resistance I could muster.</p>
<p>Could there be something so absurd?</p>
<p>In the face of such misery, I felt like I might start crying loudly at any moment.</p>
<p>But Hirabayashi-san just said…</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, to start with, it&#8217;s wrong from the get-go. the very premise of Love psychology is wrong, and it&#8217;s okay to lie about it.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Love psychology is okay, even if it&#8217;s a lie?</p>
<p>My brain was on the verge of overheating due to the bewildering riddle.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright? From here on out, it&#8217;s the advice of the Love Creator, Mori. Normally, I&#8217;d charge for this, so listen carefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yes&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, I know it might sound cliché, but in this world, there is no one exactly like you. Have you ever come across anyone who is completely the same as another among all the people Takane Saki has interacted with?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230; true.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Of course not. Hirabayashi-san, I, Yuka-chan, Mashima-kun, Arakawa-kun, Iwasawa-kun, and even Miyanoshita-kun, we all have different personalities and values, and we act accordingly.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8230; unlike a computer game, there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all perfect strategy for influencing someone&#8217;s heart, is there? And it&#8217;s presumptuous to think that you can manipulate other people&#8217;s hearts with some superficial techniques or wisdom! After all, moving someone&#8217;s heart is all about the heart itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;So it&#8217;s still fake&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to the end! Love psychology is just a catalyst; it&#8217;s okay if it&#8217;s a lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A catalyst&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>“──Exactly!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Hirabayashi-san stood up, an action that I couldn&#8217;t have imagined from her usual demeanor, and she leaned towards me with an imposing air.</p>
</p>
<p>“─ What did you do when you found out about the &#8216;Windsor Effect&#8217; in Imamote?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I responded, perplexed by the sudden questioning.</p>
</p>
<p>“Uh, uh…Yuka-chan told me that Saki Takane seems to like Mashima-kun…”</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the &#8216;Mirroring Effect&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I tried to imitate Mashima-kun and talked to him&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the &#8216;Luncheon Technique&#8217; with the &#8216;Stinzer Effect&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I ate lunch next to Mashima-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how about the &#8216;Door-in-the-Face&#8217; technique?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I invited Mashima-kun on a date and exchanged contact information&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about the &#8216;3-Month Rule for Confessions&#8217;?”</p>
<p>Three-month confession rule.</p>
<p>The pattern where confessing within three months of meeting had the highest success rate.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, I realized&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to confess to Mashima-kun&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>“──That means all of that wasn&#8217;t just your efforts!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I gasped.</p>
<p>It was as though a tangle of conflicting emotions inside me had suddenly come unraveled.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve written nothing but lies in Imamote, but I&#8217;ve also written the truth. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; ‘90% of the Factors for Fulfilling Love are Courage and Perseverance<strong>’</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. Love psychology is just the 10%, there to push you forward. Takane-san already has enough courage and patience. So, forget about Imamote and just do what you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;Ah, could there be a happier moment than this?</p>
<p>Mori-san, the Love Creator, was truly an incredibly amazing person, and it turned out that I hadn&#8217;t been wrong at all.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;─ Thank you so much, Hirabayashi-san! I&#8217;ll go talk to Mashima-kun again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, that&#8217;s the spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every year, the student discipline committee does rounds during the Kamimura Grand Festival, so maybe Mashima-kun is there.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan said and gave me a thumbs up.</p>
<p>I was truly&#8230; blessed with friends!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;──Thank you so much!! Then I&#8217;ll go!!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I had no more doubts.</p>
<p>I rushed out of the empty classroom and headed towards the Kamimura Grand Festival grounds.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You know, I&#8217;ve realized how wonderful love is. Maybe I should confess to Iwasawa-kun&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“By the way, Swindler-san.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Mori, a popular romance creator on the internet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many copies of Imamote did you sell?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Hehehe, it went into an immediate second printing upon release, and we&#8217;re currently on the seventh edition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much have you honestly made from this fake book?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Love is Priceless by mori.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey.&#8221;</p>
