<h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 5</h2>


<p>“….Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“Ayana?”</p>



<p>During the break between classes, I finally reached my limit. With Setsumi and my other friends looking at me in surprise, as if to say I couldn’t take it anymore, I started packing my things together.</p>



<p>“Hey, Ayana?”</p>



<p>“Are you going to Yukishiro’s house?”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>Leaving school early to visit my boyfriend… I understood that even if I told the teacher directly, it probably wouldn’t go over well. However, because I’ve always behaved properly until now… Because I’m trusted by the teacher, I have a plan to somehow get permission!</p>




<p>“How will you explain your absence?”</p>



<p>“Well, there’s a saying that ‘a little lie is sometimes necessary.'”</p>



<p>“I see… Well, if you tell it with a serious face like that, I’m sure the teacher will believe you.”</p>



<p>“I think so too!”</p>



<p>“Seriously… You’re living for love, huh?”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s love!”</p>



<p>…Yes, my love for Towa-kun is infinite.</p>



<p>But it’s not just that… I’m worried—worried that he might be suffering from a cold, of course—but more than that, I’m feeling that same anxiety again… The fear that he might drift away, that the person I fell in love with might disappear…</p>



<p>“Alright then, everyone, I’m leaving.”</p>




<p>“Yeah, do your best!”</p>



<p>“Say hi to Yukishiro-kun for us!”</p>



<p>After leaving the classroom, I quickly headed to the faculty office. A little lie, no obstacles in the face of love… But I still hadn’t figured out exactly what excuse I would use… However, when I entered the faculty office, my homeroom teacher didn’t say anything.</p>



<p>“I understand. Go home.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“I’ll make an exception. But don’t think you can do this too many times. Even if I’m lenient to a certain extent, there are limits.”</p>



<p>“…Thank you, sensei.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, now go.”</p>



<p>With a gentle expression from the teacher, I left the faculty office. …Thinking about it now, I realize how blessed I am to have so many kind adults around me.</p>




<p>The moment I changed my shoes at the student entrance, I dashed out as if wings had sprouted on my feet. Though it wasn’t exactly a refreshing feeling, I didn’t want to be crushed by anxiety… I didn’t want to feel that, so I understood in my head why I was running.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun… Towa-kun…”</p>



<p>What is this unpleasant anxiety?</p>



<p>Unlike the air-conditioned school, it was hot outside… Running like this made me sweat immediately, and my breath quickened.</p>



<p>“Haa… Haa…”</p>



<p>As if to leave behind both exhaustion and pain, I headed straight to Towa-kun’s house… By the time I arrived, my body was covered in sweat.</p>



<p>My shirt clung to my skin, revealing my figure… One might even see the lines of my underwear if one looked closely. But I couldn’t afford to be embarrassed by that… Because I could only think about Towa-kun.</p>



<p>“Ah, I need to message Akemi-san.”</p>



<p>While catching my breath, I sent a message to Akemi-san, who was at work. Though she had already anticipated this, she had said I could come anytime, but it’s always best to be polite even with close friends.</p>




<p>After ringing the intercom and waiting a bit, Towa-kun didn’t come out.</p>



<p>I thought he might be sleeping, so I opened the door and hurried into his room. Knocking lightly, I peeked inside… Sure enough, Towa-kun was asleep.</p>



<p>“Fuu…”</p>



<p>Thank goodness… Towa-kun was there. Well, I can’t exactly say it’s good considering his current condition, but just seeing him here gave me some relief.</p>



<p>“That’s right, Towa-kun won’t go anywhere… Because he promised we’d be happy together.”</p>



<p>The promise I engraved in my heart with Towa-kun… As long as that exists, I won’t feel anxious. But why did I feel so unsettled? And why won’t it disappear, even though Towa-kun is right in front of me?</p>



<p>“I feel relieved that you’re here… but what is this?”</p>



<p>Towa-kun… Towa-kun… Towa-kun…</p>



<p>Driven by anxiety, I entered the room and sat down next to the bed, gazing at Towa-kun.</p>




<p>“Haa…”</p>



<p>He looks so uncomfortable… If I could, I would take his place. He seemed much sicker than I had thought from his voice last night.</p>



<p>“I… I… Where… Ay… ana…”</p>



<p>“Ah…”</p>



<p>Towa-kun called my name… Without raising my voice or shaking him, I reached into the bed and grasped his hand firmly.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun… I’m here. I’m right here.”</p>



<p>Surely, Towa-kun won’t get angry if I wake him up… Instead, he’ll probably smile and say he’s glad I came, despite being bewildered by my early departure from school. Or perhaps he’ll insist I go back, saying it’s to prevent him from catching a cold… But I won’t leave. Absolutely not.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun… I love you. Thanks to you, I’ve found happiness. Of course, I intend to be even happier with you from now on.”</p>



<p>The words flow incessantly… As if to reassure Towa-kun, who is suffering from a cold.</p>




<p>“I… was saved by you. I’m sure you think I’ve saved you too. But more than anything, I was saved by you right now… The person I love is you. I’m so drawn to you, and I want to live with you… That’s why I love you.”</p>



<p>Right now… I don’t know why these words came out.</p>



<p>Towa-kun is Towa-kun… He should be the same now as he always was… I don’t think I need to worry about that.</p>



<p>So… I just wanted to convey this… I just want you to know how much I love you.</p>



<p>“Fufu, I’m always telling you this, but… Whispering words of love to the person you love too much shouldn’t be a problem. Ah, but if I’m being too persistent and bothering you…”</p>



<p>I realized something important… It’s true that being too persistent might cause more trouble than kindness! Th-this is something I need to be careful about from now on!</p>



<p>I tightened my grip on Towa-kun’s hand just a little… to convey that I won’t let go here, that I won’t let go.</p>



<p>“Hey, Towa-kun… If you’re looking for me, if you’re looking for a place to return to, there’s no need to hesitate… Because this is your… your place to return to.”</p>



<p>And I… I’ll always be waiting for you… No matter what happens, I’ll always be waiting.</p>


<img src="https://i0.wp.com/soafp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6.jpg?w=604&ssl=1" alt="" />


<p>So please open your eyes quickly… Look at me with those beloved eyes, like you always do.</p>



<p>“…Ah”</p>



<p>Even though there’s nothing to be sad about, tears start to fall from my eyes. Large drops of tears stream down, and I have no way to stop them… It’s not as simple as just wiping them away with my hand.</p>



<p>So please… open your eyes, Towa-kun.</p>



<p>If you look at me… I’ll stop crying.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>[Towa PoV]</p>



<p>“….?”</p>



<p>I felt like someone called out to me. I stared into the void for a while, then refocused my attention on the computer screen. The game, “I Was Robbed of Everything,” had suddenly booted up, and I just kept progressing through the story.</p>



<p>“I was really surprised the first time I played this.”</p>




<p>Technically, it was when I played the sequel, the fan disc that detailed all the behind-the-scenes stuff.</p>



<p>“But man, no matter how many times I see it, Ayana’s expressions are just… something else.”</p>



<p>The erotic scenes featuring Ayana are truly full of allure, and her lines are just filled with devotion to Towa, even though from Shu’s perspective in the main game, it’s pure betrayal. Knowing the full story, Ayana’s words are always filled with thoughts of Towa.</p>



<p>“…Something about this just doesn’t sit right.”</p>



<p>It’s clear that Ayana is devoted to Towa. Yet, the words coming from the game’s Ayana felt oddly unsettling, as if she wasn’t the Ayana I knew.</p>



<p>“What am I saying, ‘the Ayana I know’…”</p>



<p>Loving the game and its characters so much that reality and fantasy blur together—no, I can’t be that far gone!</p>



<p>“Calm down… It’s like when people call anime or manga characters their wives!”</p>



<p>Why am I so flustered?</p>




<p>In my frantic state, Towa and Ayana continued their intimate scene on screen.</p>



<p>“Sorry, you two, for keeping you in that position…”</p>



<p>Since I hadn’t clicked to progress, the two remained connected, and Ayana, in particular, was in a strenuous pose that would challenge even a gymnast.</p>



<p>“Haha, laughing at this while playing an eroge… typical of me. I’ve got a unique perspective.”</p>



<p>After a short while, I reached the ending, and next, I started playing the fan disc that depicted Ayana’s life.</p>



<p>“……………”</p>



<p>As I played through the fan disc, I was perhaps more focused than ever before. I watched the screen intently, unable to look away. The more I saw the path Ayana had walked, the more I felt for her—feeling not just sympathy for her hardships, but a strong desire to comfort her, to be by her side and reassure her.</p>



<p>“I… I…”</p>



<p>What do I want? As I continued the story, a strange feeling of clarity began to emerge in my mind.</p>




<p>“…Ah, I see… I…”</p>



<p>The fog in my mind lifted, and memories became clear. Ah, yes—this was the world I once inhabited. But it was no longer the world I lived in. The moment I realized that, everything came rushing back with incredible speed.</p>



<p>And at the same time, I thought…</p>



<p>“The world where she exists isn’t where I truly belong… A place I could never go, a world that shouldn’t exist. Maybe that’s why… If I hadn’t remembered, I might have been trapped here forever.”</p>



<p>This is likely to remind me that in reality, reincarnation shouldn’t be possible… right? Maybe I’m just overthinking it, and in time, I’ll be able to go back. But there’s no way to be sure—because I’ve already decided to live in that other world.</p>



<p>[Towa-kun… I’m here.]</p>



<p>“Ayana?”</p>



<p>Ayana’s voice echoed in my room, where I was alone. Her tearful voice made me feel that I needed to return to her immediately. I stood up.</p>



<p>“…Ayana.”</p>




<p>The game was paused at a scene where Ayana reveals her inner darkness. The close-up of her face, wet from the rain, had moved not only me but every player who saw her sorrowful expression. I placed my hand on the screen, as if to caress her cheek.</p>



<p>Of course, it felt hard and unyielding, but strangely, it felt just like when I touched her in the game.</p>



<p>“Ayana… I promise I won’t let you make that face. I can’t comfort the Ayana here in front of me, but I’ll protect the Ayana I’ve met and vowed to walk into the future with.”</p>



<p>This is my unchanging will… my feelings.</p>



<p>“Hey, Towa. I can’t comfort this Ayana… So who will? It’s gotta be you, right? Come on, Towa Yukishiro.”</p>



<p>I knew it was pointless… but I couldn’t help saying it. I’ll protect the Ayana I’ve fallen for. Only Towa Yukishiro, who lives in that world, can comfort the crying Ayana there.</p>



<p>“Fue… I guess it’s time to go back.”</p>



<p>Oh, right, I have a bad cold… It’s pretty severe, so should I stay here until I recover?</p>



<p>“…Haha, if it means seeing Ayana, I’ll gladly endure that much suffering. In fact, I welcome it… Alright, I’m coming back, Ayana.”</p>




<p>If I step out of this room, I should be able to return to that world. Just as I was about to head to the door without hesitation, I felt the game screen move behind me and turned around.</p>



<p>“…Eh?”</p>



<p>It was moving… Just as I sensed, the game was progressing. And there was an image I’d never seen before… Towa embracing the crying Ayana, comforting her.</p>



<p>“…Seems like there was no need to worry, huh?”</p>



<p>After experiencing something as mysterious as reincarnation, a miracle like this should be expected. I took a good look at the two embracing and then woke up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>“…Ayana?”</p>



<p>“Su… su…”</p>



<p>As soon as I opened my eyes, I realized Ayana was right next to me. My head, still foggy from just waking up, turned to the side to see Ayana resting her head on the bed, fast asleep. </p>



<p>She was holding my hand tightly, making me certain that it was Ayana who had pulled me back from that other world.</p>



<p>“But who was that girl…?”</p>



<p>The junior girl who appeared in that world… She resembled Ayana so closely, but I had no memory of her from my previous life. </p>



<p>Not only did she look like Ayana, but her way of speaking and overall vibe were identical. </p>



<p>If that girl was just a figment of my imagination, or a manifestation of my desire to have someone like Ayana by my side, then it only made me prouder of how much I love Ayana.</p>




<p>“It’s already past noon, huh?”</p>



<p>My stomach was growling, and since it was past noon and Ayana was here, she must have left school early. </p>



<p>Although I was slightly exasperated, I had half-expected it and was more glad than anything else, so I decided not to scold her.</p>



<p>“She probably hasn’t had lunch yet, has she?”</p>



<p>She usually packs a bento, but should I wake her up and make sure she eats? </p>



<p>As I pondered this, I realized that the heaviness I felt this morning was gone, and my body felt surprisingly light. </p>



<p>There was still a bit of lingering fatigue, but I felt almost completely recovered.</p>



<p>“Mm… mmm?”</p>



<p>“Oh, you woke up? Troublemaker.”</p>




<p>I said with a laugh. Ayana rubbed her eyes and looked at me. As she understood that I was awake, her eyes gradually opened wider… and though she was about to jump at me, she stopped herself just in time, letting out a small huff.</p>



<p>“Ah, that was close… I almost hugged you without thinking, even though you’re still sick.”</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t mind, honestly. I feel strangely fine now… But it’s probably better you didn’t, just in case the cold is contagious.”</p>



<p>Ah… I felt relieved. The discomfort, anxiety, and loneliness were all gone… It was as if waking up from that dream had freed me from everything. And most importantly, I had something I wanted to say now that I felt so clear-headed.</p>



<p>“I’m back, Ayana.”</p>



<p>Saying “I’m back” in this situation would probably confuse her… But Ayana just smiled softly and replied.</p>



<p>“Welcome back, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>Her words made me smile back at her.</p>



<p>“Are you hungry?”</p>




<p>“Very much so.”</p>



<p>“Then I’ll hurry and make something.”</p>



<p>“What about your bento?”</p>



<p>“No, I planned to come here, so I thought I’d make ours together.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>



<p>Well, that’s… I guess I’m pretty happy about that!</p>



<p>Afterwards, I ate the lunch Ayana prepared for me and took a shower to wash off the sweat while changing out of my pajamas. Unexpectedly, Ayana decided to take a shower too.</p>



<p>I actually ran all the way here from school… Even though the sweat has dried, I still feel like taking a shower.”</p>



<p>She was so worried about me that she ran all the way here. When I checked my temperature, it had completely returned to normal. </p>




<p>As I mentioned earlier, I felt perfectly fine, but I had already decided to take it easy for the rest of the day. So, I quickly returned to my room and became a permanent resident of my bed.</p>



<p>“As I lie here, all my classmates are probably in class. Around noon, it’s the time when you get the sleepiest.”</p>



<p>“That’s right. Oh, we’re so lucky, aren’t we?”</p>



<p>“If only you were here in bed with me, it would be perfect.”</p>



<p>That was the only thing I found regrettable. </p>



<p>A bed is meant for sleeping, and lying down on its soft surface is comforting. Having the girl you love next to you, holding her in your arms, makes it even more fulfilling… Really, it’s such a shame.</p>



<p>“……………”</p>



<p>“Ayana?”</p>



<p>Uh… Why is she staring at me like that? Ayana, with a serious expression, approached me and tried to pull the comforter over herself, but I quickly stopped her.</p>




<p>“What are you doing?”</p>



<p>“You said it would be perfect if I were in bed with you, right? So, I thought I would cuddle with you.”</p>



<p>“I was wrong, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t speak without thinking.”</p>



<p>I keep reminding myself that I have a cold. Despite her determination to crawl into bed with me, I managed to hold her off, and eventually, Ayana gave up. </p>



<p>Since I wasn’t feeling sleepy, I had Ayana keep me company, and it turned out to be a good opportunity to talk about things we hadn’t discussed yesterday.</p>



<p>“So, I talked to Shu. He had a really nice smile on his face.”</p>



<p>“Really? Fufu, Shu-kun huh.”</p>



<p>“He’s finally moving forward… He also said he’d like to talk to you sometime.”</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t mind talking to him now.”</p>




<p>“Well, even with me, he had to muster a lot of courage… It might take a bit longer with you.”</p>



<p>“That’s true… Let’s wait patiently.”</p>



<p>It was clear from Ayana’s expression that she welcomed Shu’s change. Even if we couldn’t go back to the way things were completely, it was a significant step forward, and now I felt more confident than ever that we’d be okay.</p>



<p>“It’s really thanks to you, Towa-kun. Because you’re here, we have such a happy future to look forward to… Are you some kind of wizard?”</p>



<p>“What are you talking about? I’m no wizard… I’m just someone who does everything they can for the person they love.”</p>



<p>“…I meant that as a compliment, you know.”</p>



<p>“Well, then you could say the same about yourself, couldn’t you?”</p>



<p>“I suppose so… Fufu.”</p>



<p>“Haha.”</p>




<p>Lying in bed, with Ayana sitting on the floor next to me, we kept a bit of distance between us to prevent the urge to hug each other or get closer. Yet, Ayana couldn’t resist and moved closer, saying she couldn’t hold back anymore.</p>



<p>“As long as we avoid mucous membrane contact, we should be fine. So, I’ll stay here.”</p>



<p>Ayana, really? Is that okay? She sat right next to the bed, staring at me.</p>



<p>“…The term ‘s*x’ sounds kind of inappropriate, doesn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Yes, it’s quite suggestive. Hey, Towa-kun, get better soon, okay? I’ll be blunt: I want to do naughty things with you.”</p>



<p>“You’re straightforward, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“Of course. We’re past the point of being shy about these things, right?”</p>



<p>That was certainly true… I reached out from under the blanket to pat Ayana’s head, then gently touched her cheek in a flowing motion.</p>



<p>“I love being touched like this. Not thinking about anything, just wanting to touch the other person and being touched in return.”</p>




<p>“Yeah, it feels nice. Just being able to touch you like this makes me happy… I want to get better soon so I can do all sorts of things with you.”</p>



<p>“Let’s do that. So, please, get better quickly.”</p>



<p>I mentioned the intimate stuff partly to embarrass her a bit, but it seems we’ve moved past the point where such things would make either of us blush.</p>



<p>“Ayana.”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“I… I was in a different world until just a little while ago.”</p>



<p>“A different world? That sounds fascinating. Please tell me more.”</p>



<p>Instead of reacting with confusion or disbelief, Ayana asked to hear more about my story. </p>



<p>Most people would probably be puzzled or dismissive if I suddenly mentioned another world, but she was genuinely interested.</p>




<p>I reflected on everything that happened until I woke up and continued speaking.</p>



<p>“In that world, I wasn’t Towa… and Ayana wasn’t there either. It was a world where none of the people I knew from this world existed. I lived normally in that world… but I realized something was missing.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>“Well, yeah… obviously. That world was undoubtedly important to me, but Ayana wasn’t there.”</p>



<p>That world must have originally been the world I belonged to… Well, it’s probably best to classify it as something very similar.</p>



<p>“I wonder what’s missing… Who do I want to be with? I thought about that and remembered everything I had forgotten. And then I thought again—I realized that the world I want to live in, the world I should live in, is this world where Ayana is.”</p>



<p>“Towa-kun…”</p>



<p>I’m keeping a secret from Ayana… that I’m a reincarnated person. But I’m already Yuki Towa, and I’ve decided to live in this world as one human being.</p>



<p>I’m not saying it to convince myself, nor am I suggesting it to myself, because in this world where I live, there is no one else but me.</p>




<p>“……Fufu, hey Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“I… I love the Towa-kun who guided me just now. Like you’ve changed, I’ve changed too—I love you. I love you for being by my side, for holding my hand and comforting me, and for always telling me you love me.”</p>



<p>This time, Ayana began to stroke my cheek in return.</p>



<p>I enjoyed the sensation of her hand, feeling her love and dedication through her palm… It tickled a little, but for now, I simply accepted it while listening closely to Ayana’s words.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun… Sometimes I noticed you feel guilty about something.”</p>



<p>“……”</p>



<p>“Well, of course, because it’s you, Towa-kun. There’s no way I wouldn’t notice how much I love you… It may sound odd, but it was just a minor discomfort for me.”</p>



<p>“I-I see…”</p>




<p>“But! I love you so much now that it doesn’t bother me. I love you—I love you as much as saying I adore you, Towa-kun. Hey, Towa-kun, do you love this world?”</p>



<p>When she asked that, I vigorously nodded my head.</p>



<p>“I can’t forget about this world anymore. That’s why I want to stay here… So, Ayana, will you continue to stay by my side?”</p>



<p>“Of course! ♪ Once again, nice to meet you, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Yeah! Nice to meet you, Ayana.”</p>



<p>Ah… Just how much happiness does this girl give me, really?</p>



<p>You know, there have been a few times before when I felt like I was being released from something heavy, but right now, I feel overwhelmingly liberated. </p>



<p>That dream… perhaps it was a trial for me to remember things here, to realize what is most important to me. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but at least now… I truly felt like I’ve become a resident of this world in the truest sense.</p>



<p>“Hey, Towa-kun!”</p>




<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“When I think back on our conversation just now! Aren’t we closer than any newlyweds around here?! This is definitely marriage in the future! We should get married right after high school graduation! Or even as college students! Right? Right?!”</p>



<p>“W-Woah, calm down, Ayana!”</p>



<p>Her excitement level was off the charts…! I desperately tried to restrain Ayana as she leaned forward with such fervor, and as a result, my condition worsened slightly.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry!”</p>



<p>“Haha… Well, let’s calm down, okay?”</p>



<p>While Ayana repeatedly apologized, I chuckled wryly and thanked her once again.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Ayana… for meeting me.”</p>



<p>In response to those words, Ayana also said this:</p>




<p>“I should be the one thanking you. Thank you for meeting me, Towa-kun♪”</p>



<p>By the way, these are words we’ve said to each other many times.</p>



<p>No matter how many times we say them, I realize just how important Ayana is to me. And I believe she feels the same way… That truly brings me happiness.</p>



<p>(I… will live here)</p>



<p>I will live in this world… alongside her, who smiles beside me.</p>
