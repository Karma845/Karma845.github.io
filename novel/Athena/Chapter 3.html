<h2>Chapter 3: Leave That Culture in the Heisei Era</h2>

<p>Monday.</p>
<p>For many people heading to school or work, it represents the epitome of depression.</p>
<p>Only a few eccentrics look forward to this day, and I, Kujo Kurenai, have always found such individuals utterly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>…Or so I thought.</p>
<p>The classroom door swings open.</p>
<p>“Hey, Miyashiro, good morning~”</p>
<p>“Morning~”</p>
<p>Voices exchanging greetings around me and footsteps approaching, all of which I listen to intently but never turn to face, keeping my gaze fixed on the window.</p>
<p>Nearby, the sounds of a bag being hung and a chair being pulled out cease, signaling his presence next to me now.</p>
<p>“Hey, Yuuji, morning~”</p>
<p>“Morning! Hey, Kuuya, listen, …I gotta tell you this! So, actually––”</p>
<p>He begins conversing with a particularly close classmate who has arrived. They seem to be getting quite excited.</p>
<p>Quietly, I pull out my smartphone. Carefully, so as not to be noticed, I aim the camera slowly and stealthily toward my neighbor.</p>
<p>Using a silent camera app with the shutter sound turned off, I take a photo.</p>
<p>“––so that’s the deal! I’ll treat you, treat you! Anything you want! It’s all thanks to you, Kuuya!”</p>
<p>“Really? It’s nothing. But seriously, that’s awesome!”</p>
<p>While I’m engaged in this, he continues to chat and laugh with his friend, Yuuji Hatsuse.</p>
<p>From what I’ve overheard, it seems Yuuji Hatsuse has found himself a girlfriend.</p>
<p>“What do you mean what? You think we’re close or what?”</p>
<p>“We are close, idiot~”</p>
<p>“Exactly, idiot~”</p>
<p>As usual, the two of them have a lively conversation. Kuuya has a few male friends he’s close with in the class, but Yuuji Hatsuse seems to be a particularly intimate friend.</p>
<p>They always seem to have so much fun discussing various topics.</p>
<p>My only thought is…</p>
<p>…I’m so envious!!!</p>
<p>Suppressing the scream in my heart, I let out a small sigh.</p>
<p>Because, ah, I couldn’t even greet him today…!</p>
<p>Every morning, I manage to wake up early, a major struggle for me, and arrive at school early to sit at my desk and run through simulations and mental rehearsals of starting a conversation with him!</p>
<p>Not just in the morning, but constantly, I rack my brain for topics to prepare, aiming to strike up a conversation with him.</p>
<p>And how often do I actually manage to do so…?</p>
<p>On average, if I’m lucky, once every ten days.</p>
<p>Ugh…</p>
<p>Because initiating casual conversations with people isn’t a skill I’ve honed, especially when they’re not just anyone… but someone special to me.</p>
<p>Ah… how miserable.</p>
<p>Why must I be subjected to this?</p>
<p>Even as I think this, my eyes are drawn to my smartphone’s screen, where I can’t help but look at the photo I just took.</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>A rush of uncontrollable emotion tightens around my chest.</p>
<p>Biting my lip to keep any sound from escaping, I once again suppress my feelings.</p>
<p>…I often wonder how I ended up like this.</p>
<p>‘Human Haters’.</p>
<p>That nickname isn’t wrong. To me, most people don’t matter.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>“…Sigh”</p>
<p>A sigh escapes me before I can stop it.</p>
<p>Next to me, he continues his cheerful conversation with his friend.</p>
<p>“Planning to go anywhere during the summer break?”</p>
<p>“Nah, Nakabayashi asked me the same thing, but, you know, with club activities and all. What to do…”</p>
<p>“A tough decision. Nakabayashi isn’t in any clubs, right?”</p>
<p>“Right, she isn’t. Wonder what I should do…”</p>
<p>Boys’ talk about romance, something I could never intrude upon.</p>
<p>I wish…</p>
<p>…What I can do, though I shouldn’t, is…</p>
<p>While thinking, I navigate through my smartphone, tapping on the icon of a certain app. It’s not publicly available, something I crafted myself.</p>
<p>The app launches, displaying various menu options:</p>
<p>“Search Words,”</p>
<p>“Visited Websites,”</p>
<p>“Watched Videos,”</p>
<p>“Current Screen (Screenshot),”</p>
<p>and so on,</p>
<p>including “Current Location.”</p>
<p>Recently,</p>
<p>“Sleep Duration,”</p>
<p>“Heart Rate,”</p>
<p>and “Stress Levels” were added.</p>
<p>Carefully ensuring no one sees, I tap on “Search Words.”</p>
<p>Words like “cute cat images,” “how not to burn food,” “recommended famous ramen shops” appear.</p>
<p>Cats! Searching for cute cat pictures! How adorable!! And, a cat person, noted.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As you may have guessed…</p>
<p>All the data I’m viewing through the app are pulled without permission from his smartphone and smartwatch, a collection of his personal information and usage data.</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>…It’s not just “sigh.” Of course, this is a clear crime.</p>
<p>What I can do isn’t mingling with the conversation unfolding beside me but gazing at the illicitly obtained personal information of the person I like, a testament to my criminal act.</p>
<p>Kujo Kurenai.</p>
<p>Currently a second-year student at a prefectural high school, a freelance programmer, and… stalking her classmate sitting next to her—Miyashiro Kuuya.</p>
<p>Ah, but, not stalking in the physical sense (mostly).</p>
<p>Because I’ve thought—is that really the essence? Is chasing someone around truly what I want to do?</p>
<p>No. Chasing is merely a means to an end.</p>
<p>What I really want is to thoroughly collect information about the person I like. For that purpose, I would chase and take photos and whatnot.</p>
<p>But, Reiwa, right? (TLN : Reiwa era begins in 2019, before Reiwa era, it was Heisei era 1989 – 2018)</p>
<p>It’s already the Reiwa era, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Is it really stalking if you’re just physically chasing and taking photos or eavesdropping?</p>
<p>No, it’s not.</p>
<p>Humanity, leave such outdated notions behind in the Heisei era.</p>
<p>In this era, vast amounts of private information about each individual are stored within digital devices like smartphones.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you truly want to know everything about someone, why not target that information!</p>
<p>With such thoughts, I created this system, but I truly believe I’m the worst.</p>
<p>Ahhhhh…</p>
<p>I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, truly sorry…</p>
<p>And yet, I can’t bring myself to stop…!</p>
<p>Miyashiro-kun is searching for [“how not to burn food” while cooking]. I knew he cooked for himself, but maybe he’s not that good at it?</p>
<p>Then there’s [“recommended famous ramen shops”]. He likes ramen, doesn’t he? Is that a thing with all guys?</p>
<p>…Like that, information about Miyashiro-kun keeps piling up at my fingertips.</p>
<p>I want to know. That feeling, I just can’t suppress it.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s start the morning homeroom~. Anyone still standing, take your seats~”</p>
<p>The chime rings, and at the same time, our homeroom teacher enters.</p>
<p>“Kuuya, I’m heading back to my seat.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>While listening to such conversations, I sneak a glance at him from the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>Praying he doesn’t notice my gaze, yet at the same time wishing he’d pay attention to me and look my way.</p>
<p>How foolish.</p>
<p>Caught in contradictions, losing logic, swayed by desires. I never intended to become like this.</p>
<p>And so, another day begins.</p>
<p>Me, Kujo Kurenai’s––a new-era, tech-specialized stalker living in the Reiwa era, starts her day.</p>
<p>A girl who lived hating humans, yet about half a year ago, fell for the boy now sitting next to her, starts her day.</p>
<p>But let me say this in advance, I’ll be breaking a lot of laws…</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>“Eh~, so, the value of x here is──”</p>
<p>It’s morning, currently the second period. Math class.</p>
<p>I am, at my own seat, fiddling with my smartphone. It’s quite obvious to the teacher, but I’m not particularly cautioned. As long as you score well on tests, they will not complaint. That’s the kind of person they are.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, I can focus on what’s important to me.</p>
<p>What I have launched on my smartphone is, of course, the matter at hand, my homemade app.</p>
<p>──Ah, Miyashiro-kun, was looking up summer leisure activities during the break of the first period. Hmm, hmm, he seems to be looking for something enjoyable even in a short time?</p>
<p>I see, it’s for the sake of Yuji Hatsuse, who needs to balance both club activities and his girlfriend. I remember them talking about something like that.</p>
<p>I’m impressed by his thoughtfulness for friends.</p>
<p>And me, who is unilaterally aware of such things, really feels creepy…</p>
<p>Ah…</p>
<p>By the way, the information I am currently looking at through this app is sourced from his smartphone, but how it’s realized is a simple story.</p>
<p>His smartphone has spyware hidden in it──(Spyware is a general term for malicious programs that gather information without permission and send it out externally. Since it spies, it’s called spyware).</p>
<p>The method of hiding it was to lend him a self-made device for inserting spyware, disguised as a power bank…</p>
<p>When charged, malicious programs are sent along──In modern smartphones, where the data transfer port and the charging port are the same, such risks exist.</p>
<p>Though not a common case of smartphone virus infection, everyone should be careful.</p>
<p>….It’s not something the perpetrator should say. Yes, I am the scum of this town…</p>
<p>“Eh~, then, turn to page 72 in your textbook and try solving exercises 1 through 5.”</p>
<p>I heard such words from the math teacher. Hmm, practice problems, huh.</p>
<p>Stopping my smartphone operation, I quickly open the textbook to the specified page. They’re simple high-order equation problems. I feel like I could solve them when I was in elementary school.</p>
<p>I think it’s pointless to do this now, but I start solving anyway.</p>
<p>Because, I might be called on by the teacher later… and I don’t want to say “I don’t know” in front of Miyashiro-kun!</p>
<p>No…</p>
<p>I want to smoothly answer and show my cool side!</p>
<p>I finish at a blinding speed, checking for mistakes and confirming there are none. Alright, perfect.</p>
<p>One of the few respectable appeal points that Kujo Kurenai possesses is academic ability. At least, I want to show it…</p>
<p>I glance at Miyashiro-kun. He’s seriously solving the problems.</p>
<p>His eyelashes are long… Ah, he seems to have a good complexion today…?</p>
<p>As I observe such things, I find myself continuing to stare, so I muster all my mental strength to look away.</p>
<p>That’s right, if I have extra time, I should work on this.</p>
<p>I return my gaze and consciousness to my smartphone.</p>
<p>──So, about the “summer leisure” he was researching.</p>
<p>The conditions are something suitable for couples, available around here, and something busy people can quickly go to.</p>
<p>Let’s search, and I tap tap tap on my smartphone.</p>
<p>I access my PC in my room from a distance, and from there, I launch my “Miyashiro-kun Conversation Topic Creation &amp; Automatic Information Gathering Program.” I really owe a lot to this little program.</p>
<p>Oh, found quite a few options. Let’s see… Oh, how about this one?</p>
<p>I find interesting information and was about to research more when I hear the math teacher’s voice again.</p>
<p>“Finished solving? Alright, let’s start with number 1. Who shall I pick to answer…”</p>
<p>I send a fervent gaze towards the math teacher. Come on, I’m ready.</p>
<p>Please let my few respectable appeal points see the light of day!</p>
<p>“What to do~, hmm….our eyes met.”</p>
<p>The math teacher looked in my direction and said that. Alright, this might be my chance──</p>
<p>“Then, Miyashiro, I’m counting on you.”</p>
<p>I almost slid off my chair.</p>
<p>…No, no, no, but this is. This is good in its own way!</p>
<p>“Ugh, should’ve kept my head down… Ah, and so, it is.”</p>
<p>Miyashiro-kun, when called on during class to speak, his voice tone changes a bit. It becomes more serious, or a bit more formal.</p>
<p>Listening to his voice, different from usual, is a lucky moment.</p>
<p>Such foolishness, perhaps, is what they call love.</p>
<p>Thinking such, of course, the moment Miyashiro-kun was called on, my smartphone’s recording app was already running, meticulously recording his voice.</p>
<p>Because, generally, when students stand up to speak during class, it’s usually quiet, making it the best time to record Miyashiro-kun’s voice clearly!</p>
<p>I can’t miss this opportunity!</p>
<p>…Whether or not this behavior falls within the concept known as a “lovestruck girl,” I do not know.</p>
<p>“…Phew, yes, correct. Tch.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, was there a reason to click your tongue? Think about it? Your cute student got it right, you know?”</p>
<p>“Think about it yourself, Miyashiro! It would be easier to explain if you got it wrong, damn it.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll spill everything in the course-end survey…”</p>
<p>“I’ll write it too~!” “Get scolded, crap teacher~!” the surrounding students jeered.</p>
<p>This class is basically serious, but sometimes their behaviour is bad.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>Lunch break.</p>
<p>After quickly finishing my lunch in the classroom, I, alone, sip vegetable juice while looking at my smartphone.</p>
<p>What’s displayed in the Miyashiro-kun monitoring app is “Current Location.” I’m borrowing data from his smartphone’s GPS function.</p>
<p>──He seems to be in the schoolyard, but I wonder what he’s doing.</p>
<p>I don’t have much of an image of Miyashiro-kun exercising outside during lunch break. Going through past location data quickly, he indeed spends most of his lunch breaks inside the school (however, GPS is weak indoors, so it’s hard to judge which room he’s in. The commercialization and equipping of smartphones with quantum accelerometers are awaited).</p>
<p>Let’s see then.</p>
<p>Returning to the app’s menu screen, I tap “Heart Rate.” A heart icon appears on the screen, and a number below it.</p>
<p>Miyashiro-kun’s current heart rate is around 110 to 120. It’s not a resting number, so he must be doing some exercise. Unusual.</p>
<p>I wonder if he’s alright. Today isn’t very hot, nor is the sun strong, so maybe he’s fine.</p>
<p>I was surprised on that hot Saturday before.</p>
<p>That day, as I was looking at Miyashiro-kun’s “Search Words,” things like 【Heatstroke Prevention】and【How to Treat Heatstroke】popped up.</p>
<p>When I checked “Current Location,” it was the multi-purpose park. I thought he might have fallen ill during exercise, so I rushed there with all sorts of heatstroke countermeasures.</p>
<p>It was the first time in my stalker life that I took such action.</p>
<p>Even if I got to him, I thought I wouldn’t be able to say anything because of my cowardice, but once I saw him seemingly in poor condition, my hesitation blew away.</p>
<p>…The excuse was quite forced, so I might be considered suspicious or creepy. It’s very sad, but if I could be of help to Miyashiro-kun, I’m willing to take it.</p>
<p>His health is more important.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>──Still, on that day, I ended up talking so much up close. When I almost fell and he helped me… I even got hugged by him!</p>
<p>I still remember well the sensation of his hand around my waist.</p>
<p>At that time, should I have paid him? After having such a good experience, maybe I should have offered like thirty thousand yen?</p>
<p>I’m always looking for a way to make in-app purchases for Miyashiro-kun.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>While thinking about that, I noticed the heart rate displayed on the app screen gradually decreasing. He might have finished exercising.</p>
<p>By the way, this “Heart Rate” is taken from his smartwatch.</p>
<p>And of course, that smartwatch, before it reached his hands, was specially prepared by me with spyware inserted.</p>
<p>From the information extracted from his smartphone, I knew he started looking for a smartwatch on a flea market app, so I listed the one I had prepared in advance.</p>
<p>It would have been over if it was reset, but it was lucky he started using it as is, believing the phrase I included in the description, “It’s already initialized, so you can use it immediately.”</p>
<p>This smoothly executed procedure is, of course, a crime too.</p>
<p>…No, well, supposedly, the main reason why I recommended the smartwatch was for him to use it for health management. I’m saying this myself, but it’s completely unbelievable…</p>
<p>Sigh…</p>
<p>I sigh at my own wickedness. It feels like it’s become a habit.</p>
<p>They say you sigh a lot when you’re in love, but maybe everyone is thinking about their criminal history due to love…?</p>
<p>…That can’t be right.</p>
<p>Even as I’m dumbfounded by myself, on the other hand, my hand never lets go of my smartphone.</p>
<p>Because, while displaying Miyashiro-kun’s “Heart Rate,”──my smartphone vibrates in real-time to his heartbeat, tottotto…</p>
<p>It’s as if I’m holding his very heart in this hand… (tln : …)</p>
<p>────The best~~~~~~!!!!!</p>
<p>…No, really, I think you won’t understand unless you actually experience it! But!</p>
<p>Being able to feel the heartbeat of the person you love in your hand anytime is an amazing experience! It’s incredible!</p>
<p>Talking to each other, being in the same place, it’s a different thing. It’s like touching the very source of the loved one’s life… So, in other words, there’s a special kind of danger! I could die of reverence. Oh no, I’m running out of vocabulary.</p>
<p>Thinking that many humans will go on without experiencing this excitement makes me even sad. Humanity, before going on dates, first feel the heartbeat.</p>
<p>That’s where the “answer” is…</p>
<p>“Yukko, Ruu-chan, gather up! …Miyashiro-kun isn’t here, right, good good.”</p>
<p>“Ah, what?”</p>
<p>“What’s up with Miyashiro?”</p>
<p>…What? I can’t help but eavesdrop on the conversation I heard.</p>
<p>Excluding my family, humans other than Miyashiro Kuuya are quite unimportant to me, so I usually don’t care about conversations happening around me.</p>
<p>But if it’s about Miyashiro-kun, that’s different.</p>
<p>The conversation is among three girls in the class who are particularly lively (I think, I don’t remember well).</p>
<p>“About a week ago in HR, Miyashiro-kun became a committee member for the upcoming ball game tournament, remember?” (TLN : HR = Homeroom class)</p>
<p>“…Was that so?”</p>
<p>“I remember, I remember, that’s when Hatsuse nominated himself and invited Miyashiro to join him, right?”</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right, I nod to myself as I listen to their conversation. If it’s related to Miyashiro-kun, I remember it accurately.</p>
<p>Also, for the ball game tournament, two boys and two girls from each class, totaling four, become committee members.</p>
<p>When Miyashiro-kun was decided as a committee member, the slots for girls were still open, but thinking “then I should…” was impossible for me.</p>
<p>“Right. And, …actually, I told Hatsuse-kun beforehand that he should nominate himself.  I Told him “It seems your crush from another class has become a committee member too,” ”</p>
<p>“That’s super kind, hilarious. What’s with that? That’s not like you.”</p>
<p>“No, Aki is quite kind.”</p>
<p>The girl who made a jesting comment gets retorted by another girl. By the way, I don’t remember their names. What were they…? No, I have no idea.</p>
<p>Temporarily, let’s just call them Girl α, Girl β, and Girl γ in the order they spoke. (tln : Alpha, beta, Gamma)</p>
<p>Girl α says.</p>
<p>“Nfufu, just as Ruuchan says, I’m kind. …You know, a friend from another class──ah, you both know her. Sacchan from class 7. …She likes Miyashiro-kun!”</p>
<p>“Oh~!”</p>
<p>“Oh~”</p>
<p>I freeze at the sudden explosion of a bomb.</p>
<p>“Then~, she came to consult with me! How to get closer to Miyashiro-kun! So, first, I had Sacchan become a committee member…”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. So, you used Hatsuse, who’s close to Miyashiro, to make sure Miyashiro would also become a committee member? Smart~”</p>
<p>I blink hard five times and take three deep breaths to regain my normal thinking capacity.</p>
<p>And I think.</p>
<p>──Normies must die!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>What’s that, what’s with that plan! Is that, that, unfair, Ah, is it not unfair?</p>
<p>Where do you learn such things…? In a cram school…? No way, in Benes…?</p>
<p>I mean, you’re manipulating people! Is that allowed!</p>
<p>Isn’t that against human ethics!</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I have no right to say such things. After all, I’m a genuine criminal.</p>
<p>“Hehehe, and today’s the sixth period is a long homeroom, right? We have self-study time, but the committee members are gathering in the multipurpose room on the third floor for a meeting. You know what i mean right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Ruuchan and I are on the committee.”</p>
<p>“It’s like, if you become a committee member for the ball game tournament, you don’t have to do it for the cultural festival and stuff.”</p>
<p>It seems β and γ are committee members for the ball game tournament from this class, just like Miyashiro-kun. I totally didn’t remember that.</p>
<p>“Can you two help Sacchan and Miyashiro-kun get along? Like, making them in charge of the same sport!”</p>
<p>“Hmm, okay~. I’ll do what I can~”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’ll work, but the committee members for the ball game tournament seem to work in teams by grade, so there should be plenty of chances to talk, right?”</p>
<p>The more I listen, the more I hear things I don’t want to hear.</p>
<p>I feel the blood draining from my face.</p>
<p>“Thanks~! But Miyashiro-kun, he’s not super popular, but he’s somewhat popular, right?”</p>
<p>“I get it~. He’s kind of my type.”</p>
<p>Girl β, licking a candy, nonchalantly says such a thing. What…</p>
<p>“Huh, Yukko, really? Surprising. I thought you liked more flashy guys…”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Miyashiro-kun has an atmosphere, you know. It’s like, he sees things differently from us. Like he has his own world. I like that kind of thing~”</p>
<p>Girl β responds to Girl α. She continues in her serious yet ambiguous tone.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>“Ah, but I’ve never seen Miyashiro-kun’s paintings yet.”</p>
<p>“No way! You’re missing out! You absolutely have to see them!”</p>
<p>This time, it was Girl γ who suddenly raised her voice with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“They’re amazing! Like, really amazing, and so good! I even cried a little when I first saw them!”</p>
<p>“Huh, what’s with that energy… What happened?”</p>
<p>“It’s not ‘what happened’! I’m telling you to go see them! They’re really, really good! There are a few in the art prep room, so go see them! After school, when Miyashiro is painting in the art room, the prep room is also open, so go see them!”</p>
<p>“Ruuchan, how do you know all that?”</p>
<p>Faced with Girl α’s question, Girl γ fell silent for a moment with a “Ugh,” before conceding.</p>
<p>“Well, …before the volleyball tournament, I always go to see them. When I’m feeling anxious before a match, it somehow calms me down, looking at Miyashiro’s paintings…”</p>
<p>“Wow~!”</p>
<p>“Seriously~? You’re a real fan then.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, I am a fan! But it’s not just me, okay! There are others, like from different sports clubs and stuff, who come to see them too! It’s not just me!”</p>
<p>“Just go see them!” With that, Girl γ fell silent.</p>
<p>“But, doesn’t Miyashiro-kun already have someone he’s dating? You know, that first-year, Ado-chan. She’s super cute and has a big chest. They often go home together, right?”</p>
<p>“Nah, that girl isn’t his girlfriend. I talk quite a bit with her… Suika-chan, and they’re childhood friends. Well, it’s hard to approach him with such a cute, high-spec girl around~. Sacchan was having trouble too.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ado-chan, Suika-chan──Ado Suika, huh.</p>
<p>When I watch Miyashiro-kun, I naturally end up seeing her quite often too. That’s how much he’s with Ado-san.</p>
<p>At first, I really thought they were dating. I was so shocked I practically spent three days in bed.</p>
<p>But in reality, as Girl α said, they seem to be childhood friends.</p>
<p>…I’m not sure if I should just consider them “just childhood friends” since they’re close enough to go cheer for each other at matches on holidays.</p>
<p>However, the immediate threat isn’t Ado-san.</p>
<p>──Lunch break, …alright, still about fifteen minutes left.</p>
<p>After checking the time, I stood up and quickly left the classroom.</p>
<p>“Here…”</p>
<p>The third floor’s multipurpose room. The place Girl α mentioned for the meeting.</p>
<p>I try to enter by pulling the door, but it’s locked. Of course, it would be.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t matter to me.</p>
<p>“Ta-da~”</p>
<p>I pulled out a key made of acrylic resin, which I announced with a lonely sound effect. It slides smoothly into the keyhole.</p>
<p>Twisting it, I unlocked the door’s latch.</p>
<p>The key I used, of course, isn’t the room’s official one──it’s an illegal duplicate. Moreover, it’s a copy of a master key (a key that can open any room in the building).</p>
<p>That was back in my first year.</p>
<p>I was tasked with collecting prints placed on the lecturers’ desks in each classroom.</p>
<p>And then, the teacher said, “It’s troublesome to bring out all the keys for each classroom,” and incredibly handed me the master key.</p>
<p>Unbelievable!</p>
<p>I was outraged. What do they think about security! What if it was misused!</p>
<p>While angry, I went around the classrooms, collected the prints, and also measured and took several photos of the master key.</p>
<p>Then, I went home, created a 3D model from the measurements and photos, and printed it with a 3D printer.</p>
<p>And thus, the duplicate was made.</p>
<p>This is why, in today’s age where 3D printers are common, important keys should never be handed or shown to anyone other than the manager.</p>
<p>…My motive was, simply, I was curious if “a school’s master key could be duplicated with a 3D printer.”</p>
<p>After confirming the key could indeed unlock doors, I carelessly stored it at the bottom of a drawer at home.</p>
<p>However, now, thinking it might come in handy for my stalker life, I carry it daily, and here I am using it, so I’m definitely guilty.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Feeling a heavy sense of self-loathing, I opened the door cautiously and sneaked into the room filled with desks.</p>
<p>Then, I tossed one of my smartphones into a desk in the middle of the room (as a true gadget nerd, I own about eight of the latest smartphone models from various manufacturers and always carry three to school).</p>
<p>The phone I tossed had an external microphone attached. Why I have such a thing can only be due to a stalker’s hobby.</p>
<p>Now everything is prepared.</p>
<p>“Alright…”</p>
<p>LHR time. (tln : long homeroom class)</p>
<p>I was at my seat near the classroom window, earphones connected to my smartphone plugged into my ears.</p>
<p>Then, I remotely activated the smartphone in the multipurpose room to start recording. This way, I could listen to the conversations in that room.</p>
<p>It might not be crystal clear, but as long as I can make out the words.</p>
<p>If I can make out the words──not that anything can be done about it.</p>
<p>All I can do is just listen… Honestly, I know it’s meaningless. It won’t stop those girls from approaching Miyashiro-kun, nor will it allow me to appeal to him.</p>
<p>But knowing what I know, I couldn’t just leave it unheard.</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>I heard the sound of the door opening. And then.</p>
<p>“Being a committee member, huh… so boring.”</p>
<p>“Right? But it’s better than doing it for the cultural festival or school trip, right?”</p>
<p>“True that.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell whose voices they were, but such conversations started to fill the room. It seems students were gathering.</p>
<p>Soon after, that voice sounded.</p>
<p>“Kuuya, what’s the seating arrangement again?”</p>
<p>“Seems like it’s by grade from the window side; first, second, third years. Front or back… probably in class number order.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Yūji Hatsuse’s clear voice, followed by Miyashiro-kun’s soft voice, which I could replay in my brain with ease.</p>
<p>Their presence seemed to grow closer.</p>
<p>“Since we’re class four, should be around the middle here? Here?”</p>
<p>Miyashiro-kun’s words and the sound of a chair being pulled out were quite clear.</p>
<p>It seems they sat near or exactly where I left the smartphone with the microphone.</p>
<p>Miyashiro-kun and Yūji Hatsuse continued their casual chatter, and then another new voice was heard.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>“Hey, Miyashiro-kun, Hatsuse-kun, can we sit next to you guys?”</p>
<p>“We’re in the same class, so it’s better to stick together, right?”</p>
<p>It was the voices of Girl β and Girl γ. Following Hatsuse Yuuji’s light response of “Okay, okay,” Miyashiro-kun also answered.</p>
<p>“Of course. Please, do.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. And is it okay if she joins us too? Sacchan. She’s from class 7, but she has bad eyesight, so it’s tough for her to sit at the back.”</p>
<p>“Sorry to intrude!”</p>
<p>A lively tone of voice. I don’t recognize it. As introduced by Girl β, she must be the girl who has feelings for Miyashiro-kun.</p>
<p>Miyashiro-kun responds to her greeting.</p>
<p>“Please, feel free. It’s not like anyone’s going to complain the seating arrangement that much, and it’s better to sit somewhere you can see easily. I mean…”</p>
<p>“Mi-Miyashiro-kun, long time no see! Since our first year, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s been a while~. We ended up in different classes in our second year.”</p>
<p>So, they were in the same class in their first year.</p>
<p>Nice… But I only started liking Miyashiro-kun towards the end of our first year, so it’s really pointless for me to say anything about it.</p>
<p>“Even if you’re on the organizing committee, you can still participate in the sports, right? Are you entering anything, Miyashiro-kun?”</p>
<p>“I think I’ll pass this year. I plan to focus on the committee work.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? …Actually, I was planning the same. Let’s work hard together!”</p>
<p>A clear, straightforward approach. A girl named Sacchan actively engaging Miyashiro-kun in conversation.</p>
<p>—Amazing.</p>
<p>I feel respect for her. Because talking to someone you like takes a lot of courage.</p>
<p>She’s doing it. I have no right to feel envious or to think she’s getting too close to Miyashiro-kun.</p>
<p>Not that I don’t have those feelings, but anyway, I don’t have the right.</p>
<p>“Amazing,” I mutter, literally from a distance, with a blank expression.</p>
<p>“I’ll work hard! I’m confident in physical tasks too!” Sacchan’s voice rings out cheerfully and energetically.</p>
<p>I just listen in a daze. Miserable. 100% my own doing.</p>
<p>That’s the current state of my love.</p>
<p>“Excuse me~! Is everyone here? …Looks like it! Then, let’s get started!”</p>
<p>The sound of the door opening followed by a loud voice indicated that a student in charge of organizing the event had arrived.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kuuya, is that…”</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t know. She’s really involved in a lot of stuff…”</p>
<p>Hatsuse Yuuji and Miyashiro-kun have such a conversation. Perhaps they know the person.</p>
<p>—Wait, do I recognize that voice…?</p>
<p>Could it be just my imagination? I try to dig through my memory, but ultimately, I can’t find an answer. When you’re only interested in Miyashiro-kun, situations like this become difficult.</p>
<p>“First, I’ll explain the overview of the sports festival committee’s work and the precautions.”</p>
<p>The organizing student proceeds to explain various details with a clear voice.</p>
<p>“—That’s about it for each event. Basically, we’ll split you into teams by grade level, with mixed-gender teams responsible for managing each event.”</p>
<p>Mixed-gender teams for work. The girl named Sacchan plans to close the distance with Miyashiro-kun that way. There’s nothing I can do about it—</p>
<p>“…Ah. Um, sorry, actually, I wanted to hear everyone’s opinion! To put it simply, what do you think about splitting the teams by gender instead of mixed this year?”</p>
<p>“…Eh?”</p>
<p>The words I heard made me let out a soft voice.</p>
<p>From the other room, the girl named Sacchan raised her voice.</p>
<p>“Wait, wait, why? Isn’t it better to have mixed-gender teams like last year?”</p>
<p>“Well, of course, that’s fine too. But actually, I heard from the seniors on my way here that there have been issues because teams were mixed-gender.”</p>
<p>“What kind of issues?”</p>
<p>“Well… it seems that organizing committee members get busy on the day, and a few years ago, a group of boys didn’t account for their own changing time. They thought they could just change quickly in a corner of the field, so…”</p>
<p>A loud gasp of disgust or disbelief echoed from the girls.</p>
<p>“Not limited to that incident, but well, things like that have happened… So, what do you think about trying separate teams for men and women this year? Since the events are separated by gender anyway, it might be natural.”</p>
<p>The suggestion from the organizing student clearly tilted the air towards “It’s better to separate by gender.”</p>
<p>Of course, the explanation makes sense, but the convincing strength in the voice might be a decisive factor.</p>
<p>It’s not pushy or intimidating, but there’s a core strength that makes you feel like following along is the right choice. A voice fit for a politician, perhaps.</p>
<p>Reversing this situation would be a Herculean task.</p>
<p>“Um… yeah, …I think it’s okay to separate by gender.”</p>
<p>Eventually, the girl named Sacchan conceded with those words.</p>
<p>“Sorry, thank you. Then, let’s go with that direction this year! Of course, there will still be issues and disputes even with separate teams. If that happens, please report to me first, Ado Suika from class 1-1!”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>When the organizing student introduced herself, I finally realized who she was.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/00015.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>That’s right, it was Ado-san…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>“Well, that’s it for today. Those who have club activities, do your best~ and those going home, take care~”</p>
<p>With those words from the homeroom teacher, LHR ended. It’s after school.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I sneak a peek at the seat next to me, where Miyashiro-kun is getting ready to leave. According to my observations, there’s a 92% chance he heads straight to the art room to paint after school.</p>
<p>This is the only chance left today to talk to him.</p>
<p>The “Sacchan” from earlier crosses my mind. …I want to as well.</p>
<p>“Hey Miyashiro~, that math assignment from earlier is tough, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s harsh. Wonder if I can finish it by tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“It’s tough, right~! I dread the next test…”</p>
<p>“The test, huh… brings me down.”</p>
<p>Miyashiro-kun shares a bitter smile with the boy sitting in front of him.</p>
<p>Math assignments and tests are easy for me. But casually starting a conversation like that feels incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>It’s difficult, but I have to try.</p>
<p>I have a topic for conversation. The summer leisure spot Miyashiro-kun was searching for Hatsuse Yuuji.</p>
<p>Ah, but how do I start the conversation?</p>
<p>“What are you doing this summer, Miyashiro-kun?” …No, that feels too abrupt. Summer vacation is still over a month away.</p>
<p>“Do you want to know a good place to hang out?” …This sounds like I’m a dealer inviting him to a drug party.</p>
<p>But then, hmm…</p>
<p>“Alright, I’m heading out.”</p>
<p>“See ya.”</p>
<p>Ah…</p>
<p>While I hesitated, Miyashiro-kun left.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…Sigh.”</p>
<p>I let out a sigh and stand up, holding my bag.</p>
<p>Today, again, I listened to Miyashiro-kun’s voice a lot.</p>
<p>But none of it was directed at me.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>In his life, today too, I remained someone whose presence or absence made no difference.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t be relieved that the sports festival committee has been separated by gender.</p>
<p>Walking out of the classroom with a heavy heart, I proceed down the hallway.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kujo. Can I have a moment?”</p>
<p>“Huh, ah, yes. What’s up?”</p>
<p>A female teacher briskly walks over to me. She’s our class’s assistant homeroom teacher, carrying a cardboard box in her arms.</p>
<p>I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>“You’re on the library committee, right? Could you please arrange these in the bookshelf of the library? There’s a paper inside this box with instructions on where to place them.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Maybe when you’re feeling down, it’s like life decides to pile on. I don’t want to say something so unscientific, but I just feel like saying it.</p>
<p>But, I doubt I could refuse even if I tried.</p>
<p>“Understood, I’ll take care of it.”</p>
<p>The best strategy is to accept quickly and finish it off just as fast.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>Heavy!? Well, yes, they’re books…</p>
<p>The female teacher seemed to carry it effortlessly, but for someone as physically untrained as me, it’s tough.</p>
<p>Holding the cardboard box, I stagger toward the library, taking several breaks along the way until I finally make it.</p>
<p>Opening the door, the chilled air conditioned room greets me. The sweat I’ve worked up from the labor cools down rapidly. It’s actually a bit cold.</p>
<p>Now, to get the job done.</p>
<p>Following the instructions in the box, I move to a corner bookshelf as instructed. The empty space they mentioned is on the very top shelf. Conveniently, there’s a ladder nearby. It seems they expect me to climb it.</p>
<p>They’re really asking for a lot. I’ve never gotten anything but 1’s in PE my entire life… I give up at two levels of the vaulting box.</p>
<p>“Ugh, …eek…”</p>
<p>With shaky steps, I climb the ladder, trembling as I sit on the top platform.</p>
<p>This is scary… Why is it so frightening just because it’s a bit high? Is there a bug in my brain?</p>
<p>But I have no choice. I don’t plan on asking anyone for help, and there’s no one to ask in the first place.</p>
<p>I stretch out to place the books in the empty shelf… but can’t reach.</p>
<p>…I need to stand on the platform for this!</p>
<p>“Eeeek… impossible…”</p>
<p>Despite my protests, I stand on the platform. Isn’t it against the rules to stand on a ladder like this? Something about a safety hazard…</p>
<p>Trembling, I manage to insert the books.</p>
<p>One book, two books, damn, these books are heavy! Not just my legs, but my hands start to tremble too.</p>
<p>The third book, a bit too far—</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Ah, indeed.</p>
<p>Reaching out too far caused me to lose balance, and my weak body couldn’t correct it.</p>
<p>“Ah, whoa, Kyaa…”</p>
<p>Teetering on the platform, I felt my center of gravity shift fatally.</p>
<p>I knew I was going to fall, but couldn’t stop it. A wave of fear washed over me, and I couldn’t even scream properly.</p>
<p>“~!!”</p>
<p>Eventually, I completely lost balance.</p>
<p>Falling towards the floor, I instinctively closed my eyes tight…</p>
<p>“I made it!”</p>
<p>“…Ah?”</p>
<p>There was an impact.</p>
<p>…But it was far softer than I anticipated. I had fallen to the floor, but I was on top of something.</p>
<p>Or rather, someone.</p>
<p>“…Wha?”</p>
<p>“I managed to catch you, didn’t I? My reflexes aren’t completely gone yet.”</p>
<p>Turning around, that face, which I had stolen glances at countless times today, was incredibly close.</p>
<p>“Miya, shi, ro, kun…?”</p>
<p>Right now, he and I were… our bodies were touching closely…</p>
<p>“~!! I’m so sorry! I…!”</p>
<p>“Sorry here too, I wish I could’ve caught you more smoothly.”</p>
<p>As I hastily stood up and bowed, Miyashiro-kun spoke in his characteristic tone and voice.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say it was a close call, so forgive me?”</p>
<p>When I looked up, his wry smile entered my field of vision as he slowly stood up.</p>
<p>My heart leaped, and my breath stopped. Too many things had happened all at once, and my head felt like it was going to explode.</p>
<p>He saved me? It certainly seemed so. Even more physically close than when I watched his tennis match.</p>
<p>My whole body was extremely hot, and the cold air of the library that I had felt earlier was no longer perceptible.</p>
<p>But more than the heat or anything, there was something I needed to confirm first.</p>
<p>“Um, Miya, Miyashiro-kun, are you… hurt?”</p>
<p>“Not at all, not at all. Seems fine. Kujo-san, you’re surprisingly light. How about you?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine! …Really, you’re not hurt?”</p>
<p>I’d have to seppuku myself here if I had caused an injury to his dominant arm. (tln : seppuku is cutting your own abdoment etc, search it on google)</p>
<p>“Seems all good.”</p>
<p>He said, doing a hand gesture of okay. He truly seemed fine.</p>
<p>“…That’s good.”</p>
<p>Feeling my strength leave my knees, I, who had just gotten up, slumped back onto the floor.</p>
<p>“Anyway, um, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome. It must be tough inserting books up high, is that part of the library committee’s work?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes…”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>He extended his hand to me, who was sitting on the floor. I grasped it as if being drawn in, and felt his hand was slightly cool.</p>
<p>At the same time, I worried absurdly whether he found the heat of my hand strange.</p>
<p>“I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but…”</p>
<p>After he helped me stand, Miyashiro-kun picked up some books that had fallen and climbed the ladder. Unlike me, he didn’t need to stand on the platform to reach the shelf.</p>
<p>“Alright, I can insert them. Kujo-san, could you pass me the rest?”</p>
<p>“But, it’s my job…”</p>
<p>“Let’s go with the most efficient way. ‘We should always play our best move, right?’ ”</p>
<p>“Kujo-san, you say that a lot.” Miyashiro-kun said with a gentle smile.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>I must be dead, right? Because otherwise, this is just too convenient for me…</p>
<p>“Um, ah, …yes.”</p>
<p>My brain not functioning properly, I continued to pass books to Miyashiro-kun on the ladder.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t make it three days in a row, huh. Since Sunday came in between.”</p>
<p>“Do, you mean, talking, to me?”</p>
<p>In the almost empty, after-school library.</p>
<p>“Yeah. But since I managed to make it just in time for such a moment, it’s all good.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The pounding heartbeat, the sweating body. Fear of saying something weird mingled with the desire to talk about various things.</p>
<p>This is what it means to like someone, to be with someone you like.</p>
<p>It’s unbelievably like a lie.</p>
<p>Hey, because I…</p>
<p>…used to hate you at first.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>I didn’t just dislike him; I even hated him. And now, here we are.</p>
<p>“Miyashiro-kun, why are you… in the library? Don’t you always spend your after-school hours drawing?”</p>
<p>“I was planning to, but I thought I’d better doing the math homework first. If I go home, I’ll definitely end up not doing it.”</p>
<p>In the light tinged with the hue of sunset streaming through the window, I am here with the person I like. His gaze frequently meets mine directly, and his words are spun solely for me.</p>
<p>“When I was solving problems at that desk, I saw Kujo-san coming in with that heavy box. I thought I should check if you were okay, and just in the nick of time, too, before you fell off the ladder. I’m glad I made it.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you, really. Um…”</p>
<p>If I’m ever going to muster the courage, ──it’s probably now.</p>
<p>“I want to thank you, is that okay?”</p>
<p>“Thank me?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I…”</p>
<p>When I feel like hiding my true feelings and thoughts, I tend to speak quickly, adding unnecessary words.</p>
<p>So, now I am going to.</p>
<p>“Are you good at math?”</p>
<p>Take a slow breath and only say what’s necessary.</p>
<p>The only things I want to convey.</p>
<p>“Do you want to work on the assignment together?”</p>
<p>The time it takes for him to answer feels like an eternity, during which I remember.</p>
<p>How much I loathed this person.</p>
<p>And how I fell in love with him, half a year ago.</p>
<p>◆◇◆</p>
<p>Every time I heard the phrase “being human,” I couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>To me, that phrase seemed to point to things like sensibilities not bound by rules, judgments made on the fly, or irrationalities that seemed illogical.</p>
<p>None of that seemed beautiful to me.</p>
<p>What I found beautiful was synonymous with what was orderly.</p>
<p>Cold, relentless rules and clear logic. The order built upon these shone like the most brilliant gemstone to me.</p>
<p>The various laws of mathematics and physics were always mesmerizingly attractive.</p>
<p>That’s why I loved engineering. Because with the beautiful power of mathematics and physics, I could make sense of this reality.</p>
<p>Disliking “humanity” and not meshing well with those around me was inevitable.</p>
<p>Apparently, my brain developed early enough to be labeled a genius, and by the time I was in elementary school, I had completely abandoned the very notion of socializing.</p>
<p>To begin with, I couldn’t find interest in the topics people around me talked about. And conversely, what interested me was of no interest to them.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for me to lose interest in humans themselves. I hardly talked to anyone other than my family and didn’t feel inconvenienced by it.</p>
<p>I, a genius who truly understood what beauty was, lived differently from those who got excited over trivial matters.</p>
<p>The world needed people like me, and the rest were just surplus.</p>
<p>Even though I was aware of my arrogance, I had no intention of changing and lived proudly.</p>
<p>That was how I, Kujo Kurenai, lived my life ── until December of my first year in high school.</p>
<p>“It’s so cold…”</p>
<p>That day, I was wandering around the school building after classes. The sunset had already begun, and the corridors were growing dim and cold.</p>
<p>However, I had a purpose for roaming.</p>
<p>“Alright, this one opens too.”</p>
<p>An unauthorized copy of a master key. I was checking its functionality on various doors.</p>
<p>I would unlock a door, feel satisfied, and then lock it again. I didn’t plan to check every single room, but I wanted to inspect most of them.</p>
<p>After going through most of the floors with classrooms, I headed to areas like the music and resource rooms.</p>
<p>In front of me was the art prep room. Light was on in the adjacent art room, presumably the art club in action (at this point, I didn’t know there was no art club).</p>
<p>Well, I might as well check just the prep room then.</p>
<p>Without knowing what awaited me, I inserted the key into the lock with a very light-hearted thought.</p>
<p>But turning it, I felt nothing. Oh, it was already unlocked.</p>
<p>Feeling somewhat curious, a whim made me decide to peek inside. Despite my disdain for such illogical actions, I went ahead and did it that day.</p>
<p>If there was a crossroads of fate, this was it. But then, “fate” is too unscientific a term, perhaps it’s better to call it a critical juncture for the future.</p>
<p>Sliding the slightly aged door open with a clatter, I stepped inside. Flicking the light switch on, after a lag typical of old fluorescent lights, the dim interior was illuminated.</p>
<p>The room, true to its name as a prep room, was lined with tools likely used for drawing, not that I knew much about them.</p>
<p>And then, ── there were paintings hung on the walls.</p>
<p>Not many, maybe five or six in total.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I distinctly remember the sound of me swallowing my saliva.</p>
<p>Because, even from a distance, I realized something.</p>
<p>It’s not just “good,” or “beautiful.”</p>
<p>There was no room for such thoughts. It wasn’t about that, it wasn’t about that at all. What was in this room was beyond such dimensions.</p>
<p>A loud alarm was going off in my head. An instinctual warning that I should turn on my heel and leave immediately.</p>
<p>So, I ignored it. Because it wasn’t logical. I didn’t want to rely on intuition.</p>
<p>With an intensity that made me forget to blink, I closely observed the first painting.</p>
<p>A forest scene. Quiet and mysteriously gentle, just standing in front of it made me feel enveloped in a sleep-like softness.</p>
<p>The second, next to it, was a bird. Its lone journey through the twilight brought not swiftness or sharpness but a painful wistfulness and a pride in its flight.</p>
<p>…I see.</p>
<p>Those struck by it would surely feel it piercing deep. Such formidable paintings. I see, I see, impressive, indeed.</p>
<p>But it’s okay. I can observe these without losing my composure, without being shaken from my foundation.</p>
<p>Don’t scare me like that.</p>
<p>With a sigh, I relaxed, took a few steps further into the room……</p>
<p>And then, I encountered the third painting.</p>
<p>“A────────”</p>
<p>The moment I recognized it, I was blown away.</p>
<p>My ability to grasp reality was completely stripped away, and I could no longer perceive the surrounding scenery or the passing time.</p>
<p>In my world, there was only me and that painting. Everything else was blown away.</p>
<p>It was a painting, yet it was also an impact itself.</p>
<p>“…Ah, W-what…, huft…”</p>
<p>When I returned to reality, looking outside, the sun that should have been setting was completely gone.</p>
<p>How long had I been standing here? I had no idea.</p>
<p>A copy of the master key lay at my feet. I hadn’t noticed it slipping from my hand or hitting the floor.</p>
<p>I touched my face. …Hot. Hot, hot. Incredibly so.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be.</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>I glared fiercely at the painting before me.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>“Why…!”</p>
<p>As I uttered those words, I clenched my fists tightly. The emotions that surged forth were a mix of shame and anger.</p>
<p>──Why… why does such a painting exist!!</p>
<p>Unlike the first painting that depicted a forest or the second one that featured a bird, this painting didn’t clearly show what its motif was. It was perhaps an abstract piece.</p>
<p>The structure was simple.</p>
<p>At the center of the white canvas, there was only a rounded blue pattern.</p>
<p>The pattern resembled a distorted egg, hesitant to be born, or it seemed like a raindrop reluctantly giving up on several things as it fell into solitude.</p>
<p>What was clear to me, in any case, was that it represented me.</p>
<p>For some inexplicable reason, I felt that strongly at that moment, my head boiling over with the nonsensical emotion of having “my heart painted without permission.” And immediately after, I became furious with myself for feeling such an absurd anger.</p>
<p>I picked up the key and rushed out of the art prep room. I don’t remember how I made it home.</p>
<p>I skipped dinner and locked myself in my room, causing quite a worry for my family.</p>
<p>I buried myself under the duvet on my bed. The feeling of embarrassment wouldn’t fade.</p>
<p>Even with my eyes closed, I couldn’t get that painting out of my head.</p>
<p>…Having no interest in humans.</p>
<p>Thinking it’s okay to be alone at school, without friends I can truly understand.</p>
<p>Those feelings aren’t a lie.</p>
<p>They’re not a lie, but…</p>
<p>It’s not like I completely lack the desire for friends who share my interests, who like the same things as much as I do.</p>
<p>I’m like a misshapen egg, covered in a shell of timidity, a powerless and lonely raindrop that can do nothing but fall.</p>
<p>That painting reminded me of such things I had pretended to forget.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh, ughhhhh…!”</p>
<p>Frustration, irritation. Damn it, damn it, damn it!</p>
<p>It’s just a painting. Just that. Whoever made it, just painted.</p>
<p>Don’t act like you understand me just because you slapped some paint on paper or canvas!</p>
<p>“…Ughhhhh!”</p>
<p>Of course, logically speaking, I’m the one talking nonsense.</p>
<p>After all, there’s no connection between me and the unknown artist of that painting. The painting was created completely independent of my existence.</p>
<p>Yet, I thought, “This painting depicts me.” I also thought, “This painting was directed at me.”</p>
<p>That’s impossible, that’s impossible, it’s logically absurd. There’s no causal connection, no consistency.</p>
<p>While my logical conclusion denied it, my emotions refused to accept it. Torn by the contradiction within myself, I writhed in agony.</p>
<p>Unable to sleep a wink, I crept out of bed in the dim dawn.</p>
<p>“…It’s a bug, human’s.” (tln : bug as in error on program)</p>
<p>I had twisted out what seemed to be the most plausible answer.</p>
<p>It was nothing more than a cheap illusion. That must be it, I’ll prove it.</p>
<p>Turning on my PC, I rapidly typed out code on the keyboard. It wasn’t hard at all, and soon, I had created an image auto-generation program.</p>
<p>When I ran it, images with a structure similar to the painting I had seen in the art prep room—a white background with a blue pattern—began to appear on the screen one after another.</p>
<p>“Watch this…”</p>
<p>Initially, such images seemed to be created by randomly dripping paint onto a canvas. So, if I auto-generated thousands of similar images, surely among them would appear images that have the same impact on me.</p>
<p>When humans see vague shapes, they automatically recognize them as “something” they know and attribute meaning to them. It’s one of the bugs humans carry.</p>
<p>In essence, that painting was just an attack exploiting that frailty. By drawing something vaguely similar, everyone interprets it in their own way, and among them, some will even be moved by chance. A shallow trick hoping for a hit.</p>
<p>Believing so, I checked the generated images.</p>
<p>While attending school, I spent days looking at an enormous number of images.</p>
<p>The count was supposed to be in the thousands but ultimately reached one hundred thousand.</p>
<p>Even if it took one second per image, that’s about twenty-eight hours in total.</p>
<p>It might seem ridiculous to others, but I was serious, desperate.</p>
<p>I had to do it… to admit that the painting wasn’t a fluke.</p>
<p>The day after I finished checking the one hundred thousandth image, I found myself visiting the art prep room again after school.</p>
<p>Even with my eyes closed, something with a blue pattern kept floating behind my eyelids, almost driving me to a neurotic state. Honestly, I didn’t want to see another painting ever again.</p>
<p>But, I wanted to reconfirm that painting. That impact.</p>
<p>However, in such a state, I might not feel anything even if I saw that painting again. What should I do then, be happy or…</p>
<p>Such worries were needless.</p>
<p>“Ah…────”</p>
<p>Seeing that painting once more blew away all the failed blue patterns that had been wriggling behind my eyelids.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I had no choice but to admit.</p>
<p>I created a hundred thousand images with a similar composition. Yet, not once did I feel the same impact from those images as I did from the painting before me. Not even a hint of it.</p>
<p>I had come to understand that it wasn’t about the difference between the real painting and the images.</p>
<p>This was clearly painted with intention. Not specifically targeting me, but with enough skill and talent to make me think so.</p>
<p>Beautiful. The painting before me was beautiful.</p>
<p>Amazing. Truly amazing. I admit it.</p>
<p>And because of that, what filled me was hatred.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>I clenched my fists tightly, hardly aware of my nails digging into my palms due to my boiling frustration.</p>
<p>Hatred towards the person who painted it. Essentially, it was resentment turned upside down. Though I knew it, I couldn’t help but hate.</p>
<p>To begin with, I never had particularly positive feelings towards paintings.</p>
<p>I know that paintings involve a lot of techniques and theories. Still, I feel like at their core is something like sensibility or “humanity.”</p>
<p>Even what’s before me now seems like a painting that stands in opposition to my belief in beauty—a cold, rule-based, logically clear order.</p>
<p>Yet, my heart is so stirred, and… I find it beautiful. Adding insult to injury, that felt humiliating.</p>
<p>I hate the person who painted this.</p>
<p>If they hadn’t drawn such a thing, I wouldn’t have been made to feel this humiliation.</p>
<p>…And wouldn’t have been forced to confront the wishes I had tucked away deep inside, barely acknowledging them myself.</p>
<p>“Damn, damn, …damn!”</p>
<p>I wanted to see their face. I hadn’t thought about what to do next, but I just couldn’t stand leaving things as they were.</p>
<p>I had found out whose work it was. The art teacher told me when I asked.</p>
<p>Miyashiro Kuuya. A freshman like me.</p>
<p>A student who, despite being a freshman, had reached the top in the oil painting category at a national high school competition organized by the government this year.</p>
<p>There’s no art club at this school, and currently, the person working in the art room is him.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Knowing that the person who painted this was in the next room made me feel odd.</p>
<p>I put my hand on the door connecting the art prep room to the art room.</p>
<p>I wasn’t thinking of starting a conversation or picking a fight. I just couldn’t go home feeling like I had been punched one-sidedly… I wasn’t even sure what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>I slowly, very slowly opened the door and peeked through.</p>
<p>What kind of person could they be? Someone who paints such, in a way, superhuman paintings must be different from ordinary people, perhaps fitting the mold of an artist…</p>
<p>“…Ah”</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>In the art room, there was indeed one person present—</p>
<p>Lying on the floor, face up.</p>
<p>“What, wait… are you okay!?”</p>
<p>Bursting through the door I had been secretly opening slowly, I ran over to the person. I’m not strong enough to just ignore someone who’s collapsed.</p>
<p>“Um, should I call an ambulance? No, maybe the school nurse first? Or should I find another teacher?”</p>
<p>As I was panicking, his eyes, those of Miyashiro Kuuya, opened and he fixed his gaze on me.</p>
<p>For a few seconds, the depth of his gaze took my breath away.</p>
<p>“…Uh?”</p>
<p>“Sorry for startling you. No need for an ambulance or a teacher. Thanks though,” he said, his voice a bit hoarse, not sounding quite alright.</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“…You know how you feel heavy after getting out of the pool?”</p>
<p>“…? Yeah, but…”</p>
<p>“It’s kinda like that right now… Just a really, really bad version of it. It happens often, I’ll be fine after resting a bit.”</p>
<p>His voice, gestures, even his blinking seemed lethargic. Can he really be okay?</p>
<p>…Why am I even worrying this much?</p>
<p>As I was shaking off the shock of seeing someone collapsed on the floor, he started to get up.</p>
<p>“Though, I should probably get up now. Sorry for the scare, and thanks for worrying… Uh”</p>
<p>“…Kujo Kurenai. First year.”</p>
<p>“Same grade, huh? Good, I was speaking informally. I’m Miyashiro Kuuya.”</p>
<p>His way of speaking was slow, likely due to his languor, devoid of any intimidation or aggression.</p>
<p>…So this person is the artist of that painting.</p>
<p>He might carry a somewhat mysterious aura. Yet, it doesn’t match the intensity of that painting. Surprising.</p>
<p>As I was blankly staring, he stood up, moved to a nearby chair, and sat down with his back turned towards me.</p>
<p>Until now, I hadn’t even noticed the chair, nor the easel placed in front of it—with a canvas depicting a half-finished painting that seemed to dance.</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>I gasped upon finally noticing it.</p>
<p>It looked like the sea was there. An incomplete sea.</p>
<p>After blinking thrice, I finally accepted it was a painting of the sea in progress. What is this?</p>
<p>It wasn’t hyper-realistic like a photograph. Yet, the essence of the sea, and more importantly, the image people seek in the sea, seemed even clearer than the actual sea itself.</p>
<p>What spread before me was a deep, overwhelming, unconditional sense of security.</p>
<p>“Alright…”</p>
<p>He murmured, picking up a palette and brush to resume his work.</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>Behind him, I couldn’t help but let out an astounded sound.</p>
<p>Who wouldn’t, when witnessing a miracle right before their eyes? Each stroke he made was miraculous, making me want to excuse my dumbfounded reaction.</p>
<p>With every brushstroke on the canvas, the sea gained more presence and vitality. In a manner that seemed almost irrational to me, a breathtaking beauty was being assembled.</p>
<p>The sea became more like the sea. Turning into the homeland people yearn for.</p>
<p>──…But.</p>
<p>“…Haah, …Huuuh, …”</p>
<p>With every dab of color he added to the canvas, he let out heavy breaths.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/00016.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>He looked visibly in pain.</p>
<p>Realizing I had been gripping the hem of my skirt while watching him for some time, I finally spoke up, unable to hold back any longer.</p>
<p>“It looks tough… Why do you paint if it’s so hard? Do you like it that much?”</p>
<p>“I do like it. And… I’m arrogant,” he evaluated himself similarly to how I might evaluate myself. Continuing in a voice colored with visible hardship, he said,</p>
<p>“My paintings can empower others. That’s what I believe. So, I don’t want to stop painting.”</p>
<p>Despite how frail his voice and posture seemed, the painting unfolding before him was vividly alive. I could almost smell the life it depicted.</p>
<p>For something made of paint, it was too vibrant.</p>
<p>…It was as if.</p>
<p>A strange thought crossed my mind. Something fantastical, fairy-tale-like, yet incredibly cruel.</p>
<p>“…Could it be that”</p>
<p>You’re using it to paint.</p>
<p>Your own—</p>
<p>“…No, forget I said anything.”</p>
<p>That’s unscientific. I eventually clamped my mouth shut, changing the subject.</p>
<p>“Empowering others, huh? You’re painting for the sake of strangers you’ve never met?”</p>
<p>“If you put it that way, yes.”</p>
<p>I later learned he received requests to paint for various facilities.</p>
<p>“…I can’t understand. They’re strangers, after all. To me, it sounds too idealistic.”</p>
<p>Persistently badgering him despite his obvious discomfort, I ended up saying something quite nasty. I felt dizzy with my own frankness, but it was truly how I felt.</p>
<p>And to that, he responded in a cheerful tone, laughter evident even with his back turned.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with idealism? I’m a painter. I love what’s clean and beautiful. Art is written with the characters for ‘technique of beauty,’ after all.”</p>
<p>“…I like beautiful things too. Though what I consider beautiful is probably different from what you think.”</p>
<p>But I find your paintings beautiful… That was something I couldn’t bring myself to say, my pride getting in the way.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, isn’t it? Beauty standards differ from person to person. …I honestly can’t tell if my paintings are beautiful.”</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>“But, …even if they’re not beautiful, that’s okay.”</p>
<p>Without stopping his hand, he continued in a breath-heavy tone, as if climbing a snowy mountain, obviously using up various things as he painted.</p>
<p>“…There are as many unpleasant things in the world as there are good. Things that are painful, hard, or lonely. So in this world, …I think it’d be good if there were even one more painting that could sit beside someone’s pain, hardship, or loneliness, even if it’s not beautiful.”</p>
<p>And finally, he said,</p>
<p>“That’s why I paint. That’s all there is to it.”</p>
<p>If I exaggerated a bit, he spoke and sounded as if he could die at any moment, yet his hands never stopped.</p>
<p>In a dusty art room of a provincial public high school, he shared the reason he fought alone every day after school, risking his life.</p>
<p>It was an idealism.</p>
<p>A very beautiful, pure form of idealism.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it was the beauty of “humanity” I had always despised, couldn’t understand, and wanted to stay away from.</p>
<p>An idiotic brilliance that completely disregarded the best move.</p>
<p>Realizing it was dazzling at the same moment, I felt my body heat up.</p>
<p>Half of it was from embarrassment.</p>
<p>If being significantly better than average qualifies someone as a genius, then I think I’d fit in. Surely, or rather definitely, he would too.</p>
<p>But the way he and I use our abilities is just too different.</p>
<p>I saw brilliance in his idealism. I felt an aspiration. That’s why I ended up feeling embarrassed about myself.</p>


<p>Then, the other half of the reason my body felt hot was—</p>
<p>That was—</p>
<p>“…I’m going home.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Take care… Wait, why were you here in the first place?”</p>
<p>Ignoring his words, I quickly left the room. It was almost like fleeing.</p>
<p>“Stupid humans…”</p>
<p>Such words spilled out of my mouth as a result of my confusion.</p>
<p>“Stupid humans, stupid humans, stupid humans…!”</p>
<p>I’ve lived my life thinking that about humans.</p>
<p>And yet, …stupid humans!</p>
<p>Without feeling the coldness of the corridor that had made me shiver on the way there, I eventually left the school and arrived home. I don’t remember the journey back.</p>
<p>Once again, I locked myself in my room without having dinner, causing my family to worry…</p>
<p>──Eventually, I came to terms and realized.</p>
<p>…I had fallen in love.</p>
<p>…And, if only it could just end up as a normal unrequited love situation, wondering what I could do to make it come true, and feeling a strong desire to know more about him, I soon found myself slipping into the role of a stalker.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell my family or anyone.</p>
<p>◆◇◆</p>
<p>“That’s how it goes, …yeah, that’s the answer.”</p>
<p>“Ah~ I see, got it.”</p>
<p>After solving one problem, Miyashiro-kun muttered, “So, this is how it’s solved…”</p>
<p>“Thanks, you’re really good at teaching, Kujo-san.”</p>
<p>“I wonder. Maybe it’s because I often teach my sister.”</p>
<p>In a corner of the library, the two of us sat side by side, speaking in low voices, doing our math assignments.</p>
<p>“You have a sister? Are you two close even you teach her?”</p>
<p>“Well, …it depends on how you look at it. She always tries to provoke me whenever she sees an opening.”</p>
<p>“Really? Over what?”</p>
<p>Mostly… about my love life. …Basically, about you.</p>
<p>“Various things, she lacks respect for her sister.”</p>
<p>Of course, I couldn’t say that, so I dodged the question.</p>
<p>“I see. I’m an only child, so I don’t really understand how close sibling are. I’ve always wanted one, though, be it an older brother, sister, or a younger sibling. Ah, but I guess I have a childhood friend who’s like a sister.”</p>
<p>“Ado-san?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Though, she’s become so reliable now, I can’t really call her a ‘sister’ anymore.”</p>
<p>“Was she different before?”</p>
<p>“Quite a bit. She was shy and timid. Not as expressive with her emotions as she is now. Though her being hardworking hasn’t changed.”</p>
<p>When Miyashiro-kun talks about Ado-san, he looks like he’s bragging about his most treasured possession.</p>
<p>The bond between them, visible in his expression, filled me with envy.</p>
<p>To make him show such a face, I was jealous of Ado-san.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I help her study, but that’s only because I’m a grade above. If we were in the same year, it’d be impossible. I’d be the one learning.”</p>
<p>I had no idea.</p>
<p>That having your crush talk about another girl could squeeze your heart so tightly.</p>
<p>“Ado-san is amazing, being good at sports and all.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she’s really something. A true example of excelling both in studies and sports through hard work.”</p>
<p>I had no idea.</p>
<p>That even though I didn’t want him to talk about another girl, I would still bring her up, hoping it would make him happy.</p>
<p>I knew nothing.</p>
<p>“During the holidays, she’s always busy with requests from various clubs. With that, I bet her summer break will be hectic too… Ah, speaking of which, summer break is next month, right?”</p>
<p>While working on the problems, he suddenly mentioned it. It’s mid-June now, so summer break is indeed approaching.</p>
<p>“That’s true. Can’t wait.”</p>
<p>Truthfully, I wasn’t looking forward to it at all. Because I won’t be able to see Miyashiro-kun for over a month.</p>
<p>“What do you usually do during summer break, Kujo-san?”</p>
<p>“I try out new languages… Oh, I mean programming languages, not spoken ones. And some electronics projects.”</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s so cool.”</p>
<p>“Cool, you think?”</p>
<p>Cool, you think!</p>
<p>I was secretly thrilled to be praised.</p>
<p>…No, but, on second thought. Wouldn’t it have been better to mention something more traditionally feminine and cute? Programming… Electronics projects…</p>
<p>Oh, wait, we’re talking about summer break!</p>
<p>I had found a good summer leisure spot that’s easy to get to and had been planning to mention it. It was for the sake of Ado-san, who seemed to be busy with her sports club activities, something Miyashiro-kun was curious about.</p>
<p>“What do you usually do during summer break, Miyashiro-kun? I mean, I can guess but…”</p>
<p>“I paint, as you’d expect. We’re both indoor types, huh?”</p>
<p>I was trying to find the right moment to bring it up when he said that. Indoor types, meaning we have that in common… Miyashiro-kun and I are… in sync…!</p>
<p>I almost lost my mind with that thought, so I pinched my thigh to regain my sanity.</p>
<p>“But I do think I should exercise a bit for my health. Ideally, somewhere not too hot if I’m going to work out.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>A cool place for exercise, this is it! This is the moment! The best move!</p>
<p>“Miyashiro-kun, have you heard? This summer, a new pool is opening in the town next door. It’s supposed to be quite big.”</p>
<p>“Really? I hadn’t heard. Wow, that’s cool.”</p>
<p>“There’s a direct bus from the station, so it’s easy to get to. It’s open late, so you can avoid the daytime heat too.”</p>
<p>“Awesome.”</p>
<p>The sea, mountains, theme parks—they take time, but this place could be a quick getaway. If it’s open late, you could even go after club activities (though I’m not sure if you’d have the energy for it, having no experience with sports clubs myself).</p>
<p>“By the way, to avoid overcrowding, they’re only allowing entry with pre-purchased tickets for a while. They start selling them at the beginning of next month.”</p>
<p>“Huh… Do you usually go to places like that, Kujo-san?”</p>
<p>“No, I… ”</p>
<p>I began to answer, then realized.</p>
<p>…Is this… like asking him out?</p>
<p>Reviewing the situation, it seems I haven’t brought up Ado-san at all, so it’s just me suggesting a “good place” to Miyashiro-kun, who’s interested in exercising.</p>
<p>…Does this count as asking? Or am I overthinking it? No, I really can’t tell.</p>
<p>“…I don’t usually go, but… maybe”</p>
<p>I’m not sure, but… if I push further.</p>
<p>Maybe this year, I thought about trying those places out, but didn’t have anyone to go with… so, if you’d like…</p>
<p>Right here, if I had said—</p>
<p>“Wow, Kuuya, it’s rare to see you in the library.”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>A voice suddenly called us, and I swallowed the words I was about to say.</p>
<p>“Oh, what brings you here?”</p>
<p>“I needed some books.”</p>
<p>The girl, with a smile as bright as a lit lamp, was already standing close by our table. True to her words, she held several books against her chest.</p>
<p>“Ah, we were working on math assignments… and, well, it’s hard, so I was getting some help.”</p>
<p>“I see. …Um, and you are?”</p>
<p>Her wide, earnest eyes locked onto me.</p>
<p>“Kujo Kurenai from the same class. Ranked first in the national math mock exam.”</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s amazing! So cool!”</p>
<p>Her voice was lively, kept to a considerate volume. The choice of “cool” and her sparkling eyes…</p>
<p>…Her reaction felt similar to Miyashiro-kun’s. It made me instantly feel the length of time they’ve spent together.</p>
<p>“It’s not a big deal.”</p>
<p>I said, slightly looking away.</p>
<p>Ado Suika. Ado-san. This was our first conversation. A shining, wonderful, normal girl. Everything about her felt different from me.</p>
<p>“Are you going to a club activity today, Suika?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m heading straight home. My mom asked me to do some shopping. …Oh, would you like to come with me?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Yay, thank you so much!”</p>
<p>Shopping after school with Miyashiro-kun, just the two of them. To me, that was harder to achieve than scoring first in the national mock exam, and something I deeply longed for.</p>
<p>The difference in our standing was so vast, it felt presumptuous to even call it a “gap.”</p>
<p>“…The rest of the problems can be solved using the method I showed you at the beginning.”</p>
<p>With that, I started packing up my things and stood up from my chair.</p>
<p>“Ah, are you leaving too, Kujo-san? Sorry for cutting this short.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. Thanks for today, goodbye.”</p>
<p>As soon as I said that, I quickly moved away from the spot. I thought I wouldn’t be able to stand being left alone after Miyashiro-kun and Ado-san left together.</p>
<p>Making such a decision felt pitiful in itself.</p>
<p>The excitement I had felt was all gone, as if it had been an illusion from the start.</p>
<p>“…Sigh.”</p>
<p>I let out a small sigh, ensuring no one could hear, as I opened the door to the library. Before leaving the room, I glanced back to see Miyashiro-kun and Ado-san, wrapped in an intimate atmosphere.</p>
<p>But really, I’m so unlucky. Of all times, why did Ado-san have to show up when Miyashiro-kun and I were alone together? What are the chances?</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>…Right, she did have quite the timing.</p>
<p>Almost too perfect, if not a bit suspicious.</p>
