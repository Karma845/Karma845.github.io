<h2>Chapter 2: Bento</h2>


<p>It had been four days since Touka-san came to our house.</p>
<p>My late grandpa used to say that when a new family member arrives, life changes significantly.</p>
<p>True to his words, life had indeed changed drastically with the addition of a new family member, especially when it came to meals.</p>
<p>The number of times my mother stood in the kitchen noticeably decreased.</p>
<p>In her place, the one who often took over the kitchen duties was my future bride.</p>
<p>She said it was a great help because my mother was frequently suffering from morning sickness.</p>
<p>For me, having new and exciting dishes on the table was a pleasant change.</p>
<p>It was nice, but——</p>

<p>“Here, open up! Ahh~”</p>

<p>Touka-san smiled and held a spoon with yoghurt toward me.</p>

<p>“That… from the morning, please don’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Ha-kun, open wide!”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b13.png" alt="" />

<p>This person is not listening to my requests at all!</p>
<p>I mean, how can she do such a foolish thing in front of my parents?</p>

<p>“Come on, open up!”</p>
<p>“Hey, son, it’s a husband’s duty to respond when your wife feeds you.”</p>
<p>“Unlike you; I’m a tough guy. So, I absolutely won’t do such sweet things!”</p>
<p>“Huh? But you let me feed you yesterday morning.”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“Hey-hey Mama, did you hear that? This sulky son of ours acts all spoiled and lets Touka-chan feed him when we’re not around!”</p>
<p>“Yeah Papa, I heard it. This perverted son seems to act like a baby when we’re not here!”</p>
<p>“…tsk.”</p>

<p>My parents are already so annoying from the morning.</p>

<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue at your parents.”</p>

<p>Touka-san scolded me.</p>
<p>But even so, she still didn’t retract that spoon full of yoghurt.</p>

<p>Sigh…it can’t be helped.</p>
<p>Really, I don’t have a choice.</p>
<p>It’s not that I want to, but I guess it can’t be helped.</p>

<p>I’m so angry that these idiots are grinning at me, but I suppose I’ll have to go along with it to show my appreciation to Touka-san, who made a delicious breakfast early in the morning.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, I open my mouth and take a bite of that yoghurt.</p>

<p>“Cheers! My son just did ‘Ahh’ in front of his father!”</p>
<p>“Yayyy! My son just did ‘Ahh~’ in front of his mother!”</p>
<p>” …….. “</p>

<p>These idiots were already high-fiving each other with high tension from the morning…</p>
<p>Damn it! Seriously annoying!</p>

<p>Not wanting to be teased any further, I ignored them and decided to watch the morning news program.</p>
<p>On the TV screen, it was showing a place I had visited recently.</p>

<p>“Huh? Isn’t this the shopping mall we went to the day before yesterday?”</p>

<p>I said that and pointed to the TV.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s true!”</p>

<p>Touka-san was surprised just like me. What could this news be about?</p>
<p>The four of us in the family stared at the TV.</p>
<p>The caption read,『Serial Road Rage Offender Effortlessly Apprehended by Mysterious Beautiful Magician!』</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s that guy!”</p>

<p>I stood up in astonishment.</p>
<p>On the TV screen, there was a familiar man, handcuffed and being led away by the police while looking down.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the arrested man was the troublemaker who had tried to hit Himegi-san that time.</p>
<p>The TV female anchor explained the circumstances of the man’s arrest in a calm tone.</p>
<p>It seemed that the man had been a habitual aggressive driver and had been on the police’s radar for a while.</p>

<p>“Hey, not just road rage, but this guy, is he involved in car theft too? He’s a real scumbag.”</p>

<p>My father directed his anger at the guy who tried to hit on Himegi-san.</p>
<p>Although there was a difference between a bike and a car, my father probably felt strongly about this matter since he deals with vehicles that people use.</p>
<p>Maybe the car he was bragging about back then was stolen as well.</p>

<p>“It seems like there are other crimes he was involved in.”</p>

<p>Well, at any rate, it’s good that they caught a dangerous criminal.</p>

<p>“Hey, isn’t that little guy on the TV, Hakuba?”</p>
<p>“No-no, I’m not short!”</p>
<p>“No, that little guy right there!”</p>

<p>Hey, don’t keep calling your son a ‘little guy’!</p>
<p>And by the way, I’ve confirmed from the wedding video that my height has grown slightly taller than it is now in six years!</p>
<p>I watched the rest of the news, thinking my parents were really rude.</p>

<p>“Oh? It’s me!”</p>

<p>As my parents said, I was on the TV.</p>
<p>My face was pixelated, but this outfit unmistakably belonged to me.</p>
<p>The footage showed the shopping mall corridor, the exact place where I had a dispute with the pick-up guy.</p>

<p>On the TV screen, the guy who had tried to hit me was being handcuffed.</p>
<p>From the look of the footage, it seemed like someone in the crowd had recorded it probably with a smartphone.</p>
<p>Apparently, someone had provided this footage to the TV station.</p>
<p>According to the announcer’s explanation, after we left, the police rushed to the shopping mall.</p>
<p>During their investigation, it was discovered that the guy was a suspect in road rage cases.</p>

<p>In other words, if I hadn’t handcuffed him at that time and left him alone, this guy might still be out there committing crimes without a care in the world.</p>
<p>In that sense, wasn’t it quite a commendable move on my part?</p>

<p>” …. “</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems I’ve finally made a national debut.</p>
<p>In normal circumstances, I should be at least a little happy about it, but I’m not at all. I mean——</p>

<p>“But since when did our son become a ‘Mmysterious Beautiful Magician’?”</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s true! The caption says ‘Mysterious Beautiful Magician’!”</p>
<p>” …. “</p>

<p>For now, I’ll make a complaint to the TV station this afternoon.</p>
<p>They broadcast the story nationwide without even doing a proper investigation!</p>
<p>They’re really beyond reproach, these journalists.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I continued to watch the news.</p>

<p>The scene changed drastically, and footage of the guy doing road rage was shown.</p>
<p>It was very dangerous footage, and it’s a wonder that no one got hurt.</p>
<p>Well, after watching this footage, I truly think it’s good that he was caught.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s just be glad that, because of this man’s arrest, there won’t be any more victims.</p>

<p>“Oops, I have to go pick up my motorcycle early today.”</p>
<p>“Ah, right! I also have an early start today.”</p>

<p>My parents started to prepare to leave in a hurry.</p>
<p>Honestly, my parents lack elegance. And so, the two of them left with the bento that Touka-san had made for them.</p>

<p>“Now, I should head to school soon. Thank you for the meal, Touka-san.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome, it was nothing special”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do today, Touka-san?”</p>
<p>“Same as yesterday, I’ll behave like an adult and stay at home today.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>Despite saying she came to this time period with a purpose, she seems surprisingly carefree.</p>
<p>Is it really okay for her to take it so easy?</p>

<p>“It’s okay. There’s still plenty of time until the time limit…”</p>

<p>Maybe my face gave away my concern; Himegi-san reassured me not to worry.</p>

<p>“Well, I have enough time to stay in this timeline…”</p>

<p>Touka-san adjusted her clothing’s neckline and checked the number engraved on her chest.</p>

<p>“In that case, Touka-san, I’m off to school.”</p>

<p>I grabbed my school bag and headed for the entrance.</p>

<p>“Wait, Ha-kun. You forgot your bento.”</p>

<p>Touka-san made a rustling sound as she approached me and handed me the bento, wearing slippers.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you.”</p>
<p>“I put lots of your favorite things in there, Ha-kun.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the bento box was noticeably heavy.</p>
<p>A homemade bento made by Touka-san, huh?</p>
<p>I’m genuinely looking forward to it.</p>

<p>“Now, before you go to school, chu——…Ah, I got ignored!”</p>

<p>Since she asked me for something ridiculous, I pretended not to hear her and closed the front door immediately.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>Arriving in the classroom and sitting at my desk, I was greeted by an unusual person.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Ouji-kun.”</p>

<p>With a refreshing smile, Takashi Harukawa, Kanako’s beloved boyfriend and my classmate, greeted me in an equally refreshing manner.</p>

<p>“Good morning, my beloved Takakyun.”</p>
<p>“Ahahahah… Sorry, if possible, don’t call me ‘Takakyun.’ “</p>

<p>In a situation where it wouldn’t be surprising for someone to get angry over such provocation, he just smiled and brushed it off.</p>
<p>As expected of someone able to date the twisted personality Kanako, Takakyun is truly a mature individual.</p>

<p>“Anyway, Takakyun, what do you want from me?”</p>
<p>“…Is it just my imagination? It feels like you’re giving me the cold shoulder, Ouji-kun.”</p>
<p>“It’s not your imagination. Maybe you’re the enemy I have to defeat.”</p>

<p>After all, he was affectionately called ‘Takashi’ by Himegi-san.</p>
<p>If, and only if, this refreshing bastard in front of me were to say that he’s Himegi-san’s ex-boyfriend…I’d feel sorry for Kanako, but I’d have to send this man to another dimension with my ultimate magic trick,『 Another Dimension』.</p>

<p>“As for me, I’d like to get along with you, Ouji-kun…”</p>

<p>Hey, hey, don’t look at me with those sad eyes…</p>
<p>I’m starting to look like the bad guy here.</p>
<p>Th-this guy is my enemy! He’s the enemy I have to defeat!</p>

<p>“Anyway, thanks for putting up with Kanako’s whims. This is a gift from me for you.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Takakyun gently placed an unopened plastic model kit on my desk.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I had promised Kanako that I would receive an unopened plastic model kit as a reward for the investigation request to the fortune teller.</p>
<p>I had completely forgotten about it after everything that had happened.</p>

<p>“…I can’t accept this.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“The matter of the investigation was an agreement that Kanako and I decided on our own, so it wouldn’t be right for me to receive a reward from you, who is not the client.”</p>

<p>At that time, I was in high spirits and didn’t think it through, but he didn’t request the investigation from me.</p>
<p>Therefore, receiving something from him would still be out of place.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“Even if you don’t mind, I do. Kanako will make it up to me in her own way for something different, so please take this plastic model kit back this time.”</p>
<p>“Then, I’d like to ask——no, request Ouji-kun. That should be fine, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes? You want to make a request to me? Takakyun, unfortunately, I’m neither a detective nor a lawyer.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I know thatl. You’re the vice-president of the Magic Club. That’s why I’m approaching you with this request.”</p>

<p>From the way he’s saying it, it seems like it’s related to magic.</p>

<p>“Ouji-kun, could you teach me some magic tricks?”</p>

<p>As expected, his request was about magic.</p>

<p>“Why do you want me to teach you magic tricks?”</p>
<p>“I want to perform magic for a girl.”</p>

<p>So that’s what it is.</p>
<p>Despite having a girlfriend, this guy wants to show magic tricks to another girl.</p>
<p>There really are foolish people who try to learn magic with impure intentions…</p>
<p>If anyone could become popular just by doing that, then I would have built a harem a long time ago!</p>

<p>Seriously, they should apologize from the bottom of their hearts to someone like me who is earnestly committed to magic.</p>
<p>By the way, the reason Hakuba Ouji decided to learn magic in the first place was that he wanted to be popular with girls.</p>
<p>There was no other reason.</p>

<p>“What level are you aiming for?”</p>

<p>However, if he’s looking at me with such serious eyes, I can’t just turn him down.</p>

<p>“Will you teach me?”</p>

<p>“To be honest, if it’s just a simple magic trick, you’d be better off learning from a book or stealing from professional magicians who stream their performances online. It’s quicker that way.”</p>

<p>In fact, I also get hints from magic performed by professional magicians.</p>

<p>“I’d like to perform a trick that would genuinely astonish people if possible…”</p>
<p>“Basically, you’re not looking for easy tricks, huh?”</p>

<p>Takashi Harukawa nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, the morning homeroom is about to start. How about continuing this during lunch?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, and sorry for bothering you.”</p>

<p>And then, the school bell rang.</p>
<p>At the same moment, Kanako burst into the classroom, shouting ‘Safe!’</p>
<p>As usual, my childhood friend is already making a ruckus from early in the morning.</p>

<p>Unlike me, Takakyun gazes affectionately at Kanako.</p>
<p>Well, despite everything, I think they make a good couple.</p>
<p>But somehow, I have a feeling I’m about to get dragged into some trouble.</p>
<p>With those thoughts in mind, I waited for our homeroom teacher to arrive.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>During lunch break, Takakyun and I were in the Magic Club room together.</p>
<p>It seemed like there were some complicated circumstances, so I thought it would be best to invite him to this clubroom where no one was around.</p>

<p>“For now, feel free to sit wherever you like.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“It’s a bit early to thank me.”</p>

<p>Takashi Harukawa looked around with a curious expression.</p>

<p>“Is this place like an away game for you as a soccer club member?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think like that. It’s the Magic Club, after all. There are various things here.”</p>
<p>“Well okay, try not to touch too much. What’s here doesn’t belong to just me.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I understand.”</p>

<p>And so, we sat facing each other.</p>

<p>“It’s the first time we’ve talked like this, just the two of us.”</p>

<p>Indeed, as he said, this was the first time we had spoken face-to-face like this.</p>

<p>“How are things going with Kanako?”</p>
<p>“Ahh, she’s too good for me.”</p>

<p>To my surprise, I found myself slightly dazzled by his perfect smile.</p>
<p>I see; Kanako must have fallen for this smile…</p>

<p>“I want to take this opportunity to get along with you, Ouji-kun. After all, you’re Kanako’s precious childhood friend.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a rotten relationship. Right, we’re just bad friends. But regardless, for me, it’s a long-standing relationship. If you and Kanako were to have a falling out, I would probably take Kanako’s side, one way or another. Of course, if Kanako is clearly in the wrong, that’s a different story…”</p>
<p>(TN: 腐れ縁だよ, rotten relationship. A Japanese term often used to describe a relationship that may not be perfect or ideal, but one that has endured for a long time.</p>
<p>Similarly, 悪友 means a bad friend, but in this context, it means a friendship that has its flaws but remains important.)</p>

<p>I find it very frustrating, but when it comes to Kanako, I don’t think I can judge things from a neutral standpoint.</p>
<p>That’s why I intentionally avoided him.</p>

<p>“Thank you, for speaking your mind. Ouji-kun, I hope you will always be on Kanako’s side.”</p>

<p>He casually says words that make my blood boil.</p>
<p>Well, that’s probably why Kanako fell for him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I became curious about what kind of relationship he and Kanako have built six years from now.</p>
<p>Are they still lovers? Or have they married, like me and Himegi-san?</p>
<p>Regardless of the form, I hope they are as close as they are right now.</p>


<p> </p>


<p>“Anyway, let’s talk about magic. Well, you want to learn a magic trick with a strong impact, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“About that, I realized I don’t really need to perform it myself. ——Ouji-kun, why don’t you perform the magic for me?”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>From there, he begins to explain the situation.</p>
<p>It seems he has a girl in his life who is like a little sister to him, and her birthday party is scheduled to take place in six days from now.</p>
<p>He wants to perform some kind of magic at her birthday party.</p>

<p>“I see. So that’s why you chose me for this.”</p>
<p>“Please. There are many of her friends invited this time, and she’s really excited about it.”</p>

<p>Harukawa clasped his hands together and pleaded with me.</p>
<p>I was struggling to give him an answer to his request.</p>
<p>It’s Kanako’s boyfriend asking. Ideally, I would want to agree gladly.</p>
<p>But the current me is preoccupied with Touka-san, the person from the future.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don’t have time for other things.</p>
<p>While she may not mean any harm, she has caused various troubles, and I have been busy dealing with them.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s neighborhood trouble was——no, let’s not dwell on that.</p>
<p>Besides, she seems to have a purpose to fulfill in this timeline, and while it might sound conceited, I’d like to focus on supporting that purpose if I can.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I can be of any help, but if, at that time, I find myself unable to move due to other matters, I’ll deeply regret it.</p>
<p>So, I’m sorry, but I don’t think I can lend my strength to this request.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry… I’d like to help you, but I’m currently busy with a another matter…I can’t fulfill your request.</p>
<p>“I see… Sorry for suddenly making an unreasonable request…”</p>

<p>Takashi Harukawa stepped back and bowed deeply to me.</p>

<p>“I’m the one who should apologize for not meeting your expectations. If you ever decide to have a party for her next year… or even for Christmas or Halloween, please feel free to reach out to me again.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’ll keep that in mind for next time.”</p>
<p>“I promise that next time, I’ll put all my effort into performing the magic trick.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much. Ouji-kun, if it’s okay with you, would you like to have lunch here?”</p>
<p>“Of course. If you don’t mind, we can have our lunch together——”</p>

<p>Thinking that, I was about to take out my bento from my bag when Kanako and Himegi-san appeared in the hallway, each carrying a bento.</p>
<p>It’s really an unusual combination to see the two of them together like this.</p>

<p>“See, they were here after all.”</p>
<p>“It was just as Chikada-san had guessed.”</p>

<p>Then, they boldly entered the club room, with Himegi-san sitting next to me and Kanako settling down next to Harukawa-kun.</p>
<p>I sent a questioning look to Harukawa-kun. He shrugged and insisted that he had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Touka. Ouji-kun declined your request.”</p>

<p>Harukawa-kun offered a brief apology to Himegi-san.</p>
<p>Huh? Why is Harukawa-kun apologizing to Himegi-san?</p>

<p>At that moment, my 530,000 intelligence quotient kicked into high gear.</p>
<p>Could it be that the girl he mentioned earlier, the one who’s like his little sister, is——Himegi-san’s sister?</p>

<p>Come to think of it, she did mention that her little sister’s birthday was coming up soon.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, refusing this request would be quite a big deal.</p>

<p>“Is that so? Well, it can’t be helped——”</p>
<p>“——So, what kind of magic tricks does your sister like?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“N-nothing, I thought you refused earlier…”</p>
<p>“——I was testing you. I wanted to know if it really had to be me.””</p>

<p>Takashi Harukawa opened his mouth wide, looking stunned.</p>
<p>Next to him, Kanako, who had figured everything out, looked at me with an exasperated expression, but right now, that doesn’t matter——</p>

<p>“Could it be that the girl Harukawa-kun was talking about, who’s like his little sister, is Himegi-san’s sister?”</p>
<p>“Yes, she’s my sister.”</p>

<p>It seems my prediction was spot on.</p>

<p>“I see, I see. Himegi-san, please rest assured. This Hakuba Ouji will perform the best magic show for your sister.”</p>
<p>“W-well, I appreciate it, but… Are you really sure?”</p>
<p>“Yes, even if my parents were to pass away on that day, I will definitely be there for your sister’s birthday.”</p>
<p>“If that happens, you really should behave like an adult and be the chief mourner for your father and mother…”</p>
<p>“Well, of course I’m just joking, but I’ll do my best with that level of dedication!”</p>

<p>Oh, I’m looking forward to this.</p>
<p>With high spirits, I took out the bento from my bag.</p>

<p>“By the way, what’s the relationship between my beloved Takakyun and Himegi-san?”</p>
<p>“Us? Ouji-kun, we’re childhood friends just like you and Kanako.”</p>
<p>“For me, he’s like a troublesome little brother.”</p>
<p>“I see, I see.”</p>

<p>I had suspected that they might have been former lovers, but it seems I was mistaken.</p>
<p>That’s good, that means I don’t have to bury Kanako’s boyfriend in darkness.</p>

<p>“Hey! Himegi-san, I have a favor to ask.”</p>
<p>“Me? A favor?”</p>
<p>“If it’s okay with you, would you be my assistant for the magic trick?”</p>
<p>“Me, as Ouji-kun’s assistant?”</p>
<p>“If Himegi-san were to assist me right next to me, I feel like I could give it my all even more.”</p>

<p>I clasped my hands together and pleaded with Himegi-san.</p>

<p>“Please!”</p>

<p>In response to my request, she hesitated for a moment but eventually said, ‘Okay,’ with a slightly troubled expression.</p>

<p>“Okay, I understand. I’ll be your assistant.”</p>
<p>“That’s great!”</p>

<p>With this, I became even more motivated.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Now, let’s all have lunch together!”</p>
<p>“That sounds good.”</p>

<p>So, each of us opened our bento on our desks.</p>
<p>Kanako’s bento was very girly, with sandwiches and fruits as the main items.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Harukawa-kun, being an athlete, had a bento filled with fried chicken, pork cutlet, and meat, giving it a hearty feel.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Himegi-san’s bento featured a character bento (charaben) of a well-known character that everyone recognizes.</p>
<p>Even though it’s a charaben, it’s colorful and well-thought-out in terms of nutritional balance.</p>
<p>Quite unexpected. I had imagined that she might bring a traditional stacked bento box, like a daughter of a prestigious family. It caught me off guard.</p>

<p>“Wow, Touka-san’s bento is so cute!”</p>
<p>“It’s a bit embarrassing.”</p>
<p>“No, not at all! Touka-san, did you make this yourself?”</p>
<p>“No, it was made by our maid. She’s been really into making character bentos lately.”</p>
<p>“I see. A maid, huh? By the way, it’s unusual to see you with a bento.”</p>
<p>“…Well, yeah.”</p>

<p>As Kanako pointed out, I usually just buy bread from the cafeteria or the school store and eat lunch alone.</p>
<p>Kanako was somewhat intrigued by the fact that I had brought a bento.</p>

<p>“Is it homemade by your mom?”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that answer was incorrect.</p>

<p>“Well, something like that.”</p>

<p>However, I couldn’t reveal the true answer.</p>
<p>So, for now, I decided to go with the story that my mother had made my lunch.</p>
<p>In reality, I really wanted to brag about it. I wanted to shout it out loud to the entire school that my future bride had made this lunch.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t do that. If I said that, people would think I’m a crazy student.</p>
<p>For now, I’ll endure it. Until one day, I can proudly declare this bento… With this thought in mind, I open my bento.</p>

<p>“——!”</p>

<p>And then, I quickly closed the lid with a bang, sealing it shut.</p>
<p>This is a bento that should not be revealed in public.</p>

<p>“Hey, don’t make such a loud noise out of nowhere! You’ll startle people!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, my hand slipped.”</p>

<p>I decided to put this bento back.</p>

<p>“Hakuba, why are you trying to put the bento back so forcefully?”</p>
<p>“…I, uh, I just remembered I’m on a diet.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. You, a slender guy, on a diet? You should stop sleep-talking.”</p>
<p>“Right…I just remembered something I have to do——”</p>

<p>Trying to maintain composure as much as possible, I put the bento back forcefully and stood up from my chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, really? Something you have to do?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have something to do. You three enjoy yourselves.”</p>

<p>Saying that, as I was about to leave the club room——</p>

<p>“Takakyun, catch Hakuba!”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Just do it and don’t let the Pitiful Prince escape!”</p>
<p>“I, I got it!”</p>

<p>Takakyun obediently followed the little girl’s orders and stood up to catch me.</p>
<p>I couldn’t let myself be caught, so I roughly opened the door and dashed down the hallway at full speed.</p>
<p>I really gave it my all in that dash, but as expected of the ace striker of the soccer club, I was captured within seconds and ended up being held tightly by Takakyun.</p>

<p>“Let go! You traitor!”</p>
<p>“S-Sorry, but I can’t go against Kanako.”</p>

<p>What a pathetic man you are! I will never become such a weakling!</p>

<p>“…There’s no way you can beat Takakyun in a footrace.”</p>

<p>With a exasperated expression, Kanako took out a bento from the bag she had just snatched away.</p>

<p>“Apparently you don’t want anyone to see what’s inside this bento.I wonder what’s in this bento.”</p>
<p>“Stop! You must not open that! If you open that box, you’ll regret it!”</p>
<p>“Now, let’s see what the Pitiful Prince’s lunch is today!”</p>

<p>My plea fell on deaf ears, and Kanako opened my bento with a smug smile.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b14.png" alt="" />

<p>“This is… What is this…”</p>
<p>“…Ouji-kun, this bento…”</p>
<p>“…Don’t, don’t look… I’m begging you, please don’t look at it!”</p>

<p>The lunchbox that Touka-san handed to me was what is commonly referred to as an ‘Aisai Bento’ (loving wife’s bento).</p>
<p>On top of the white rice, there was a red heart mark made of salmon flakes, and below it was written 『Ha-kun, I love you』 in seaweed.</p>

<p>“Wow, seriously, I’m totally creeped out! This is seriously creepy! What a disappointing bento!”</p>

<p>I’m going to cry, I’m seriously going to cry.</p>
<p>Sadly, not only Kanako but also Takakyun seemed a bit put off.</p>
<p>Damn it. I never expected there to be a bomb like this.</p>
<p>Enough, it’s whatever. Let’s just eat it for now.</p>
<p>Having come to that realization, I returned to my seat and decided to eat Touka-san’s specially-made loving wife’s bento.</p>

<p>“…Itadakimasu.”</p>

<p>I clasped my hands together and offered thanks to Touka-san, who had made it for me since early in the morning.</p>

<p>“Chikada-san, making fun of someone’s hard-made bento is a shameful act.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, that’s true.”</p>
<p>“Ouji-kun, you shouldn’t worry about it either. Just be thankful that your mom made you lunch.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Himegi-san came to my defense.</p>
<p>By the way, it’s actually you from six years in the future who made this lunch…</p>

<p>“If you’d like, would you like to have some of this heart-shaped tamagoyaki?”</p>

<p>As a thank-you for her support, I offered Himegi-san some of the side dishes from my bento.</p>

<p>“Well, if you don’t mind, I’ll have some of the tamagoyaki…”</p>

<p>Himegi-san picked up a piece of tamagoyaki with her pink chopsticks and playfully popped it into her cute mouth.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s delicious. It’s seasoned just the way I like it.”</p>

<p>That’s to be expected. In a sense, it’s like she made the tamagoyaki herself.</p>
<p>It’s only natural that their tastes would be similar.</p>

<p>I thought to myself, this is truly a case of singing one’s own praises.</p>
<p>By the way, the taste of the Aisai Bento made for me was so perfect that there was absolutely no room for complaints.</p>
<p>(TN: 自画自賛, singing one’s own praises, it’s used when someone compliments or admires something they themselves created or did.)</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“So, you were invited to Harune’s birthday party?”</p>
<p>“Yes, both Kanako and I are making an emergency appearance.”</p>

<p>I had come to Touka-san’s place, where she was helping out at my father’s motorcycle shop, to report today’s events after returning from school.</p>

<p>—Bike Ouji Co., Ltd. (Kabushiki Gaisha Bike Ouji) This utterly tasteless name is what this motorcycle shop is called.</p>

<p>Well, what can I say? It’s a good thing our family name isn’t ‘Ou (王)’ (King).</p>
<p>If it were, the bike shop would be named ‘Bike King’——well, let’s not go there.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it makes me feel like I could get sued.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there were no customers today either, and it was as quiet as a ghost town.</p>
<p>Despite such a slow business situation, my father was very carefree, washing his favorite motorcycle while humming a tune.</p>
<p>I approached my father, who was having a seemingly pleasant conversation with the bike (though to an outsider, he just looked like a crazy person).</p>

<p>“Huh? What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>My father tensed up as I approached with a smile.</p>
<p>As expected of someone who’s been my father for sixteen years, he’s grown cautious.</p>

<p>“You seem to be in a good mood, Dad.”</p>
<p>“Well… yeah. I mean, knowing that my son, who I thought would be a lifelong bachelor, is getting such a beautiful bride out of nowhere, anyone would be in high spirits.”</p>

<p>In response to my father’s words, Touka-san chuckled elegantly and looked very pleased.</p>

<p>“While you’re in such a happy mood, I have a favor to ask——”</p>
<p>“——If it’s money, I’m not lending you any.”</p>
<p>“…to the cheerful dear father——”</p>
<p>“——like I said, it’s a firm ‘no’ for the loan!”</p>

<p>And with unwavering determination, he refused to lend me any money.</p>

<p>“Come on, you didn’t even pay back the 5,000 yen I lent you before!”</p>
<p>“I told you it was an installment payment!”</p>
<p>“Touka-chan, does this disappointing guy ever make any progress in life?”</p>
<p>“…Well, when he had gained a few million yen, he lost twice that amount… I guess you could say he’s been living a life like it’s a roller coaster…”</p>
<p>“Are you really okay?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me that…”</p>

<p>The Future me seems to have quite an adventurous life…</p>

<p>“He angered my father once and almost got buried in the mountains, got involved in a murder case on a college trip, infiltrated a cult facility and fought a phony cult leader, got captured by pirates, and even got mistaken for a yakuza and chased by police cars.”</p>

<p>Oh, wow… I’m going to have some pretty intense experiences ahead…</p>

<p>“…Are you sure you’re okay?”</p>
<p>“I told you, don’t ask me!”</p>
<p>“Ah! And he turned into a frog through magic once.”</p>
<p>“…I-is that a joke?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha. Yeah, just a joke. Well, half-joke.”</p>
<p>“Hold on! Wait, half?”</p>

<p>Huh?</p>
<p>So, that means the other half is true; I really hope the frog incident is the false part.</p>
<p>I absolutely don’t want to turn into a frog!</p>

<p>“…Well, what the heck…Looks like life insurance is a must…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, having insurance that’s okay even if you turn into a frog would be good…”</p>

<p>But for now, that’s not important.</p>

<p>“Dad, I’ll be straightforward——lend me some money!”</p>
<p>“I’ll be straightforward too——it’s impossible.”</p>
<p>“W-why?”</p>
<p>“We’re about to have two kids! Can’t afford to throw money away!”</p>


<p>“Throw money away… Mr President, are you really planning to pass up the chance to invest in Ouji Hakuba, the genius magician who will be celebrated with thunderous applause in Las Vegas in the future? You’ll regret it later if you miss this opportunity. You’ll suffer in hell.”</p>
<p>“…You’re starting to sound like a con artist. Sighh, okay then, surprise me. If I’m surprised, I’ll lend you some money… how much do you want?”</p>

<p>I flashed a peace sign at my father and said,</p>

<p>“Two 10,000 yen bills.”</p>
<p>“…Twenty thousand? Fine, I’ll give you 20,000 yen. Try to amaze me with your magic!”</p>

<p>So, without hesitation, I decided to astonish my father with my magic.</p>
<p>I grabbed one of the motorcycle covers stored in the shop and stood in front of my father’s prized motorcycle.</p>

<p>“Now, I’m going to… um, what’s this bike’s name?”</p>
<p>“Hey, you should at least know the name of the motorcycle if you’re working at a bike shop, son. This is a Kawasaki——”</p>
<p>“All right, I’m going to put this big motorcycle cover on Kawasaki-kun here.”</p>

<p>Since my father’s explanation seemed like it would go on forever, I ignored him and started my magic trick.</p>

<p>“H-hey! Treat it with care! That bike costs more than five million yen, and it’s more precious to me than my own son.”</p>
<p>“That more precious-than-son bike is about to disappear from here.”</p>
<p>“Huh!?”</p>
<p>“Music starts!”</p>

<p>I clapped my hands to create the sound of a drumroll.</p>
<p>Then, I shouted, ‘Ba-ba-bam!’ at the top of my lungs and dramatically pulled off the cover.</p>
<p>Just as I had declared, Kawasaki-kun had vanished.</p>

<p>“W-what’s going on? M-my motorcycle disappeared! Where’s my motorcycle?”</p>

<p>I gave my bewildered father a sly smile.</p>

<p>“Twenty thousand.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“If you give me twenty thousand yen, I’ll bring it back.”</p>

<p>And that’s how I got the money.</p>
<p>After grumbling about how he’d get an earful from my mom if he got caught, my father went to the convenience store to buy canned coffee.</p>

<p>“Ha-kun, I have a favor to ask regarding Harune’s birthday party.”</p>

<p>Touka said, looking at me with a serious expression.</p>
<p>It seemed like she was about to discuss something important.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you a spoiler, but Harune’s birthday party is going to be canceled.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Canceled?”</p>
<p>“Yes, various troubles have occurred the day before, so it won’t be held as planned.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“As an additional note, Kanako and Ha-kun weren’t invited to the birthday party six years ago, as far as I know.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that things are different from what Touka-san knows six years ago??”</p>
<p>“That seems to be the case. But if things continue like this, the birthday party should still be canceled.”</p>
<p>“I see, so you want me to help avoid that?”</p>
<p>“I should handle this alone in an ideal situation, but in terms of the right person for the job, I believe you’re better suited.”</p>
<p>“What should I do specifically?”</p>
<p>“Will you help me?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I might be a little less reliable than the me from six years in the future, but I’ll still give it my all.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Now, let me explain——”</p>

<p>And then, Touka-san began to explain what would happen on the day before the birthday party.</p>
<p>Indeed, when it came to this matter, I might be more suitable than Touka.</p>
<p>However, I had been entrusted with a huge responsibility.</p>
<p>I pondered how I could ensure that everything would go smoothly.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>On the day before the birthday party, I went to the park.</p>
<p>The purpose of my visit was to ensure the successful celebration of tomorrow’s birthday party.</p>

<p>“Is that girl in the school uniform Harune-chan…?”</p>

<p>Touka-san had described Harune-chan’s physical features to me, but honestly, such descriptions were unnecessary.</p>
<p>That’s because Harune-chan bore a striking resemblance to Touka Himegi in terms of appearance.</p>
<p>She had the same shiny black hair and pure white skin as Himegi-san, with perfectly symmetrical facial features that hinted at her potential to become a beautiful girl in the future.</p>
<p>I was sure she was the envy of her elementary school classmates, and yet here she was, sitting on the swing, looking gloomy as she gazed into the distance.</p>

<p>“It certainly is a big package…”</p>

<p>At Harune-chan’s feet lay a large Boston bag.</p>
<p>According to the stories I’d heard from Touka-san, she was planning to run away from home.</p>
<p>The reason for her escape was her reluctance to play the violin at tomorrow’s birthday party.</p>
<p>It seemed that, like in Touka-san’s timeline, she had similar plans for running away.</p>

<p>This time, I have two tasks to do: prevent Harune-chan from running away and convince her to play the violin at the birthday party tomorrow.</p>
<p>I had to clear both of these missions starting from now.</p>

<p>Preventing her from running away wasn’t that complicated.</p>
<p>I just had to contact Himegi-san about it.</p>
<p>The real challenge lay in getting her to play the violin at the birthday party tomorrow.</p>

<p>“For now, let’s start by introducing myself to my future sister-in-law…”</p>

<p>I casually took a seat on the empty swing next to her, pretending it was just a coincidence.</p>
<p>Then, with a smile on my face, I attempted the first contact with my future sister-in-law.</p>

<p>“Hello, the weather is really——Hey! Put that personal alarm back in your pocket!”</p>
<p>(TN: Self-defense alarm.)</p>

<p>What a kid! Without any hesitation, she tried to pull the string of that personal alarm.</p>
<p>I hate to say this about myself, but I don’t think I looked that suspicious.</p>

<p>“I’ve been told to sound the personal alarm if a stranger talks to me!”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? That’s an excellent safety precaution…”</p>
<p>“By the way, who are you, Onē-sa——no, Onīsan?”</p>

<p>Hey, did she determine my gender by looking at my pants?</p>
<p>That’s kinda hurtful.</p>

<p>Anyway, right now, it’s more important to show that I’m not a suspicious person.</p>

<p>“For now, I’m not a suspicious person. Look, this uniform, you recognize it, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s the same school uniform as Touka-neesan’s.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. I’m actually in the same class as your Onēsan.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that you’re the favorite guy that Touka-neesan talks about a lot lately?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Himegi-san talks about me a lot?”</p>

<p>What’s this? I’m curious!</p>
<p>I definitely want to know the full details of that conversation!</p>

<p>“Onī-san, may I ask your full name?”</p>
<p>“Ouji.”</p>
<p>“…When introducing yourself to someone, you should use your full name.”</p>
<p>“…Ouji… Hakuba…”</p>
<p>“That was a long pause.”</p>
<p>“I was hoping you’d understand from just the name…”</p>
<p>“So, Onī-san, you’re the friend who will perform magic tricks at tomorrow’s birthday party?”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you believe me.”</p>
<p>“Do you have something to say to Harune?”</p>
<p>“No, I just happened to see you and thought I’d say hello.”</p>

<p>I offered a casual excuse since I couldn’t reveal my true purpose.</p>

<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>With that, Harune-chan let out a sigh.</p>

<p>“That’s a big sigh…”</p>
<p>“…Even elementary school students have big worries.”</p>
<p>“I see. So, is that why you’re running away from home?”</p>
<p>“W-What?”</p>
<p>“Just looking at that bag makes it pretty obvious.”</p>
<p>“…You really are a magician. Quite observant.”</p>

<p>Even if she had realized I found out she was trying to run away from home, she showed no signs of fleeing.</p>
<p>It seemed she understood that she couldn’t escape if I wanted to stop her.</p>

<p>“Are you going to contact Touka-nee?”</p>
<p>“It’s still early in the evening, so I think I’m the only one who knows that Harune-chan ran away. So, I believe the best way to handle this is for you to go back home on your own.”</p>
<p>“Will you keep Harune’s running away a secret?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you.”</p>
<p>“But before that, tell me the reason for your runaway.”</p>
<p>“…At the recent violin recital, Harune experienced a major failure for the first time.”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“Since then, she hasn’t been able to play well no matter what.”</p>

<p>Harune began to speak with a pained expression.</p>
<p>It seemed that she had experienced despair and fear for the first time due to that failure.</p>
<p>Currently, she was in a deep slump.</p>

<p>“If she’s going through such a hard time, Harune doesn’t want to touch the violin again…”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“Have you never wanted to escape from pressure?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, due to my personality, I’m immune to nervousness.”</p>

<p>Besides, I rarely fail in magic tricks.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you something that would help her…</p>

<p>“Ah! Although it’s not magic, I had a major failure recently.”</p>
<p>“A major failure?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I confessed my love to your sister, and she instantly rejected me.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, I’m sorry about that.”</p>
<p>“No need to apologize. Well, at that time, I did wish I could turn back time, but…”</p>

<p>To be honest, I didn’t want to dwell too much on what happened back then.</p>

<p>“But I think it was good to be able to convey my true feelings, and there were many things I could learn from it.”</p>
<p>“Many things, you say…”</p>
<p>“Though it’s sad, people often learn more from their failures. The important thing is to reflect and use those lessons in the future.”</p>
<p>“So, Onī-san, you haven’t given up?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t. To avoid regrets… I’m definitely going to confess to Himegi-san again.”</p>
<p>“To avoid regrets…”</p>

<p>Harune’s eyes wavered at my words.</p>
<p>I’m sure there was inner turmoil in her heart right now.</p>
<p>The reason she couldn’t perform was simply her fear of failure.</p>
<p>In other words, there was no choice but to either remove that fear or confront it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have the means to remove her fear right now.</p>
<p>So, the words I could offer to Harune were…</p>

<p>“Then, how about this? If I fail at the magic trick tomorrow, I’ll confess to Himegi-san right there.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Even I might not perform well due to fear of failing if I have to perform under that condition.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t a flattering proposal, but this was the only thing I could do for her.</p>

<p>“What do you think? Since I’ll also be confronting my fear, how about you give it another try, Harune-chan?”</p>

<p>In response to my words, Harune crossed her arms and began to agonize.</p>

<p>“I want to add one more condition.”</p>
<p>“One more?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If you accept this condition, Harune’ll do her best.”</p>
<p>“What’s that condition?”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, you have to listen to everything Harune says.”</p>
<p>“…Then I’ll also add one more condition.”</p>

<p>I explained the additional condition to Harune.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see. You’re making Touka-neechan do that.”</p>
<p>“Since I think she might refuse, I want you to support me when the time comes.”</p>
<p>“I understand. Harune will accept that condition.”</p>
<p>“Alright, then no running away.”</p>
<p>“I won’t run away. If you succeed in the magic trick tomorrow, I will definitely play the violin.”</p>

<p>And so, the two of us secretly made a pact.</p>
<p>For now, I managed to prevent her from running away.</p>
<p>Harune then called her private driver using her smartphone.</p>
<p>The driver arrived at the park in about five minutes, and Harune bowed her head slightly to me before heading home.</p>

<p>“Well, you can come out now. It’s safe.”</p>

<p>I called out to Touka-san, who had been hiding in the shadows.</p>

<p>“…Did you find out?”</p>

<p>Touka-san stuck out her tongue, looking somewhat embarrassed.</p>
<p>She approached me and sat down on the swing where Harune had been earlier.</p>

<p>“Thank you. With this, I’ve achieved one of my goals.”</p>
<p>“That depends on the outcome tomorrow.”</p>

<p>If I fail at the magic trick, she might not play the violin.</p>
<p>It was a heavy responsibility to bear.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s not a problem. After all, my husband’s magic is the best in the world.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate the compliment.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a compliment. Your magic truly brings happiness to people.”</p>

<p>I could see from her expression that there was no doubt in her words, and I realized that Future Me was trusted by her.</p>
<p>I wondered if one day I could also earn Himegi-san’s trust…</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best to live up to Touka-san’s expectations.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe. Do your best, husband.”</p>

<p>Husband, huh… It didn’t sound bad at all.</p>

<p>“However, I also wanted to see Harune play with my own eyes.”</p>
<p>“I see. So tomorrow, Touka-san will enter the unknown.”</p>
<p>“Yes, from here on, it’s a world I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. How about you, Hakuba-kun?”</p>
<p>“I’m a little anxious. Can I really be a support for Harune-chan?”</p>
<p>“There’s no problem. In my timeline, you saved Harune.”</p>

<p>I see. So Future Me really saved that troubled girl… If that’s the case, then I can’t afford to lose.</p>

<p>“Shall we go home then?”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s go back.”</p>

<p>Maybe I was taking things somewhat easy.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that the birthday party would turn into such chaos for me——At that time, I could never have imagined it.</p>
