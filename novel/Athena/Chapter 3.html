<h2>Chapter 3: Reunion with the Tough Guy</h2>

<p class="calibre2">“Waa~ This feels kinda strange, doesn’t it!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha, I know right? I never thought that there would be a day where I’d play games with a customer.” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-22" class="calibre2">Haruto and Aya were talking to each other through the app, Diacord.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-23" class="calibre2">“Wait, is this Haruto-san’s account? [Oimo_daisukiyo], ahaha~!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I knew you’d say that!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“So, you like sweet potatoes (<em class="calibre6">oimo</em>)?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, not particularly, but… it just sounded like a nice name, you know?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If someone got hit by this ID, they’d be irritating.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Irritating? Like a sudden desire to eat sweet potatoes…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh? Hahaha.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Laughter erupted.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course not! Irritating as in getting angry!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, I see! Well, if you think about it, with this name… yeah, it could be a bit provoking.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, speaking of provoking, Haruto-san, have you heard of the ABEX streamer, Oni-chan?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, uh… that, you mean the streamer who’s infamous for always provoking others?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">When suddenly asked, Haruto’s heart raced, but he managed to respond calmly.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah! Well… he’s actually a pretty kind person, you know. Have you ever been told that you sound just like Oni-chan? Especially over the mic, it feels that way.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“R-really? That’s the first time someone told me that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">(It’s okay, calm down… It’s just a practice account, so there’s no way she’d find out…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With such composure, there was no need to panic</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, if you’re going to say that, then Shirayuki-san also sounds kind of similar to the Vtuber, Ayaya-san, you know? The dialect is similar too.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh…!? That’s just because we have the same dialect! Haruto-san, you sound pretty much like Oni-chan.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, ahaha…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The conversation repeated itself. If he were to respond again, they would likely spiral into another loop.</p>



<p class="calibre2">However, it genuinely pleased Haruto that someone like Aya knew about Oni-chan.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, it’s probably just our imagination, so let’s not worry about it.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-yeah! We’re both in the Platinum rank after all!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s right.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This was a topic he didn’t want to delve into. Whether Aya was reading the atmosphere or simply going along with it, her cooperation was appreciated.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, so should we go for ranked or casual? And should we do duo or trio?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm. I think the chaos is fun, so let’s go for casual and form a trio. The third teammate can be a random.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Got it! Let’s get started then!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Okay~” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With both of them ready, they started finding a match.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As it was a highly popular game, they were able to find a solo teammate relatively quickly, and once they formed a three-person team, they moved to the character selection screen.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, Shirayuki-san, what’s your main?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ll use… Gibraltar!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Alright, then I’ll go with Octane.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm, interesting. Oni-chan also uses Octane.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uh, well… Octane is a popular character, so…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While making excuses, he screamed internally.</p>



<p class="calibre2">(What am I doing…!)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Being told he’s similar to Oni-chan and then choosing Oni-chan’s main would naturally lead to him being suspicious.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He managed to pull off a strained smile and came up with a quick excuse.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well… let’s do our best.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Un</em>~!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">On the screen, the countdown for the game began, and the player-filled aircraft traversed the expansive map.</p>



<p class="calibre2">During this time, they had to make the important decision on where to land.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, our teammate marked a popular area! Pretty aggressive from the get-go.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, looks like it’s going to be an intense fight right from the start…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This was a casual match which didn’t affect their rank so there was no problem taking such risks.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Following the teammate’s marked location, they descended simultaneously into the central area of the map.</p>



<p class="calibre2">During this descent, they scanned for enemies heading to the same location, assessing how many parties they might be fighting against.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Two parties, huh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“&mdash;Two parties, eh?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">For that brief moment, they both were thinking about the same thing.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“We were thinking the same thing, weren’t we?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-yeah! What a coincidence…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Her laughter, accompanied by an unsteady voice, seemed to reveal a sense of nervousness.</p>



<p class="calibre2">∮</p>



<p class="calibre2">[Aya’s PoV &ndash; On the day before Haruto and Aya played together]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, tomorrow I’ll be playing games with Haruto-san. Yay~ (<em class="calibre6">yatta~</em>)!” (Aya)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-21" class="calibre2">Under the dimmed lights, Aya slipped into bed, wearing a bright smile. She kicked her legs excitedly and buried her face in the pillow.</a></p>



<p class="calibre2">Of course, she was looking forward to playing with Haruto, but what excited her even more was the fact that she received praise from someone she admired.</p>

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vampiramtl.com/wp-content/uploads/TGS_8.jpeg?w=1112&ssl=1">

<p class="calibre2">He was a Platinum-ranked player, a whole three ranks below her, who had reached the Predator rank. This meant there was little chance she would be a burden, and on the contrary, there was a high chance that he would praise her if she could show off her skills.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&ndash; (You’re really good~!)<br class="kb-gallery-wrap-id-3914_b7126d" />&ndash; (You’re so reliable!)<br class="kb-gallery-wrap-id-3914_b7126d" />&ndash; (How are you so good!?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She had imagined hearing such praises. She believed she could impress him, and perhaps, by playing more together, they could get closer!</p>



<p class="calibre2">“H-how should I respond if he praises me? I’d probably get too happy and my words won’t come out at all… and if I end up saying something weird… yeah, that’s not good.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Just the thought of that made her chest hurt.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya squeezed her pillow, trying to motivate herself. She fidgeted, grabbed her phone, and lay on her back, staring at the ceiling.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, let’s see…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In the dimly lit room, she turned on her phone and opened a memo, swiftly typing away. She was writing down lines of script just like Oni-chan would.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, I’m going to be praised a lot. Maybe I’ll even get to use up all the replies I thought of.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">No one would have expected Aya to be doing something like this. In reality, this was the first time she had done something like this. In other words, she really didn’t want him to think that she was weird.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Nnn</em>~! I wish tomorrow would come sooner. I really want to be praised a lot… also, I want to get closer to him…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She stretched, letting her overflowing excitement fill the room.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She indulged in elaborate fantasies, but things didn’t unfold exactly as she had imagined.</p>



<p class="calibre2">∮</p>



<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The first casual game:</span></p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Haruto</strong>: 2870 damage, 6 kills, 2 assists, 9 knockdowns.<br class="kb-gallery-wrap-id-3914_b7126d" /><strong class="calibre5">Aya</strong>: 3210 damage, 8 kills, 3 assists, 11 knockdowns.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Together, they eliminated around 5 squads.<br class="kb-gallery-wrap-id-3914_b7126d" />Team ranking: 1st.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">The second casual game:</span></p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Haruto</strong>: 2343 damage, 7 kills, 1 assist, 8 knockdowns.<br class="kb-gallery-wrap-id-3914_b7126d" /><strong class="calibre5">Aya</strong>: 2255 damage, 6 kills, 3 assists, 8 knockdowns.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Together, they eliminated around 4 squads.<br class="kb-gallery-wrap-id-3914_b7126d" />Team ranking: 1st.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre8">Third casual match:</span></p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Haruto</strong>: 3171 damage, 9 kills, 4 assists, 9 knockdowns.<br class="kb-gallery-wrap-id-3914_b7126d" /><strong class="calibre5">Aya</strong>: 2828 damage, 8 kills, 4 assists, 6 knockdowns.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Together, they eliminated around 7 squads.<br class="kb-gallery-wrap-id-3914_b7126d" />Team ranking: 1st.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Three consecutive victories.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After the first match, there were exchanges like ‘That was lucky!’ ‘Feeling a bit good today!’ ‘You’re good!’ flying around.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Similar conversations continued after the second match.</p>



<p class="calibre2">However, after the third match, that kind of conversation disappeared.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The performance metrics such as damage dealt and kills were suspicious, but it wasn’t just that. Their speed in providing cover, predicting safe zones, the speed at which they eliminated enemies, and their overall strategy&mdash;all of these factors highlighted that both of them possessed a ‘similar level of skill’.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-24" class="calibre2">“Haruto-san, that’s definitely a smurf account! You’re way too good! What’s the rank on your main account!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, even if you say that, Shirayuki-san, you…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ve been watching Haruto-san’s movements closely, but aren’t you actually at the top-level?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“H-How do you know? Is Shirayuki-san saying that because she has reached Predator rank before… or something?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-I’ve watched videos of top players before!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">No matter what excuses they made, it was clear that they had a skill level not far from top players.</p>



<p class="calibre2">At this point, the question lingering in their minds was about their main accounts… and with these suspicions, they entered the fourth match.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;But then tragedy struck.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Chat (Teammate)</strong>: [Wait? Is this for real!?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">A random teammate in the solo queue suddenly entered this message into the chat.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The two of them, having seen the chat, fell into silence. Cold sweat started to bead on their foreheads.</p>



<p class="calibre2">These were words not casually thrown around to ordinary players. These were words reserved for streamers or content creators…</p>



<p class="calibre2">And the target of this chat became evident with the next set of words.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Chat (Teammate)</strong>: [That’s Oni-chan’s smurf account, right?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha. I-I think our teammate is misunderstanding something…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto immediately tried to address what was typed in chat but…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-I wonder what’s our teammate saying? R-right, Shirayuki-san?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While Haruto was asking, Aya remained silent.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In her silence, she started typing in chat to the other teammate.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Chat (Aya)</strong>: [Why do you think that?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre6">Under the dimmed lights, Aya slipped into bed, wearing a bright smile. She kicked her legs excitedly and buried her face in the pillow.</em></a></p>



<h4>◆◆◆◆</h4>

<p class="calibre2">“W-Wait! You don’t need to ask that!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was natural for a panicked voice to escape.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If he didn’t stop the discussion between their teammate and Aya, the situation might get out of hand.</p>



<p class="calibre2">And to make matters worse, it was being exposed to Aya, a regular at the cafe…</p>



<p class="calibre2">In a state of panic, the only thought that crossed his mind was how to interfere and prevent them from talking to each other.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“U-Um, Shirayuki-san. I’ll mute Diacord for a moment. Also, set the in-game voice chat volume to zero, okay?!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“……Y-yeah.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, sorry… I’ll be right back!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With this setup, even if Haruto tried to communicate with their teammate, Aya would not be able to hear it.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Despite the relief he felt after taking control of the situation, Aya was well aware of his true intentions.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While ignoring his instructions, she quickly went back into her in-game settings tab and raised the voice chat volume from 0 to 50.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Of course, Haruto did not know that she had changed her settings to allow her to hear the conversation, so he proceeded to address the teammate.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(H-hey… How did you know that this is my smurf account…? I haven’t posted anything about this account during my streams, right?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He deliberately changed his tone and expression, revealing himself as Oni-chan.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(It was more than a year ago, but there was one time where I’ve seen it! Do you remember that there was a time when you did a 1v1 challenge?)” (Teammate)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Huh? W-Was that so…? I think that was the first time I’ve used this account… I didn’t think that anyone would remember it. After all, it was more than a year ago, before my channel really started to take off.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(That’s because I’ve been watching you ever since you had around 100 subscribers!)” (Teammate)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(A-All the way back then!? Well, thank you, really. It makes me happy to hear that.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(U-um. I have a favor to ask of you.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Seeing an opportunity, he quickly brought up the main topic of discussion.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Hey, so, I am indeed Oni-chan, but could you type in the chat something like ‘Oops, it was just a misunderstanding!’ or ‘Never mind, I was wrong!’? I’m in a party with another teammate, and I don’t want them to know that I use this account. Oh, and their in-game voice chat volume has been turned off, so you don’t need to worry about them listening in to this conversation.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Is there something in this account that you didn’t want them to know about?)” (Teammate)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Well… Don’t tell anyone about this, okay? This account… the username has the words, ‘sweet potatoes (<strong class="calibre5"><em class="calibre6">o imo</em></strong>)’, which is a play on the word, ‘little sister (<strong class="calibre5"><em class="calibre6">o imo</em></strong><em class="calibre6">uto</em>)’.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Eh!? Was it meant to be interpreted that way!? So you really are a siscon!)” (Teammate)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Sh-shut up. What’s wrong with that?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">To get his cooperation quickly, Haruto provided an incentive in the form of the secret of his username.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(W-Well, anyways, because of this, please help me!! Okay!?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Okay!)” (Teammate)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(All right!)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Perhaps because it was from a genuine fan, Haruto felt relieved by their response. However, this was short-lived. At that moment, a familiar voice entered their voice chat.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(W-What are you talking about…? More importantly! Oni-chan was the real deal, huh?!!)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Huh? W-what…? Hey, you’re not supposed to come out! I told you to mute the voice chat, right?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-57" class="calibre2">“(Even if the voice chat is muted, the voice-to-text is still visible in chat so it’s pointless, you know?)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Ah…)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While Haruto was panicking earlier, he had completely forgotten about that feature in the game. His face turned pale in an instant, and he began to break out in a cold sweat, but he wasn’t ready to give up just yet.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(No, if it’s just the chat, I might still be able to bluff my way through…?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(No, you can’t bluff your way through!)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(You don’t know that!)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(There’s no way you can lie your way out of this!)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(No, no, no, there might be a chance…)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Absolutely not! I’ll not be fooled! Besides, I have already heard everything!)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya emotionally fired back in her strong dialect.</p>



<p class="calibre2">But, considering the circumstances, it couldn’t be helped…</p>



<p class="calibre2">After all, she had sought relationship advice from someone she thought was Oni-chan.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;(“Well, you know! She’s into a café staff, someone mature and kind!”)</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;(“That onii-san boldly confronted them and stood up for her! How cool is that!?”)</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;(“And besides, he pays a lot of attention to her! He earnestly draws latte art for her, write messages that make her happy, and was very caring! Isn’t he great!?”)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She even went as far as to reveal embarrassing details to him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Amidst the panic, her genuine emotions surfaced. Because of that, their teammate couldn’t help but notice something was off.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh? Um, is the person you’re teamed up with Ayaya, the pro gamer?” (Teammate)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">A sharp line was heard.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh… you think so too, huh? Her voice and dialect are exactly the same, ain’t it?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What are you both saying!? I’m not Ayaya…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the situation turned into a 2v1 against her.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-58" class="calibre2">“Well, if I’m teaming up with Oni-chan, my account should be in the Predator rank, right?" (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Even if you try to change the way you talk, it would just make it even more suspicious.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Then how else could I have covered it up!? There’s no other way!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Maybe try imitating Ayaya and saying something like ‘Ayaya <em class="calibre6">desu~</em>‘.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That definitely won’t work!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“They say that even celebrities can go unnoticed if they act confidently without disguising themselves.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In the midst of their heated exchange, the random teammate interjected with some sound advice.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You know, I was thinking that maybe you two should stop trying to mislead each other.” (Teammate)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah…” (Haruto &amp; Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Correct. With the cat out of the bag, there was no point in arguing. The two of them gradually fell silent.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With this, the fourth match started with a toll on their concentration and mental state…</p>



<p class="calibre2">Oni-chan: 138 damage, 0 kills, 0 assists, 0 knockdowns.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ayaya: 98 damage, 0 kills, 0 assists, 0 knockdowns.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In all the previous matches, the duo had defeated around 15 enemies, but in this particular match, they couldn’t eliminate a single opponent, making them deadweight. After losing the game and apologizing to their teammate, the two returned to the lobby…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…”&nbsp; (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Silence enveloped them and it wasn’t just because they threw that last game.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, Oni-chan?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What is it, Ayaya-san? I mean, Shirayuki-san.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yes, now that they knew each other’s true identities…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“S-So… how are you feeling right now?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh? Even if you ask me that, I’m still struggling to keep up with the situation… I mean, the fact that two streamers coincidentally met in real life… Well, I did have my suspicions that you were Ayaya.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, not that. Something else…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Something else?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t you remember what I consulted you about? If you’ve forgotten, it’s okay…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That thing about your friend… which is actually your own story?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“?! <em class="calibre6">Mooouuuu</em>~! You definitely figured out everything!!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With this response, her emotions exploded in an instant.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, the information matches what I know, so…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Uwahhhhhh</em>~! I don’t want to hear it anymore! I’ll get mad if you keep saying it!!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ayaya’s voice, filled with such agony, was something no one had ever heard before. It was a first for Haruto.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ahhh <em class="calibre6">mouuu</em>~!, it’s over… My life is over… Why is it that the one person I consulted about my love troubles turned out to be Haruto-san…! S-So, um, everything is exposed, right!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">A silent confirmation was given.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Mmmnnn~! <em class="calibre6">Haa</em>… My face is so red. I don’t think I can face Haruto-san anymore…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In a feeble, trembling voice, she lets out her feelings. However, she quickly changes the subject as if to cover up her embarrassment.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, why is Oni-chan working at a cafe? With the number of subscribers and views Oni-chan has, you should be able to make a living from ad revenue, right?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-well, that’s true, but… My streams mainly rely on toxic persona, so it wouldn’t be surprising if I get demonetized. In fact, I’ve already been warned by the management…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">If one’s livelihood depends on a single stream, all ad revenue might be lost when it gets demonetized.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If something like that were to happen, it would cause problems for Yuno. Even though he wanted to send her to university, it could end up hindering her studies if she became too persistent in helping.</p>



<p class="calibre2">To prevent that, he has that as a backup plan&mdash;a second pillar.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But, you know, these kinds of coincidences really do happen, huh…? It’s surprising that Ayaya-san is only a first-year university student.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Nee</em>… Let me tell you this first!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“U-Um… it’s not like I like Haruto-san or anything, okay!? Just as I mentioned before, I’m just interested in you!! Understand!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha. I get it. That’s why I’m so calm about it.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even though he reassures her with his usual tone, his face is flushed. While scratching his cheek, he desperately tries to hide his embarrassment.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-In that case… yeah. Also, keep this a secret, okay!? If this gets out to someone, uh, it might indirectly reveal that Ayaya and Oni-chan is… you know.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I know.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“T-thank you…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">And with her expression of gratitude, she changes to a more serious tone.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um… Oni-chan. I want to change the subject, but there’s a possibility of us facing backlash, right?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah… I was thinking about that too.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Both of them are familiar with the streaming industry so they share the same concerns.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“To be honest, we should be prepared… Depending on what that teammate does. If it gets out that Oni-chan and Ayaya-san have a close enough relationship to meet in real life, Ayaya-san’s fans, especially the males, might get upset…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In this industry, ‘people’ build fan bases. If their relationship is misunderstood as romantic, viewers might turn away, becoming antagonistic and become hostile. Even if they reveal the whole process leading up to this situation, it’s unlikely that anyone will believe it.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But, Shirayuki-san, you don’t have to worry. I’ll take care of it. To be honest, I can just say that I threatened and forced you into this.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh, you can’t do that!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“This whole situation is my fault. If I had remembered that I used this account before during a stream, it wouldn’t have been exposed in the first place.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But that’s not true! It’s because I talked openly…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Shirayuki-san, you just got caught in the crossfire.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">If it’s oni-chan, it’s no big deal if there’s some backlash. While many viewers might leave, the damage won’t be as severe as compared to if Ayaya-san gets caught.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was at that moment when he showed his determination to take responsibility and protect her&mdash;</p>



<p class="calibre2">A private message arrived in [Oimo_daisukiyo]’s account:</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Private Message</strong>: [I’m the teammate from earlier, thank you so much for today! Even though the game ended pretty quickly, it was an honor to play together with you!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">This was what was written in the message, following the title:</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Private Message</strong>: [Onto the main topic. Given the recent trouble you both had, rest assured that I have no intention of spreading this anywhere. The only things I spread are related to you, as your fan lol. Well then, I look forward to your future activities! As the seasons change, take good care of your health!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Shirayuki-san…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It seems like we’re in the clear regarding the backlash.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">And thus, he relayed the contents of this message, carefully selecting the line:</p>



<p class="calibre2">‘If there’s anything I might spread, it’s only related to you as your fan lol.’</p>



<p class="calibre2">A sense of relief washed over them in perfect timing.</p>




<h4>◆◆◆◆</h4>

<p class="calibre2">A few hours later.</p>



<p class="calibre2">An edited video is posted on social media.</p>



<p class="calibre2">【Encounter with Oni-chan in a casual game! Oni-chan’s secrets exposed (with voice)!】</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a clickbaity kind of title that catches the eye.</p>



<p class="calibre2">*</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(H-hey… How did you know that this is my smurf account…? I haven’t posted anything about this account during my streams, right?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(It was more than a year ago, but there was one time where I’ve seen it! Do you remember that there was a time when you did a 1v1 challenge?)” (Teammate)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Huh? W-Was that so…? I think that was the first time I’ve used this account… I never thought anyone would remember it. After all, it was more than a year ago, before my channel really started to take off.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(That’s because I’ve been watching you ever since you had around 100 subscribers!)” (Teammate)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(A-All the way back then!? Well, thank you, really. It makes me happy to hear that.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">*</p>



<p class="calibre2">From a moment of gratitude to the viewers&mdash;</p>



<p class="calibre2">*</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Hey, so, I am indeed Oni-chan, but could you type in the chat something like ‘Oops, it was just a misunderstanding!’ or ‘Never mind, I was wrong!’? I’m in a party with another teammate, and I don’t want them to know that I use this account. Oh, and their in-game voice chat volume has been turned off, so you don’t need to worry about them listening in to this conversation.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Is there something in this account that you didn’t want them to know about?)” (Teammate)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Well… Don’t tell anyone about this, okay? This account… the username has the words, ‘sweet potatoes (<em class="calibre6">o imo</em>)’, which is a play on the word, ‘little sister (<em class="calibre6">o imouto</em>)’.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Eh!? Was it meant to be interpreted that way!? So you really are a siscon!)” (Teammate)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Sh-shut up. What’s wrong with that?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">*</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;To Oni-chan’s secret story, thinking that it had to be mentioned in order to get his teammate’s cooperation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">*</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(W-Well, anyways, because of this, please help me!! Okay!?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">*</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;To the content of his plea.</p>



<p class="calibre2">To avoid complete identification, only the ‘<strong class="calibre5">yo</strong>‘ in ‘Oimo_daisuki<strong class="calibre5">yo</strong>‘ was censored.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-102" class="calibre2">As a result, the meaning conveyed in the username was slightly altered from a joking kind of “I love her (<em class="calibre6">daisukiyo</em>)?” to a sincere kind of “I love her (<em class="calibre6">daisuki</em>)!</p>



<p class="calibre2">Whether it was intentional or coincidental, only the editor knows.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, at the end of this video, one of Oni-chan’s famous line was inserted with an echoed voice.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was a statement he made from the past, and even Oni-chan couldn’t remember when he said this.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m impervious to any attacks from haters. I’m prepared for any kind of criticism I will receive.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This new video about Oni-chan stirred up the already ongoing discussions about him in the ABEX community.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Social media users swarm to it like piranhas.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Should we just rename this to [Oni-chan’s Family Love Channel] lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [The editing is too good!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [The name of his smurf account is just too embarrassing lol.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [I want to see his sister’s reaction when she finds out the meaning behind this username!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">It seems like Oni-chan’s statement has sparked lively reactions and discussions among social media users.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The response was overwhelming, with over 10,000 likes in less than 30 minutes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The victim (oni-chan) himself only noticed it during his break at work which was some time after playing with Aya.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What the… What is this? No, seriously, this is messed up… I told them to keep it a secret.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">How many times has this happened already…</p>



<p class="calibre2">While seeing the flood of notifications arriving from Twitto and watching the edited video, he slumped in his chair.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Why on earth was that person recording during that time… And they just so happen to be able to edit videos… <em class="calibre6">Haa</em>.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In today’s convenient world, it only takes a push of a button to start recording. Perhaps they started recording right after finding out to celebrate the occasion.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ugh… what the hell, seriously. Everything I’ve been doing lately is backfiring… That guy really went and only spread stuff about me… Ugh, this is the worst. It’s even trending in the entertainment scene… Everyone’s going to see this, aren’t they…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In the evening, what was trending on Twitto were the two characters, ‘<em class="calibre6">o imo</em>‘ (little sister). Those two characters are more than enough to catch the attention of people.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, notifications keep piling up.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a tap on the notification, real-time comments from viewers turn the streamer into a live toy.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Hey, siscon! How’s it going!? You’ve been exposed!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m not okay…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Oni-chan! Is your sister cute!?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t that obvious?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Do you like your little sister!? Or do you love her!? Which is it!?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Shut up…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [How about renaming your channel to [Siscon Oni] from now on?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You’re annoying…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Oni-chan isn’t great at comebacks, but in this situation, his words come out effortlessly.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>. Why did this have to happen…? Seriously, why did this have to happen…? I’d prefer another streaming incident over whatever is happening at this point.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The consequences of the first streaming incident he caused were that his fake persona was exposed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">However, this time’s accident exposed his love for his little sister. It’s unbearable.</p>



<p class="calibre2">And the editing of the video makes things worse.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;”Well… Don’t tell anyone about this, okay? This account… the username has the words, ‘sweet potatoes (<em class="calibre6">o imo</em>)’, which is a play on the word, ‘little sister (<em class="calibre6">o imouto</em>).”</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;”I’m impervious to any attacks from haters. I’m prepared for any kind of criticism I will receive.”</p>



<p class="calibre2">The transition from these two lines resulted in a mocking kind of tone as if encouraging viewers to purposely tease him about the revelation. The emphasis on the echo in the last line makes it sound like a challenge as if saying, “If you don’t believe me, try me!”</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That person should use that quick-witted editing skill for something else… It’s really a waste, no matter how you look at it…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As a result, the majority of users who watched the video think:</p>



<p class="calibre2">(Challenge accepted! I won’t hold back!!) </p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>. I feel so embarrassed, I could die…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Covering his face with both hands and rubbing his temples to distract himself, Oni-chan let out a sigh. At that moment, when his head felt like it might catch fire from the heat, he received a notification. </p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Haruto-san, what time do you finish work today?)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was a message on LAIN from Aya, whom he had exchanged contact information with on the day they made plans to play ABEX.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While wondering if she timed the message during his break, he opened the LAIN app and replied.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(I’m planning to finish early today, around 9 PM. Do you need something?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Yeah. I was thinking if I could have a bit of your time after you finish work, Haruto-san.)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This unusual and unexpected request surprised him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(That’s fine.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Really!? I’ll make sure to be at the shop by 9 PM then, thank you!)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Huh? Don’t you have to attend classes tomorrow, Shirayuki-san? Shouldn’t you be preparing for that? And also, there’s no need for you to go out of your way to do this. We can just do it through LAIN.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(No, it’s fine. Besides, I want to properly talk about today’s events, so I’d prefer to talk face-to-face. And also, I want to thank you.)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Thank me? For what?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Haruto-san, you’ve shouldered everything for me this time, haven’t you?)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(What are you talking about?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(You’re really kind, you know?)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Even if you say that, I have no idea what you’re talking about.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Hmm. Well then, I’ll explain until you understand.)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oh, no, please don’t. I’m begging you.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Hehe, okay. Well then, do your best with the rest of your work, Haruto-san. I have to go and start my stream now.)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Thank you. In that case, I might watch it until my break is over.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Ehhh, um, sure. Just try not to pay too much attention to me; it feels weird.)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Ahaha, what does that mean.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-107" class="calibre2">While inserting a tsukkomi at the end, they wrapped up their conversation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Thus, he spends the rest of his break time peeking into Ayaya’s stream, making the most of his time off.</p>



<p class="calibre2">And also, he decided to overlook the part where Ayaya bit her tongue at the start of the stream.</p>



<h4>◆◆◆◆</h4>

<p class="calibre2">The current time is 8:50 PM, 10 minutes before Haruto’s part-time job ends.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-Yahoo…?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Good evening, Shirayuki-san.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Having probably gone shopping somewhere, Aya speaks in a quiet tone to Haruto while holding a stylish paper bag,</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…You know, I don’t really know how to respond if you act this embarrassed.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m trying my best, okay?! Just don’t bring up <strong class="calibre5">that </strong>topic anymore!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha. Sorry.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He hasn’t forgotten. No, it’s impossible to forget.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The love consultation and the fact that she is interested in him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya probably can’t forget about it either which leads to the current strange relationship.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, so, do you want to order something to drink for now?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uh, yeah. Then… a large almond latte ice, please.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Understood.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, and also the latte art and message…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um… if you don’t act as aggressive as usual, it’ll make me conscious of the situation again…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“B-but it’s impossible not to be conscious of it in the first place…!! Just put up with it!!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Even if you say that…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Perhaps because of her fair skin, her blushing face stands out quite prominently.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, she seems to be making an effort to maintain the usual atmosphere.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Responding with a wry smile, Haruto begins preparing the order.</p>



<p class="calibre2">First, he focuses on the requested latte art and message.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While enduring the embarrassing atmosphere, he writes down a message with his trembling hands.</p>



<p class="calibre2">[Good job on your steam (<em class="calibre6">haishi</em>) today! Fight on!!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">To ensure confidentiality, he refrained from specifically writing down the word, “streaming (<em class="calibre6">haishin</em>)”. Next, the latte art.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While imagining an image of a hamster he found online, he diligently starts drawing.</p>



<p class="calibre2">…In the end, two of the teeths became too long, resulting in a somewhat strange face, but at least it can be passed off as a mouse.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Now, all that’s left is to make the almond latte.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, Shirayuki-san. I forgot to mention, but you don’t need to worry about money this time. Since you came all the way here at this hour, let me treat you.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, don’t worry about it. You have a sister, right, Haruto-san? You should use that money for her sake.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm? That’s weird, I can’t hear anything all of a sudden.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Wow, that’s some terrible acting…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“What are you talking about?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While playing dumb till the end, Haruto enters the price for the almond latte and adds it as his own order.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With this, she shouldn’t feel uneasy about drinking it.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As the total amount of 1,020 yen appeared on the cash register, he recorded the amount and closed the register.</p>



<p class="calibre2">All that’s left is to settle the bill at the end of the shift. Of course, he already had the approval from his manager to do stuff like this.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, I’ll go and quickly finish up your order, so please wait a bit more.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-yeah. Thank you, Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You’re welcome. Also, sorry for being a bit forceful.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Mouu</em>… Only Haruto-san would do something like this.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s not true. You’re exaggerating” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With that response, he quickly moves away from the register to start preparing the drinks.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Haruto-san must be really popular with girls…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh? Did you say something?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-Nothing!!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Is that so? Let me know if anything is bothering you.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The moment Aya heard his response, she couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After serving a few more customers, the time finally hit 9:00 PM, the end of Haruto’s part-time shift.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Man, I’m still surprised. To think that Shirayuki-san is actually Ayaya-san…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Same here. I feel that it’s too much of a coincidence.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya and Haruto sat on a bench in a nearby park, chatting away while they sipped on their drinks.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ve been wondering for a while now, but have you ever felt that I was Ayaya? After all, the name ‘Ayaya’ even has my real name inside.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I did think your voice and personality were similar, but that’s about it. I never imagined Ayaya-san was a university student, and I also thought that she lived in a different region because of her dialect.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, I see. That makes sense.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Although there were similarities, it wasn’t enough to make a definitive judgment.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But, maybe our thoughts were actually quite similar. I never thought that Oni-chan was such a young person. Are you in your 20s?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m exactly 20.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh… What!? So we’re only two years apart!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, technically, yeah.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Why do you look so mature at this age? I’m jealous.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Does she have a longing for being ‘mature’? Aya peers into his face with a serious expression as if seeking advice.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As her beautiful face gets closer, Haruto subtly distances himself and gives his thoughts.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If I had to say, maybe it’s the family environment. You probably already know from the streaming incident, but I’ve wanted to be like a parent to my little sister.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah… Actually, let’s not talk about that anymore!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, it’s okay now. I’m not dwelling on it anymore. Thanks for being considerate.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-Is that so?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course. By the way, Shirayuki-san, do you live alone?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah! I moved here by myself to attend university.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Is it tough living alone?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Honestly, it’s quite tough. Well, thanks to this experience, I’ve come to appreciate how much my parents were taking care of me.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Same here. Earning money for living expenses, cooking, doing housework &ndash; it’s really amazing how much was happening behind the scenes. It’s not something that can be easily pulled off.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I know right? And even when they’re tired, they rarely show it, don’t they?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, that’s definitely true.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto who lost both parents, and Aya who moved away from her parents to attend university, have completely different backgrounds. However, they share the same sentiments.</p>



<p class="calibre2">For a while, they discuss how great and admirable their parents are, and on top of some casual conversations, 50 minutes have passed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“All right, it’s already getting late. Let’s save this conversation for another day. Shall we get to the main topic now?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“A-Ah, that’s right!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Not wanting to let someone who is living alone go back late, he prompts her on the main topic of discussion, and she readily nods.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“So, what did you want to talk about today? If you wanted to talk about today’s incident, it seems to have already been resolved relatively smoothly.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Mmmnn!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-34" class="calibre2">Looking at her making onomatopoeic sounds, he sees her large eyes narrowing into a glare.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haruto-san, you’ve been facing a lot of controversies lately, haven’t you?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s a positive kind of controversy, so you don’t have to worry too much about it. It’s not affecting me, and if anything, it’s helping.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But it’s negatively affecting Oni-chan, isn’t it?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I know that you’re also looking out for me.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As if she had anticipated everything, she hands over the stylish paper bag that she had placed on her thigh.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“So, Haruto-san, please take this as a token of my gratitude. It might not be enough for all that you’ve done for me though…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Th-This is the thank-you gift? What’s all this?” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-35" class="calibre2">“Well, macarons, cookies, and baumkuchen! I also included some for your sister.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, I can’t accept something so expensive… Rather, I should be the one apologizing for getting you involved in this situation.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Though she doesn’t mention it, it’s likely worth around 10,000 yen. It’s a product from a famous brand that anyone would have heard of at least once.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While he naturally wants to share it with his younger sister Yuno, he can’t show greediness towards someone younger.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, I just did what anyone would do, so there’s no need for thanks…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, that’s not true.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As she argues, a breeze sweeps through the night.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haruto-san, you’re trying to use the money you earn from streaming to support your sister’s education, right? Yet, you’re also trying to protect me… That’s not something anyone can do.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, considering Oni-chan’s streaming style, there’s plenty of potential for a comeback. Even if I can’t stream, I can somehow make a living if I work hard. It’s not a big deal, really.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While there’s some embarrassment in his response, he genuinely means what he says.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe~ So you don’t deny you’re trying to protect both your sister and me?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haruto-san, did you try to protect me because you thought I was living off my streaming money and using it for university? Were you worried that if I couldn’t pay for the expenses, I might have to drop out…?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uh…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I knew it.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Whether she heard the suppressed sound of his <em class="calibre6">*gulp*</em> or read it from his expression, she smiled and continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I don’t know anything about your sister, but I’m sure she likes you too.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-wait. Why is it in Shirayuki-san’s mind that I am someone who likes his sister…!? It’s not like I…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Your username says ‘I love my little sister (<em class="calibre6">oimo_daisukiyo</em>)’ though?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, that’s like saying ‘<em class="calibre6">daisukiyo</em>‘ in real life… It’s more like a joking expression.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, really?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Don’t look at me like that…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With an overflowing grin, Aya enjoyed his reaction, and he instinctively averts his gaze.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, I guess I’ll stop teasing you for now.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a merciful tone, Aya stops teasing him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Glancing at him from the side, she changes her tone once again.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What is it?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I was really happy about what you did for me. Haruto-san, you’re really amazing, after all.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“So, I’ve decided to learn from you, Haruto-san. I want to become someone who can protect others when needed. I owe you a debt, and ideally, I hope to be able to protect you in return.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…………” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…………” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Not knowing how to respond, Haruto remained silent.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Perhaps due to the atmosphere, as time passes, Aya’s body starts to tremble, and her face turns bright red. She makes large gestures and lets out a bunch of “Awawa!!” rapidly.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-33" class="calibre2">“Uh, um, p-please don’t misunderstand!! Th-this is not a confession or anything! This is just what I genuinely thought! If we were to go out with each other, I would have to meet your sister first!! It’s better to have her permission… right!?” (Aya)</a></p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha… I don’t think you need permission, but having it might be better.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-yeah! That’s right!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The conversation came to an abrupt pause.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Both of them might be feeling embarrassed by the conversation reminiscent of an actual couple.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The atmosphere is awkward and somewhat uncomfortable.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well…! Since we finished this important conversation, I think it’s about time for me to head home!!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Would you like me to walk you home?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-yeah! I-if you’re that kind to me… I might be in trouble.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, just kidding! Just kidding!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While scratching her cheek and wearing a wry smile, Aya stands up energetically as if to hide her face.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, see you later, Haruto-san! Thank you so much for today.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Likewise. Be careful on your way home, it’s getting dark.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Okay!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Their parting was sudden.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya runs to the entrance of the park, then turns around, waving energetically.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haruto-san, be careful on your way home too!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Got it!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Alright then, bye!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Her face, seen from a distance, somehow seemed to be tinged with red, perhaps just a trick of the light.</p>



<p class="calibre2">*</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m home~! …Ah.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Returning home after parting with Aya, Haruto opens the front door with his usual cheerful voice. However, what unfolds before him is a scene that makes his body shrink in an instant.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Whether it was the sound of his footsteps or a premonition of his return, Yuno, with both hands on her hips, was standing right in front of the entrance.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Welcome back, stupid (<em class="calibre6">baka</em>) onii-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-Yes.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">A commanding voice. A commanding posture. And it feels like a shadow is cast over the upper half of her face.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Work today was supposed to end early, at 9 PM, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Y-yes. That’s correct.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“What time is it now?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uh, it’s 10:30 PM…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“How long does it take to travel from home to work?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Just under 20 minutes…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s right. But today, you’re an hour later than the time you told me this morning. I always tell you to let me know if you’re going to be late, right~?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The ‘right~?’ at the end. It’s something Yuno always does when she’s angry.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I always cook at a specific time so that you can have a freshly cooked meal by the time you get back, onii-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m really sorry… Some stuff happened…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>. Don’t make me worry like that… I even sent you a text.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Getting scolded by his high school younger sister. It’s a scene he wouldn’t want anyone else to see.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If a third party were to witness this, they might get the impression that she’s being overly protective, but in reality, they are each other’s only family.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s something they understand from the pain of losing someone dear.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If you don’t give me a proper explanation, I’ll keep lecturing you for another 5 minutes. You’re the type who won’t get it unless I say it multiple times.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, well, actually, I got caught up talking with a regular customer!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s not an explanation, that sounds like an excuse. Whatever. Where’s my slipper…” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-wait a minute! Before that, this! I got a gift for you!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Sensing the imminent danger of being spanked, Haruto quickly realizes the dire situation, and in a panic, shows the paper bag he was holding, successfully diverting the conversation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“A gift?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s a continuation of my explanation. I got praised by a customer, and it kind of led to them giving me this…? Sorry, I got carried away talking with them. Inside is your favorite Western-style sweets.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh!?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno, who received the paper bag with both hands, begins rummaging through it while peeking inside, confirming its contents.</p>



<p class="calibre2">When she raises her face again, her eyes are sparkling like jewels.</p>



<p class="calibre2">This wasn’t just about receiving her favorite treats but also about hearing that her family had been praised.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You got praised at work, onii-chan!?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-well, (not exactly about work but) something like that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Why didn’t you say that sooner! If that’s the reason, I’ll forgive you.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Alright!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Being scolded by Yuno is the hardest thing to bear. Haruto raises a joyful voice in the heat of the moment, but he inadvertently dug himself into a hole.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“‘Alright’? Onii-chan, you don’t seem to be reflecting on yourself. I didn’t say you didn’t need to think about what you’ve done.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-no… I’m really, truly reflecting.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Looks like I still have to lecture you.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“… I’m really really sorry.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">And so, the lecture begins… and just once, his butt was smacked with a slipper.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In the end, Yuno writes the words “Don’t forget to inform” on the back of his hand with a permanent marker.</p>
