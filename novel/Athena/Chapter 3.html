<h2>Chapter 3</h2>



<p>[We will definitely be happy together. That’s our resolve.]</p>



<p>[I truly love Towa-kun with all my heart.] </p>



<p>Those words won’t leave my head even though it’s been about two months.</p>



<p>To me…Shu Sasaki, Ayana, my childhood friend, was the most precious person in the world… she was precious, beloved, and irreplaceable.</p>



<p>But it turns out I was the only one who thought that way… I had arrogantly believed that Ayana felt the same way about me.</p>



<p>[Don’t be ridiculous… why… why?!]</p>



<p>What did I do…I…I…!</p>




<p>I was just happy to have her by my side… but my feelings never reached Ayana, and she and Towa were in love with each other.</p>



<p>Seeing them together, I kept muttering to myself how absurd it was.</p>



<p>Unable to accept the current reality… I felt hatred, envy, and utter despair as I spewed out ugly words at the two of them… I was so miserable.</p>



<p>“…It’s quiet.”</p>



<p>I muttered to myself on the way home from school, walking alone.</p>



<p>With Towa and Ayana no longer by my side, my world had become quiet.</p>



<p>Having been rejected by Ayana and faced with reality by Towa, I had distanced myself from everyone, including Iori-san and Mari… spending my time alone like this.</p>



<p>But I was grateful for the quiet time alone.</p>



<p>Being alone like this allowed me to forget the unpleasant things… I didn’t have to think about anything… and more than anything, it gave me a chance to reflect on myself.</p>




<p>“Ayana looks so… so happy being with Towa.”</p>



<p>Thinking back on everything, sure, Ayana used to smile when she was with me, but seeing her now, I realized that the smiles she had with Towa were genuine.</p>



<p>In the end, I was just getting excited by myself.</p>



<p>I conveniently interpreted that Ayana liked me… ha, I was such a straightforward child.</p>



<p>“Without Towa and Ayana… I said it’s nice and quiet, but it’s really lonely.”</p>



<p>I do have other friends, but today I told them I wanted to go home alone, so no one is here… haha, it’s my own fault for feeling lonely after saying that.</p>



<p>“…Ah.”</p>



<p>As I saw my house coming into view, I made eye contact with a certain person.</p>



<p>“Ara, Shu-kun?”</p>




<p>Standing there was Ayana’s mother, Seina-san.</p>



<p>Well, it’s not unusual since our houses are across from each other, but I hadn’t seen her or spoken to her in a while.</p>



<p>Since I hadn’t seen Ayana, I naturally hadn’t interacted with Seina-san either, and my mom hadn’t met with Seina-san since the incident with Ayana.</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Even though Seina-san called my name when our eyes met, I had nothing to say since I had become estranged from Ayana… what kind of face should I make, and what should I talk about?</p>



<p>As I tried to walk past with my head down, Seina-san not only called out to me again but also made an unexpected suggestion.</p>



<p>“Shu-kun, would you like to come in for some tea?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>A sudden proposal… I almost refused and tried to run away, but I nodded.</p>




<p>I didn’t know why… but I felt like this was something I needed.</p>



<p>“Well then, come in, please.”</p>



<p>“Excuse me…”</p>



<p>Led by Seina-san, I was taken to a familiar living room where I was served tea, and a small tea party without Ayana began.</p>



<p>Even though it was called a tea party, there wasn’t any specific conversation in mind. I just sat there restlessly, my eyes darting around… and then I spotted a certain photograph.</p>



<p>“Ayana… and Towa.”</p>



<p>In the photo, Towa and Ayana looked exactly as they do now, smiling happily along with Seina-san and Towa’s mother. The warmth of their smiles made me smile too, despite myself.</p>



<p>(…Towa)</p>



<p>It’s not that I didn’t feel anything looking at Towa… or that I wasn’t jealous of him. But seeing that photo filled with warmth, I couldn’t help but smile and relax my cheeks.</p>




<p>“They look happy, don’t they? I never imagined a day would come when I would take a photo with Towa-kun and his mother Akemi, after having done such a terrible thing.”</p>



<p>A terrible thing…? What does Seina-san mean by that?</p>



<p>Sensing the question on my face, Seina-san began to explain. It was the same as what my mother and Kotone had done… the sin of saying cruel things to Towa in the past.</p>



<p>…If that’s a sin, then I’m guilty too. I had also mocked him.</p>



<p>Listening to Seina-san, what she told me was beyond anything I could have imagined.</p>



<p>“Ayana even said she hated sharing the same blood as me.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>I was at a loss for words at such a cruel story.</p>



<p>To me, it was something I could never say to my family… no matter how much we fought or how harsh our arguments got, I couldn’t say it, not even as a joke.</p>




<p>But Ayana said that…?</p>



<p>And this kind Seina-san, who had always treated me so nicely, said such horrible things to Towa…?</p>



<p>Wait, that’s too much information to process all at once.</p>



<p>(But… that’s how it was.)</p>



<p>How must Towa have felt at that time?</p>



<p>Seeing Ayana’s anger, it’s easy to imagine how hurt Towa must have been… he must have been deeply pained.</p>



<p>When he was told he couldn’t participate in the soccer tournament, he was stunned… and I laughed at him. Everything Ayana pointed out was true.</p>



<p>(I was… envious of Towa.)</p>



<p>Towa could do everything I couldn’t… he was good at sports, good at studying, and good-looking. He and Ayana made a perfect pair… I was envious and, at the same time, jealous, which is why I laughed… why I felt joy at his misfortune.</p>




<p>“Shu-kun? Are you okay?”</p>



<p>“…I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>Worried by my silence, Seina-san showed concern, and I apologized.</p>



<p>(I… am truly a terrible person.)</p>



<p>Even if he didn’t notice, laughing at someone’s misfortune is the lowest of the low.</p>



<p>Realizing anew how ugly and filthy I was inside made me feel sick… in the end, deep down, I didn’t see Towa as a friend but as an obstacle to getting closer to Ayana.</p>



<p>“…Haha.”</p>



<p>Ah… I really am nothing but a fool.</p>



<p>Confronting Towa on the rooftop, I was beyond saving… selfish to the core, never considering Ayana’s feelings… everything Towa said was true.</p>




<p>Afterward, I said my goodbyes to Seina-san and left.</p>



<p>Why did Seina-san call out to me… it wasn’t for something as convenient as wanting us to reconcile. She noticed I had been looking down… because Seina-san is a very kind person, she was worried about me. I’m sure of it.</p>



<p>“Haa…”</p>



<p>I headed straight to my room upon returning home and curled up on my bed. In the dimly lit room, my mind replayed memories of Towa, Ayana, and me, from our childhood days spent together.</p>



<p>“Towa… you’ve always been so cool.”</p>



<p>Towa was… he was always amazing. He had everything I didn’t, could do everything I couldn’t, and he did it all without becoming arrogant. He always worked hard at soccer and everything else… and I watched him do it all alongside Ayana.</p>



<p>“It’s frustrating, but… I get it. I understand why Ayana loves you… because you care about her so much… you love her so deeply.”</p>



<p>It hurts… it really does. I was undoubtedly a fool, but my feelings for Ayana were real… no matter what anyone says, I won’t let anyone call my feelings a lie. I truly loved Ayana.</p>



<p>“Be happy together… huh.”</p>




<p>I muttered Towa’s words. He declared that they would be happy together, while I foolishly believed that happiness would just come my way if I sought her affection. I was really hopeless.</p>



<p>“………”</p>



<p>I reached out towards the ceiling, clenching my fist as if trying to grasp the lost connection. No matter how much I regret it, no matter how much I look back at the past, my connection with Towa and Ayana is severed. It’s a fitting end for someone as hopeless as me to give up, thinking no words will reach them now.</p>



<p>[This time, I talked to you because I wanted you to look forward. Just as Towa-kun and Ayana helped me do… because right now, you’re just like I was when Ayana rejected me.]</p>



<p>Seina-san’s words as we parted echoed in my mind. Looking forward… I took it to mean not keeping my head down but raising it to see the future and move forward.</p>



<p>“Yeah… right. Nothing will change if I keep being down… and who knows how long it’ll take if I just hope time will solve everything… if I choose that path, I think I’ll end up regretting it… no, I definitely will.”</p>



<p>A future of regret or a future where I gave it my all, even if things didn’t go perfectly—there’s no need to think twice about it.</p>



<p>With a loud slap, I smacked my cheeks hard with both hands. It hurt… it hurt a lot more than I expected. I should’ve held back a bit… ouch.</p>



<p>“…Ah, my cheeks are bright red.”</p>




<p>My face in the mirror looked terrible. Even though it was to psych myself up, it’s typical of me to act without thinking, and I laughed bitterly at myself. But I felt incredibly clear-headed.</p>



<p>The time spent apart from Towa and Ayana, and the brief conversation with Seina-san, had given me a lot to think about.</p>



<p>“I… I want to make up with them. They might think it’s too late or question why I’m doing it now… or even if we can’t reconcile, even if Towa and Ayana reject me more… I want to apologize.”</p>



<p>Yes… I need to apologize. For laughing when Towa got hurt, for forcing my one-sided feelings onto Ayana. No matter what form it takes, I need to apologize… and above all, for causing everything with my carelessness. Even though I apologized back then, I need to apologize once more.</p>



<p>With that decision, my heart felt as light as if I had been reborn. Though I’m a coward and might get clouded again soon, it’s been a long time since I felt this lighthearted.</p>



<p>“It’s already evening, but Mom and Kotone aren’t home… I’ll go out again for a change of pace.”</p>



<p>Once I made up my mind, I moved quickly.</p>



<p>Changing quickly into my casual clothes, I headed outside… But this was my first time going out without having a specific place to go. If it got late and my mom called, I’d just hurry back home.</p>



<p>(…Is that?)</p>




<p>Just as I stepped out into the town, I noticed someone familiar in a difficult situation. That person had always looked out for me, even after what happened with Towa—she’s a senior and the student council president, Iori Honjo-san.</p>



<p>“Is she… being hit on?”</p>



<p>Seeing her being approached by a man in a suit, I thought Iori-san might be getting hit on, but upon closer inspection, it seemed different. Regardless, I could tell she was troubled, so I felt compelled to help her and started walking towards them.</p>



<p>(…I want to help… Even though I’ve always run away before, even when it was someone I was close to… Why am I acting differently now?)</p>



<p>There was a time when Ayana was being hit on, and I couldn’t do anything… I even tried to ignore it and got scolded by Towa. Despite being a coward, I felt an overwhelming urge to help the troubled Iori-san.</p>



<p>“Iori-san!”</p>



<p>“Eh? Shu-kun…?”</p>



<p>“W-what…?”</p>



<p>Iori-san looked surprised to see me, standing in front of her protectively. The man also seemed taken aback. It didn’t look like he was hitting on her after all.</p>




<p>“Could it be… Did you think I was hitting on her?”</p>



<p>“Judging by his reaction, it seems so.”</p>



<p>“Uhm…”</p>



<p>Wait… Did I just jump to conclusions? I felt anxious, but at least Iori-san didn’t seem to be bothered by my interference. She gently took my hand.</p>



<p>“Even though it wasn’t hitting on, I did find him a bit persistent. So, having him step in helped me a lot. Consider this a refusal from me.”</p>



<p>“…I understand. Sorry for being so insistent.”</p>



<p>After watching the exchange between Iori-san and the man, she led me to a bench a little farther away, where we sat down.</p>



<p>“Yare yare (good grief)… I never thought I’d get such an offer.”</p>



<p>“What was that all about?”</p>




<p>“He’s from a talent agency. It was a scouting offer.”</p>



<p>“A talent agency?!”</p>



<p>Isn’t that a big deal…?!</p>



<p>I must have been making an incredibly surprised face… But even if I couldn’t understand why Iori-san caught a scout’s eye, I couldn’t deny it either.</p>



<p>(Iori-san… She really is incredibly beautiful.)</p>



<p>Yes, Iori-san is truly beautiful. She has an elegant face and an outstanding figure, and there’s nothing to criticize about her appearance… And it’s not like she has a bad personality either. She’s great both inside and out.</p>



<p>“Fufu, why are you staring at me like that?”</p>



<p>“…I just thought that it makes sense for you to get scouted.”</p>



<p>“That’s quite a flattering thing to say… Fmm?”</p>




<p>“W-What is it…?”</p>



<p>Iori-san leaned in close, examining my face thoughtfully. As always, my timid nature made me nervous, and my face showed it right away. She was so close, and the pleasant scent she gave off made me instinctively look away.</p>



<p>“Sorry for staring like that. It’s just… I haven’t talked to you much recently, and it feels like your vibe has changed quite a bit.”</p>



<p>“My vibe…?”</p>



<p>My vibe has changed…? Even if someone says that, I don’t really understand it myself… But, I have a small suspicion. Perhaps it’s because I feel lighter after deciding that I want to apologize to Towa and Ayana and move forward… Could that be related?</p>



<p>“Something must have happened… Though that’s a silly question, isn’t it? Something must have happened to cause this change in you.”</p>



<p>“I do have an idea, but I’m not sure if that’s really it…”</p>



<p>“I’m intrigued… I definitely want to hear about it.”</p>



<p>Iori-san leaned in even closer than before. If I moved my face even a little, it would be a major accident… No, I can’t be thinking about things like that! But, Iori-san’s words were truly comforting for me at this moment.</p>




<p>“…Iori-san?”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“Would you mind listening to me for a bit?”</p>

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/soafp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3.jpg?w=608&ssl=1" alt="" />


<p>Even if it’s just for a bit, I want someone to listen to me… Even though I’ve thought about what to do next, I still wanted someone to hear me out.</p>



<p>“You said you’d tell me, but of course, I wasn’t going to force you to. If you want to tell me, then I’d love to hear it. Is that alright?”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>And so, I started to talk. I told her about how my actions over the years had destroyed my childhood friendships, how I had created an unbridgeable rift, and how I decided that I couldn’t go on like this. </p>



<p>Even if I couldn’t be forgiven, I wanted to apologize and move forward in my own way.</p>



<p>“I haven’t taken any action yet… But ever since I decided I needed to do this, my heart feels lighter. I haven’t talked to Towa or Ayana yet, but making that decision just now… maybe that’s the change you sensed, Iori-san.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>




<p>“Well… I know it’s overly optimistic to think that feeling a bit better without having done anything yet is a good sign. But this change feels significant to me… Iori-san?”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>I thought Iori-san was quietly listening because I was talking, but that didn’t seem to be the case. Looking at her, she seemed more surprised than when I interrupted her earlier, almost as if she doubted I was really Shu Sasaki.</p>



<p>“Iori-san…?”</p>



<p>“Oh, sorry.”</p>



<p>When I called her name, Iori-san snapped back to reality, blinking rapidly and still looking at me with those beautiful eyes.</p>



<p>“I was surprised because Shu-kun was so serious like I’ve never seen before. I’m not making fun of you—it’s just that you’ve grown up so much in such a short time. It made me feel a bit like an older sister.”</p>



<p>“An older sister… Well, you are older than me.”</p>



<p>“I was that surprised. You see, up until now, Shu-kun has never expressed himself like that, right? I almost couldn’t believe the arrogant words you said to Yukishiro-kun on the rooftop that day.”</p>




<p>“…Eh?”</p>



<p>Wait a minute… on the rooftop with Towa…?</p>



<p>I had so many memories of that, and that conversation had always lingered in my mind. Could it be that Iori-san knows about that exchange?</p>



<p>Realizing this new fact here, I felt an overwhelming sense of embarrassment and an immense sense of shame.</p>



<p>“Ugh…”</p>



<p>“Actually, at that time, I really accidentally overheard it. I saw you and Yukishiro-kun heading to the rooftop together… and I wondered what you were going to talk about.”</p>



<p>“…I see.”</p>



<p>This is bad… I feel like dying of embarrassment.</p>



<p>No, the very fact that I feel embarrassed about that exchange is already wrong. It just shows how pathetic I am as a person and a man.</p>




<p>(…But it’s truly strange. Even though I couldn’t accept it at that time, I can recall it now with a sense of calm.)</p>



<p>While I was thinking that, Iori-san gently held my hand. The warmth of her hands overlapping with mine made me feel her nurturing presence.</p>



<p>It was comforting… very calming.</p>



<p>“When I saw Shu-kun back then, I thought you were pathetic… and that your attitude was just unpleasant.”</p>



<p>Iori-san’s words made me smile bitterly. That’s exactly how I felt when I thought back on it. I deserved all of her words. But there was a kindness and thoughtfulness in Iori-san’s words, and I understood that she had cared about me all along.</p>



<p>“But I couldn’t just abandon you or stop caring. After all, the time we spent together wasn’t a lie, right? Did you hate spending time with me, Shu-kun?”</p>



<p>“There’s no way I could hate it!”</p>



<p>Naturally, I immediately denied it. Iori-san would often give me difficult tasks, drag me to the student council room without asking for my opinion… Wait, now that I think about it, those things might make me tilt my head a bit, but I never hated it. I never wished for the time spent with Iori-san to end.</p>



<p>“I’m glad to hear you say that. But when I thought about everything, I realized you needed time to think on your own… It was important for you to realize that things couldn’t go on like this by yourself.”</p>




<p>“…It took quite a long time, didn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Really. Both Uchida-san and I have been concerned about you, you know?”</p>



<p>“Mari too…”</p>



<p>That’s right… Mari is also like that. Just like with Iori-san, Mari is a junior I became friends with thanks to Ayana. Now that I think about it, even though Mari kept trying to talk to me, I kept ignoring that kind-hearted girl.</p>



<p>“…I’ll apologize to Mari too. I’ll definitely apologize.”</p>



<p>“That’s right. I think that will be good.”</p>



<p>It seems like I’ll have a lot of apologies to make for a while, but there’s no running away. It’s important for me to face sincerely those I hurt because of my actions.</p>



<p>“Fufu, your expression has become so much more resolute.”</p>



<p>“Really? You think so?”</p>




<p>“I do. What, you can make such a handsome face too, huh?”</p>



<p>“Ouch.”</p>



<p>She flicked my forehead, and I held it in pain. Well… that hurt a bit more than I expected… but that flick from Iori-san felt like it gave me the final push, or rather, a big boost of determination.</p>



<p>“Iori-san.”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“Thank you. For listening to me… and I’m sorry. I’ve worried you so much too.”</p>



<p>“…You’ve really changed, Shu-kun.”</p>



<p>I thanked her for listening to me and apologized for the worry I caused her. I was truly glad I met with Iori-san today… but then something unexpected happened.</p>



<p>“…Eh?”</p>




<p>“Good boy, you’ve grown up so well.”</p>



<p>“W-wait…?”</p>



<p>Before I knew it, Iori-san had placed her hand behind my head and pulled me into a hug. The soft, fluffy sensation against my face made my heart race to its peak, and I felt light-headed as if I were in a daze. Iori-san then released me, laughing softly, which confirmed that she did it on purpose.</p>



<p>“I won’t irresponsibly tell you everything will be alright, but I do think you’ve grown into someone admirable for facing forward like this. So, keep it up.”</p>



<p>“Ah… yes!”</p>



<p>“And… Shu-kun?”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“Would you help with student council work again?”</p>



<p>I told her I would be more than happy to help. And so, the day that brought about significant change for me passed—Towa, Ayana… I hope I can talk to you both, even if just a little. I want to apologize.</p>




<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>[Towa PoV]</p>



<p>Several days had passed since the interview with Bundou senpai, and it had become a bit warmer again. Even early in the morning, the temperature rise was subtly noticeable. Though it wasn’t unbearable yet, the thought of sweltering nights to come made me feel gloomy.</p>



<p>“…I really don’t want to use the air conditioner too much.”</p>



<p>I understand that it’s becoming necessary, but I’ve forgotten to turn it off a few times and have even caught a chill from setting the temperature too low. Well, I just need to be more careful.</p>



<p>“Alright, let’s get going.”</p>



<p>My mom had already left for work, so I made sure to lock up before leaving the house. Normally, I’d be walking to school with Ayana, but last night, she messaged me saying she’d be going with Todo-san today.</p>



<p>“Walking to school alone once in a while isn’t so bad.”</p>



<p>Since Ayana is usually by my side, this quietness feels quite refreshing.</p>



<p>“Walking to school alone… even in my past life… here we go again.”</p>




<p>There it is again. I find myself thinking about my past life as I walk alone to school. It’s not something I need to recall now, nor is it something I intentionally try to remember, yet it bothers me that I keep doing it. I suddenly turn around, feeling as if something is pulling me back.</p>



<p>“…What’s going on?”</p>



<p>I must be making a really bad face right now. While it doesn’t feel exactly uncomfortable, I need to shake off this feeling soon. I don’t want to spend the whole day in this mood.</p>



<p>“At times like this… I wish Ayana were here.”</p>



<p>…Was I always someone who complained this much? No, no! If I keep making such a face, it’ll make my whole day feel gloomy, and more importantly, it’ll worry Ayana… I need to get a grip.</p>



<p>“Alright…!”</p>



<p>I slapped my cheeks with a loud smack to shake off the negativity. Ouch… that really hurt… it actually stings. Maybe I overdid it a bit? I hope it doesn’t swell.</p>



<p>“Are you okay?”</p>



<p>“Did something upset you?”</p>




<p>“Ah… no, no, I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>I thought I was alone, but it turns out there was an elderly couple nearby taking a walk. Instead of being weirded out by my sudden actions, they kindly expressed concern, which was touching. I reassured them with a smile and walked away.</p>



<p>“…Haha, is this the anxiety Ayana talked about?”</p>



<p>If she felt this way, I can understand why she clung to me so tightly when she was anxious… I really get it now.</p>



<p>“I don’t know what’s making me uneasy… the footsteps of my past life? As if.”</p>



<p>My past life shouldn’t matter to me now. No one’s here telling me that I don’t belong in this world or accusing me of stealing Ayana from the original Towa.</p>



<p>[You’re overthinking it. You are Towa now—the Towa Yukishiro who saved the current Ayana. And the Ayana who loves you now is yours alone.]</p>



<p>I chuckled at the thought of hearing such reassuring words. If the original Towa, whom I met once in a dream, said that, then there’s no reason for me to be anxious.</p>



<p>Even so, my steps felt lighter with the desire to see Ayana’s face as soon as possible.</p>




<p>I told myself this was exercise, yes, exercise, as I hurried along the road to school.</p>



<p>“…Eh?”</p>



<p>As I continued walking and passed through the school gate, I saw the student council members greeting everyone. Of course, President Iori was there, but what caught my eye was Shu standing next to her.</p>



<p>“Good morning!”</p>



<p>“Good morning!”</p>



<p>Shu’s energetic voice carried over to me, and standing next to Iori, he looked… well, he looked like a new person, with a bright and cheerful expression on his face. I watched as Mari, who had been walking ahead of me, ran over to Shu and started talking with Iori and him.</p>



<p>“…That guy.”</p>



<p>Shu bowed his head to Mari, who, in a flustered manner, waved her hands saying no. From their interaction, I could gather a lot of things, but it was clear that after a long time, the girls had gathered around Shu again.</p>



<p>(…Iori really cares about him.)</p>




<p>Iori watched Shu and Mari with very kind eyes. It was easy to recognize because it was similar to the way Ayana looks at me.</p>



<p>“Looks like things are getting better for you, Shu.”</p>



<p>Feeling happy to see the smile return to Shu’s face, which had been so dark for so long, I headed towards the classroom. As I entered the room, Ayana, who had been talking with Todo-san, immediately approached me.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, good morni—”</p>



<p>“Ayana.”</p>



<p>As she came closer, I hugged her tightly. The soft and warm sensation from Ayana melted away the anxiety I had felt earlier. However, I quickly realized we were in a classroom full of classmates. Apologizing for the sudden hug, I let go and headed to my seat.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, what happened?”</p>



<p>“…Ah—”</p>



<p>Aside from the shrill voices of some girls, hugging Ayana like that surely made it obvious that something was wrong.</p>




<p>“Well, it’s nothing much. I just felt anxious because Ayana wasn’t by my side today… so I ended up hugging you.”</p>



<p>“Ara… Fufu♪ That’s just like me before, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“I’m not sure if it’s the same level of anxiety, but I can understand why you’d want to do that when you feel like this.”</p>



<p>“That’s a good sign♪ Not just me, but you too, Towa-kun, should become more dependent on me♪”</p>



<p>Too much dependency isn’t good, but having her try to envelop me with such immense love… I can only describe it as perfect.</p>



<p>“By the way, Towa-kun, did you see Shu-kun?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I saw him. His smile is back… Mari was with him, too. They were laughing together after a long time.”</p>



<p>“Is that so? Iori-senpai slightly bowed her head and made eye contact with Shu-kun. He seemed nervous… but clearly different from before.”</p>



<p>Ayana had also noticed Shu’s change. Despite everything that happened in the past, both Ayana and I had been concerned about Shu. Even if we never talked again, as long as Shu could move forward, we, as his childhood friends, would be happy.</p>




<p>As I’ve said many times, both Ayana and I have already overcome the past. There’s no hatred or resentment; we just want Shu to look ahead and see the future like we do.</p>



<p>“Oh, Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“You mentioned feeling anxious… are you still feeling that way? Should we go to an empty classroom so I can comfort you?”</p>



<p>“Haha, I’m fine now. Thank you, Ayana.”</p>



<p>“…Well, I was kind of hoping you’d say yes.”</p>



<p>Ayana confessed with a playful smile, sticking out her tongue.</p>



<p>Of course, I wanted to spend time alone with Ayana, but honestly, I was fine now.</p>



<p>“By the way, weren’t you planning to hang out with Todo-san and the others after school today?”</p>




<p>“Yes, that’s the plan… but if you say you’re lonely! If you say you’re anxious, I’ll cancel!”</p>



<p>I didn’t think I was that weak, though!? I put a hand on Ayana’s shoulder, who was eagerly offering to cancel, and reassured her that it wasn’t necessary. Ayana reluctantly agreed.</p>



<p>So, if she’s going to hang out with them, I’ll be free after school, won’t I?</p>



<p>“Guu… Towa-kun looks so lonely! Maybe I should—”</p>



<p>“I said I’m fine!”</p>



<p>I restrained Ayana, who was about to go tell Toudou-san she couldn’t make it, insisting that it was okay.</p>



<p>“Ugh…! But I’m going to cancel… for Towa-kun’s sake!”</p>



<p>“Don’t be hasty! I’m not that weak… I’m not weak at all!”</p>



<p>“What are you two doing?”</p>




<p>And there it was, Todo-san, looking exasperated at the spectacle.</p>



<p>In the end, Ayana understood my wish for her to cherish time with her friends as well as with me. Although she agreed with a very reluctant nod, it was clear she was heartbroken to do so.</p>



<p>“If either of you were missing, I wonder what would happen.”</p>



<p>“Todo-san, that’s a terrible joke.”</p>



<p>“I’m soooorry!!”</p>



<p>Although it was obviously a joke from Todo-san, Ayana’s voice was incredibly stern. Ayana’s stern look made not only Todo-san but also all our classmates in front of her gasp in fear. What kind of face did you make, Ayana?</p>



<p>“A-Ayana…?”</p>



<p>“Yes, what is it♪”</p>



<p>She turned around with the cutest smile… she was really adorable. Seeing Ayana’s classmates behind her clapping and some even praying like I was some kind of hero who had tamed a demon lord made me even more curious about what kind of face she had made!</p>




<p>“Ufufufu♪”</p>



<p>“Hiii?!”</p>



<p>“Spare me!”</p>



<p>“Please, just spare my life!”</p>



<p>Our classmates were visibly terrified by Ayana’s smile… In the end, I never found out what kind of face Ayana had made.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>“Alright Towa-kun, I’ll definitely contact you tonight.”</p>



<p>“Got it. Have fun.”</p>



<p>“Yeah!”</p>



<p>After school already arrived, Ayana left the classroom with Todo-san and the others, and since I didn’t have any specific plans, I left the classroom shortly after. As I reached the shoe lockers, I was unexpectedly called out to by someone.</p>




<p>“Towa!”</p>



<p>“…Shu?”</p>



<p>Yes, it was Shu. To tell the truth, I had noticed several times today that our eyes met, and I wondered what was going on.</p>



<p>“What’s up—”</p>



<p>“Oh, Yukishiro-kun! We meet again!”</p>



<p>Just as I was about to ask what was going on, Bundou-senpai intervened. Both Shu and I were surprised by the sudden interruption. Bundou-senpai looked at both of us and said with a start:</p>



<p>“Oops, sorry to interrupt. I don’t have anything important, but when I saw Yukishiro-kun, I couldn’t help but call out.”</p>



<p>“Oh.”</p>



<p>“Thanks to your cooperation with Otonashi-san, we’re about to complete a fantastic article. After that, we’ll determine the rankings through a rigorous review. Please look forward to it!”</p>




<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>“Well then! Adios!”</p>



<p>…What a stormy person, seriously. I watched Bundou-senpai head towards the club room, then turned back to face Shu again.</p>



<p>“Um… sorry about that.”</p>



<p>“No, I… should be the one saying sorry out of the blue.”</p>



<p>“So…?”</p>



<p>“Well, um… I was wondering if…”</p>



<p>“Oh, Shu-kun and Yukishiro-kun?”</p>



<p>“Again!?”</p>




<p>“Eh!? What!? What’s going on!?”</p>



<p>Next, it was Iori who called out to us. Both Shu and I responded simultaneously, and Iori seemed so flustered that her eyes darted back and forth between us.</p>



<p>After a while of awkward silence, it seemed Iori decided that since Shu and I were facing each other here, it wasn’t right for her to intrude.</p>



<p>“I see. Well then, I’ll leave you two alone. Shu-kun, do your best.”</p>



<p>“Ah… yes.”</p>



<p>(…What on earth is going on?)</p>



<p>It’s intriguing… though I wonder what it could be.</p>



<p>After waving to Shu, Iori waved to me and added a wink before leaving… Her departure felt like a perfect exit for someone who has it all together.</p>



<p>“…Next is…”</p>




<p>“There’s no one else, right?”</p>



<p>“………………”</p>



<p>“………………”</p>



<p>“Alright, shall we move?”</p>



<p>“Thank you.”</p>



<p>It was sudden, but finally, there was nothing to come between us. Thinking about it this way, there’s a kind of nervousness akin to a confession… But being with Shu right now doesn’t feel bad at all.</p>



<p>It even reminds me of the pure feelings we had when we used to play together in the past… Yeah.</p>



<p>Leaving school, we headed to the park… Not the park where things happened with Ayana, but another place.</p>



<p>“Here.”</p>




<p>“T-thanks…”</p>



<p>Feeling that silence would be awkward, I bought a juice from the vending machine and handed it to Shu. Even though we both seemed calm, there was definitely some nervousness lingering, so let’s start by calming down first.</p>



<p>After we gulped down about half of the contents of the canned juice in one go, we sat down on an unused swing.</p>



<p>“You… seem to have brightened up a lot, haven’t you?”</p>



<p>“You think so? Well… I’m glad to hear that. I’ve had some time to think about things, and I talked to Iori-san.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“Yeah…”</p>



<p>Then, Shu looked at me and said,</p>



<p>“Towa, I want to talk to you… about everything that’s happened so far, and what I’ve been thinking about the future.”</p>




<p>“Got it. Let’s talk then.”</p>



<p>And so, this marked the beginning of a long-awaited conversation between Shu and me.</p>
