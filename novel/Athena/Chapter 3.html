<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>“What do you guys think of this year’s examinees?”</p>
<p>‘&#8212;Inside Rosanlila Magic Academy’s conference room&#8212;’</p>
<p>The staff had gathered there to discuss this year’s exam results.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty good”</p>
<p>One of the staff members said.</p>
<p>“First of all, coming from a distinguished family of mages, the daughter of the Sizenosna family, Marise Sizenosna. Despite having ‘Inferior Magic Power’, her talents are amazing. She used the highest-ranked magic during the practical exam. She is considered by far the most outstanding one among the examinees”</p>
<p>“That girl, Lara, is incredible, too. Even though she couldn’t hit the Mud Dolls, but she was able to unleash powerful magic. She will get stronger with training”</p>
<p>Everyone in the conference room looked excited as they talked about their notable examinees one after another.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>At the far end of the room, the headmaster folded her arms and listened to all the chatter in silence.</p>
<p>The headmaster&#8212;she has the appearance of a young girl.</p>
<p>However, there seems to be a thick solemn atmosphere around her, as if she had been through many experiences.</p>
<p>“Hmm. I understand what you guys are trying to say. But there is only one boy with abnormal power, isn’t it? A boy called Kurt”</p>
<p>When the headmaster mentions that name, the examiners, who have been talkative, immediately stop.</p>
<p>The magic of that boy, Kurt, was too overwhelming.</p>
<p>So much so that it was as if they were witnessing a fantastical dream.</p>
<p>“What are Kurt’s exam scores?”</p>
<p>“As one would expect, he has exceeded the passing score for both the target and battle exams by a large margin”</p>
<p>“What about his written exam?”</p>
<p>“His written exam was excellent, too. The magic formula he drew was several levels higher than what we had anticipated, especially that last question”</p>
<p>“The last question…. Ohh, is that the question that was made based on the premise that it wouldn’t be possible to solve by just anyone?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, it’s a question based on the long lost magic theory from a thousand years ago. What he wrote on his answer sheet was evidence that supports the aforementioned theory of lost magic, which many would regard have been impossible with our current understanding of magic”</p>
<p>“What did you just say&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“If we present it to the ‘Institute’, a revolution will occur. It has that kind of content. But even if we try to use it now, it still won’t be up to par with our current capabilities” <em>|Editor’s Note: That ‘Institute’ is subject to change|</em></p>
<p>The staff member shrugged.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the headmaster was at a loss for words with the sudden arrival of such great talent.</p>
<p>However, if it’s Kurt&#8212;he might be able to achieve the ‘Revolution’ that the headmaster had very much desired for.</p>
<p>“Then it has been decided. He has passed the entrance exam”</p>
<p>None of the staff members disagreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>After the practical exam ended, there was some free time before the day of the results was supposed to be announced.</p>
<p>“I’m nervous”</p>

<p>I wandered aimlessly around the city until the day of the announcement of the results arrived before heading towards the magic academy.</p>
<p>Lara ran up to me and said, “Kurt! Let’s go see it together!”.</p>
<p>There is no particular reason to refuse, so we decided to check the results together.</p>
<p>We proceeded to the location where the numbers of every candidate who passed the entrance exam are posted.</p>
<p>As I observe the surrounding area, everyone looked very nervous.</p>
<p>In the midst of this,</p>
<p>“AH!”</p>
<p>Just as I thought I heard a voice, a girl rapidly approached us.</p>
<p>“You’re&#8230;Kurt Lepracta!”</p>
<p>“And you are&#8212;Marise, right?”</p>
<p>“&#8212;! So you remembered my name”</p>
<p>Marise’s cheeks blushed momentarily from happiness.</p>
<p>However, she quickly shook her head.</p>
<p>“O-Of course! We did fight hard in the practical exam after all! Though there was a slight difference in our abilities…&#8230;”</p>
<p>She was muttering to herself.</p>
<p>Marise, huh…. During that low-level exam, she was the only one who used the intermediate level magic, Holy Sword.</p>
<p>As for Lara, I noticed she has good talents, too.</p>
<p>“Besides&#8230;it’s so shameless of you to have a girl accompany you on the day of the announcement of the results!”</p>
<p>“Shameless?”</p>
<p>“I mean, isn’t that true? What a pity! I don’t know if she is your girlfriend or maybe not, but to lose to such a guy&#8230;how could I&#8230;”</p>
<p>said Marise, looking really frustrated.</p>
<p>“Whoa, Kurt and I don’t have the kind of relationship that Marise-chan is thinking about!”</p>
<p>“Though that is what I’m hoping for eventually&#8230;”</p>
<p>Lara mumbled.</p>
<p>“Marise-chan. I’m Lara. Nice to meet you!”</p>
<p>“Likewise, nice to meet you&#8212;wait, I didn’t come to this academy to make friends!”</p>
<p>Marise with a pouty face immediately folded her arms and looked away.</p>
<p>However, she seems to be a tad bit delighted. I don’t really understand this girl’s emotions.</p>
<p>“Oh. They’re finally going to post the notice of successful candidates”</p>
<p>As we were having our conversation, a person who seemed to be a staff member came and started to post up a big piece of paper on the notice board.</p>
<p>There were the examinees’ number and something that looked like scores written next to it.</p>
<p>“The exam scores for each of the written, target and battle exams are 100 points respectively, totaling to 300 points. The passing score this time will be 170 points and above”</p>
<p>The staff member announced</p>
<p>“Eh?? 170 points!? But it was just 140 points last year…&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Does that mean the standard is higher this year?”</p>
<p>cried the people around me.</p>
<p>I don’t know about last year, but what matters is now.</p>
<p>Let’s see&#8230;I wonder what’s my score.</p>
<p>I doubt it, but I didn’t fail, did I?</p>
<p>When I looked up, it was written in a prominent place, right at the top,</p>
<p>‘Examinee Number 99   ∞ Points’</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>99 is me.</p>
<p>“Ah, there it is! I made it!”</p>
<p>“T-There’s mine, too! Though it doesn’t seem to be the top spot that I was aiming for…&#8230;”</p>
<p>It looks like Lara and Marise had passed as well, and they are quite happy right now.</p>
<p>“Hmm, looks like I’ve passed, too. I’m glad that I didn’t fail. I would be the only one among the three of us if I did fail”</p>
<p>“Obviously! There’s no way Kurt would fail”</p>
<p>“That’s right. More importantly, what do the ∞ points mean? Even I, in second place, only have a score of 285 points…”</p>
<p>That’s what I want to know as well.</p>
<p>&#8212;At any rate, I’m now a first-year student at the Magic Academy.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>She looks at me.</p>
<p>…&#8230;Damn.</p>
<p>What should I say?</p>
<p>Well, I don’t have to be like Erika-sensei, trying to be funny.</p>
<p>Let’s end this peacefully.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, I moved back my chair and stood up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m Kurt. Kurt Lepracta. I hope to live a peaceful and happy life in this school. Nice to meet you all”</p>
<p>After finishing my introduction, a weak applause followed, and the students began whispering to each other.</p>
<p>“Kurt who passed as the top student…. Ahh&#8230;he was the examinee 99, right?”</p>
<p>“I heard he broke all 10 Mud Dolls in one fell swoop”</p>
<p>“That’s not all. In the practical exam, he was able to make a huge ‘Holy Sword’ appear, and he seems to have won against Desmond-san, too”</p>
<p>“But I heard that he has the ‘Defective Magic Power’? It all just sounds so unreal! I didn’t watch the fight&#8230;but it must be a lie!”</p>
<p>I wonder if it’s because I was being a little too conspicuous during the entrance exam?</p>
<p>Even though it’s only my first day at school, it’s like I’m already famous.</p>
<p>“Excuse me! May I ask a question, Kurt-kun!”</p>
<p>One of the girls raised her hand and stood up.</p>
<p>“Kurt-kun has an exam score of ‘∞’, right? Full marks are supposed to be 300 points&#8230;so what does that ‘∞’ mean?”</p>
<p>“You can ask the examiner about that”</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>Seeing that, Erika-sensei decided to reply on my behalf.</p>
<p>“It means exactly as it is. Kurt does not fit into the 300 points category”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t fit into…&#8230;the 300 points category…&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“To be precise, we couldn’t score him. That’s just how it is. Ah, right&#8230;Kurt. Can you try to solve this problem?”</p>
<p>said Erika-sensei as she writes out a magic formula on the blackboard.</p>
<p>Hmmm..….it looks like this is the magic formula of Ifrit Flare.</p>
<p>In my previous life, it was a high-ranking magic.</p>
<p>I never thought I’d be able to see something like this in this era&#8230;.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Hm? But that’s…&#8230;”</p>
<p>There are far too many errors.</p>
<p>As it is, it will go out of control and the magic won’t be able to activate properly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Sensei. Isn’t that magic formula wrong?”</p>
<p>“Oh? It’s wrong? Then please write down the correct magic formula for me”</p>
<p>I didn’t expect that she would suddenly set me up.</p>
<p>“You may use this piece of chalk”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t need it. I can write without it”</p>
<p>“What do you mean&#8212;Wha-!!!”</p>
<p>Sensei’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>Before she could even blink, a new magic formula has been written all over the blackboard.</p>
<p>“What is going on here……??”</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to start from scratch, so I just projected the magic formula in my head directly onto the blackboard. Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>“N-No, it’s not that, but……”</p>
<p>Erika-sensei quickly adjusts her glasses and takes another serious look at the magic formula I wrote.</p>
<p>“WOW…&#8230;! Amazing!! This one is certainly more logical and beautiful!! I don’t think I have enough magic power to materialize it…but I really didn’t think it was possible&#8230;!!”</p>
<p>For some reason, she looked very excited.</p>
<p>“Sensei?”</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry. It seems like I was overly excited”</p>
<p>“Then&#8230;is it correct?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sensei nodded and then replied,</p>
<p>“It’s not correct”</p>
<p>Eh&#8230;?</p>
<p>Does that mean I’m wrong&#8230;?</p>
<p>“There’s no correct answer in the first place”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that, Sensei?”</p>
<p>“This is one of the ‘Lost Magic’ which has been lost in the annals of time. There’s no one in this school&#8212;or even in the entire world who can handle this”</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>Even if it’s a high-ranking magic, anyone who could use a little bit of magic, can cast it continuously, right?</p>
<p>It’s the kind of magic that’s suitable for attacking a large area.</p>
<p>If the enemy hadn’t set up a barrier, an entire city could be blown away easily. And after the magic revolution happened a thousand years ago, it was common to have this level of magic that can destroy entire cities.</p>
<p>For that reason, it was a common practice to set up barriers that cover entire cities.</p>
<p>“However, the remaining descriptions of the ‘Lost Magic’ in the old literature…&#8230;we tried to decipher and restore it as much as possible, and the result was the magic formula that I had written earlier……but the formula written by Kurt is much better. It’s on a different level”</p>
<p>Sensei muttered to herself.</p>
<p>In contrast, the students who were watching as this whole event unfolded,</p>
<p>“Is a magic formula supposed to be that long?”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it take an hour to set up that magic formula during a battle? And what’s with the structure of the chant?”</p>
<p>said the students.</p>
<p>“……So everyone understands, right? In the exam, there was also a similar problem like this. After much consideration, we had no choice but to give him an ‘∞’ score. Needless to say, he’s the undisputed top student”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, nobody argued that statement.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Well&#8230;my self-introduction took a little longer than expected, but the following ones went on without any issue.</p>
<p>“I’m Lara! Everyone, please let us all be friends!”</p>
<p>“I’m Marise. Nice to meet you all”</p>
<p>Among all the self-introductions, Lara and Marise were the ones who attracted the most attention.</p>
<p>Guess it can’t be helped.</p>
<p>In the exam, Lara and Marise’s magic was clearly head and shoulders above the rest.</p>
<p>That’s probably why they’re getting so much attention.</p>
<p>“Well then. Now that all 30 of you have finished introducing yourselves, there’s something that I need to tell everyone here. Let’s talk about that for today then call it a day”</p>
<p>Putting her hands on the lectern, Erika-sensei continued in a more serious tone.</p>
<p>“I suppose all of you are also aware that there’s a dungeon called 《Treasure Labyrinth》 on the grounds of this school”</p>
<p>A Labyrinth, huh&#8230;that sounds nostalgic.</p>
<p>“The 《Treasure Labyrinth》 is an underground dungeon. There are different types of monsters living there and many treasures that no one has touched yet. Even though you’re first-year students, if you have met certain conditions, then you can challenge the 《Treasure Labyrinth》 and train your skills there. This is one of the main selling points of Rosanlila Magic Academy”</p>
<p>said Erika-sensei proudly.</p>
<p>These dungeons called Labyrinths existed a thousand years ago, too.</p>
<p>I often went into these dungeons to collect materials for making magic tools and to kill some time.</p>
<p>For example, in my previous life, the 《Sorlahese Great Labyrinth》 that I’ve traversed and spent three days in there, has 1000 layers underground.</p>
<p>It was just a Labyrinth, but it was quite enjoyable at the time.</p>
<p>“It’s said that the 《Treasure Labyrinth》, which is classified as a ‘Great Labyrinth’, has up to 100 layers. Moreover, no one has ever set foot in the lowest layer. It’s a Labyrinth that’s still shrouded in mystery”</p>
<p>For me, a Labyrinth with just 100 layers is a rather small Labyrinth, but&#8230;well, let’s just keep my mouth shut here, and not make a scene again.</p>
<p>“In two month’s time, within that same 《Treasure Labyrinth》, an exhibition game will be held with the Disaria Magic Academy from the Empire’s imperial capital. Do any of you know about that?”</p>
<p>When Sensei asked, about half of the students in the class raised their hands.</p>
<p>Among them was Marise.</p>
<p>“Then allow me to elaborate a little on the exhibition game. To put it simply, it’s a friendly competition game with the Disaria Magic Academy. Each magic academy will have three representatives and dive into the Labyrinth as a team. Those teams will then compete with each other to see who can obtain the most materials and treasures within a time limit”</p>
<p>Oh? There’s an event like that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Basically, it’s held for the purpose of having a good competitive spirit and strengthening the relationship between us…but for the past few years, we, the Rosanlila Magic Academy, have been losing to Disaria Magic Academy from the Imperial Capital. If we lose this year as well, it will be the first time in our history to have a 10-time losing streak”</p>
<p>So, they keep losing, huh?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;the Empire’s imperial capital was destroyed by the demon, Vonbax, 1000 years ago.</p>
<p>But seems like, over the years, they managed to succeed in their restoration efforts.</p>
<p>There were many nobles that I disliked in the Empire, so even just remembering them made me feel sick.</p>
<p>“We want to win at all costs this year! Let’s put an end to this disgraceful losing streak! That’s why we need everyone here to help out too!”</p>
<p>With fervor, Sensei slammed her hands down on the lectern.</p>
<p>But&#8212;a question started to arise in my mind.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a little strange to have so many consecutive losses? Is the standard between the Rosanlila Magic Academy and the Empire’s Disaria Magic Academy really that far off?”, I asked.</p>
<p>Hearing that, Sensei clenched her teeth and replied,</p>
<p>“No&#8230;I don’t think there’s that big of a difference in the skills itself&#8230;it’s just that, we couldn’t win due to unfortunate circumstances”</p>
<p>Unfortunate circumstances?</p>
<p>Somehow, this is kind of fishy.</p>
<p>It’s the cowardly Empire after all. There’s the possibility that they did something.</p>
<p>&#8230;No, my conventional wisdom about the Empire being cowardly is from 1000 years ago.</p>
<p>They may be different in this era. Besides, it’s not good to be prejudiced.</p>
<p>“But, I think we can win this year. After all, this year’s batch of first-year students is excellent. Everyone&#8230;let us win the upcoming exhibition game!!”</p>
<p>“Are the first-year students going to be selected as the representatives?”</p>
<p>“Most of them are in their third-year&#8230;but if there are any outstanding first-year students, they’ll be selected. And for this year, I think one of them is definitely going to be selected”</p>
<p>While Sensei was talking, I noticed she took a glance at me.</p>
<p>Oh well, I guess that’s fine.</p>
<p>To become a representative, I’ll have to accumulate achievements first.</p>
<p>And I have no intention of losing.</p>
<p>She said it’s for the sake of having a good relationship with the other magic academy, but a competition is still a competition.</p>
<p>Only a complete victory will be considered a win.</p>
<p>After Sensei’s talk was over, I was about to leave the classroom but then, Lara came up to me and tapped me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“Kurt! May I have a moment?”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I have a favor to ask of you. Please&#8230;teach me some magic!”</p>
<p>said Lara as she has her clenched fist in front of her chest while giving me an intense gaze.</p>
<p>“What made you suddenly say that?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“After listening to what Sensei said just now&#8230;I’m motivated now like a fire has been lit! And besides, it was all thanks to Kurt for helping me with the exam. I don’t think I’m strong enough yet&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s true”</p>
<p>“It’s true! That’s why&#8230;I want to learn from Kurt to hone my skills in magic. So&#8212;please, Kurt! No matter how hard the training is, I’ll endure it!</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>She’s a good child of great ambition.</p>
<p>I don’t hate children like her.</p>
<p>“Include me as well, please”</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking about my reply, Marise also came over and asked something similar to Lara’s.</p>
<p>“Marise, too?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve yet to give up on my goal to graduate from this school as a valedictorian. So I thought it would be best to learn from you”</p>
<p>“So, you’re trying to imply that&#8230;you want to steal my knowledge on magic from me?”</p>
<p>“You can think of it that way, too”</p>
<p>There seems to be a fire in Marise’s eyes as well.</p>
<p>“Hmm”</p>
<p>Great, I’m in trouble.</p>
<p>A thousand years ago, no one would dare tell me that.</p>
<p>Even if they did, they were only pretending so that they could cut off my head when I slept.</p>
<p>That’s why&#8212;when someone makes requests like these two, I get confused and uncertain on how to respond.</p>
<p>Because of that,</p>
<p>“I don’t think I can do it?”, I replied.</p>
<p>Was I too quiet?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lara looked up at me with an uneasy look on her face and her head tilted to one side.</p>
<p>“But…”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Will it be better if we display our abilities?”</p>
<p>Marise who was standing at the side intervened.</p>
<p>“Whether we deserve to have you teach us magic or not…. We fought against each other in the entrance exam, but if you can’t tell by that alone, I’ll show you my full capability. With that, I’m sure I can convince you”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Me too, me too! I’m not confident&#8230;but I’ll do my best!”</p>
<p>Apparently, this has become a misunderstanding as they thought I’m thinking it’s not worth teaching them magic.</p>
<p>“Kukuku…”</p>
<p>“Why are you laughing!?”</p>
<p>Isn’t this interesting?</p>
<p>“All right, I understand. Let’s have a little test. And if the two of you pass, I’ll teach both of you magic”</p>
<p>“Yay!! I’ll do my best”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with you, Lara? He hasn’t decided to teach us yet”</p>
<p>“Ehehe, you’re right”</p>
<p>Marise calmly interjected, but Lara’s cheeks were already forming at the end of a broad smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So&#8230;what’s the test?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of going to the 《Treasure Labyrinth》 that Sensei was talking about earlier. So I’ll take a look at your aptitudes there”</p>
<p>At those words, Lara and Marise’s expressions tensed up.</p>
<p>“Eh&#8230;in the&#8230;《Treasure Labyrinth》&#8230;? Isn’t it dangerous for us to suddenly go in there as first-year students?”</p>
<p>“As long as I’m around, you’re safe. And didn’t you hear? Three representatives will be selected for the exhibition game. Therefore&#8230;no, from now on, I want Lara and Marise to join me as a party for subjugating the Labyrinth”</p>
<p>““EH?””</p>
<p>They both exclaimed in unison.</p>
<p>It’s more efficient to train Lara and Marise this way, so let’s add them to the party anyway. I prefer this over being in a situation where I don’t know who I’ll be partnered with.</p>
<p>Besides, I’ve gotten tired of subjugating Labyrinths all by myself 1000 years ago</p>
<p>In that case&#8212;it might be interesting to try subjugating a Labyrinth with a party in this era.</p>
<p>“It kind of surprises me”</p>
<p>“What does that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“You don’t seem to like company, parties, or anything of the sort. I thought you’d prefer getting everything done by yourself”</p>
<p>What is she talking about?</p>
<p>It’s not like I like being alone.</p>
<p>I also wanted to make friends in my previous life, but that failed.</p>
<p>Fearing my power, the people around me all left.</p>
<p>“I’ve yet to decide if I’m going to party with you two&#8230;but for the time being, we’ll be working together. And therefore, nice to meet you”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Likewise, nice to meet you, Marise-chan!”</p>
<p>said Lara, offering her hand out to Marise, but&#8212;</p>
<p>“I-I don’t need friends! But&#8230;if I could form a party with Kurt, I could see his magic up close. I also don’t want to form a party with a liability from here on out&#8230;just for clarification, we are not friends, I’m just joining you guys because of the benefits. Please don’t misunderstand here”&nbsp;</p>
<p>said Marise coldly, turning her back on Lara.</p>
<p>“I-I see&#8230;I guess we won’t just suddenly get along. At any rate, let’s make lots of fun memories from now on as we get along with each other!”</p>
<p>Hmm. Marise is a very ambitious child as well, huh?</p>
<p>With that being said, Lara is also mentally strong. It’s a valuable trait to have her maintain such a cheery tone, even when Marise acted like that to her.</p>
<p>“Anyway&#8230;the forming of the party will have to wait until the test is over. So come on, let’s get going!”</p>
<p>“Eh? Where to?”</p>
<p>I think that should be obvious by now.</p>
<p>“It’s the Labyrinth”</p>
