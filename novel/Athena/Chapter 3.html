<h2>Chapter 2: You Gave Me Emotional Support</h2>


<p>「Sorry for the wait, Kamome-kun.」</p>



<p>Good morning, Himawari.</p>



<p>Today was finally the day of the date.</p>



<p>Kamome, who was waiting earlier on the platform of the station that was designated as the meeting place, waves her hand to Himawari, who has just arrived.</p>



<p>By the way, today, Kamome is wearing the clothes he bought the other day.</p>



<p>Over a new T-shirt, he is wearing a shirt with an eight-tenths sleeve.</p>



<p>And jeans underneath.</p>



<p>…It’s not particularly fashionable, and it may be plain.</p>



<p>Even now, Kamome regretted that he should have chosen more carefully.</p>



<p>This is partly because, on the other hand, Himawari’s outfit is quite well-dressed.</p>



<p>「W-What do you think of my outfit… Do I look weird?」</p>



<p>Himawari asks timidly with upturned eyes.</p>



<p>She is wearing a floral one-piece dress with a pink cardigan over it.</p>



<p>It’s a cute, loose-fitting outfit that suits Himawari well.</p>



<p>In her hand, she is holding a slightly large basket.</p>


<p>「Ehehe, it’s our first date, so I was at a loss at how I should dress up… I don’t feel very confident.」</p>



<p>「No, not at all! I think it’s very cute!」</p>



<p>Kamome says what he frankly feels.</p>



<p>「On the contrary, I’m starting to feel uneasy about my outfit!」</p>



<p>Involuntarily, he cried out such unnecessary things.</p>



<p>Himawari, on the other hand, seems embarrassed at being told straight out that she is cute.</p>



<p>「T-Thank you… Kamome-kun doesn’t look weird at all. You look cool.」</p>



<p>Himawari complimented him, but now that he’s by her side, he still feels like he’s not as good as her.</p>



<p>(…Wait, what’s the use of worrying about such things?)</p>



<p>It’s pointless to be depressed.</p>



<p>Today it’s their date, after all.</p>



<p>He should just enjoy his time with Himawari without worrying about it.</p>



<p>「Ah, the platform is over there, right?」</p>



<p>「Yes, let’s go.」</p>



<p>With a change of heart, Kamome heads together with Himawari to the platform where the train they plan to board is coming.</p>



<p>But really, Himawari looks very cute today.</p>



<p>Until now, he had only seen her in her school uniform, so it’s a fresh feeling.</p>


<p>Feeling elated, Kamome walks on happily.</p>



<p>「Ah, I’m going to get something to drink before we go… Huh, Himawari?」</p>



<p>There, Kamome notices that Himawari, who was supposed to be standing next to him, is gone.</p>



<p>When he turns around, he sees that she is walking behind him, well behind Kamome.</p>



<p>「Himawari?」</p>



<p>「I-I’m sorry, I’m too slow.」</p>



<p>Himawari quickly catches up to Kamome who has stopped.</p>



<p>「…Ah.」</p>



<p>There, Kamome realizes what’s going on.</p>



<p>Looking down at her feet, he sees that Himawari is wearing heels today.</p>



<p>He was careless.</p>



<p>He didn’t think much of it because she always wore loafers with her school uniform, but with heels she can’t walk fast.</p>



<p>In the first place, he may have always walked without considering Himawari’s pace.</p>



<p>Maybe she was trying her best to walk fast to keep up with him.</p>



<p>「Sorry, Himawari, I wasn’t very considerate…」</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing Kamome feeling down when he said that, Himawari hurriedly waved her hand and said, “Don’t worry about it”.</p>



<p>「It’s totally fine, walking at whatever speed Kamome-kun wants. Rather, I feel more at ease that way…」</p>


<p>「No, I don’t want Himawari to overdo it..」</p>



<p>Kamome says to Himawari with a serious face.</p>



<p>「I want to keep pace with Himawari.」</p>



<p>At these words, Himawari’s expression turns into one of surprise.</p>



<p>「Well, um… T-Then… Want to hold hands?」</p>



<p>After a fidgety glance, Himawari suggested timidly.</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Kamome stopped moving at the sudden remark, but then he realized that if they hold hands, he would be able to match Himawari’s speed.</p>



<p>「Good idea. Well then, let’s go with that.」</p>



<p>Kamome quickly holds out his hand.</p>



<p>「Y-Yes…」</p>



<p>Hearing that magnificent invitation, Himawari was also nervous as she entrusted her left hand.</p>



<p>The two walk hand in hand.</p>



<p>But… When it comes time to do it, Kamome realizes that it’s a very embarrassing thing.</p>



<p>This place was still inside the station, and various people passing each other at close range were gazing sideways at the two of them.</p>



<p>(It’s very, heart-pounding.)</p>



<p>He can feel his heart beating all the time.</p>


<p>Himawari’s hand is hot and moist with sweat, probably due to her nervousness and shyness.</p>



<p>But so is Kamome.</p>



<p>Both of their body temperature raised, and each could feel their sweat mixing between their clasped hands──</p>



<p>「Ah, I-I’m sorry, Kamome-kun!」</p>



<p>Himawari withdrew her hand there, as if she finally couldn’t take it anymore.</p>



<p>「Himawari?」</p>



<p>「S-Sorry, I sweat easily… My hand got sweaty, right…?」</p>



<p>「No, if you say that, I’m the one…」</p>



<p>Perhaps because they were both nervous, the conversation became somewhat distraught.</p>



<p>「L-Let’s go the normal way for now.」</p>



<p>「Yeah…」</p>



<p>So, the two of them let go of their hands and headed normally toward the platform.</p>



<p>Since some of the mood from earlier remained, they still feel somewhat embarrassed.</p>



<p>「Ah, by the way…」</p>



<p>There, Kamome looks at the luggage Himawari is carrying.</p>



<p>A rather large basket.</p>



<p>I wonder if it’s an appropriate size bag for a girl to carry on a date or outing like this… Kamome, with his limited experience, doesn’t know, but even from a man’s point of view, it seems a little big.</p>



<p>「I’ll carry your luggage.」</p>



<p>With that, Kamome took Himawari’s basket.</p>



<p>「T-Thank you.」</p>



<p>Himawari seemed to be honestly pleased with Kamome’s thoughtfulness.</p>



<p>The basket he received was unexpectedly heavy.</p>



<p>「It’s quite a big baggage, isn’t it?」</p>



<p>To Kamome who said so frankly, Himawari mutters with a smile.</p>



<p>「Yeah… Look forward to it.」</p>



<p>「?」</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And so, they arrived at the destination of their date.</p>



<p>By the way, they chose an amusement park as their date course.</p>



<p>This is a classic first date spot, and it is probably the most popular choice.</p>



<p>After entering the park, the two of them immediately looked around the attractions.</p>



<p>「Wow, there are so many attractions.」</p>



<p>Himawari looks around at the wide variety of attractions and exclaims in admiration.</p>



<p>(…Okay.)</p>



<p>While looking at such Himawari next to him, Kamome is enthusiastic in his heart.</p>



<p>Today is his first date with Himawari.</p>



<p>Therefore, Kamome has come up with some kind of plan in his own way.</p>



<p>I want to make our first date as memorable as possible.</p>



<p>That’s what he thought.</p>



<p>When he thought about Himawari’s hobbies and interests, he remembered that unexpectedly she likes action games such as racing, shooting, and fighting games.</p>



<p>She also seems to like games with high age ratings and rather grotesque descriptions.</p>



<p>She has a quiet personality, but she probably likes flashy entertainment.</p>



<p>「Himawari, let’s ride that.」</p>



<p>Kamome pointed at the thrilling attraction that boasts the largest scale in this amusement parl, the roller coaster.</p>



<p>「The roller coaster here is so intense that it’s famous even on the internet for being one of the most terrifying in the top thrill type attractions of amusement parks around the world.」</p>



<p>I’m sure Himawari would love it too; he speaks of such researched knowledge with that thought.</p>



<p>But──</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Himawari’s face stiffened as she watched the gondolas rushing overhead at high speed, scattering screams from the passengers.</p>



<p>「Himawari?」</p>



<p>「Ah, yes! It looks interesting! I’m really looking forward to it!」</p>



<p>However, when she immediately puts her expression back on, she turns to face Kamome with a smile.</p>



<p>(…Okay, Himawari seems to be looking forward to it too.)</p>



<p>The two of them head for the boarding gate of the roller coaster.</p>



<p>After a few minutes of waiting in line, it was finally their turn to board.</p>



<p>Kamome and Himawari board the gondola next to each other.</p>



<p>「I’m so excited.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>The safety bar is lowered and secured.</p>



<p>And finally, the start alarm rings──</p>



<p>It was at that time.</p>



<p>「Himawari?」</p>



<p>「Ah, ah…」</p>



<p>Kamome notices that Himawari is acting strangely.</p>



<p>Her face is pale, and she is trembling.</p>



<p>「I-I can’t after all…」</p>



<p>「Excuse me! Please wait!」</p>



<p>Kamome hurriedly raises his voice.</p>



<p>He asked the staff to stop the start and then they descended in a hurry.</p>



<p>After telling the worried staff “We’re alright”, Kamome and Himawari went out of the attraction.</p>



<p>They sit down on a comfortable bench, and he checks on Himawari state.</p>



<p>「I-I’m sorry, Kamome-kun…」</p>



<p>Himawari, who has calmed down, uttered words one by one.</p>



<p>「I’m not good at roller coasters like this…」</p>



<p>「Ah, I didn’t know that…」</p>



<p>When Himawari was still a child, she once rode a roller coaster at an amusement park and felt sick and was unable to move for the rest of the day.</p>



<p>After that, she didn’t come to the amusement park for a while.</p>



<p>It had been a long time, but she had grown up so she tried to ride it thinking that she would be fine, but… Perhaps because of her trauma, it seems she felt sick just by getting on.</p>



<p>「I see…」</p>



<p>「Sorry… But I’m fine now.」</p>



<p>Said Himawari, still looking a little unwell.</p>



<p>「Then, let’s ride something a little more relaxed, shall we?」</p>



<p>Seeing Himawari like that, Kamome changes the plan.</p>



<p>Today, he was planning to have a lot of fun with Himawari going around the flashy attractions, but it seemed better to go on a quieter one.</p>



<p>For starters, they headed to the nearby coffee cup.</p>


<p>Compared to other attractions, there were fewer visitors, so they were able to get on right away.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>However, Himawari’s expression didn’t clear up even during the coffee cup ride.</p>



<p>Rather, Kamome thought that it would be bad to spin the cup too much, so he controlled the cup so that it wouldn’t spin as much as possible.</p>



<p>「Himawari, let’s rest a little longer after all.」</p>



<p>Kamome makes Himawari sit down on a bench nearby, and then buy a drink from a vending machine.</p>



<p>「…Sorry, Himawari.」</p>



<p>Kamome muttered feeling sorry, looking at Himawari’s drooping head.</p>



<p>「Because I invited Himawari to a roller coaster ride without properly checking your condition…」</p>



<p>「N-No, I should have told you instead of holding back… Even though I predicted this would happen when we promised to come to the amusement park in the first place.」</p>



<p>Himawari hurriedly apologizes to Kamome.</p>



<p>「…I just got carried away thinking, “It’s my first date with Kamome”, “I’m sure it’s going to be fun”…」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>She is filled with apologetic feelings, Kamome thought.</p>



<p>She’s been apologizing since a while ago.</p>



<p>After all this, he’s ashamed of himself.</p>



<p>“I want to make our first date as memorable as possible”, what the hell have I been trying to act cool.</p>



<p>Earlier, I mentioned the walking speed at the station, and I thought I understood Himawari.</p>



<p>I don’t know anything about Himawari.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry, Kamome-kun. I’m really fine this time.」</p>



<p>Saying that, Himawari stands up and shows.</p>



<p>However, as of now, he doesn’t think she’s fully recovered.</p>



<p>「…That’s right.」</p>



<p>There, Kamome remembers.</p>



<p>He pulls out an amusement park pamphlet that he had looked at the day before, and points to a facility in it.</p>



<p>「Himawari, let’s go here.」</p>



<p>「Game section?」</p>



<p>There is a game center in the corner of the amusement park.</p>



<p>「I’m sure we can have fun here without any problems.」</p>



<p>「Yeah… I’m sorry, even though it’s an amusement park.」</p>



<p>「It’s okay, I just want Himawari to have fun. Let’s go.」</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, Kamome together with Himawari, who loves games, headed to the game center.</p>



<p>There, they played shooting games, which is her specialty, and caught the prizes they wanted in the crane catcher.</p>



<p>Himawari seems to have recovered completely and is playing happily.</p>



<p>At any rate, the result was good.</p>



<p>While enjoying the game center like that, time flew by in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>「I took first place in this shooting game month score…」</p>



<p>「Yeah, I was surprised. As expected of Himawari.」</p>



<p>The two decided to take a break on the terrace and spend a relaxing time.</p>



<p>「Kamome-kun. Shall we have lunch soon?」</p>



<p>There, Himawari suggested to Kamome, who was staring at a pamphlet to decide what to do next.</p>



<p>「I see… Okay. I’m pretty hungry, too.」</p>



<p>Looking at the clock, it’s three o’clock.</p>



<p>Since they were playing with excitement, it’s already past lunch time.</p>



<p>「Ah, umn… You know.」</p>



<p>There, Himawari opens the basket she brought.</p>


<p>「I made bento.」</p>



<p>Two large, stacked boxes were taken out of the basket.</p>



<p>When the lid is opened, a variety of colorful dishes are revealed.</p>



<p>There were egg rolls, meatballs, potato salad, sandwiches, futomaki rolls, and fruits such as apples with rabbit-shaped skins.</p>



<p>It’s quite an elaborate assortment.</p>



<p>「Eh, bento? Himawari, did you make it all by yourself?」</p>



<p>「Yes, I hope it suits your taste…」</p>



<p>Such a large amount… She must have woken up very early in the morning to make it.</p>



<p>Learning the identity of the unexpectedly large luggage and the true meaning of her line “Look forward to it”, Kamome’s heart was filled with emotion.</p>



<p>「I’ll take it gratefully.」</p>



<p>Immediately they enjoy the bento together.</p>



<p>「Yeah… It’s delicious! Himawari, you were good at cooking.」</p>



<p>「I-I wonder… I’m glad you are pleased.」</p>



<p>On the terrace, Kamome and Himawari spent a happy time together that couldn’t have been more harmonious.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After enjoying the carefully prepared lunch by Himawari, Kamome said “Excuse me for a moment” and headed for the restroom.</p>



<p>(…I guess we’re back on track for the time being.)</p>



<p>Thinking so, Kamome made an expression of relief.</p>



<p>An hour earlier he wondered what would happen, but it seems that their first date isn’t going to be a horrible memory.</p>



<p>He had previously been told by Misaki and the others said something like “The ideal couple”, so he might have gotten a little carried away.</p>



<p>He thought he knew Himawari well enough.</p>



<p>And that he could make the best choice for her.</p>



<p>(…I must change my mind.)</p>



<p>Kamome reflects on this.</p>



<p>But even so… They are having a good time now.</p>



<p>Himawari’s expression, attitude, and words… They must be sharing the same feelings.</p>



<p>Just thinking about that fills his heart, and a smile naturally appears on his face.</p>



<p>(…A little more until closing time… We don’t have much time left, but let’s have Himawari enjoy it until the end.)</p>



<p>While thinking so, Kamome leaves the private restroom.</p>



<p>When he opens the door.</p>



<p>Tsuyu was standing there.</p>



<p>「……Eh?」</p>



<p>For a moment, his thoughts stopped.</p>



<p>It’s Tsuyu.</p>


<p>Long blond hair with earrings shining in her ears.</p>



<p>On top is a short white shirt, tied in a knot at the front, boldly exposing both her chest and belly button area.</p>



<p>Below is a pair of damaged denim shorts.</p>



<p>With a provocative smile on her face, she stood in front of Kamome as he came out of the restroom.</p>



<p>「T-Tsuyu?」</p>



<p>「Long time no see, Kamome.」</p>



<p>In a casual tone, she greets him.</p>



<p>「Why is Tsuyu here…?」</p>



<p>Kamome is dismayed by the unexpected appearance of this person.</p>



<p>But it’s understandable that he’s in that state.</p>



<p>Whether or not she knew Kamome’s state of mind, Tsuyu continued facing him without changing her expression.</p>



<p>「… Ah.」</p>



<p>There, Kamome came up with an idea.</p>



<p>「Could it be that Tsuyu is also on a date? Or did you come with a friend? It’s a coincidence, right?」</p>



<p>「It’s not a coincidence.」</p>



<p>Immediately denying Kamome’s speculation, Tsuyu continues.</p>



<p>Still looking up at him, smiling.</p>



<p>「I followed you.」</p>



<p>「Ha?」</p>



<p>「Well… I got interested in you… Kamome.」</p>



<p>For a moment, Tsuyu takes Kamome’s hand.</p>



<p>Then, before he could resist, he was pulled to the back of the restroom.</p>



<p>「W-Wait a minute!」</p>



<p>As if to push Kamome against the wall, Tsuyu pulls her body close to him.</p>



<p>As if to seduce him.</p>



<p>「T-Tsuyu, what are you…?」</p>



<p>Kamome tried to ask firmly, but when he looked into her eyes at close range, he involuntarily averted his gaze.</p>



<p>The corners of his words also fade away.</p>



<p>It was because he remembered what happened between the two the day they met again at her house after a long time.</p>



<p>「For some reason, I can’t forget you these days… Before I knew it, I found myself thinking about you all the time… Ahaha, well, in other words, that’s what I mean.」</p>



<p>Laughing to hide her embarrassment, Tsuyu caresses Kamome’s chest with her fingertips.</p>



<p>Her face is close.</p>



<p>Her breath easily brushes against him, and her sweet smell of ripe fruit pervades his nostrils.</p>



<p>「Aren’t you excited? This kind of thing. Behind Himawari’s back, secretly.」</p>


<p>「W-What are you──」</p>



<p>No more words were spoken.</p>



<p>A soft and hot feeling approaches and adheres.</p>



<p>Tsuyu leaned over and kissed Kamome on the cheek.</p>



<p>The background music in the park and the cheers of the passengers on the attractions seemed a world away.</p>



<p>A kiss different from the one given in her room, a soft and gentle kiss that numbs the whole body.</p>



<p>As if his brain were submerged in lukewarm water, his thought process paralyzed, and her ability to make decisions dulled.</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu.」</p>



<p>There, Kamome manages to summon his reason.</p>



<p>He puts his hand on her shoulder and puts all his strength into it.</p>



<p>「Please stop.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>At Kamome’s reaction, Tsuyu fell silent for a moment, as if thinking about something──</p>



<p>“Kashyah”.</p>



<p>He heard such a sound in his dulled sense of hearing.</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Looking at the situation, Tsuyu has taken a picture of herself and Kamome with the camera of her smartphone in her hand.</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>「Ahh, I did it.」</p>



<p>She moves apart her body.</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s gaze is still passionate.</p>



<p>However, the amount of heat has changed into something filled with dangerous emotions.</p>



<p>「Wouldn’t it be a problem if Himawari saw this?」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>He doesn’t understand what she is saying.</p>



<p>While Kamome remains unable to think, Tsuyu continues.</p>



<p>「What would you do if that girl found out that you were secretly having an affair with me, and that you were sneaking around doing this kind of mischievous things behind her back during your date?」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>At first, he didn’t understand what she was doing or saying, but finally he understood.</p>



<p>He is being threatened.</p>



<p>Using the photo taken on Tsuyu’s phone as material.</p>



<p>「Why, something like his…」</p>



<p>「…Because I hate you.」</p>



<p>To Kamome who is stunned, Tsuyu says something mixed with disturbance.</p>



<p>It’s as if she is hiding her true feelings, as if she herself doesn’t understand the meaning of her own actions.</p>



<p>「If you don’t want me to give you away, you must absolutely obey me from now on. Be at my mercy.」</p>



<p>「…Why, to take it that far.」</p>



<p>「…I don’t like being told selfish things or being interfered with from strange angles, so I just want you to make an effort to prevent that from happening.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu lifts his lips with a grin.</p>



<p>「Besides, I don’t think it’s all that bad for you. For some reason I’m interested in you as a man. And we might be able to make good memories now and then as well.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>「Well then, that’s how it is. Understood? What’s your reply?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu pressed him, flashing the photo displayed on the screen.</p>



<p>To such Tsuyu’s face, Kamome…</p>



<p>「…Eh?」</p>



<p>He was staring at her with a purely sad face.</p>



<p>Seeing such a face, Tsuyu couldn’t help but get upset.</p>



<p>「What is, with that face…」</p>



<p>At that moment, Kamome grabbed Tsuyu’s arm.</p>



<p>「Ha!? Wai…」</p>



<p>Then, he pulls her by force and walks out from the back of the restroom.</p>



<p>「W-Wait, what are you…!」</p>



<p>While Tsuyu is puzzled by this sudden action, Kamome doesn’t stop.</p>



<p>Without saying anything, walking fast, just keeping moving forward.</p>



<p>And then, where they arrived was──</p>



<p>「Ah, Kamome-kun──」</p>



<p>To where Himawari was.</p>



<p>Kamome came in front of Himawari with Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Himawari, who was sitting on a chair on the terrace waiting for Kamome’s return, noticed footsteps approaching from behind and turned around with a smile.</p>



<p>Then, she noticed that Kamome was with Tsuyu, and her expression hardened.</p>



<p>「…Eh, T-Tsuyu-san? Why…」</p>



<p>「Sorry, Himawari!」</p>



<p>Naturally, Himawari was surprised.</p>



<p>Why is Tsuyu here, and why is he with Kamome?</p>



<p>To the panicked her, Kamome first and foremost shouted and bowed her head.</p>



<p>「I… I was kissed by Tsuyu!」</p>



<p>「Eh… Eh?」</p>



<p>Himawari’s state of confusion continues to grow as a result of this sudden statement.</p>



<p>「I was pressed by Tsuyu, and unable to resist properly, I was left to her mercy! I’m sorry!」</p>



<p>To such a Himawari, Kamome confesses with a look of sincere apology from his heart, and then gives her a serious look.</p>



<p>「Himawari…」</p>



<p>There, Kamome looked straight into Himawari’s face.</p>



<p>She had a shocked look on her face.</p>



<p>It was an expression as if her elated heart had been suddenly slammed to the ground during their first date at the amusement park.</p>



<p>Her heart becomes painful.</p>



<p>Yes, it was natural to feel that way.</p>



<p>Whether it was unintentional, or whether he was set up, as a preliminary step, he didn’t try to avoid Tsuyu’s lips.</p>



<p>Inside his heart, he wasn’t trying to reject her.</p>



<p>He confessed the truth, that he did something that would make Himawari feel that way.</p>



<p>Kamome clenched his teeth so hard that they seemed to bleed and regained his serious expression.</p>



<p>「…But Himawari is more important to me!!」</p>



<p>As if to convert his feelings from the bottom of his heart.</p>



<p>Kamome shouts.</p>



<p>At these words, Himawari suddenly regains consciousness.</p>


<p>「Himawari is the most important person to me! I’m not lying! I want you to believe me!」</p>



<p>A declaration from too much impetus reporting and reflection.</p>



<p>However, Himawari’s face gradually blushes as he directs his direct gaze and unpretentious bare words.</p>



<p>「Ye… Yes.」</p>



<p>「Are you an idiot!」</p>



<p>In the face of this series of exchanges, unable to stand it anymore, Tsuyu shouted.</p>



<p>「What are you confessing so stupidly honestly?」</p>



<p>「I don’t want to be called an idiot by someone who goes out of her way to follow someone around in the middle of their date to threaten them!」</p>



<p>At that moment, Kamome turned around and howled.</p>



<p>「How crazy of you to buy a ticket and spend your precious time for something like this!」</p>



<p>「Wha…!」</p>



<p>Tsuyu turns bright red.</p>



<p>On top of all of her own plans being exposed, she is even hit with a righteous argument, so probably she couldn’t find the words to say back.</p>



<p>「S-Shut up!」</p>



<p>Leaving behind a parting line, Tsuyu ran away from the scene.</p>



<p>「Eeto…」</p>



<p>After that, Himawari, who didn’t seem to understand what had happened, and Kamome, who saw off Tsuyu’s shrinking back with an angry face, were the only ones left behind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>「What the hell is wrong with that guy!」</p>



<p>Tsuyu yells in an annoyed tone as she runs through the park.</p>



<p>It didn’t go well; it didn’t go the way she wanted it to.</p>



<p>She was humiliated tremendously.</p>



<p>──All because of Ooshima Kamome, a childhood friend who had suddenly returned to her world after several years.</p>



<p>His words and actions shake her heart.</p>



<p>Even though she should just ignore him, his presence is getting bigger and bigger.</p>



<p>She’s irrationally angry with such him.</p>



<p>…But at the same time, she feels that her feelings are more than just irritation, and she doesn’t understand why.</p>



<p>Thinking about Kamome makes her heart pound.</p>



<p>It’s been a long time since she has had this kind of feeling.</p>



<p>「Ah.」</p>



<p>Suddenly, Tsuyu felt a pain like an electric current in her leg and fell down on the spot.</p>



<p>She slams her body into the ground with momentum, scraping her knee and elbow.</p>



<p>「Tsuu…」</p>


<p>She slowly raised her body and turned her gaze to her own ankle.</p>



<p>A bandaged ankle.</p>



<p>「…Really, I’m the worst.」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu came to her senses.</p>



<p>What she did today.</p>



<p>What an insane and incomprehensible thing she had done.</p>



<p>Frustrated, embarrassed ── I deserved it all.</p>



<p>She did a terrible thing.</p>



<p>To Kamome and to Himawari.</p>



<p>She’s aware of it and wants to die.</p>



<p>「Really… What I’m doing…」</p>



<p>Tsuyu hung her head down in the middle of the road while the people who came and went looked at her suspiciously.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>──On the other hand.</p>



<p>「Is Tsuyu-san interested in Kamome-kun?」</p>



<p>After Tsuyuu left, Kamome and Himawari left the terrace and went for a walk.</p>



<p>Tsuyu suddenly appeared and tried to mess with Kamome, but she failed and left.</p>


<p>It seems that Himawari is still concerned about her.</p>



<p>「Maybe.」</p>



<p>Kamome replied to Himawari with a serious expression.</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Himawari flinched at Kamome’s clear assertion.</p>



<p>「Maybe she doesn’t like me. I said some terrible things to her before.」</p>



<p>「Ah, that kind of thing…」</p>



<p>「But it’s annoying. If she doesn’t like me, why don’t she just tell me directly when I’m alone? She went out of her way to come here when I was with Himawari… I feel bad for Himawari.」</p>



<p>Kamome is angry, “punpun”, you could hear him making onomatopoeic noises.</p>



<p>Seeing his face, Himawari lets out a little smile.</p>



<p>「Himawari?」</p>



<p>「Oh, I’m sorry. Earlier, I was surprised by the suddenness and didn’t know the details of the situation… But I was really happy when Kamome told me honestly about what happened between you and Tsuyu-san, and when you said that I was important to you.」</p>



<p>「…It’s a matter of course.」</p>



<p>Kamome and Himawari walk in silence for a while.</p>



<p>Evening, the sun begins to set, and the street lights in the park begin to turn on.</p>



<p>「Nee, Kamome…」</p>



<p>Eventually, Himawari began to speak slowly.</p>

<p>「Do you remember when we first met?」</p>



<p>「Eh? Yeah.」</p>



<p>Kamome and Himawari met at the beginning of the first semester.</p>



<p>It all started when Kamome helped her out after she was snatched by a purse snatcher.</p>



<p>Kamome, who happened to be there when her bag was stolen, immediately chased after the snatcher.</p>



<p>Being a fast runner, Kamome, who used to be a track and field athlete, quickly caught up with the snatcher and held him down until the police arrived.</p>



<p>「You were cool. Really, like a hero of justice.」</p>



<p>Kamome is embarrassed by being told so honestly.</p>



<p>「After that, Kamome and I became good friends, and we started talking and playing together a lot… Kind of everyday became more fun than I ever thought possible.」</p>



<p>「Until now….」</p>



<p>When Kamome turned his head to look at Himawari, she looked down sadly.</p>



<p>「…Back then, I didn’t enjoy my days very much. I may have told you this before, but… My parents remarried.」</p>



<p>「Yeah.」</p>



<p>Himawari is probably trying to tell him something very important right now.</p>



<p>Even the insensitive Kamome can understand that much.</p>



<p>So, with a serious expression on his face, Kamome nodded to Himawari.</p>



<p>「When I was in junior high school, my mother and father suddenly divorced one day… I won’t talk about the details because it’s not a pleasant thing to talk about, but… Because my mother was mostly to blame, I had to follow my father who won custody… I was so shocked by this that there were days when I couldn’t even pass food down my throat…」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Himawari doesn’t go into detail, but the fact that the custody was given to the father ── perhaps the mother had an affair?</p>



<p>Then Himawari laughed.</p>



<p>It was a wry… a self-deprecating smile.</p>



<p>「I consider myself an ordinary and boring person. I don’t know what’s trendy or interesting for my age group. I’m an introvert, and I only have hobbies that I can enjoy by myself… But I thought I could live a normal life without any inconvenience. There are no guarantees, but I thought I would be fine… But the reality didn’t forgive me.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Himawari, who had her heart emotionally wounded, realized that her life was neither ordinary nor peaceful.</p>



<p>I must become a person with a strong heart who can overcome the harsh reality.</p>



<p>He knows that, but Himawari has had a rough time.</p>



<p>What should I do from now on, how should I live?</p>



<p>It would be better if someone could pull me with such strength that I don’t have to think about anything…</p>



<p>「While I was spending my days like this, with no way out and no solution, I met Kamome-kun.」</p>



<p>It doesn’t mean that he pulls her with a strong force, but when she’s with Kamome, she feels very comfortable.</p>



<p>He’s serious and dependable, but there is also a clumsy and somewhat lacking side to him. As she spent her days with Kamome, who has such a personality, she became strongly attracted to him.</p>



<p>And at some point, she became very conscious that she liked Kamome.</p>



<p>「Having someone you like is a wonderful thing. I had been suffocating in a dark sea for a long time, but Kamome pulled me out of that painful place and let me breathe with all my might…. That’s how I feel.」</p>



<p>Inevitably, Kamome stares at Himawari’s face.</p>


<p>Her cheeks are blushing with embarrassment and her eyes are moist with tears.</p>



<p>「I fell in love with such Kamome-kun, and Kamome-kun told me that he loves me and that I’m important to him… I’m so happy.」</p>



<p>「…Himawari.」</p>



<p>Evening.</p>



<p>The time when the sun is setting.</p>



<p>The illuminations and the light of the street lamps are beginning to illuminate the amusement park.</p>



<p>Kamome unconsciously took Himawari’s hand.</p>



<p>「Ah…」</p>



<p>「Ah, sorry…」</p>



<p>Himawari is surprised by the sudden action, and so is Kamome.</p>



<p>Himawari and Kamome connect their hands.</p>



<p>On their way to the amusement park, they instinctively let go of each other’s hand.</p>



<p>Because of embarrassment and a variety of idle thoughts.</p>



<p>But now──</p>



<p>「I want to walk a little, hand in hand with Himawari.」</p>



<p>Like that, Kamome told Himawari how he honestly feels right now.</p>



<p>「…Yes.」</p>


<p>Himawari nodded modestly and responded to Kamome’s request.</p>



<p>The two walk hand in hand through the park.</p>



<p>Just walking with the cheers of the attractions as background music.</p>



<p>Even though it’s just that, it feels like a special moment.</p>



<p>「Um, you know… Sorry.」</p>



<p>There, Himawari mutters.</p>



<p>Her face and neck turned bright red, her eyes slightly moistened, and she was looking down.</p>



<p>「After all, I’m sweating because I’m nervous, so….」</p>



<p>Her intertwined hand was hot, and her palm was moist and humid.</p>



<p>Himawari is concerned about that.</p>



<p>It’s not about herself, but about what Kamome thinks of her.</p>



<p>「…I’m sorry, too. For suddenly saying I want to hold your hand.」</p>



<p>「…Eh?」</p>



<p>But it was the same for Kamome.</p>



<p>Is it too much force? Am I hurting her hand?</p>



<p>I’m sweating too.</p>



<p>Isn’t it uncomfortable?</p>



<p>The two of them were concerned about each other, and various thoughts were going through their minds.</p>



<p>In their heated minds, they asked and answered themselves persistently.</p>



<p>──But still.</p>



<p>Neither Kamome nor Himawari let go of each other’s hands as they walked together through the amusement park until the closing time was announced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Afterwards ── after finishing today’s date and leaving the amusement park, Kamome decided to take Himawari home.</p>



<p>「Thanks for today, I really enjoyed it.」</p>



<p>「Yeah, me too.」</p>



<p>Kamome looks up at Himawari’s house.</p>



<p>No lights are on.</p>



<p>Nobody seems to be back yet except Himawari… not even Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「There was a lot that happened along the way, but I guess it’s good to say that it all worked out.」</p>



<p>「I guess so. In the end, maybe we should thank Tsuyu-san.」</p>



<p>“Ahaha”, Himawari laughs as she says that.</p>



<p>After all that has happened, Himawari is amazing to be able to say that, Kamome honestly thought.</p>



<p>「If you have any worries about Tsuyu, I want you to talk to me.」</p>



<p>Her older sister, who lives under the same roof, acted like that.</p>



<p>It might make their relationship even more strained from now on.</p>



<p>Thinking so, Kamome made a suggestion to Himawari.</p>



<p>「…Yeah」</p>



<p>To this, Himawari replies in a slightly implied tone.</p>



<p>「I’ll send you a message when I get home.」</p>



<p>「Yeah, I still want to talk a lot about today…」</p>



<p>Laughing at each other, Kamome waves her hand to leaves Himawari’s house──</p>



<p>「…Kamome-kun.」</p>



<p>But then, that’s when it happened.</p>



<p>Himawari stopped Kamome.</p>



<p>「There is one thing I would like to ask about Tsuyu-san.」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>「…The other day, when Kamome-kun met Tsuyu-san again at my house.」</p>



<p>The light at the entrance became backlit.</p>



<p>Himawari, who has an overall atmosphere of being in the shadows, stares at Kamome.</p>



<p>「Did really… nothing happened?」</p>




<p>「……」</p>



<p>For a moment, he thought his heart would stop beating.</p>



<p>The question posed by Himawari.</p>



<p>What does this… mean?</p>



<p>On that day too, Kamome was kissed by Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Is Himawari aware of that?</p>



<p>Does she suspect why he doesn’t tell her honestly?</p>



<p>(…Why now, at this timing?)</p>



<p>…No.</p>



<p>Himawari’s expression right now is one of great anxiety.</p>



<p>There was no such meaning behind it, now, she probably just wanted to clear the doubts that had been inside of her.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>For a moment, Kamome thinks.</p>



<p>What should he do?</p>



<p>There, Kamome’s mind recalled the shocked look on her face when she told that he was kissed by Tsuyu today.</p>



<p>It was a look of despair, so painful to watch.</p>



<p>Repeatedly telling the truth may be too much of a shock.</p>




<p>Especially when she’s in such a mood.</p>



<p>Today, they were able to spend a cheerful and joyful time, fulfilling each other’s hearts.</p>



<p>Himawari told Kamome how special he is to her.</p>



<p>「…Really, nothing happened.」</p>



<p>Someday I will confess.</p>



<p>So now, please let me lie.</p>



<p>「I can understand Himawari being anxious. But nothing happened that day. It’s true.」</p>



<p>Again, a cramping pain runs through the back of his neck.</p>



<p>Maybe it’s guilt, maybe it’s disgust.</p>



<p>Kamome told Himawari, clutching the back of her neck.</p>



<p>「…I see. I’m sorry, for asking strange things over and over again as if I doubted Kamome-kun.」</p>



<p>Saying so, Himawari apologized, returned to a refreshed expression, and once again said goodbye to Kamome.</p>



<p>Kamome leaves the Shishido house.</p>



<p>Himawari held up the stuffed shark he got for her at the amusement park’s arcade until Kamome was out of sight.</p>



<p>(…How cute, Himawari.)</p>



<p>On his way home, Kamome reflected on the day.</p>



<p>Himawari confided in him what was on her mind.</p>



<p>Her strong feelings for him were clearly conveyed, and at the same time, her presence in Kamome’s heart grew.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>…On the other hand, he can’t help but think of Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Her odd behavior today.</p>



<p>The way she acted like she was trying to push him into a corner.</p>



<p>Is she the kind of person who would normally do such a thing?</p>



<p>Such a vulgar thing.</p>



<p>When he thinks about it, he gets really angry.</p>



<p>A simple sense of justice.</p>



<p>In addition, perhaps there is the desire that he didn’t want Tsuyu to do that.</p>



<p>…But.</p>



<p>Today, by hearing Himawari’s inner thoughts and family situation, he has come to think.</p>



<p>「Just like Himawari… I wonder if Tsuyu is also having worries and anxieties…」</p>



<p>I wonder if she might also have her own circumstances, he began to take that into consideration.</p>
