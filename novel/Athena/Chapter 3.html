<h2>Chapter 3: The Main Request Should Be Brought Last</h2>

<h3>■ Takane Saki ■</h3>

<p>June 1.</p>
<p>It is getting much hotter and humid in Kamimura.</p>
<p>I am very happy about the change of clothes around this time.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, I haven&#8217;t heard any bad rumors about Saki Saki recently, have I?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>During a slightly longer break between second and third periods, Yuka-chan suddenly said in an empty classroom.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The proof is that people are talking to you in the classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed…&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Is it because people stopped spreading rumors about me?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any friends that I can talk to on a friendly basis, but even so, recently all of my classmates have started to talk to me in a normal way.</p>
<p>I would say that they are no longer blatantly distancing themselves from me as before&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>Why is that? I tried for a minute to figure out why, and then I said to myself.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been 75 days, hmmm.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I decided not to think too much about it.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Saki Saki, you&#8217;re in a good mood, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? I don&#8217;t think so. Hmmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In any case, you only think about eating lunch with the public moron during lunch break, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ppppppppplease don&#8217;t call Mashima-kun funny nicknamesssssssssss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, your smile is the weirdest ever.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>That would be the biggest smile ever.</p>
<p>…Almost a month has passed since I had lunch with Mashima-kun for the first time, and our secret lunch meetings have continued.</p>
<p>We eat lunch together on the stairs in front of the rooftop for 20 minutes during lunch break.</p>
<p>It is still awkward, but we have conversations, and it is tremendous progress compared to before when it was difficult to even talk to each other.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not an exaggeration to say that we are already in a relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an exaggeration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, please, please communicate with me.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, Yuka, but to tell you the truth, I&#8217;m in a bad mood right now.</p>
<p>Every day at the end of lunch break, I am already thinking about tomorrow&#8217;s lunch break!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Saki Saki, but it seems you haven&#8217;t read Imamote lately, haven&#8217;t you forgotten something important?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm&#8230;What is it, hmmm&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you and Mashima haven&#8217;t exchanged MINE contacts yet.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>My smile hardened.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had completely forgotten about &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>The fact that Mashima witnessed the Imamote, I had completely lost sight of the original purpose of the event.</p>
<p>But soon recovered my original smile.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Well, if we keep up our current good relations, we&#8217;ll be able to exchange MINE sooner or later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!! Saki Saki, now that you get to have lunch with Mashima-kun, you&#8217;ve gone soft!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if we exchanged contact information, I&#8217;ll be in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the kind of thing that gets you in trouble, then high school kids are nothing but sinners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t want our current relationship to be ruined&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s the way you really feel!!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan let out a loud sigh, almost as if she had a steam engine inside her.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re happy with the success of your first mission, but what do you ultimately want to do with Mashima-kun, Saki Saki?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d like our current relationship where we can have lunch together and chat&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to hold hands!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to go on a date!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to kiss and stuff!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aah!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka&#8217;s breathless three-stage verbal assault nearly knocked me over.</p>
<p>I certainly would like to &#8230;&#8230; kiss him!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m following the teachings of Saki Saki&#8217;s favorite Imamote, the time limit for confession is only a little over a month left! &#8230; No, maybe even shorter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saki Saki may not be the only one who likes that&#8230; freak of nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;!!!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I felt like cold water was poured on my head.</p>
<p>Yuka, you are right!</p>
<p>I have long wondered why no one has come forward to discover the charm of Mashima-kun and, come to think of it, how can I be so sure!</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t know, but perhaps she is already out there.</p>
<p>She may have already started some kind of approach, or she may be thinking of confessing her feelings to Mashima-kun tomorrow&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>If that were to happen, there is no chance that I, with zero experience in love, would be able to compete!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;W-What should I do!? They&#8217;re going to take away Mashima-kun!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Putting aside the fact that he&#8217;s not yours in the first place &#8230; calm down! Don&#8217;t panic so easily!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiyahi!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Saki Saki, all you can do is to get closer to Mashima-kun, little by little, and you know what you have to do for that, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, exchange MINE &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See, you know what I&#8217;m talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what if I ask him about MINE and he pulls away &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I&#8217;d like to ask you, is your favorite &#8220;public morals&#8221; guy the kind of guy who would withdraw just because you ask him for his contact information?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I meant.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka nodded deeply.</p>
<p>Yes&#8230; Mashima-kun is not the kind of person who would change his opinion of someone like that!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m going to ask Mashima-kun during lunch break!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll be exchanging MINE contacts!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a piece of cake!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the spirit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to use some of the techniques I&#8217;ve learned about romance from the Imamote!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Well, that&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka, who had been so vigorous, had a slightly vague expression on her face at the end of the session.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, I&#8217;m late.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes had passed since the start of lunch break.</p>
<p>Unusually, today, Mashima-kun was late and appeared on the staircase to the rooftop.</p>
<p>Well, not only the rarity, but I was also surprised to see Mashima&#8217;s muscular arms peeking out from his short sleeves in his summer uniform, and my mind went blank&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! I didn&#8217;t see anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;? I see.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun sat down next to me and spread his bento on his lap.</p>
<p>He is always so composed, but today he looked unusually tired.</p>
<p>&#8230; Well, I have to be ready for this soon.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m behind when it comes to clothing instruction, and the timing of the change of clothes brings a whole lot of instructional material, and that&#8217;s what happened last year too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who come to school in long-sleeved shirts by mistake &#8230; it&#8217;s fine, I&#8217;ll just remind them not to forget tomorrow. However, those who get carried away and lose their uniforms or shorten the hem of their skirts will have to be given proper guidance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first section of the student handbook, &#8220;Daily Principles.&#8221; Always dress neatly and cleanly, and do not be inappropriately elegant or fashionable. If you underestimate the importance of dressing properly, it will lead to a disturbance in the public order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; You really are a role model in this regard, and I wish everyone else were as well dressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Takane Saki?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a favor to ask you, Mashima-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite unexpected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; This Sunday, would you like to go shopping with me?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230; Now, those of you who are watching this are probably wondering if I&#8217;ve gone on a suicide binge, or if I&#8217;ve gotten a headache from the heat and humidity of the past few days.</p>
<p>But! This is a legitimate strategy backed up by psychology!</p>
<p>The door-in-the-face technique.</p>
<p>It is a negotiation technique also known as the compromising request method!</p>
<p>First of all, human beings have the principle of &#8220;if the other party does something for us, we have to do something in return.&#8221;</p>
<p>Door-in-the-face is a technique based on this principle.</p>
</p>
<p>❶Prepare a genuine request and a request that the other party is likely to refuse.</p>
<p>❷First, you present the request with a high refusal rate and make the other party refuse it.</p>
<p>❸Then you present your real demand as if it were a compromise</p>
<p>❹Then, the other party will feel bad about refusing repeatedly even though the other party has gone to the trouble of making a compromise.</p>
<p>❺They will give you their OK for your main request.</p>
</p>
<p>That is why!!</p>
<p>This is a negotiation technique often used by salesmen, and studies have shown that by following this procedure, the other party is more likely to agree to your request than if you just make your real request straight away!</p>
</p>
<p>And as you know, for me, my real request is to exchange MINE with Mashima-kun!</p>
<p>So, after this, Mashima-kun should be like, &#8220;Eh~ I can&#8217;t go shopping with you on a Sunday, so I have no choice but to exchange MINE with Takane-san.&#8221; &#8230;!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, June 5th, I&#8217;ll leave it open.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next week there&#8217;s the gymnastics festival, and I&#8217;ve just been asked to do some shopping by the committee members.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way, I don&#8217;t have your contact information yet. I&#8217;ll exchange it with you on the day, in case you need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, what are you planning to buy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re like a puppet with broken threads sometimes&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, for some reason or other, I&#8217;m going shopping with Mashima-kun this weekend&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re packing too much in all of a sudden&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yuka-chan said with her head in her hands in the empty classroom.</p>
<p>And to top it all off, somehow we were able to exchange MINE as well. I still can&#8217;t believe what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>I myself still don&#8217;t understand the situation&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; No! Let&#8217;s just be honest now and thank Saki Saki&#8217;s stupidity and the teachings of Imamote! Not only did you exchange MINE with him, but you even got him to go on a date with you, which is way too good for Saki Saki.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; D-date &#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A date is when a man and a woman meet alone at a certain time and date.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>As soon as I heard the word &#8220;date,&#8221; I immediately felt hot from the bottom of my stomach to the top of my head like a kettle boiling.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible! It&#8217;s too early for a date!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s already too late. You&#8217;ve got to make up your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if you told me that, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said so yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tsk&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t even get a word out.</p>
<p>I bite my lower lip and clutch the hem of my skirt in silent protest.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s completely pointless to do that to Yuka&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Breathe, breathe, breathe.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Waa…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, now that you&#8217;ve said it, it can&#8217;t be helped, Saki Saki, let&#8217;s start by getting ready for the date one by one, shall we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s my first time to go on a date with a guy, and I&#8217;m so &#8230; nervous I&#8217;m going to throw up now&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Top priority is to buy some stomach medicine &#8230; and. By the way, does Saki Saki have any casual clothes for a date?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look at me like you&#8217;re a chihuahua. Let&#8217;s go clothes shopping together this Saturday, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho&#8230; really, I&#8217;m going on a date with Mashima-kun&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going on a date, do you think that public morals freak is the type to break a promise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuka-chan, you could follow us&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; too bad, I have to eat, brush my teeth, and take a bath that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Which is, in essence, the same thing as always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, you&#8217;re going alone. If you miss this opportunity, you may never have an outing alone with Mashima-kun again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m happy or scared right now, if I&#8217;m soaring or nervous, I&#8217;m definitely feeling sick right now &#8230; anyway &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, stop crying, stop crying, you have me and Imamote with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Imamote?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That book has all the know-how on how to find love, doesn&#8217;t it? Then there&#8217;s nothing wrong with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; That&#8217;s right! I have Imamote!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Imamote is packed with all kinds of relationship know-how.</p>
<p>It also contains all kinds of dating tips and tricks!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m starting to feel like I can do this! I&#8217;ll follow Imamote&#8217;s teachings and make our date a success for sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Saki Saki, I think you&#8217;re going to fall for some shady business seminar or something in the future.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>… Anyway, the operation has begun!</p>

<h3 class="nextPage">■ Chapter: Kengo Mashima ■</h3>

<p>After school, I, Arakawa, and Iwasawa were changing the bulletin board.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way, Mashima-kun, I think you were asked by the committee to do the shopping for the festival, right? Do you want us to help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, but Takane Saki is going to accompany me on the shopping trip, so I&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we only need to buy what&#8217;s missing, we don&#8217;t need much manpower. &#8230;&#8230;Arakawa, you should stick the studs at a 45-degree angle to the wall surface. It will also make it easier to remove the studs when changing the board.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even so, the person who designed this particular poster has a wonderful artistic sense. I&#8217;d like to tell them what I think of it personally, and next time introduce me to them&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, wait, wait, wait!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go on to the next topic!!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Arakawa and Iwasawa interrupted me in some panic.</p>
<p>What happened&#8230;?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!? What!? Mashima-kun, you&#8217;re going shopping with Takane-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which one of you asked first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mind the strangeness of it all, don&#8217;t you? Saki Takane. She has some shopping thing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…&#8221; &#8220;…&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Iwasawa and Arakawa looked at each other for a moment, and then, hushing their voices, they began to whisper in each other&#8217;s ears.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;(Hey, Arakawa&#8230;, I guess those rumors are true&#8230;)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(I think so too, but strange things do happen&#8230;)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s getting interesting.)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(I agree.)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a nice thing to whisper in someone&#8217;s ear in public.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I said, and they glanced at me, exchanged some eye contact, and then turned to me with a deliberate smirk on their faces.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mashima-kun, you&#8217;ve been getting along well with Takane-san lately.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Iwasawa said with a weird smile.</p>
<p>I was about to answer honestly about my relationship with Saki Takane, but kept my mouth shut. The two of them would not say anything if I directly told them&#8230; But even with that, it&#8217;s better to keep quiet about Saki Takane&#8217;s relationship advice.</p>
<p>I was personally asked for advice on that one.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean that there are more opportunities to talk &#8230;, well, then yes.&#8221;<br />&#8220;What do you think about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worried that people will start rumors about us again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it? What else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else? &#8230;Oh, maybe I&#8217;m not as hated as I think I am.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m even asked for advice on love matters, which is an extremely personal matter. I guess she trusts me more than a little.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think about the fact that she asked you out shopping?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was this some kind of psychological test? I just wanted a girl&#8217;s opinion on the shopping trip, so I honestly think it is helpful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…&#8221; &#8220;…&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>After a short pause, Arakawa and Iwasawa began their secret conversation again.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;(It&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s shy or anything… Kengo is &#8230;)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(Does this guy really like Saki-chan &#8230;&#8230;? I&#8217;m just not convinced&#8230;)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(Well, for a guy like Kengo, things are going quite well.)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(Whatever it is, it&#8217;s funny.)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel good about this.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>And then they look at me again with smiling faces.</p>
<p>What on earth is going on?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s good! Have fun on Sunday.&#8221;<br />&#8220;I am only shopping for a school event. As a student of Kamimura High School, I will be aware of this and spend my time off in a moderate manner.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Oh, no! A holiday is a holiday! Everything should be in good spirits! Oh, come to think of it, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen Kengo in his regular clothes! Kengo wears a uniform even on his days off. So? What are you going to wear on that day!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The uniform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whaa!? Ah…!! For a da-&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold it, Tatsuki!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Suddenly, Iwasawa was on the edge but the next moment, Arakawa was blocking his mouth.</p>
<p>What have they been doing all this time?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Da-?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no! Hmmm &#8230; see! That&#8217;s right! Iwasawa said it too! As a member of the Discipline Committee, I think that you should keep a clear distinction between your school life and your daily life!&#8221;<br />&#8220;…Ha?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a TPO, you know? Kengo also never sees a businessman in a suit on his day off, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not that I know of&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Arakawa&#8217;s words are unusually on target.</p>
<p>I had never really thought about it, but now that they mention it, isn&#8217;t it a bit disorganized to be in uniform all the time?</p>
<p>In essence, isn&#8217;t it no different from wearing pajamas all day long?</p>
<p>And in the unlikely event that we are involved in some kind of incident with uniforms that are recognizable as Kamimura High School uniforms, it is our Kamimura High School that will be troubled&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, you are absolutely right. You are brilliant, Arakawa, and I am honestly impressed. I&#8217;ll wear casual clothes on Sunday.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>For some reason, the two of them seemed relieved by my comment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never gone out with someone in casual clothes since I entered high school&#8230;</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I&#8217;ve experienced a lot of firsts with Takane Saki.</p>

<h3 class="nextPage">■ Chapter: Takane Saki ■</h3>

<p>Sun Tzu said</p>
</p>
<p>&lt;Victorious warriors win first and then go to war; defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.&gt;</p>
<p>In short, the essence of warfare is &#8220;preparation,&#8221; and victory or defeat is already decided before the battle even begins.</p>
<p>&#8230;, it was written in Imamote.</p>
<p>Not only psychology, but also the teachings of Sun Tzu are quoted. &#8230;&#8230; The author, Mori-san, must be a very powerful and invincible popular person who is well versed in all kinds of studies, ancient and modern, East and West.</p>
<p>But aside from that&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too perfect&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I was dressed in a white lace blouse and a fresh, green one-piece dress that looked like early summer.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, I couldn&#8217;t hide the smile that broke out in front of the full-length mirror in my room.</p>
<p>I paid 1,500 yen for a round-trip train ticket to the heart of the city, and chose this dress at an unfamiliar clothing store!</p>
<p>On the way there, Yuka-chan almost had a stroke because of my devastating fashion sense.</p>
<p>Yuka-chan helped me when I was out of range of the store staff.</p>
<p>Yuka-chan was angry at me for trying to buy a cheese haddock even though we were on a tight budget.</p>
<p>Many hardships (mainly Yuka-chan&#8217;s) befell me, but &#8230; it was worth it!</p>
<p>─ ─ Ah~~~ Yes, isn&#8217;t it nice? It looks great on you. I&#8217;ll take you for next year&#8217;s Paris Collection. By the way, can I go home now?</p>
<p>Yuka said so, too!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufu.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I even did a complete spin in front of the mirror for nothing.</p>
<p>I even fluttered the bottom of my one-piece dress.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing!</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too perfect&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>The season, the size, the clean and neat look&#8230;</p>
<p>The skirt is just knee-length, which is great! If this is the case, I think Mashima-kun will like it too!</p>
</p>
<p>By the way, it&#8217;s just after 9:00 p.m&#8230;</p>
<p>I finished my dinner, soaked in the bathtub, and didn&#8217;t forget to apply the face mask my sister gave me after the bath!</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not all! On my desk, I had my makeup kit and hair iron ready to go as soon as I woke up.</p>
<p>And a cool eye mask on my pillow! I&#8217;m ready to fall asleep anytime!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m having too much fun &#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>At first, my stomach was constantly churning with nervousness and fear, but…</p>
<p>Thanks to careful preparation and an all-nighter last night memorizing the entire &#8220;Must-Do&#8217;s for Dating&#8221; of Imamote, my expectations somehow won out!</p>
<p>Henry Ford famously said, &#8220;The secret of success is to prepare first and foremost&#8221; &#8211; well, this was also written in Imamote, and it&#8217;s a good quote!</p>
<p>And I will make one last move!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, I now have Mashima-kun&#8217;s MINE&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I changed into my pajamas, rolled over in bed, and immediately opened up Mashima-kun&#8217;s chat.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already spent two whole days thinking about the text I&#8217;m going to send, referring to Imamote&#8217;s section on &#8220;MINE Strategy Techniques for People You Like&#8221;!</p>
</p>
<p>To Mashima-kun,</p>
<p>Excuse me for my first MINE, I&#8217;m Takane Saki (bowing down emoji).</p>
<p>Did you have a good rest today? (Emoji tilting head)</p>
<p>Tomorrow, you&#8217;ll be at Kamimura station at 9:00 a.m., correct?</p>
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s the first time for me to go out with a boy on a holiday, so I&#8217;m looking forward to it, but at the same time I&#8217;m a little nervous (laughter).</p>
<p>Do you often go out with girls? (Cute rabbit emoji)</p>
</p>
<p>After pressing the send button, I smiled winningly.</p>
<p>Perfect&#8230; it&#8217;s too perfect, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
</p>
<p>If a final exam asked you to write a MINE to a boy you like the day before a date, your answer would be too perfect and would be posted in the hallway.</p>
<p>First, you should begin with a polite dusting and greeting.</p>
<p>Next, a statement of concern for your friend, and then a casual mention of tomorrow&#8217;s appointment.</p>
<p>The girlish and cute emojis are also used, and the best part is the flowing question and finish that makes it easy for the other person to reply!!!!</p>
</p>
<p>10 points 10 points 10 points</p>
</p>
<p>High school girl representative, Saki Takane, is a new world record&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8230;might be too good at it&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I gradually became afraid of my talent and flapped my legs on the bed.</p>
<p>─ ─ Anyway! Now I&#8217;m ready to go this time!</p>
</p>
<p>I put my phone in sleep mode, connected it to the charging cable, and turned off the lights.</p>
<p>I put on my eye mask and crawl under the covers!</p>
</p>
<p>………..</p>
<p>…………..</p>
<p>My eyes are cold.</p>
<p>…………..</p>
<p>……….</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230; I shifted my eye mask and turned on my phone.</p>
<p>The message was sent at exactly 21:00, three minutes ago now, and not yet marked as read.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haha, I&#8217;m too excited, aren&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Even Mashima-kun doesn&#8217;t have his phone with him at all times, and he won&#8217;t reply so quickly.</p>
<p>Come on, come on, there&#8217;s no point in waiting.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I had to wake up early and put on makeup, which I&#8217;m not used to, referring to makeup videos on I TUBE. Let&#8217;s go to bed. &#8230;Good night&#8230;</p>
