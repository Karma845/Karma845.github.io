<h2>Chapter 4: Birthday Party</h2>


<p>——It had become the long-awaited April 23rd, Harune-chan’s birthday.</p>
<p>I had come to Himegi-san’s house with great enthusiasm for my adorable future sister-in-law, but… the sight of Himegi-san’s house blew all these feelings away.</p>

<p>“…unbelievable.”</p>

<p>Kanako and I stood there in a complete daze at the grandeur of the Himegi residence.</p>

<p>“Hey-hey! Is this even someone’s home? Isn’t this the White House?”?”</p>
<p>“…It’s hard to believe, but it seems to be a home where people live.”</p>

<p>It had been a series of surprises since morning.</p>
<p>When the Himegi family’s car came to pick us up at our house, and we finally arrived, a building that looked like a castle with a vast green garden welcomed us.</p>

<p>“Seriously, this is out of this world.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s even bigger than our school…”</p>

<p>Either way, I had never imagined such a place existed in Japan.</p>
<p>Just how many millions——no, how many billions of yen would it take to build a house like this?</p>
<p>It made me realize once again that my future bride was an incredible persona.</p>

<p>“Hey, there’s a fountain over there…”</p>

<p>Kanako pointed to the fountain with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>“And over there, there are beautiful roses and a pool.”</p>

<p>Kanako was even more surprised when she saw the rose garden.</p>

<p>“What… what should I do? I came in such casual attire!”</p>

<p>Kanako was dressed in denim shorts and a T-shirt, looking very casual.</p>
<p>Certainly, this outfit was not suitable for this kind of party.</p>
<p>It seemed like Kanako hadn’t even imagined that it would be such a large-scale birthday party.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to endure it, thinking at least it’s better than being naked.”</p>
<p>“You’re lucky.”</p>

<p>Kanako looked at my outfit and gave me an envious look.</p>
<p>I had come dressed as a magician with full-blown chuunibyou fashion: a white tuxedo with a cape, a large silk hat, and pointed boots with no practical use.</p>
<p>It’s the kind of outfit you’d expect to see in an anime or video game.</p>

<p>“Normally, I’d point and laugh, but…”</p>
<p>“That’s a shame.”</p>

<p>I debated whether to change this outfit on-site, but it might have been the right choice to come dressed as I am now.</p>

<p>“Hello to both of you.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san appeared before us, who were still in a daze.</p>

<p>“Wow~ Himegi-san, your dress is so beautiful!”</p>

<p>Kanako was so excited upon seeing Himegi-san in her dress that she was practically bouncing.</p>
<p>True, it was a very lovely and elegant long black dress.</p>
<p>If I could, I would have loved to gaze at Himegi-san in this dress forever, but alas, that wasn’t meant to be.</p>

<p>“Oh? Ouji-kun, what’s that patch on your silk hat?”</p>
<p>“Oh, this? Well, actually, I’m the son of a motorcycle shop owner…”</p>

<p>The silk hat had a patch sewn onto it that read ‘Ouji Bike.’ My father had forcibly stitched it on, saying, ‘Since I sponsored you, advertise it for me.’</p>
<p>If I had known this would happen, I w&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;hould have declined the 20,000 yen loan…</p>

<p>“We also have stickers of the same design. If you want, I can give some to Himegi-san too.”</p>

<p>Saying that, I handed Himegi-san an Ouji sticker that I had in my pocket.</p>
<p>My father had ordered me to distribute them, so I had brought a few in my pocket just in case.</p>

<p>“Ah, no thanks.”</p>

<p>She shook her head vigorously.</p>

<p>“I see. In that case, I’ll give them to Kanako.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I want them?!”</p>

<p>Kanako vehemently refused.</p>
<p>…I was slightly irritated by her response, so I decided to stick them on her back later.</p>

<p>“Ugh, I’m so sorry, Himegi-san! I can’t believe I came to such an amazing party looking so uncool!”</p>

<p>Kanako apologized to Himegi-san while on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>She probably wanted to escape back home just like this.</p>

<p>“If you’d like, would you like to borrow my dress?”</p>
<p>“Really? Is it okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m sure I still have a dress I wore when I was in elementary school somewhere.”</p>
<p>“Yay!”</p>

<p>Kanako rejoiced with open arms and hugged Himegi-san.</p>
<p>Hey, this idiot doesn’t realize she’s just been casually dissed.</p>
<p>Well, whatever. As Himegi-san said, it probably won’t fit if it’s not the dress from her elementary school days.</p>

<p>“Ouji-kun, I’m sorry, but I need to go back to the mansion right now.”</p>
<p>“In that case, take this.”</p>

<p>I handed Himegi-san a paper bag I had with me.</p>

<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to be my magic assistant, please wear that outfit.”</p>
<p>“Outfit???”</p>
<p>“Anyway, please change into it.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san, with a puzzled look, headed back to the mansion with Kanako.</p>

<p>“Now, what should I do?”</p>

<p>As I pondered this, suddenly my vision went dark.</p>

<p>“Can you guess who it is?”</p>

<p>I heard Harune-chan’s cute voice from behind me.</p>
<p>It seemed that her little hand was covering my eyes.</p>

<p>“Hello, Harune-chan.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Onī-san!”</p>

<p>As my vision returned, she greeted me cutely.</p>
<p>Harune-chan was also wearing a cute red dress.</p>

<p>“Onī-san, is Harune’s dress cute?”</p>

<p>Harune-chan asked me for my opinion on her dress.</p>

<p>“It looks really good on you. You’re the star of the show today.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you.”</p>

<p>She blushed a little and seemed pleased with my words.</p>
<p>With such a cute reaction, I felt like complimenting her repeatedly.</p>

<p>“Harune will be your guide in place of Touka nee.”</p>

<p>She said. Then I decided to indulge Harune-chan and followed her with cheerful steps.</p>

<p>“This is the party venue!”</p>
<p>“Oh? This is…”</p>

<p>It seems like the party is going to be held outdoors.</p>
<p>Maids and butlers were busy preparing for the party, bringing in food and drinks, decorating, and bustling about.</p>
<p>It was truly a party befitting an extremely wealthy person.</p>
<p>The scale was beyond imagination.</p>

<p>I thought I had some idea of what to expect, but I had never imagined it to be so extravagant.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s far beyond my expectations.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Oh, a grand piano is being brought in.”</p>
<p>“That’s the prize for bingo.”</p>

<p>On the table set up on the stage, there were numerous presents piled up, and Harune-chan and I ascended the stage.</p>
<p>On the stage, there were mascots that one might see at amusement parks, holding balloons.</p>
<p>What’s this? This subtly un-cute white frog mascot…</p>

<p>“Look, this is Hakugaeru-kun, who came here just for today!”</p>

<p>It seems that this frog mascot was hired for today’s event. The mascot embraced Harune-chan.</p>

<p>“Wow, Hakugaeru-kun, you’re so ticklish!”</p>

<p>Apparently, this white frog is named Hakugaeru-kun.</p>
<p>However, it’s quite cheeky for a mascot to hug my cute sister-in-law.</p>
<p>I was about to separate them when I heard Kanako’s loud voice from behind.</p>

<p>“Wow, it’s a mini Himegi-san!”</p>
<p>“Even though she’s small, I think she has longer limbs than Kanako——Ouch!”</p>

<p>Then Kanako gave me a low kick.</p>

<p>“H-hey! Ouji-kun, what’s with this outfit?”</p>

<p>Himegi-san protested to me while hiding behind Kanako.</p>
<p>Her face turned as red as an apple, and she fidgeted.</p>
<p>It seems she’s very embarrassed.</p>

<p>She had transformed from a princess in a dress into a sexy bunny girl.</p>
<p>Shiny white high heels, white stockings revealing her skin color, and a white leotard that accentuated her ample cleavage—frankly, it’s quite a provocative outfit.</p>
<p>Upon seeing her now, even an enlightened monk might become filled with worldly desires, wouldn’t they?</p>
<p>Well, that’s how incredibly enchanting she looks at this moment.</p>

<p>Personally, I’d love to observe her struggling with this embarrassment 24/7, but unfortunately, I have a mission to fulfill right now.</p>
<p>Yes, my task at the moment is to convince her not to take off the bunny girl costume.</p>

<p>“I handed you both black and white options… I see, you chose white.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t choose anything! I never agreed to become a bunny girl!”</p>
<p>“My fault I didn’t explain anything either, but more importantly, it suits you very well.”</p>
<p>“Do I really need to wear this…?”</p>
<p>“Of course you do. Throughout history and across cultures, magicians’ assistants have always been bunny girls. That’s why Himegi-san, you’ll be a bunny too. There are no exceptions.”</p>

<p>I stated this to her without any remorse.</p>

<p>“Who decided on such a ridiculous rule?”</p>
<p>“By the way, can I take a picture?”</p>
<p>“Enough, I’m gonna go change!”</p>

<p>Saying that, Himegi-san tried to return to the mansion.</p>
<p>I circled around in front of her and said,</p>

<p>“Harune-chan, you want your big sister to wear this outfit, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I want Touka-nee to wear this outfit!”</p>
<p>“That’s what she said. Himegi-san, just accept it!”</p>
<p>“I-I don’t have the right to say no!?”</p>
<p>“It’s today’s protagonist’s command. Please give up and enjoy the event today in that outfit.”</p>

<p>Harune-chan supported me as promised.</p>
<p>Even the great Himegi-san had to give in when the star of the day asked her to do so.</p>

<p>“I’ll remember this. I’ll dress you up as a woman this time, Ouji-kun…”</p>

<p>I heard some disturbing words, but I’ll let it slide this time.</p>

<p>“Good grief…by the way, Harune, say hello to Chikada-san.”</p>
<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>Harune-chan, with her short hair swaying, bowed to Kanako.</p>
<p>Being Himegi-san’s sister, she was a polite girl.</p>
<p>Then, Harune-chan approached me and jumped into my chest.</p>

<p>“Since I kept my promise, Onī-san, you’re Harune’s retainer today!”</p>

<p>And with an affectionate smile, Harune-chan looked up at me.</p>
<p>A retainer, huh?</p>
<p>I see, I was born into this world just to hear this word.</p>

<p>“What are you grinning at? It’s creepy.”</p>

<p>For some reason, Kanako and Himegi-san were looking at me with disdain.</p>

<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, Harune-chan, you look cute in that dress.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Onē-san looks good in her dress too!”</p>

<p>Kanako had also transformed from her casual attire into a calm blue dress.</p>
<p>Was that the dress Himegi-san wore when she was in elementary school?</p>
<p>…I won’t say anything since she seems so happy about it, but the fact that it fits perfectly is rather sad.</p>

<p>“Kanako, instead of being all cheerful, why don’t you give her the present?”</p>

<p>I nudged her side, urging her to give the birthday gift we had prepared.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is the birthday present we chose together, this idiot and me!”</p>

<p>With a flustered expression, Kanako took the present from the paper bag she had in her hand.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure if you’ll like it…”</p>

<p>With a mixture of hope and anxiety on her face, Kanako handed the wrapped gift to Harune-chan.</p>

<p>“Wow, thank you!”</p>

<p>Harune-chan is thrilled with our gift. On the other hand, Kanako had a hesitant expression.</p>
<p>It seems she lacks confidence in the chosen gift.</p>

<p>“Is it okay if I look inside?”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t open your present until after the party.”</p>
<p>“Yes, just once! I want to see it now!”</p>
<p>“No problem, why not? Besides, I want to see Harune-chan’s reaction.”</p>
<p>“Onī-san, thank you!”</p>
<p>“Ah, hold on——”</p>

<p>Ignoring her older sister’s warning, Harune-chan carefully unwrapped the present so as not to tear the packaging.</p>

<p>“Wow! This is the one Haru wanted!”</p>

<p>With a delighted expression, Harune-chan looked at the present.</p>
<p>Inside was a card game box set.</p>
<p>It might be a somewhat safe choice, but considering that Harune-chan enjoys card games, I thought it would make her happy.</p>

<p>“Thank you!”</p>
<p>“No problem, as long as you like it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you both of you.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san also bowed her head to us.</p>
<p>She’s a really good big sister.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about that, a deafening noise echoed from the sky.</p>

<p>“W-what’s that?”</p>
<p>“It’s a helicopter!”</p>

<p>Harune-chan pointed to the blue sky. Then we all looked up at the sky in unison.</p>
<p>A helicopter was flying high above…why is there a helicopter flying in the sky?</p>

<p>“Wait, there’s a person in the helicopter!”</p>

<p>Kanako pointed at the helicopter with trembling fingers and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>As Kanako said, a silhouette that resembled a person was visible from the helicopter’s door.</p>

<p>“Huh? Did he just… jump out of it?”</p>

<p>Incredibly, someone jumped out of the helicopter’s door.</p>
<p>Huh? What? Is this some kind of new suicidal act?</p>
<p>Everyone in the garden stared at the fool who was free-falling.</p>

<p>“Hey-hey, is it just my imagination, or did that person… is going to land here?”</p>
<p>“——It’s not your imagination! He’s landing in this garden! Everyone, run!”</p>

<p>Starting with my words, all the people in the garden scattered like a bunch of frightened spiders seeking safety.</p>
<p>Of course, we, who were on the stage, also made a hasty escape.</p>
<p>I carried the stunned Harune-chan while Himegi-san held onto the frightened Kanako’s hand, and we retreated to what seemed like a safe place.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>I looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>As he descended, the silhouette of the person was rapidly growing larger.</p>
<p>At this rate, he was going to crash into the ground head-on.</p>
<p>Just as I envisioned a tragic scene unfolding before my eyes——</p>

<p>“Look! It’s a parachute!”</p>

<p>As Harune-chan exclaimed, a bright red parachute was floating in the sky.</p>
<p>It seemed that he wasn’t jumping for suicide purposes.</p>
<p>The mysterious person landed on the stage where we were.</p>
<p>Then we approached cautiously, albeit a bit scared.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?! It’s dangerous!”</p>

<p>Naturally, everyone was angry with the mysterious person.</p>
<p>Among them, Kanako, who had been the most frightened, was angrier than anyone else.</p>
<p>Kanako marched onto the stage with determined steps, glaring at the mysterious person.</p>

<p>“Miss, I apologize for scaring you.”</p>

<p>The mysterious person removed the goggles and gloves he was wearing.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the mysterious person turned out to be a handsome young boy as striking as me.</p>
<p>Was he a half-Japanese? He had blond hair, blue eyes, and an otherworldly atmosphere.</p>
<p>How should I put it? He looks like a picture-perfect, beautiful boy.</p>
<p>Approaching Kanako, the handsome boy——</p>

<p>“——Eh!?”</p>

<p>Surprisingly, he knelt before Kanako and then kissed the back of her hand.</p>
<p>Wow…there really are people in this world who can do such things without feeling embarrassed…</p>

<p>“Miss, are you okay? Did you get hurt?”</p>

<p>From somewhere, a bright red rose was held in the hand of the mysterious boy. And then, with a bright smile, the mysterious boy handed that red rose to a blushing Kanako.</p>

<p>“…Yes, I’m fine…”</p>

<p>It seems that Kanako was completely captivated by this boy’s charm. But who is he?</p>
<p>Enchanted by the mysterious boy’s charisma, Kanako, with heart-shaped eyes, returned to us and said,</p>

<p>“Hey, Hakuba.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’ve met a genuine Prince (Ouji-sama) from the Hakuba family. I just realized, you’re just a cheap imitation of a prince (Ouji).”</p>
<p>“Leave me alone!”</p>

<p>As soon as she opened her mouth, she started dissing me…</p>

<p>“I see. So you’re my opponent, huh?”</p>
<p>“Yes? Opponent??”</p>

<p>What the hell is this guy talking about? Who’s fighting who?</p>

<p>“——Let me take it from here.”</p>

<p>From behind, a man’s voice was heard. We turned to the source of the voice.</p>
<p>There stood an extremely beautiful woman and a dapper older man.</p>
<p>I think the beautiful woman in the dress is probably Himegi-san’s older sister or mother.</p>

<p>The dapper old man looked familiar…</p>
<p>Oh, he was the person who appeared in the smartphone video when Touka-san first came to our house.</p>
<p>Since he walked down the aisle with Touka-san in the video, he must be her father.</p>
<p>In other words, this middle-aged man in a tailcoat would become my future father-in-law.</p>
<p>This is a chance to get along with my father-in-law.</p>
<p>Despite thinking that, my father-in-law is glaring at me as if I’m his enemy.</p>
<p>Why is this guy so openly hostile towards me?</p>

<p>“I hired him to perform a magic trick for us. He’s a professional magician named Chris.”</p>

<p>Huh? Did I mishear that?</p>
<p>Did the old man just say he’s going to do magic tricks?</p>

<p>“This Chris is the outstanding top disciple of that famous Rosemary Sensei.”</p>
<p>“Rosemary Sensei!”</p>

<p>No way… Is this arrogant guy really Rosemary Sensei’s top disciple?</p>

<p>“Hey-hey. Who is Rosemary Sensei?”</p>

<p>Since Kanako, who is ignorant of the situation, asked me, I explained the information I knew about Rosemary Sensei.</p>

<p>“He’s a mysterious person who wears a mask, but his skills are undoubtedly top-notch. He’s one of the best magicians in Japan——no, in the world.”</p>
<p>“Hee, really? That Rosemary Sensei is amazing.”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s highly skilled in various forms of magic, and all the magic tricks he performs are often called miracles.”</p>

<p>In reality, I’ve watched Rosemary Sensei perform magic tricks on video several times, but I couldn’t figure out the tricks at all.</p>
<p>That’s how refined Rosemary Sensei’s magic tricks are.</p>

<p>“Even an amateur like you seems to understand Sensei’s greatness well.”</p>

<p>He’s someone who talks in a way that gets on my nerves…</p>

<p>“So, does that mean I’m no longer needed since you’ve called a professional magician?”</p>
<p>“No, I want you two to compete in a magic contest.”</p>
<p>“A magic contest?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my daughter praised you, and I hired Chris. Let’s determine who the superior magician is, once and for all.”</p>

<p>What is this old man talking about?</p>
<p>There’s no way an amateur like me can beat a professional magician, okay?</p>
<p>Normally, this would be the scene where I make excuses and run away, but unfortunately, I’m really bad at running away.</p>

<p>Above all, I have a promise with Harune-chan.</p>
<p>I must make the magic trick a success and have her play the violin.</p>

<p>“By the way, the winner will receive one million yen.”</p>
<p>“——What? One million yen?”</p>

<p>One million yen means I’ll get a hundred times ten thousand yen?</p>
<p>With a million yen, I could buy this and that…</p>

<p>“It’s not very mature to go all out against an amateur!”</p>

<p>Chris snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>Then——white smoke enveloped Chris.</p>

<p>“Cough-cough… Cough-cough… W-White smoke is coming out from Chris-sama!”</p>

<p>The smoke that had surrounded Chris disappeared, and in just a few seconds, he transformed from his modest green wind jacket attire into a flashy wine-red coat and a silk hat.</p>
<p>Seeing Chris like that, Harune-chan excitedly exclaimed, ‘It’s like magic!’ As expected of Rosemary Sensei’s top disciple.</p>
<p>I could see how skilled he truly is with just that magic trick.</p>
<p>He’s frustratingly skilled beyond belief.</p>
<p>With a confident expression, he pointed at me.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s have a match!”</p>
<p>“Alright, Chris-kun. Let’s do it.”</p>

<p>I might be falling into Himegi-san’s father’s plan, but for now, I’ll just go along with it.</p>
<p>Thus, a magic contest between Chris and me was about to begin.</p>

<p>Well, that being said, the magic contest didn’t happen immediately.</p>
<p>The birthday party kicked off with a piano performance by a bunny girl.</p>
<p>I’m quite ignorant when it comes to music, so I can’t give a detailed commentary on how skilled Himegi-san is. But from what I can tell, I think she’s at a pretty high level.</p>
<p>At the very least, I was genuinely moved by her performance.</p>
<p>Then, nearly a hundred people simultaneously cracked party poppers and delivered birthday wishes to the star of the show, Harune-chan.</p>
<p>From there, everyone enjoyed themselves with the luxurious dishes on the tables, games, quizzes, bingo, and even a comedy routine by the butlers.</p>

<p>——By the way, the prize I won in bingo was a tissue box.</p>
<p>Why did I get a tissue box while Kanako and Harukawa-kun got the latest gaming consoles?</p>

<p>On a side note, when I won the tissue case, there was someone who was laughing uproariously, holding his stomach.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the silly Kanako; it was none other than Himegi-san’s father.</p>
<p>It seems like that man has something against me…</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Onī-san, are you having fun?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I’m having a great time.”</p>

<p>Throughout the birthday party, I had been sitting on Harune-chan’s chair.</p>
<p>I never thought an elementary school student would have the nerve to sit on my lap.</p>

<p>“Onī-san, here’s some roast beef.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Harune-chan offered me a slice of roast beef, and I took a bite.</p>

<p>“Next up is the cake.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>With this, it feels like I’m not a retainer but a pet…</p>

<p>“Grrrh, I can’t believe even Harune has fallen into the clutches of this bean sprout guy…”</p>

<p>Who’s a bean sprout guy!</p>
<p>Well, I’m feeling happy right now, so I’ll let it slide.</p>

<p>“Harune actually wanted a big brother like Onī-san.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’ll do my best to become like a big brother to Harune-chan.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Onī-san?”</p>
<p>“Yeah? What is it?”</p>
<p>“Why do you smell the same as Touka-nee?”</p>
<p>” …. “</p>

<p>This kid is sharp!</p>
<p>By the way, why do we have the same smell?</p>
<p>It’s simply because Touka-san and I use the same shampoo and soap, nothing more.</p>

<p>“I think it’s just a coincidence…”</p>
<p>“I’ll leave it at that.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>I’m grateful for having a sister-in-law who can read the air.</p>
<p>And as we approached the end, a large screen used for bingo displayed a woman with glasses that I didn’t know.</p>
<p>Her appearance somewhat resembled Himegi-san.</p>
<p>However, unlike Himegi-san, who rarely smiled, the person on the screen had a cheerful and carefree smile.</p>
<p>I don’t know… there’s something about her that reminds me of Touka-san.</p>

<p>She waved her hand gently and, with a happy expression, said, ‘Harune, happy 11th birthday!’ as she celebrated Harune-chan through the screen.</p>
<p>Who could this woman be? Why did Harune-chan and Himegi-san’s faces cloud over a bit when they saw the video?</p>
<p>I was really curious, but I felt like I shouldn’t casually delve into it.</p>
<p>So, I decided not to mention this matter for now.</p>

<p>Finally, our magic showdown began.</p>
<p>The rules were quite simple. We placed various topics in the box used for bingo draws, and Harune-chan would draw a topic from the box.</p>
<p>Chris and I would then perform magic tricks based on that topic.</p>
<p>Finally, Harune-chan herself would judge who did better.</p>
<p>Without delay, Harune-chan reached into the box held by a certain Bunny Girl and drew a topic.</p>
<p>‘I choose this one!’ she exclaimed, holding up the drawn white paper for everyone to see.</p>
<p>The paper had ‘Playing Cards’ written on it.</p>
<p>The chosen topic was playing cards.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you the first turn.” Chris generously offered.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the confidence of a strong contender, but Chris let me take the first turn.</p>

<p>Playing card magic was my specialty.</p>
<p>I didn’t know how far I could go against a professional magician, but I would give it my all.</p>
<p>I opened the sealed deck of playing cards placed on the table and casually shuffled them for a moment.</p>
<p>From Hindu shuffle to Zarrow shuffle, an aerial Riffle shuffle, and executing Waterfall followed by Sybil Cut, I observed Harune-chan’s reaction, who was smiling in front of me.</p>

<p>“Wow! It’s like the cards are alive!”</p>

<p>After getting the reaction I wanted, it was time to start the magic trick.</p>

<p>“First, please choose any card from here.”</p>

<p>Following my instructions, Harune-chan picked a card from the face-down deck.</p>
<p>The card she chose was the 5 of Hearts.</p>

<p>“Now, take this pen and put a mark on the 5 of Hearts while it’s still face-up, then place it somewhere in the middle.”</p>

<p>I handed the pen to Harune-chan. She wrote ‘Harune’ on the card with the pen and returned it to the middle of the deck.</p>

<p>“Is this okay?”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Now, place this entire deck, including the card, back in its original box and put the box on the table. Harune-chan, where is the 5 of Hearts now?”</p>
<p>“Eh? It’s inside this box?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. The 5 of Hearts is inside this box. By the way, I didn’t hide it in my hand or anything.”</p>

<p>I emphasized to Harune-chan and the audience that I didn’t hide it in my hand.</p>

<p>“Harune-chan, can you snap your fingers?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I can.”</p>

<p>Harune-chan made a cute snapping gesture.</p>

<p>“OK, well done. With that, the 5 of Hearts from earlier has instantly teleported somewhere.”</p>
<p>“No way! It absolutely should be inside this box!”</p>
<p>“No, no, the 5 of Hearts definitely teleported.”</p>
<p>“Where is it?”</p>
<p>“——In this pocket.”</p>

<p>I slowly pulled the 5 of Hearts with Harune’s name written on it from my chest pocket and displayed it.</p>

<p>“Ah! It’s the 5 of Hearts! The 5 of Hearts with Harune’s name on it!”</p>
<p>“And now, I’ll put this 5 of Hearts back in my chest pocket and snap my fingers again. Then, the 5 of Hearts from earlier will instantly teleport back into this box.”</p>
<p>“…Onī-san, can Haru open this box?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I won’t touch it, so you can open the box, Harune-chan.”</p>

<p>Harune-chan opened the box containing the cards hesitantly.</p>
<p>She then took out the deck of cards and spread them on the table.</p>

<p>“——The 5 of Hearts is really inside! And it has ‘Happy Birthday’ written on it! That’s amazing! The card really teleported!”</p>

<p>Harune-chan was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Yes, it was worth performing magic tricks for reactions like this.</p>
<p>And the audience under the stage also gave me a big round of applause.</p>
<p>I looked at Chris with a triumphant expression.</p>

<p>“That’s pretty good…”</p>

<p>Now, it was Chris’s turn to perform a magic trick.</p>
<p>Chris waved to the audience like a Hollywood star, and cheers in yellow erupted from the maids and Harune-chan’s friends.</p>
<p>Among them, there was one person who was particularly loud in supporting Chris.</p>

<p>“Give it your all, Chris-sama! Don’t hold back and beat that Hakuba guy!”</p>

<p>H-hey!</p>
<p>Since we’re childhood friends, you should be cheering for me! You traitor!</p>
<p>The betrayal of my childhood friend slightly hurt me.</p>

<p>But there was a man who seemed even more dejected than I was.</p>
<p>It was none other than Takakyun, Kanako’s boyfriend.</p>

<p>S-Sorry, Takakyun. Please forgive this foolish childhood friend!</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“It seems I need to take things a bit more seriously.”</p>

<p>Chris said with determination as he opened a new, unopened deck of cards.</p>
<p>Then, just like I did earlier, Chris began to shuffle the cards.</p>
<p>…As expected of a pro. The way he handled the cards was much smoother than mine.</p>
<p>I felt a little down seeing the difference between me and a professional, but on the other hand, I was touched that a great magician was giving his all against me. That fact alone made me feel proud.</p>
<p>What kind of magic trick would the professional magician use to amaze us?</p>

<p>“Now, miss, I want you to choose three cards from this deck.”</p>
<p>“Well, since today is Harune’s birthday, I’ll choose the 4, 2, and 3 of Hearts.” (TN: April 23rd)</p>
<p>“OK. Now, with this pen, please mark these three cards.”</p>

<p>Harune-chan marked the cards with a cute bird drawing using a pen.</p>

<p>“When you’re done, put those three cards into this brown envelope.”</p>

<p>Following Chris’s instructions, Harune-chan put the three cards into the brown envelope and handed it to Chris.</p>

<p>“Now, I’m going to completely seal this brown envelope——”</p>

<p>Chris tossed the brown envelope he was holding into the air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the envelope caught fire, and it burned up in an instant.</p>
<p>Ashes fluttered down onto the table, and there were surprised voices from the audience.</p>

<p>“And now, I’ll put this ash into the birdcage.”</p>

<p>Chris placed the ashes from the envelope into a red birdcage and covered it with a large piece of cloth.</p>

<p>“Earlier, he showed the teleportation of cards, but I’ll show you something even more amazing——a card’s time travel. I’ll rewind time and miraculously restore the burned cards.”</p>

<p>Chris boasted confidently. It seemed like he was going to restore the three burned cards from inside the birdcage.</p>
<p>Chris then took out a pocket watch from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Ten seconds. The cards will return to their original state in ten seconds from now. Now, everyone, please count down with me.”</p>

<p>And the countdown began——</p>
<p>Ten seconds passed.</p>

<p>“Now, miss, can you uncover the cloth?”</p>

<p>Chris said this, handing Harune-chan the role of uncovering the cloth.</p>
<p>Then, from out of nowhere, a drumroll started playing, and spotlights were focused on Chris and Harune-chan.</p>
<p>…Hmm strange, when I performed, I didn’t have this kind of production.</p>
<p>I feel some kind of malicious intention. Is he being favored?</p>
<p>Despite my dissatisfaction and suspicion, I watched Chris’s every move closely.</p>
<p>Then, as the sound of the cymbal rang out——Harune-chan pulled the cloth taut.</p>
<p>Inside the birdcage, there was a single white dove.</p>
<p>With a triumphant look, Chris opens the cage door.</p>
<p>Then, the white dove flies out of the cage, soaring into the sky.</p>

<p>“Now, come back!”</p>

<p>The white dove obeyed Chris’s command and returned to the table.</p>

<p>“——Ahhh! The dove is holding three cards!”</p>

<p>Harune-chan reacted with great surprise.</p>
<p>As Harune-chan exclaimed, the dove was indeed holding playing cards.</p>
<p>These cards were undoubtedly the ones Harune-chan had marked with the pen.</p>
<p>Both his appearance and the performance of the magic were quite flashy.</p>

<p>Then, from the audience, there was an even louder round of applause and cheers than when I had performed.</p>
<p>It was frustrating, but the gap in card magic skills between Chris and me was evident.</p>
<p>He truly lived up to being Rosemary-sensei’s top disciple.</p>

<p>“Wahahaha! How’s that, kid? This is the skill of a professional! Don’t get too carried away just because you caught a little villain!”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>

<p>Certainly, the difference in skill between Chris and me was clear, but why was this old guy bragging so much?</p>
<p>I heard from Himegi-san’s mother earlier that he seems to harbor a strong rivalry towards me.</p>
<p>Apparently, he didn’t like that Himegi-san had spoken highly of me for protecting her from a flirtatious guy at the shopping mall.</p>
<p>Is he jealous or what?</p>

<p>He probably hired Chris to embarrass me.</p>
<p>It made me think… this is so childish.</p>
<p>The thought that such an immature person might become my future father-in-law saddens me.</p>

<p>“Mwahahaha! Now, admit your defeat!”</p>

<p>The old man said as he stepped onto the stage and lightly patted my cheek with a bundle of one million yen bills.</p>

<p>” …… “</p>

<p>Darn it!</p>
<p>I have to somehow get back at this guy. I won’t be able to sleep tonight if I don’t.</p>
<p>Right, let’s stick this Ouji sticker all over his favorite car.</p>
<p>Besides, I can’t just leave it at that.</p>
<p>Although the magic trick was successful, I couldn’t let Chris defeat me and pass the baton to Harune-chan.</p>

<p>“…One more time.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I said, one more time! Just one more time, let me perform a magic trick.”</p>
<p>“No, no! That’s against the rules! This time’s magic…”</p>
<p>“…Harune gets to decide! It’s Harune’s birthday, so Harune decides! Dad, please be quiet!”</p>

<p>Himegi’s father looked dejected at his daughter’s angry words.</p>

<p>“Chris, do you mind?”</p>
<p>“Fine. Let’s have one more round.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Then, let’s draw the lottery again.”</p>

<p>What would be the theme of this magic trick?</p>

<p>“It says ‘Free’ this time. In other words, we’ll compete with the magic tricks we’re good at.”</p>
<p>“This time, I’ll go first.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s fine.”</p>

<p>I decided to wait backstage because I felt like I might get flustered if I saw the magic trick Chris was about to perform.</p>

<p>“Now, what should I do?”</p>

<p>This time, I only brought simple props that everyone could enjoy.</p>
<p>If I had known this would happen, I should have brought more flashy props.</p>

<p>“No use regretting it now…”</p>

<p>With the props I brought, there was no way I could defeat Chris.</p>
<p>While thinking about this, I examined the props backstage.</p>

<p>“What’s this? A coffin?”</p>

<p>In front of me were two coffins that a person could fit into.</p>
<p>They looked like Western-style coffins that might be used for Dracula or a cursed sleeping princess.</p>

<p>“Is this one of Chris’s props, or did Himegi-san and the others prepare it?”</p>

<p>For some reason, I became curious about the coffin and opened it to examine it.</p>

<p>“I see. It’s a device that releases smoke…”</p>

<p>It’s an interesting trick, but it’s not the tool I want.</p>
<p>I sit on top of the coffin and bury my head in my hands.</p>
<p>I’ve simulated various magic tricks in my head, but I can’t think of any that could beat the professional Chris.</p>

<p>If possible, I want to win and give Harune the courage to play the violin.</p>

<p>“I’ve run out of options…”</p>

<p>As I utter those discouraged words, I sense someone behind me.</p>
<p>When I turn around, there’s a person dressed in a white frog costume.</p>
<p>I believe his name was Hakugaeru-kun?</p>

<p>“W-what?”</p>

<p>Hakugaeru-kun hands me a note. I accept the note and read it.</p>

<p>“…Ah? What? Hakugaeru-kun! You…!”</p>

<p>Hakugaeru-kun presses his finger to my lips, silencing me.</p>
<p>Then, he releases my lips and gestures for me to take the opponent’s neck.</p>
<p>It seems that Hakugaeru-kun is quite angry about this situation as well.</p>
<p>Then, I hear loud cheers and applause.</p>
<p>It seems that Chris has finished his magic trick.</p>

<p>“Sigh… I understand. I’m not convinced, but I’ll go along with Hakugaeru-kun’s suggestion.”</p>

<p>And so, I decided to take the gamble of a lifetime.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>I’ve finished my preparations and am now on the stage.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m here to present the final magic trick.</p>

<p>“Finally, I’m going to do something like a real assistant.</p>

<p>Himegi-san seemed a bit dissatisfied with how she was treated earlier, but now she was a bit more enthusiastic, knowing that she was needed for the final magic trick.</p>

<p>“Now, for my final magic trick, I’ll show you all something you’ve never seen or heard of before.”</p>
<p>“Something we’ve never seen? Kid, you’re making some bold claims.”</p>
<p>“Please judge that after seeing my magic. Everyone, you saw Chris perform teleportation with cards and time manipulation magic. This time, I’ll show you something even more extraordinary: parallel movement magic.”</p>
<p>“Parallel movement?”</p>
<p>“A picture is worth a thousand words. Now, please take a look at these unassuming coffins.”</p>
<p>“Can Harune examine the coffins?”</p>
<p>“Okay, feel free to examine them as much as you want.”</p>

<p>Harune eagerly examines the two coffins.</p>

<p>“Hmm… it’s just empty coffins.”</p>

<p>Harune examines the coffins thoroughly and is convinced that there’s nothing inside.</p>
<p>Aside from a mechanism that produces smoke, these coffins are normal.</p>

<p>“Certainly, as Harune-chan said, they appear to be regular coffins. However, by following a certain procedure, these coffins can connect to a parallel universe. I will demonstrate it now.”</p>

<p>I beckoned to the cute bunny.</p>

<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“First, whether it’s the right or left one, please step into this coffin.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san, with a slightly reluctant expression, cautiously enters the right coffin.</p>

<p>“Hey, can you let me out quickly later——”</p>
<p>“——Now! I will close the door and she won’t be able to get out! The problem lies within this coffin. I will now connect this coffin to a parallel universe. Could someone bring me a hand mirror?”</p>

<p>A maid brings a hand mirror.</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll place the hand mirror inside the empty coffin. Afterward, I’ll close the door and leave it for a while.”</p>

<p>When closing the door, I make sure to press the hidden switch on the coffin’s lid.</p>
<p>White smoke billows from the coffin.</p>

<p>In an instant, the stage is enveloped in white smoke.</p>
<p>Voices from the audiences below mix with anticipation and anxiety.</p>

<p>“Wow, we can’t see anything in this smoke!”</p>

<p>It lasts for several seconds.</p>
<p>The white smoke that dominated the stage vanished, returning everything to its original state.</p>

<p>“So, is this white smoke the magic trick you wanted to show us?”</p>
<p>“You’ll find out soon enough. Now, I’ll open the right coffin. Everyone, please give a warm round of applause to our cute rabbit!”</p>

<p>A drumroll plays, and a spotlight shines on the right coffin. Then, I open the right coffin.</p>
<p>——From the coffin emerges a white bunny girl with a bewildered expression.</p>
<p>A few scattered applause erupts from the audience.</p>
<p>Everyone must be thinking: ‘What changed?’</p>

<p>“Is this the magic trick you wanted to show us? It’s quite cheap——no, this isn’t magic at all.”</p>
<p>“The real show starts now.”</p>

<p>That’s right, the main event is the left coffin.</p>

<p>“Next, I’ll open the left coffin. Everyone, please give her a grand round of applause this time!”</p>

<p>And then, from speakers set up on the stage, a drumroll flows. The spotlight focuses on the left coffin.</p>
<p>Every person in this place watches the final magic act in silence.</p>
<p>I slowly open the door of the left coffin.</p>
<p>Then——out of the opened coffin, a black bunny girl springs out with great force.</p>

<p>“———Ah!?”</p>

<p>Some cover their mouths in shock. Others are left stunned, struggling to comprehend what they’re seeing.</p>
<p>Everyone is surprised and doubts their own eyes.</p>
<p>They can’t accept what they’re witnessing.</p>

<p>It’s understandable.</p>
<p>Two bunny girls are on the stage, mirroring each other’s poses.</p>
<p>As if reflected in a mirror, the two bunny girls stand in identical poses.</p>
<p>Both bunny girls have the same hair color and the same eye color.</p>
<p>The black bunny girl’s body might be slightly plumper, but overall, it’s nearly the same silhouette.</p>
<p>Most of the people here are associated with the Himegi family.</p>
<p>So they know and understand her well.</p>
<p>There’s no such thing as twin sisters of Touka Himegi, and everyone acknowledges that.</p>
<p>Yet, here are two Touka Himegis in front of them.</p>
<p>It goes beyond surprise; they can only stand there in astonishment.</p>
<p>Someone mutters softly,</p>

<p>“…we’ve witnessed a miracle….”</p>
<p>“… Touka-nee… there are two of her…”</p>

<p>Harune-chan blinks her eyes and stands dumbfounded.</p>

<p>“D-doppelganger!”</p>

<p>The white bunny girl points at the black one with a loud exclamation.</p>

<p>“Touka has become two!”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Himegi couple exclaim with wide eyes, reacting exactly as expected, no, even more exaggeratedly…</p>
<p>Well, if I didn’t know Touka-san’s true identity, I would probably react the same way.</p>

<p>“Judging by the reactions around, it seems like you did something amazing.”</p>

<p>Chris, who was the only one unaware of the Himegi family’s situation, couldn’t comprehend the situation.</p>

<p>“To me, they don’t look the same… Well, the black bunny is sexier.”</p>

<p>As a professional magician, his observation skills were truly remarkable.</p>

<p>“This time it’s my——”</p>
<p>“No, you win. You take the one million yen.”</p>

<p>If he found out the final secret, it would be considered cheating.</p>
<p>So, this time, the magic contest was his victory.</p>

<p>“Is it okay?”</p>
<p>“If I accept the money, I’ll never forgive myself.”</p>

<p>I was satisfied and I was grateful for this day.</p>
<p>I took pride in performing magic alongside such an amazing magician.</p>
<p>In that sense, I had to thank the man who looked so frustrated.</p>

<p>“Well, my true purpose wasn’t to defeat you…”</p>

<p>I shook hands with Chris.</p>
<p>Today, I met a truly respectable man.</p>

<p>“For someone who looks so poor, you surprisingly don’t seem to be greedy for cash.”</p>

<p>…I take back what I said earlier; I hate this guy!</p>

<p>“Everyone, give them a big round of applause!”</p>

<p>Even though the audience seemed perplexed, they followed my words and applauded the two of them.</p>

<p>“Onī-san, don’t decide the outcome on your own. Harune decides the winner!”</p>
<p>“That’s true. So, Harune-chan, who is the winner of this magic contest?”</p>
<p>“Both of you, kneel before Harune and close your eyes!”</p>

<p>Chris and I followed Harune-chan’s instructions.</p>

<p>“The winner of this round is——”</p>

<p>——I felt a soft sensation on my right cheek.</p>
<p>Huh? Could it be… Did I just get kissed on the cheek???</p>

<p>I opened my eyes and looked towards Harune-chan.</p>
<p>Harune-chan had also given Chris a light kiss on the left cheek.</p>
<p>It seemed that I had been kissed on the cheek, just like Chris.</p>

<p>“It’s a tie this time! Thank you both so much for Harune!”</p>

<p>Harune-chan declared.</p>
<p>Chris and I were showered with thunderous applause from the audience. I never expected to be kissed by Harune-chan…</p>
<p>Getting a kiss from my cute little sister-in-law made me genuinely happy.</p>

<p>“Wh-what? Wait a minute!”</p>

<p>I turned around and saw two rabbits standing stiffly.</p>
<p>For some reason, they were both glaring at me as if they were about to erupt like volcanoes.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s send the black bunny back to its original world!”</p>

<p>I pressed the hidden switch on the coffin and released white smoke.</p>

<p>“Hey! Ha-kun, you’re trying to trick us, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>I pushed Touka-san, who had a fierce expression, and allowed her to escape.</p>
<p>When the white smoke cleared, not only Touka but Chris had also escaped, taking his rightful share of five hundred thousand yen.</p>

<p>“Now it’s Harune’s turn!”</p>

<p>Harune-chan announced as she picked up the violin.</p>
<p>There was no hesitation or fear in her expression.</p>
<p>With this confident face, there should be no problem.</p>

<p>“Everyone, thank you for coming for Harune! Finally, Harune will present music to all of you.”</p>

<p>And so, the birthday party came to a close with a beautiful piece of music.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>Having successfully concluded Harune-chan’s birthday party, I came to the park mentioned in Touka-san’s note.</p>
<p>If I had stayed there, I could easily imagine being questioned by everyone, so I left Himegi-san’s mansion like I was running away.</p>

<p>Touka-san, who seemed to be in a good mood, was sitting on a bench in the park.</p>
<p>It seemed that her little sister’s birthday party had gone well.</p>
<p>She had changed from the black bunny girl outfit to a more casual look, wearing a blue turtleneck sweater and jeans.</p>
<p>The paper bag she was holding likely contained the bunny girl costume set.</p>

<p>“Welcome back, Ha-kun! Over here-over here!”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your hard work.”</p>
<p>“I’m so tired. I’ve been inside the mascot suit the whole time…”</p>
<p>“I never would have thought that the person inside Hakugaeru-kun was Touka-san.”</p>
<p>“I just want to see Harune’s birthday party with my own eyes…”</p>

<p>The final magic trick was a very simple one. While the white smoke was being released, Touka-san, who had been inside the mascot suit, simply entered the coffin.</p>
<p>It was an explanation that wouldn’t be anything special, but the surprising part wasn’t there.</p>
<p>By now, the audience would be completely captivated by the topic of the other Touka Himegi.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but feel gloomy, imagining myself being interrogated by Himegi-san tomorrow.</p>
<p>If only I could turn back time, I would want to rewind it.</p>

<p>“I never would have thought that Chris-chan would appear at Harune’s birthday party. Originally, we were supposed to meet when we became third-years.”</p>

<p>From the context of the conversation, it seemed that Touka-san knew Chris.</p>
<p>Wait, Chris-chan? She???</p>

<p>“What? She’s a girl!?”</p>
<p>“Oops, slipped up again…”</p>

<p>Touka-san covered her mouth with her hand and made a careless expression.</p>
<p>Based on her reaction, it appeared that the professional magician was not Chris-kun but Chris-chan.</p>
<p>However, Chris-chan herself probably never even imagined that her gender secret would be revealed in such a careless manner.</p>

<p>“More importantly, are you okay with this?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I thought you wouldn’t want to reveal your true identity.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not exactly something to be happy about… But I got really fed up with that idiotic father’s attitude!”</p>
<p>“…for me, it was a relief. If things had continued as they were, I wouldn’t have been able to do anything against Chris.”</p>
<p>“It’s a wife’s job to help her husband when he’s in trouble, you know.”</p>

<p>Touka-san said mischievously and winked at me.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much. I’m sure Harune six years in the future will be thrilled when I tell her about it.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to hear that.”</p>

<p>Harune-chan six years from now, I bet she’ll be a beautiful woman!</p>

<p>“Besides, that person should be happy too…”</p>
<p>“That person?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. More importantly—If my husband were showing interest in another girl, he will get this—”</p>
<p>“——Ouch!”</p>

<p>Touka-san pinched both of my cheeks hard.</p>

<p>“Don’t get all lovey-dovey with my sister!”</p>
<p>“I’m not. I’m not into a little kid or anything. I’m just an only child, so it made me a little happy to be pampered by someone younger!”</p>
<p>“That’s what people call lovey-dovey?”</p>

<p>This person is surprisingly jealous…</p>

<p>“Well, in recognition of what you did today, I’ll let it slide.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“No, thank you. Thanks to Ha-kun, I was able to accomplish one of my goals.”</p>
<p>“No problem. I’m glad I could help.”</p>
<p>“Now, I just have to achieve my remaining goal.”</p>
<p>“I’ll help you again.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. But at first, I wanted to do it alone. I’ve decided that the first time we meet, I’ll be alone…”</p>

<p>Meet… Could it be that she’s planning to meet the person in the video message from earlier?</p>
<p>For some reason, I had an image of that person meeting Touka-san, which filled me with anxiety and fear.</p>

<p>“Someday, Ha-kun, there will definitely come a time when I need your help. When that time comes—”</p>
<p>“——I’ll help you as much as you need. After all, I’ll be your future husband…”</p>
<p>“Hehe, that’s right. Thank you. I’ll start taking action from tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Do your best.”</p>
<p>“I will, so Ha-kun, can you give me a bit of courage?”</p>

<p>Touka-san asked me with a soft voice and a gentle touch.</p>

<p>“What do you mean courage?”</p>
<p>“Yesterday, didn’t you practice confessing your feelings in your room?”</p>
<p>“You… heard that?”</p>

<p>Thinking about my magic trick failure, I had practiced confessing my feelings to Himegi-san.</p>
<p>However, considering that the magic trick went perfectly without any failures, Harune-chan bravely played the violin, and everything turned out well; I had assumed that the confession was no longer necessary.</p>

<p>“I actually want to hear your confession right here and now.”</p>
<p>“Well, that confession was planned for Himegi-san, not for you.”</p>
<p>“I want to hear it.”</p>

<p>It seemed like she wouldn’t give up until I confessed.</p>
<p>I guess I have no choice. I’ll indulge her.</p>

<p>“By the way, I’ll score it.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Since you’re trying to win me over with words, if you give me a half-hearted love confession and I accept it, it’ll affect my reputation.”</p>
<p>“You’re really putting the pressure on me…”</p>

<p>Alright, it’s come to this. I’ll take the plunge.</p>
<p>I’ll accept the criticism gracefully later.</p>

<p>“—Touka Himegi, I—————————” (TN:Censored/Hidden)</p>

<p>With these words, I hoped that something in my world might change even just a little.</p>
<p>But sadly, my feelings never reached her.</p>

<p>“Fifty points.”</p>

<p>I received a harsh score from her. It seems I still have a lot to work on.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>In the next scene, I was inside an elevator at a certain hospital.</p>
<p>Even though it had been six years since I last visited this hospital, the memories from that time were still vivid.</p>
<p>I pressed the button for the top floor without hesitation.</p>

<p>I had pressed this button countless times before.</p>
<p>In my hand, I held two popular shop-bought puddings that I had purchased earlier at the station.</p>
<p>I wondered how many times I had brought these puddings as gifts.</p>
<p>Lost in thought, I arrived at my destination floor, and the doors opened.</p>
<p>I gazed at myself reflected in the hallway window.</p>

<p>Seeing my own appearance, I realized how much I had aged.</p>
<p>What kind of reaction would she show when she saw me now?</p>
<p>Would she recognize my true identity?</p>
<p>Or would she greet me with a smile as she always does?</p>

<p>I stood in front of the room I was supposed to enter. It was a room I had thought I would never visit again.</p>
<p>As I took a deep breath, I noticed that I was more nervous than I had imagined.</p>
<p>I took another deep breath and opened the door with trembling hands.</p>

<p>“——How are you feeling?”</p>

<p>I spoke to the person lying in the bed while trying to maintain a calm demeanor.</p>
<p>The person was watching a video of Harune’s birthday party on their smartphone.</p>
<p>On the smartphone screen, Harune was confidently playing the violin.</p>
<p>She watched my sister’s efforts with a smile.</p>

<p>Seeing that smile, I was convinced.</p>
<p>Changing the future had been the right choice.</p>

<p>“Oh? Touka-chan, aren’t you supposed to be at school?”</p>

<p>The woman sitting on the bed noticed my presence and greeted me with a smile.</p>
<p>Ah, she sounded like this… She had this kind of expression…</p>
<p>Yes, my sister always had a rainbow-like smile that lit up the sky.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that this person was my older sister, Natsumi-nesan.</p>

<p>“So, did you leave school early———Ah! Could it be, the black Touka-chan?”</p>
<p>“Uh?”</p>
<p>“Look, there are two Touka-chan.”</p>

<p>My sister turned her smartphone screen toward me.</p>
<p>On the screen were images of both of us in bunny girl outfits.</p>

<p>“Could it be that you’ve come from the future?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Huh? Touka-chan? Why are you crying?”</p>

<p>I had made up my mind not to cry…but when I heard my sister’s voice and saw her smile, I burst into tears.</p>

<p>I had dreamed of this moment so many times. I had imagined it over and over in my mind.</p>
<p>And now, the day had finally come when we could meet again.</p>
<p>A miracle had happened. What I had once lost was right in front of my eyes.</p>

<p>If this isn’t a miracle, then what is?</p>
<p>With all the sincerity I could muster, I decided to convey my true feelings to my older sister with a big smile.</p>

<p>“——Natsumi-neesan, I’ve missed you so much…”</p>

<p>——Finally, the time that had stood still for me began to move again.</p>
