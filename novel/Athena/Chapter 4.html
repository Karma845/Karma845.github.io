<h2>Chapter 4: Stream After the Punishment</h2>


<p class="calibre2">“Now then…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">After Yuno’s sermon and finishing the meal she had prepared, Haruto let out a voice as if switching his own mental state.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Onii-chan, are you going to be streaming today?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. I absolutely have to livestream today because…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He messed up again. The meaning behind the username of his smurf account was exposed, and the account was getting harassed by the people who found out.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While it might be an option to wait until the incident settles down before streaming, delaying the explanation will only make things more difficult in the future. Furthermore, not streaming will only negatively impact his finances. Similar to the first streaming incident, there’s no choice but to tackle the problem head-on.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Could it be… you’re running out of money?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, no, it’s not that! It’s for personal reasons… Oh, well. There are just times when I feel an uncontrollable urge to stream, you know?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He couldn’t honestly admit it.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With a nervous sweat, he managed to gloss over the situation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm. Is it not okay to stream after taking a bath? It’s better to go to bed right after the stream, right? You just finished your part-time job, after all.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thanks for worrying. But I’ve already scheduled the livestream, and tomorrow’s work starts later than usual, so it’s fine.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I see. That makes me a bit relieved.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, but I’m sorry if you can hear me make some weird noises.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Weird noises… like the script stuff?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uh, well… something like that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As he rested his chin on his hand, Haruto felt Yuno’s sharp gaze on him. It seemed like she saw through everything.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Onii-chan, if it’s okay with you, how about turning your gaming room into a soundproof room…? I’m not exactly bothered by it, but it would make it easier for you to work without worrying, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I won’t deny that, but if it’s about that, it usually costs around 500,000 yen or more.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh, it’s that expensive!? That’s so much… If I look hard enough, maybe I can find a decent one for around 300,000 yen…” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">When Haruto heard Yuno mentioned the exquisite price with a difficult expression, it triggered his Onii-chan senses.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Stop. Are you thinking about buying me a soundproof room, Yuu?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. Right now, I have around that much in savings.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, no, that’s absolutely not okay. I’ll be angry if you spend such a large sum of money for my sake. Since you’re still in high school, you should rely on me more. I have a certain image to uphold as your big brother.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Just this time, Haruto changed his gentle expression to a serious one.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“When the time comes, I’ll be the one to buy it. I’ll make sure it’s set up before your entrance exams.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…I understand. Then, for now, I’ll rely on onii-chan. I don’t want to get scolded.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“A wise decision. But you hardly rely on me at all.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s not true.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Really?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Onii-chan, you just haven’t noticed.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-if you say it like that… I’ll believe you.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Respecting each other and supporting one another in their daily lives, the two of them naturally matured in their way of thinking.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The tense atmosphere around them quickly softened.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, well then, it’s about time, so I’ll go prepare for the livestream. You have school again tomorrow, so make sure to go to bed early, Yuu.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I know. And you don’t have to wake up early to see me off.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Even if you say that, I just naturally wake up.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Could it be that I was too loud in the morning…?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Wait, that’s not true! It’s the alarm clock&mdash;” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In a rush to dispel the misunderstanding, he quickly realized he had fallen into a trap.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno was there, smirking with a satisfied expression, having successfully teased him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“U-Ugh, using those words is unfair…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s because onii-chan isn’t honest. I know you set an alarm, and I know you sleep with the curtains open to let the morning sun in.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…You could have just said that earlier.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The outcome was clear.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, I’m going to bed soon. I don’t want to disturb onii-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I don’t really consider you a disturbance.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, good night, Yuu. Let’s do our best tomorrow too.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. Good night, onii-chan. Sorry for going to bed before you again.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ll be making a bit of noise later, so don’t mind me~” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, honestly…” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Due to her strong sense of responsibility, it’s probably difficult for her to go to bed early every time.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Responding with a joke to Yuno in this manner is the right approach.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Having witnessed his sister’s smiling face, Haruto turned off the lights in the living room and moved to the gaming room with a drink in hand.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Phew…”&nbsp; (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The livestream was scheduled for 11:30 PM. There were less than 15 minutes left. While sitting in his gaming chair, he quickly started up the PC.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ll definitely get teased today… And there are already 2000 viewers waiting…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ever since the streaming accident, the accidental collaboration with Ayaya, who has over 300,000 subscribers, the recent numerous trending topics, and the (generally positive) controversies, the topics surrounding him seem endless.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even though it’s late at night, it’s not surprising to see unprecedented numbers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ugh, I’m getting nervous…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As Haruto tries to pass the time, he starts reading the comments from the viewers in the waiting room.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Is Oimo_daisuki-chan not here yet LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Hurry up and start the streammm!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Bring out imouto-chan!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [This guy’s mental strength to stream even after being exposed today is like a diamond.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If only I was as strong as a diamond…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">From here on, he changed his tone to his “oni-chan” persona, and spent the rest of the remaining time meaningfully by going through his script.</p>



<p class="calibre2">And then, 11:30 PM arrives.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Phew… <em class="calibre6">*cough*</em>” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Taking a deep breath and clearing his throat, Haruto started the livestream.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting, everyone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="calibre2">As he delivered his opening line and switched to the ABEX screen, comments started flooding in.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [It’s hereeeee!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Been waiting!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Good evening!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Was looking forward to this!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Ever since the streaming incident, hate comments rarely appeared. The majority of the comments were genuinely positive.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“There are already 2500 people watching? Seriously… You guys have way too much free time; it’s a bit off-putting. Go to bed already.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Shut up, siscon]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [I’m done with work just like oni-chan!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Did you enjoy your imouto-chan’s cooking?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Actually, if we go to sleep, won’t you be in trouble lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Banter between the streamer and viewers ensued. Since there were a higher number of viewers, there were more comments, but this was a regular occurrence at this point.</p>



<p class="calibre2">A slight change in the routine wasn’t a big problem. In fact, it was even welcomed because it meant endless topics for discussion.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, well, let me announce today’s schedule. It’s late at night, so… it’s going to be about a 2-hour stream. The first 20 minutes will be shooting bots while doing a Q&amp;A. After that, we’ll have about 1 hour and 40 minutes of ranked matches.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Bot shooting refers to the target practice game mode.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Since it’s just a light warm-up before the actual games, he can answer questions while preparing.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Make sure not to wake up your little sister!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [You don’t have to get too rowdy!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Take care of your family!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Do it at your own pace]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Those were the comments that came in response to today’s schedule.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The sentiment of “Since you have a little sister, I’ll allow this much!” comes through in the comments.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Um, <em class="calibre6">*cough*.</em> As always, I’ll prioritize answering superchats, but feel free to drop your comments in chat anyways as I’ll be reading that too.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">If he showed his nervousness, he would be teased even more. He couldn’t afford to let his emotions be shaken.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After the usual introduction, Oni-chan, now in the bot-shooting room, picked up his favorite weapon, the R-301, and began answering questions while shooting targets.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With this, a lot of comments started pouring in.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The first one Oni-chan read was a 1000-yen superchat.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, I’m a first-time viewer. Oh, a newcomer, welcome! So… To what extent will you answer the question…? Well, it’s along the same lines as other streamers. Naturally, questions that could lead to revealing personal information are a big no-no. So, please refrain from asking those questions as it’s just throwing money down the drain.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He understands the challenges and importance of earning money. He doesn’t want to engage in actions where he receives money without answering questions.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It seems this sentiment resonated with the viewers.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Now that I think about it, there’s kindness showing here and there…]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [I envy imouto-san for having such a big brother!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [I wonder if imouto-chan is a brocon…?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [If she knew about the username of the smurf account, he’d definitely be called creepy lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2">The tone is rough, but his words show consideration for the viewers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Unintentionally, Oni-chan has taken on a tsundere attribute.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While continuing the bot shooting, Oni-chan proceeds with the Q&amp;A session with a 2500 yen superchat. “Tell us about some of the recent interactions you’ve had with imouto-chan!”</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well… I don’t know who is this sister you’re talking about, but let’s just say that I got scolded and spanked with a slipper.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [With a slipper lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [What stupid thing did you do to deserve that]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [You sound kinda down.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Well, if you get scolded by your beloved imouto, of course you would feel down lmao]</p>



<p id="calibre_link-70" class="calibre2">Ever since the streaming incident where his sister’s voice was heard, her fanbase has been steadily growing for some reason.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The comments asking “Why were you scolded?” flooded in, and he quickly shared the details.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“The reason I got scolded… well, it’s totally my fault. I didn’t let her know that I’d be reaching home late. She got worried, so she spanked me.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [You jerk!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [You’re the worst!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Apologize by cutting your belly open!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Don’t make your imouto worry!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">As soon as he explained, a barrage of harsh comments came out. There were no viewers siding with Oni-chan; instead, the merciless comments continued.</p>



<h4>◆◆◆◆</h4>


<p class="calibre2">“Huh?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Seeing this reaction, Oni-chan quickly raised his voice.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Shut up, all of you. I admit that it was my fault. I’m damn well reflecting on it, you idiots.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [This guy’s losing it lmao]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Did we offend you lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [He’s taken more damage from this than I thought.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [It’s hilarious just picturing Oni-chan getting spanked by his sister]</p>



<p class="calibre2">While venting his frustration, Oni-chan continues shooting bots, and true to his status as a top-tier (Predator) player, his accuracy remains impressive.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As he keeps the viewers entertained with the gameplay, he glances at the next set of comments.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Do you really love imouto-chan?”, from a 5000 yen superchat.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“… Uh, hey, how about asking something else…? Answering that isn’t worth 5000 yen.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [They’re just waiting to clip this lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Come on, answer already!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Well, you said you’d answer as long as it doesn’t reveal personal info, so it can’t be helped]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [You’re gonna answer, right!?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“*<em class="calibre6">Sigh*</em>…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The comments section buzzes with excitement. Oni-chan stops shooting bots, scratches his head, and reluctantly answers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“… Well, I love her more than chocolate. Seriously, though, my room isn’t soundproof, so please stop with these kinds of questions. I’m begging you, seriously.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [What’s your standard for chocolate lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Saying that will just make your sister tease you…]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [I wonder if imouto-san is watching this stream]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [It’s Oni-chan’s fault for not putting more restrictions on the questions lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2">The viewers are right.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s Oni-chan’s fault for not being restrictive. As a result, the teasing about his sister naturally continues.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, what do you like about your sister?”, from a 7000 yen superchat.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, seriously, another one of these?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He doesn’t want to pick up comments like these, but since he’s receiving money, it’s unavoidable. To overcome the embarrassment, he has no choice but to answer.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, um, the things I like about her…? She’s kind, good at cooking, gives her all in everything she does, and she treasures anything I give her… And, well… Okay, that’s enough!” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">By taking on the role of the head of the household in place of their parents. It’s inevitable that he takes a more parental perspective in such a situation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, isn’t everyone like this? Those with siblings?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Nononono]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Just from this, you can tell imouto-chan is a good person]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Is this guy really trying to provoke us lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Truly lives up to his name of ‘Oimo_daisuki’ lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Let’s change the topic already. Next is… Oh, again with the sister talk! It’s my stream, so can’t you show a bit more interest in me?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Worrying about whether the audience would get tired of the same topic was unfounded. For some reason, the number of viewers kept increasing, and the number of likes was also increasing just as much.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After a while, the continuous talk about his sister came to an end. The next question was a bigger one, with a five-figure superchat: a 12,000 yen question about Ayaya, with whom he collaborated earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Superchat (12 000 yen)</strong>: [You were collaborating with Ayaya the other day, but what’s she like off-stream?]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s not about me again! Seriously, I want to ask you guys: Do other streamers answer questions like this about other streamers?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Not being the type to collaborate with others, he couldn’t quite grasp the situation. Truth be told, he didn’t want to answer.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Oni-chan is a character who was universally disliked. As such, he tries to not drag down other streamers and doesn’t usually talk about them.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Some people answer, and some don’t]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Oh, since Oni-chan hasn’t collaborated with anyone before, he might not know about that]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [I’m curious about this as much as about imouto-chan.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Indeed, some streamers include a disclaimer during their broadcasts, advising against mentioning other streamers’ names to avoid trouble. However, Oni-chan is not one of them.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He had never been involved with anyone before, so there was no reason for him to include such a disclaimer.</p>



<p class="calibre2">(If I stay silent, it might lead to some bad speculations… I can’t cause trouble for Ayaya-san either…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">If viewers start to think that staying silent means something is wrong and that off-stream Ayaya has a bad attitude, it would lead to a difficult situation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While he wants to avoid praising others during his own stream, this is his mistake for not putting up a notice.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The best thing to do is to honestly express what he thinks.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, um… since I received money for it, I’ll say a little, but… honestly, there’s nothing to criticize her about. Even from a streamer’s perspective, I can only think that she’s amazing.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Eh, is this really oni-chan?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [His tone suddenly changed lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [The gentle onii-chan voice came out]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [This Q&amp;A time is more entertaining than any other streamer’s lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Oni-chan wasn’t looking at the comments. He was recalling the details while gazing at the ceiling.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Her channel has, what, 300,000 subscribers…? Oh, it’s around 350,000 now. In this industry, power dynamics are often determined by subscriber count, and even with a huge difference between us, she never looked down on me. She treated me politely, even when dealing with someone like me. She’s seriously amazing. That’s why she has so many fans, and I hope she continues to grow. It would be strange if she didn’t.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [You’re praising her like crazy! Do you, like, have feelings for her or something!?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Ayaya’s favorability is skyrocketing, lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [I’m gonna subscribe to her channel too!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Oi oi. Your character is falling apart, you know]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Ah, I didn’t answer that question yet. Ayaya is the same on and off stream. Just as she is.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [That was worth the 12,000 yen!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [As expected of my Ayaya!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [It would be nice if Oni-chan got this much appreciation too!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [Seriously, your character is falling apart lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2">After expressing his thoughts and returning his gaze to the PC, Oni-chan finally realizes the current situation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Consciously clearing his throat, he resumes shooting the bots.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, well, I’m going to be using her as a stepping stone and reap the benefits, so you better be prepared, folks.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [There’s no point in covering it up now LMAO]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [This part is definitely going to be clipped too…]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comments</strong>: [You need to prepare more scripts!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">On that day, with just this Q&amp;A session, Oni-chan received his highest number of superchats ever, and he continued to showcase excellent gameplay in the ranked matches.</p>


<h4>Ayana's PoV</h4>

<p class="calibre2">The morning after such a stream.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Shirayuki Aya, with her pajamas on and bed hair sticking up, looked wide-eyed at her smartphone after stopping the alarm.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The drowsiness disappeared in an instant, and she made a noise reminiscent of a squashed frog.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What’s going on, wait, what is this!?” (Aya)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-48" class="calibre2">In front of her was an overwhelming number of notifications from Twitto.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She had seen this notification count several times before after collaborating with famous streamers or achieving good results in tournaments.</p>



<p class="calibre2">However, this time, nothing noteworthy had happened. This caused her to become uneasy.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-Is it… trending…!? M-Maybe that teammate spread it after all!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The only controversial thing yesterday was when she played games with Oni-chan in private.</p>



<p class="calibre2">…But it wasn’t even supposed to happen in the first place.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She just wanted to play with Haruto who coincidentally turned out to be Oni-chan.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If she were a normal streamer, there’s room to wiggle her way out of the situation given the circumstances but the challenging aspect of being in the VTuber industry is that things don’t end that easily.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Her channel, which has garnered over 80% male viewership, tends to spark wide controversy with even a hint of a male presence.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uuwww… I really didn’t mean for that to happen…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">For Aya, who earns her living and education expenses through streaming, getting involved in controversies is the most frightening thing.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She wants to just forget everything that happened right away&mdash;such feelings overwhelm her, but as a streamer, she must fulfill her responsibilities.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well, first, I need to check the contents…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With trembling fingers, Aya brought her hand closer to the screen, closed her eyes, and tapped on the notification bar. Slowly, she opened her eyes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">And at that moment, upon seeing the screen, she realized that all her previous anxieties were unfounded.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Ayaya is the best after all! Please continue doing your best!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [I’ll keep supporting you! Woo-hoo!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [As expected of my Ayaya!!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [I’ll support you even more!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ha…?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She rubbed her eyes in disbelief at the unexpected words of praise and double-checks, making sure it was not a hallucination.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The notification bar is lined with compliments.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What’s going on…?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s natural to be unable to keep up with the situation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Without doing anything, somehow her reputation has gone up.</p>



<p class="calibre2">To find out more about the details, she dug a little deeper into the notifications…</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Yesterday, Oni-chan praised Ayaya in his stream! Here’s the URL!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Finally, she found the cause.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh!? O-Oni-chan praised me…!? During his stream!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s unprecedented for the toxic Oni-chan to compliment a streamer.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya reflexively clicked on the sent URL which redirected her to a video on MouTube and she quickly scrolled through the comments.</p>



<p class="calibre2">At the top of the comment section was a list of notable timestamps of the stream posted by a viewer.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">04:27</strong> Oni-chan’s Q&amp;A session.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">07:13</strong> Interaction with imouto-chan.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">09:10</strong> Oni-chan gets upset.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">12:49</strong> Complimenting Ayaya 1.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">14:10</strong> Complimenting Ayaya 2.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">17:41</strong> Interacting with Ayaya 1.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">18:20</strong> Interacting with Ayaya 2.</p>



<p class="calibre2">There are many intriguing details, but what catches her attention the most were those related to herself.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Gulping nervously, she pressed the timestamp <strong class="calibre5">12:49</strong>, and immediately, Oni-chan’s voice could be heard.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(…Honestly, there’s nothing to criticize her about. Even from a streamer’s perspective, I can only think that she’s amazing.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Her channel has, what, 300,000 subscribers…? Oh, it’s around 350,000 now. In this industry, power dynamics are often determined by subscriber count, and even with a huge difference between us, she never looked down on me. She treated me politely, even when dealing with someone like me. She’s seriously amazing. That’s why she has so many fans, and I hope she continues to grow. It would be strange if she didn’t.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Then, perhaps after reading viewer comments, a panicked voice could be heard.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Well, well, I’m going to be using her as a stepping stone and reap the benefits, so you better be prepared, folks.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">M-Mouuu</em>… What’s he saying…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Unable to hold back her retort, her cheeks flushed, she presses ‘Complimenting Ayaya 2’ at <strong class="calibre5">14:10</strong>.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(I’d like you to tell us what you find amazing about Ayaya-san from a streamer’s perspective…? Well, it’s probably the effort she put into entertaining her viewers. During her streams, she’s always doing something for them, right? Even though her channel has grown quite big, she still values each of her viewers. Unlike me.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oni-chan is paying attention to that extent… Even though, he himself also cares about his viewers…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Next, she presses <strong class="calibre5">17:41</strong>.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, could you tell us the cute parts of Ayaya…? Well, sorry. I can’t find anything cute about her. I don’t think about that kind of stuff during games, and I did have my work mode switch turned on when talking to her.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Finally, <strong class="calibre5">18:20</strong>.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“What do you like about Ayaya? Wow, seriously, don’t think I’ll answer anything just because you pay. I can’t think of anything I like about her. Our connection isn’t as deep as you guys might think.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In these two responses, Oni-chan’s persona is on full display.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Many viewers are commenting things like, “No way!?” “Too harsh lol” “Is he serious?” “Oh no, that’s not good”, but… Aya was different.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With narrowed eyes, she wore a joyful expression.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thank you, Haruto-san…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She was grateful for the way he handled the situation. As a fellow streamer, she understands.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Regarding the last two questions, the viewers are not looking at their relationship as streamers but rather, their relationship as the opposite sex.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If Oni-chan had answered these questions with “She’s cute” or “I like a lot of things about her”, rumors would naturally start circulating.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Oni-chan is trying to appeal to Ayaya.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Oni-chan has his sights set on Ayaya.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Could they be dating?</p>



<p class="calibre2">Once such rumors spread, Ayaya’s male fans would resent Oni-chan. They would dislike him. Conflicts among viewers would arise. Collaboration would become difficult. They would have to keep their distance to continue their streaming activities.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The environment surrounding them would sour.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The reason both streamers are acknowledged by each other’s viewers is the assumption that “they don’t see each other as the opposite sex but just as streaming colleagues.”</p>



<p class="calibre2">Oni-chan has been careful to maintain that boundary to keep the situation at bay.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Really, Oni-chan… If you protect me so much, I might start thinking about various things…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He drew a clear line to protect her.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He praised her despite having a toxic persona.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-49" class="calibre2">He prepared for the backlash that might occur from talking bad about her.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Maybe it’s the warmth from the morning sun hitting her body, but her chest feels pleasantly warm.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Her heart was also pounding quicker.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Seriously, I’m being too easy…! He said some terrible things about using me as a stepping stone, right? Yeah!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She slaps both cheeks to change her mood.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In this room, the only sound is Oni-chan’s voice playing on the screen.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>… I have to be careful not to let anyone know that I’ve started to miss Haruto-san…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Looking up at the ceiling, Aya mutters, letting out a slightly feverish voice.</p>
