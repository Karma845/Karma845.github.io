<h2>Chapter 4: Confessions Should Be Made At &#8220;Twilight&#8221;</h2>

<h3>■ Takane Saki ■</h3>

<p>&#8230; I heard the sound of something tapping irregularly in the darkness.</p>
<p>No, apparently I had been hearing that sound for a long time, and my consciousness is gradually beginning to awaken.</p>
<p>The softness I feel on the right side of my body &#8230; leather? Warm&#8230;</p>
<p>It appears that I am lying on the couch, covered with a blanket.</p>
<p>Also, what is it? There is a peculiar smell in the air. I think I&#8217;ve smelled it somewhere before&#8230; Karaoke?</p>
</p>
<p>Yes, I think I&#8217;ve smelled this smell at a karaoke place I once went to with Yuka.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I slowly opened my heavy eyelids.</p>
<p>In the shadow of a table, dimness prevails in my field of vision.</p>
<p>I slowly raised myself up and crawled out of the darkness beneath the table and &#8230;</p>
<p>I saw a woman sitting in front of me.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it &#8230;6 characters &#8230;6?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>She looks quite young, but I would say that she is in her mid-30s&#8230;?</p>
<p>To be honest, I was more than a little intimidated when I first saw her appearance.</p>
<p>Her blonde hair, darkened at the roots, was what is commonly referred to as pudding.</p>
</p>
<p>Her sharp eyes peeking out from under her hair were so powerful that it made me cower even if they were not directed at me. If she were to walk past me from across the street, I would keep my eyes down and pass her on the street as quickly as possible. That is the kind of woman she is.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she doesn&#8217;t even look at me, although she is glaring at some kind of text as she taps the table with the bottom of her ballpoint pen with a clunky sound&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, high school girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hii!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect to be accosted and my voice trailed off.</p>
<p>The pudding girl, whose name I didn&#8217;t even know, continued in a low voice.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think a beef patty sandwiched between buns is called &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s six characters long.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>What is this all about?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand the situation at all, &#8230;but I know the answer to the question.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a hamburger &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it! What a trick question, it&#8217;s given me a hard time&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>What in the world could she have been stuck on&#8230;?</p>
<p>Despite my doubts, she writes the six characters of &#8220;hamburger&#8221; in the space provided.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230; It seemed to be a crossword puzzle with a prize.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ve solved two puzzles, I&#8217;m done for the day, brain training complete&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>She closed the textbook, which was full of blank spaces, and stretched.</p>
<p>&#8230; Apparently, she&#8217;s not as scary as I thought she was, but for goodness sake, I want to know who she is.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kaoru Mashima, you can call me whatever you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, Kaoru-san&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230; Huh? Mashima?</p>
<p>Wait a minute, then&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you by any chance Mashima&#8230; Kengo-kun&#8217;s aunt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Kengo calls me his sister, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, nice to meet you! I&#8217;m Saki Takane!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>My mind instantly switched to &#8220;Greeting Saki mode&#8221;.</p>
</p>
<p>I tried to straighten my posture in a hurry, and then something fell from the blanket in an avalanche.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, what is that!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hahaha, it&#8217;s body warmer, body warmer, disposable body warmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A disposable body warmer &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost summer, so why such a large amount of them&#8230;?</p>
<p>Seeing me puzzled, Kaoru-san laughed.</p>
<p>In contrast to Mashima-kun, she laughs a lot.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember? When the high school girl had a stomach ache, that idiot started gathering disposable body warmers from all over the house and stuffing them into a blanket. It was funny, so I kept quiet and watched.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mashima-kun&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kengo, who is always so serious about his work, came back home with a bloody look on his face. And he was carrying a girl on his back! I heard she collapsed all of a sudden. Lucky we live so close.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh…&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Yes, I passed out in front of the train station and&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Mashima-kun brought me in&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, this is a snack bar that I run, and it&#8217;s called &#8216;Leo&#8217; after a cat I used to have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know what a snack bar is, but it&#8217;s for adults, right?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;ve never been in one, but if you ask me, I have a dim image of a long counter with beautiful bottles of liquor lined up like jewels on the shelves.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s not a place for high school students, but it&#8217;s not open yet, so it&#8217;s a special day&#8230; Oh, don&#8217;t tell Senko or anyone else, okay? I&#8217;ll get in trouble.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Senko &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Kaoru is &#8230; kind of a mysterious woman.</p>
<p>But more than that, now I remember what I have done to Mashima-kun, and I feel deep self-loathing.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Um, Mashima-kun is &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said he was going to finish the shopping he asked me to do. I think he should be back by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done terrible things to &#8230; Mashima-kun. I even caused trouble for Kaoru-san&#8230; I don&#8217;t have any face to match&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind it at all, and he&#8217;s not the kind of person who cares about that kind of thing either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…So I am sorry.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I myself know very well that Mashima-kun is that kind of person.</p>
<p>It is because of that I cannot allow myself to take advantage of his kindness.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you should worry too much about it. Here you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My painkillers, and this is room temperature water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for everything&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just doing brain training here. Kengo was the one who took care of you.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>At first, I couldn&#8217;t help but be surprised to learn that this man was Mashima-kun&#8217;s upbringer&#8230;</p>
<p>But now I can understand.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will thank Mashima-kun in person when he comes back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smile like me! Saki is so beautiful, but with Kengo, she&#8217;s too expressionless&#8230; Wait a minute, Takane&#8230; Saki?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? What is it &#8230;?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Kaoru-san leaned forward over the table and stared at me intently.</p>
<p>Then she furrowed her brow.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Takane Saki, could it be that Saki Takane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ah.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>It was only natural, when you think about it.</p>
</p>
<p>…Because she was the one who raised Mashima-kun.</p>
<p>So of course she knows about the incident that happened.</p>
<p>The incident that got Mashima-kun suspended from school&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry about that!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha-ha-ha, you&#8217;ll apologize again soon, or rather, why are you apologizing? Saki, you didn&#8217;t do anything wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of me, Mashima-kun is &#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kengo is not a kid, no one made him do it, he took responsibility for what he did, that&#8217;s all that matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Saki! I heard you go to Kamimura High School, but you&#8217;re such a pretty girl! Your skin is so smooth, you look like a doll! You&#8217;re so cute!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, wow, hey&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn, that idiot never talks about that kind of things!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>My shoulders jumped.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Well, Mashima-kun, did he say anything about what happened at school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t say anything until he is asked. He says things like, &#8216;I changed the bulletin board today&#8217; or &#8216;I did dusting exercises&#8217; or &#8216;I had a mid-term exam&#8217;. That lack of interest is definitely a reflection of his father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see&#8230; haha&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? Um, I&#8217;m sorry! How else would Mashima-kun&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m back, sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Kengo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I screamed involuntarily and immediately hid the painkiller that Kaoru-san had given me.</p>
<p>I was so lucky that Mashima-kun didn&#8217;t notice it.</p>
<p>When he saw me, his eyes widened.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re awake!? Your complexion &#8230;&#8230; looks better, but what about your body? Anything wrong!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ah, it was just&#8230;. anemia!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahhhhh, it&#8217;s just anemia, she just woke up, so don&#8217;t be too loud. Kengo&#8217;s voice is so low it echoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, that&#8217;s good&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun expressed his relief.</p>
<p>There was definitely a sense of relief in his expression that I was safe.<br />Mashima-kun is the kind of person who can really worry about others and really reassure them&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have an appetite?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re hungry. It&#8217;s getting pretty late, but I&#8217;m going to prepare lunch. Can I use your kitchen, sister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can use it all you want, I&#8217;m sleepy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, Saki, you wait right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! I&#8217;ll help you, Mashima-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit back.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I was about to follow Mashima-kun, who disappeared behind the counter with a shopping bag in his hand, when Kaoru stopped me.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our kitchen is too small to accommodate two people. You are a sick girl, so please take it easy on yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to let you take care of me and cook for me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…What do you like about Kengo?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I spewed out my guts.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;W-What? No, w-why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be in such a rush, my ventilation fan is old and makes a ridiculously loud noise, so he won&#8217;t be able to hear you in the kitchen if you scream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know? How did you know that? No one has ever &#8230; found out, not even one person&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it right away, didn&#8217;t I? What is it? Who&#8217;s an old woman, huh?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Aside from Kaoru-san&#8217;s rhetorical questioning, I wonder if I&#8217;m quite easy to understand.</p>
<p>Now, if there was a hole here, I would like to crawl in it&#8230;!</p>
<p>&#8230;Anyway, there&#8217;s no way to get away with anything now that I&#8217;ve come this far.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8230; that kind of direct &#8230; open-mindedness&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hu-hu-hu!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Kaoru-san stirred me up and I immediately felt hot all over.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only met her for a few minutes, but what am I being made to say?</p>

<p>&#8220;Please be good to him! He&#8217;s my proud son, he would never like a strange woman, and there is no way that Saki-chan, who likes Kengo, is a strange woman! So no worries! Go out quickly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, is that right? Ehehe&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>The words &#8220;parent-approved&#8221; came to mind and my cheeks involuntarily loosened up.</p>
<p>&#8230; Hmm?</p>
</p>
<p>Did Kaoru-san just say something strange in the midst of all this &#8230;?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, it&#8217;s the easiest thing in the world to get him. It&#8217;s easy. It&#8217;s easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is that so? &#8230; Haha.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>For me, it&#8217;s like a stronghold that is difficult to attack and difficult to get rid of.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s amazing in many ways that Kaoru-san is able to say such a thing about Mashima-kun, who is like a son to her&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Saki-chan, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be fine, but as a senior in life, let me give you a little strategy for that guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A S-strategy!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I involuntarily leaned forward.</p>
</p>
<p>Even with the most powerful and invincible love guidebook, &#8220;Imamote&#8221;, what kind of strategy can I use on Mashima-kun, whom I still can&#8217;t find a clue to conquer!?</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy. Look him in the eyes and say what you want to say. He is a zero or one hundred kind of guy, so what you don&#8217;t put into words won&#8217;t be understood at all, but as long as you put it into words, he will accept everything you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230;Kaoru-san is a psychic in her own right, and in fact, she may have been able to predict everything from the very beginning&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Really, thank you for everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, no problem.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Kaoru-san said jokingly and got up from her seat with a ballpoint pen tucked over her ear.</p>
<p>…Now that I think about it, Kaoru-san may have always been concerned about me and treated me in such a casual manner.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m already sleepy for real, so I&#8217;m going to go sleep until it&#8217;s time for work&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want some &#8230; rubber? I have one that my ex-boyfriend left&#8230; Ah, no, you don&#8217;t need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…What do you mean!!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I snapped at someone.</p>
<p>Seeing me angry, Kaoru-san laughed like a devil, &#8220;Heeheehee&#8230;&#8221; and left the snack bar like the wind.</p>
<p>&#8230;I take back my previous comment.</p>
<p>I knew it. After all, I have a feeling that she is usually in that kind of mood&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; You&#8217;ve gotten to know my sister pretty well in such a short time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi-yaaaa!?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I heard Mashima-kun&#8217;s voice coming from right behind me, even though he was supposed to be in the kitchen, and I screamed out loud.</p>
<p>I think I screamed for the rest of my life just today!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8230;ma&#8230; Mashima-kun, did you hear what we were talking about…?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;? No, I just got back from the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>My heart is still pounding loudly in my chest&#8230; It&#8217;s not good&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, lunch is ready, just a simple one.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Saying this, Mashima-kun brought a steaming bowl to the table.</p>
<p>The fragrance of the steam, a relaxing and appetizing aroma&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is it Ochazuke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Salmon Ochazuke. I&#8217;m sorry to be so impromptu, but here, take this.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun handed me a spoon.</p>
<p>How can he be so kind to people, no matter what?</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t even keep my promise to the person I love, I&#8217;m &#8230; pathetic &#8230;</p>
<p>His kindness touches me, and once again an uncontrollable self-loathing swelled up inside me.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have lunch while we&#8217;re at it. I&#8217;ll sit here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really &#8230; sorry about today.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>When I said it again, my eyes immediately started to burn.</p>
<p>Oh, my emotions, again, are no good.</p>
<p>I am especially bad today.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want Mashima-kun to see me like this.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I made a promise to you and&#8230; I said it out loud and I didn&#8217;t keep it&#8230; I lied and lied again. I&#8217;m sorry, really, I&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun never lies.</p>
<p>I lied to such a Mashima-kun.</p>
<p>I have betrayed his praise…</p>
<p>And yet&#8230; and yet, he continued&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;…What could be more important than your physical condition?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Looking me straight in the eyes, as if it were the only truth in the world.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard more than enough apologies, I&#8217;m not angry at all, the shopping trip is complete, and that&#8217;s the end of it.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>He said it once and for all.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230; Ah, I&#8217;m still no match for him.</p>
<p>I chanted a small &#8220;Itadakimasu&#8221; and took a scoop and slowly brought it to my mouth.</p>
<p>The aroma of the brown rice whetted my appetite, and the thick, salty salmon melted in my mouth.</p>
<p>It was warm and gentle, a taste that made me feel relaxed from the inside out.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230; I had my first non-instant Ochazuke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rice was, of course, Niigata-grown Koshihikari rice, so how could it not be good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a bit much?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8230; No, no, no.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the best in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must really like to cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I can call it cooking, but my sister&#8230; aunt loves to cook, and she taught me most of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, I brewed some Kamimura tea, and since it&#8217;s served lukewarm, the sweetness is enhanced and it&#8217;s delicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Do you like tea as well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not very proud of it, but I have the first level of the Japanese Tea Proficiency. Eventually, my goal is to become a Japanese Tea Instructor.&#8221;</p>
<p>(TLN: This is a real thing btw I had to check…)</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about all that, but it sounds impressive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not there yet.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>He looked somewhat proud as he said this.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I picked up the teacup and sipped the clear green tea.</p>
<p>Like young leaves sprouting in early summer, a fresh, lush, sweet aroma wafted through my nose, and I suddenly thought, &#8220;I still don&#8217;t know anything about Mashima-kun.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Mashima-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I want to talk with Mashima-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We always do that at school, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to talk about that. I want to get to know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun seemed unusually puzzled.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;My life story isn&#8217;t interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything you want to talk about, anything you like, anything you remember from the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not very good at talking about myself to begin with&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>He looked me in the eyes and seemed to hesitate about something, but after a moment&#8217;s pondering.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; No, it&#8217;s nothing. Yes, it would be helpful if you could put it in the form of questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, first question, what is your favorite food?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like a sweet called Bandai Taiko, a famous Niigata sweet made by Osakaya. New flavors such as strawberry, pear, lemon, and mango are only available seasonally, but I have never eaten anything other than the plain ones. I think the standard is supreme in everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your favorite TV program?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I watch mostly NHK, and I like animal documentaries. I like the inorganic manner in which they mechanically lay out only the facts, without any preachy subjectivity. For the same reason, I also like reading illustrated books. When I was a child, I spent a lot of time at the library reading them all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You look good in casual clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This? Yesterday I had Tatsuki Iwasawa and Kawariku Arakawa accompany me to choose. Shirt, pants, and sneakers, as simple a design as possible and made of the best materials. They are comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What temperature do you take your bath at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;40 degrees&#8230; Hey, is this really fun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Interesting, yes.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>I looked him straight and said emphatically. Mashima-kun locked eyes with me for a moment, and then, as if defeated.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Okay, what&#8217;s next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right&#8230; then.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>We talked about many things.</p>
<p>Where would you like to travel?</p>
<p>What is your favorite season?</p>
<p>What was the first book you read?</p>
<p>Well, basically I asked the questions and Mashima-kun just answered them&#8230;</p>
<p>Even so, I was enjoying this time.</p>
<p>Rumors at school, the eyes of others, the psychology of love, and so forth&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the time I spent exchanging words with Mashima-kun in this small space alone with him, far away from such various things.</p>
<p>I even wished that this time would continue forever.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your favorite song?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>And when I asked him a question for what seemed like the millionth time&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Favorite song.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>For the first time, Mashima-kun was at a loss for an answer.</p>
<p>He had been able to answer any question without hesitation, but suddenly he became silent.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Please wait here for a moment.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Mashima-kun abruptly got up from his seat and walked straight to the counter.</p>
<p>Then, using a touch pen on what looked like a thick tablet that was propped up.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know this song?&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>As if on cue, the screen of the TV mounted on a very high position switched to a different display.</p>
<p>The title of a song was displayed on the screen.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know &#8230;!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>It was a long, long time ago, probably when I was in kindergarten.</p>
<p>This is a song that was played on a children&#8217;s music program&#8230; a five-minute animation and music show for children in the evening&#8230;</p>
<p>It was so popular that it became a social phenomenon when it was featured on this program at the time&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow!!! I miss those days!&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>The animation on the TV was just as it was back then, and I was so thrilled!</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;I honestly don&#8217;t know&#8230; what the popular songs of the day are, but this one left a lasting impression on me.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Saying this, Mashima-kun pulled something out from under the TV.</p>
<p>It was two microphones.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, my sister used to sing to me here. For me, who was always crying, over and over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were crying &#8230;? Mashima-kun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a time when I was like that, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mashima-kun held out one end of the microphone to me.</p>
<p>Finally, I realized that this was &#8220;karaoke&#8221;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, what&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I turned on the microphone, do you remember the lyrics?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somehow &#8230;. no! Can we sing without permission!?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe, but this is a snack bar!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any payment or anything&#8230;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;As long as no one finds out, it&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe my ears when Mashima-kun replied in such an uncharacteristic manner.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t comprehend the meaning of his words and froze like an ornament.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Look, the intro is almost over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mashima-kun&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh heavens.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>And then I looked at him.</p>
<p>And then I looked at him.</p>
<p>And then I saw Mashima-kun looking back at me,</p>
<p>He looked back at me with a playfully mischievous smile,</p>
<p>A shy smile on his face,</p>
<p>I saw that face.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Even I&#8217;m embarrassed to sing nursery rhymes by myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was the first time I saw this side of the person I had a secret crush on.</p>
<p>I was so shocked that I was in a daze for a while, and I started the duet with Mashima-kun from the second verse.</p>
<p>I am sure that Mashima-kun has many more aspects that I don&#8217;t know about him.</p>
<p>And every time I see one of them, I will like him more and more.</p>
<p>&#8230;By the way, this is an aside, but it seems that neither Mashima-kun nor I are very good singers&#8230;</p>
<p>I ended up chatting with Mashima-kun until 6:00 p.m., the opening time of &#8220;Leo&#8221;.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t notice it when I was inside the windowless bar, but when I went outside, the sky over Kamimura was tinged with a light purple color.</p>
<p>It was dusk, the magic hour, the so-called &#8220;twilight hour&#8221;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much for your time today, Mashima-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mashima-kun, walking next to me on the sunset-colored road home, replied.</p>
<p>At first, I declined, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m fine to go out of the bar alone.&#8221; but Mashima-kun said, &#8220;I&#8217;m concerned about you because you&#8217;re sick, so I&#8217;m going to walk you home.&#8221; so I took him up on his offer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;I would appreciate it if you could pass on my thanks to Kaoru-san as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll let her know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really enjoyed myself today&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t thank Mashima-kun enough.</p>
<p>After all, the worst day of my life turned into the best day of my life.</p>
<p>&#8230;It really was a dream come true.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;We just chit-chatted and sang one song, but I&#8217;m glad you enjoyed it. Speaking of which, your shopping trip?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, uh, &#8230; it&#8217;s okay, I suddenly didn&#8217;t need &#8230; anything.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The truth was, there was nothing I really wanted, and if I could go on a shopping date with Mashima-kun today, I was going to buy a lip balm that I saw at random,</p>
<p>I could never say that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, that&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8230; I look up at Mashima&#8217;s face, trying not to be noticed.</p>
<p>Strong-willed, narrow eyes.</p>
<p>The crease between the eyebrows.</p>
<p>The serious expression on his face.</p>
<p>The smooth forehead peeking out from the center parted bangs.</p>
<p>And up close, the eyelashes are surprisingly long.</p>
<p>I could list them one by one, and then I lost count again.</p>
<p>Today, I am convinced.</p>
<p>I like Mashima-kun.</p>
<p>More than anyone else in the world, I am sure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;The days are getting much longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230;, yes, they are.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was so nervous; I was in a daze.</p>
<p>Because the words &#8220;twilight effect&#8221; had been dancing in my head for a long time.</p>
<p>The twilight twilight effect&#8230; human thinking and judgment are at their slowest around 6:00 p.m&#8230;</p>
<p>In other words, now is the time when confessions are most likely to succeed&#8230;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I gulped.</p>
<p>Do I confess&#8230;!? I am&#8230;!?</p>
<p>No, but Imamote said the best time to do it is at dinner on the third date! Today is only our first date! I doubt that it was even a date in the first place!</p>
<p>&#8230; But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever have a better time than this again,&#8230; I feel like I&#8217;ve grown closer to Mashima-kun over the course of today, and I even greeted his aunt one step ahead of schedule&#8230;</p>
<p>And now&#8230; things are kind of going well!</p>
<p>I was walking next to Mashima-kun, and I&#8217;m sure from the outside I looked like my usual unsociable self, but on the inside I resembled a storm.</p>
<p>My head was like a boiling pot, my heart was beating fast, and my knees were shaking without control!</p>
<p>My heart would spill out of my mouth the moment I uttered a single word, let alone a confession!</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I was walking calmly, somehow trying not to be noticed, I caught sight of Mashima-kun&#8217;s left hand swinging like a pendulum.</p>
<p>It was a man&#8217;s hand, bony and veiny.</p>
<p>(TLN: Bony and veiny?? Hah???)</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>…Even I, timid and shy, can&#8217;t say a single word.</p>
<p>…If it was an action.</p>
<p>…Maybe I could do it&#8230;?</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;…!&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I clenched my fists once and then slowly extended my hand.</p>
<p>The sound of my heartbeat becomes so loud that I could hear it right next to me.</p>
<p>How would Mashima-kun react if I held his hand?</p>
<p>I am so scared. If he shakes me off, I am sure that I will never recover.</p>
<p>But even knowing that, I still mustered up the courage to do it,</p>
<p>Ignore Imamote&#8217;s teachings for once,</p>
<p>I reached out with my hand&#8230;,</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s one of our students in the jersey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hic!?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I reflexively hid behind Mashima-kun as he said this just as our fingers were about to touch each other.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they were walking on the opposite sidewalk and didn&#8217;t notice us, but passed by while chatting and laughing&#8230;</p>
<p>The timing was too bad! I summoned all the courage I had!</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;I-I was surprised&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The words, which came out with a resigned sigh, did not mean anything more than that.</p>
<p>But I wonder why.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mashima-kun took one look at me with a somewhat sad look in his eyes&#8230;</p>
<p>Once again, he turned his gaze in the direction he was going and said a few words.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; You don&#8217;t want to be seen with me after all, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s meet and talk for the last time.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t understand, I couldn&#8217;t keep up.</p>
<p>My mind just went blank and I stopped right there.</p>
<p>The only words that came out were,</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Why?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>That was all.</p>
<p>Mashima-kun also stopped.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ve been thinking about it all day.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But he doesn&#8217;t look at me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I was worried about you until you showed up at the meeting place, so I contacted quite a few people, mainly students of Kamimura High School, to see if they knew anything about Saki Takane. Not only that, but I ran from the station carrying you on my back.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>That&#8217;s something I really &#8230; appreciate from the bottom of my heart,</p>
<p>Why do you sound so sad, Mashima-kun?</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Kamimura is small,&#8230; and in fact, several Kamimura High School students saw us while I was carrying you into Leo. By the end of the week, you might be the subject of rumors at school.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well, sure, that might be embarrassing.</p>
<p>If Mashima-kun says he doesn&#8217;t want such rumors to be spread, I will apologize to Mashima-kun as many times as I can, and I will correct the rumors that have been spread by talking to each of them personally.</p>
<p>But then, why?</p>
<p>Mashima-kun is so&#8230;</p>
<p>Sad&#8230;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in love with someone else. You don&#8217;t want any rumors about us to get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>………?</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know who it is, but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be fine. You have a beautiful appearance, excellent grades, good character, warmth and softness, and a strong sense of compliance with the guidelines&#8230; I&#8217;m sure that your charm will be conveyed to the other person.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Blank.</p>
<p>Blank.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m ashamed to admit that I&#8217;ve never been in a relationship. There must be someone better qualified to consult with you.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Blank.</p>
<p>Blank.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8221; If you still want to talk to me, please contact me&#8230;. Yes, on MINE. No, I can consult with you now if you want. I don&#8217;t think I can give you much advice&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Blank.</p>
<p>Blank.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that would be good. Just for reference I&#8217;d like to ask you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of person is the person that Takane Saki has feelings for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;That moment.</p>
<p>In a world that seemed endless and blank,</p>
<p>Something violently colorful,</p>
<p>Something burst,</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;16 years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same age as us, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Standing 175 centimeters tall, weighing in at 62 kilograms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;? That&#8217;s a very specific number.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blood type A. Birthday is May 3rd, Constitution Day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…Yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has center parted bangs that don&#8217;t reach her eyes, long lashes, straight eyebrows that are well groomed, deep creases between the eyebrows, a straight nose, and thin lips.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230; Saki Takane? What are you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…He carries his student handbook with him at all times and can recite the school rules and school anthem by heart. He also has the ability to memorize people&#8217;s names and birthdays in one go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A conservative personality, he values discipline and tradition, but he is not a fan of the new and novel, and is reluctant to change. However, he is not negative, and is flexible enough to accept change if he finds it good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially in Japanese tea, he holds the first level of the Japanese tea ceremony certification. His dream is to become a Japanese tea instructor in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His favorite food is Niigata&#8217;s famous sweets, Bandai Taiko, and he only eats plain food. He doesn&#8217;t add any toppings to his beef bowl, and he takes a bath at exactly 40 degrees Celsius. He is not the adventurous type.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He only watches NHK TV and likes animal documentaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He punishes others harshly for their mistakes, but he never dismisses their character. Everyone knows this, but he has a twisted side that considers himself unlikable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;During lunch break, he usually eats his lunch alone on the staircase in front of the rooftop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a person who notices other people really well, but when it comes to himself, he&#8217;s devastatingly dull.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;If I didn&#8217;t go so far as to say&#8230;, wouldn&#8217;t you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;……You.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; It&#8217;s you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, you, you, you, you, you, you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;How could there be anyone else but you!?!?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>My voice echoed through the gap between day and night in Kamimura.</p>
<p>There was no one else in the world but me and Mashima-kun.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;The reason I was late today was because I was so happy to be able to talk on MINE with Mashima-kun that I couldn&#8217;t sleep!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went out of my way to find Mashima-kun because I wanted to have lunch with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cried in front of Mashima-kun because I was worried that you might think I was weird!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In short.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In short&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>(Illustration: I like you!!&#8221;)</p>
<p>After I let out every single thing in my heart, a deep silence fell around us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Hah &#8230;&#8230; hah &#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I let my shoulders move up and down, turning the steam that was turning my head white inside out into a hot breath, and exhaled it onto the asphalt ground.</p>
<p>And after I repeated it a few times&#8230;,</p>
<p>Suddenly, I snapped back to myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;?!&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I looked up and saw it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never seen that expression on Mashima-kun&#8217;s face before&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230; Sorry&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what his intention was in saying those words.</p>
<p>But as soon as I heard those words, hot drops of water spilled from my eyes and hit the asphalt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!!&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8230;From there, I don&#8217;t remember anymore. I ran home in a grueling way, not caring if anyone saw me&#8230;</p>
<p>I found myself crying under the covers.</p>
<p>And like a fool, I kept crying until dawn.</p>
<p>The young-leaf-colored one-piece dress I had gone to the trouble of buying became wrinkled in just one day.</p>
