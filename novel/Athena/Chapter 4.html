<h2>Chapter 4: Stream After the Punishment</h2>


<h2 style="text-align: center">Just Like You Did for Me 1</h2>
<p>“Baseballs and tennis balls were fine, but soccer balls are no good, huh.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about, Kuuya?”</p>
<p>“Recently, balls keep flying at me.”</p>
<p>As I said this, Yuuji chuckled, saying, “What kind of season is this?”</p>
<p>We’re in the school’s infirmary, and it’s already July.</p>
<p>The air conditioning is cool, but my head is too dizzy to fully appreciate it.</p>
<p>“The nurse isn’t coming, huh… You okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, I’m fine. Sorry, Yuuji, for making you bring me here.”</p>
<p>“No problem, just treat me to a full-course Chinese meal later.”</p>
<p>“That’s a hefty price tag, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Lying on the bed, I chat with Yuuji, who’s sitting beside me, but outside the window, our classmates are energetically playing soccer in their PE class. Just a little while ago, both Yuuji and I were out there with them.</p>
<p>“Direct hit to the face with a ball, huh? You were totally zoning out, man. Didn’t even try to dodge. What were you doing?”</p>
<p>“The sky was beautiful. I was just staring at it.”</p>
<p>Saying it out loud makes me want to sigh at my own stupidity, but it’s the accurate and honest answer.</p>
<p>Yuuji, who knows me well, didn’t laugh.</p>
<p>“Did you see something?”</p>
<p>“I did… It really was beautiful. The clouds spreading across the blue sky, changing colors here and there… as if they were tired of staying white and testing what colors could compete with the blue of the sky… It was incredibly beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Man, that’s talent…”</p>
<p>Yuuji said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>My view of the world sometimes becomes different from reality. The colors and shapes of real things mysteriously change, becoming incredibly beautiful, ugly, lovely, or terrifying.</p>
<p>And with those visions deeply imprinted in my heart, entwined with several prayers, I paint.</p>
<p>“But thanks to that, I ended up trapping the ball with my face. Knocked me out for a moment.”</p>
<p>“It looked painful, even from a distance. Lucky your nose is okay.”</p>
<p>“Lucky indeed. But Yuuji, you can head back now. Thanks, man.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, well, yeah.”</p>
<p>“…? What’s up?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to report something.”</p>
<p>“What, getting formal now? Is it about your girlfriend again?”</p>
<p>Since mid-June, he had been dating someone he had feelings for since our first year. Yuuji always seemed so happy—</p>
<p>“We broke up.”</p>
<p>I was expecting another love-dovey story.</p>
<p>“…Eh?”</p>
<p>“More like, I got dumped! That was quick, huh? Haha.”</p>
<p>“…Oh, I see.”</p>
<p>I want to punch myself for not coming up with something better to say. There’s got to be more than such a dumbfounded reaction.</p>
<p>“I’ve been buried in club activities on weekends and after school, right? Even though we started dating, she said it was too much for her. With summer break coming up… she didn’t want a boyfriend who’s always busy with club activities… When she said that—! There’s nothing I could say!”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Kuuya, you helped me out and I consulted with you, so I wanted to tell you properly. Sorry to drop this on you when you’re feeling dizzy.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, no worries.”</p>
<p>He seemed to need a moment alone to talk about this, away from everyone else.</p>
<p>Yuuji, explaining all this, maintained his usual bright and likable smile throughout. Anyone could tell it didn’t fully reflect his inner feelings.</p>
<p>He’s always been that kind of guy.</p>
<p>“I see… that’s how it is.”</p>
<p>Though I knew he wanted me to smile, I couldn’t manage it for my dear friend.</p>
<p>After a brief silence, Yuuji spoke up.</p>
<p>“Also, I wanted to thank Kuuya.”</p>
<p>“For what? I didn’t…”</p>
<p>“No, not for the ‘she’s into you’ advice—though I’m grateful for that too, but not that. After I got dumped, I went to see your painting in the art prep room.”</p>
<p>“…My painting?”</p>
<p>“I knew some people visit your paintings when they’re anxious or down, so I thought, ‘Is it my turn now!?’ And man, it’s funny, but… I cried a bit.”</p>
<p>Yuuji continued, somewhat bashfully.</p>
<p>“Your paintings are amazing, I’ve always thought so, but at that moment, really, truly… It’s like… imagine going to the hospital, right? Say your leg hurts like crazy, and you want it fixed, right?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>“But if the doctor says, ‘Ah, it doesn’t seem that painful,’ or ‘There’s nothing particularly wrong here,’ it’s super frustrating, right? Like, ‘Understand my pain! It hurts!’ I’m going through something significant here!”</p>
<p>That feeling is familiar to me, as hospitals are a part of my life. I nod deeply in understanding.</p>
<p>“But on the flip side, when they say, ‘Ah, this must hurt,’ or ‘This must have been hard for you…,’ even though the pain hasn’t lessened, it feels like you’re halfway healed. It’s like your feelings are saved, lifted.”</p>
<p>“I get it, I really do.”</p>
<p>“Right! So, your painting is like that.”</p>
<p>Yuuji says, carefully weaving his feelings into his words.</p>
<p>“It’s like it understands, ‘It’s tough, it’s lonely, it’s scary.’ Looking at it, I feel like, ‘Ah, my tough feelings are drawn here.’ And that’s such a relief.”</p>
<p>Yuuji told me he cried looking at my painting.</p>
<p>But now, I’m the one on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>“I thought I knew your painting was amazing, but now I truly understand its significance. Your paintings have protected many people, just like they did for me.”</p>
<p>Saying this, he’s saving me without realizing it, always wearing his kindly smile.</p>
<p>“And I thought, even though my girlfriend dumped me, I have such an amazing friend. ‘I’ll go to school tomorrow with pride,’ I thought. So, I wanted to thank you today.”</p>
<p>“…So, we’re square on the full-course Chinese meal?”</p>
<p>I finally manage a smile and tease him, to which Yuuji also smiles.</p>
<p>“Fine, fine, I’ll let it slide just this once.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe, you’re special! …Alright, I’m heading out. …Kinda got all talkative there, huh! Turned into ‘Storytelling Yuuji.'”</p>
<p>Standing up from the chair and heading towards the door, I call out to Yuuji.</p>
<p>“…Yuuji! Hey, …I’ll paint even better paintings! I’ll create something amazing! So, come see them again.”</p>
<p>“You saying that like you expect me to get dumped again?”</p>
<p>“There are girls out there who can’t see what’s in front of them. You didn’t know that?”</p>
<p>“…What, Kuuya~, you love me that much~?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, you idiot.”</p>
<p>“Hehehehe~”</p>
<p>Leaving behind his laughter, Yuuji exits the infirmary.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Would Yuuji be happy if I painted the scene I saw today?</p>
<p>Could I heal my friend, even just a little, who spoke of the whole situation with a smile, his voice wavering slightly here and there?</p>
<p>“…But, …damn.”</p>
<p>I can’t paint today’s scene without red. It’s an absolutely essential color.</p>
<p>“I need to become stronger…”</p>
<p>I believe in painting. There was a time I cursed it. But painting also saved me.</p>
<p>It may just be a painting. But if it can save someone, then it’s worth risking my life for.</p>
<p>I clench my right fist tightly with my left hand. My nails dig in, and blood seeps out.</p>
<p>The red color oozes out.</p>


<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>“Huh, what…?”</p>
<p>The chime rang several times, and even when it was time for the next lesson after physical education had ended, the teacher hadn’t come to the infirmary.</p>
<p>Instead, the person who appeared was the one sitting closest to me in the classroom.</p>
<p>“Kujo-san, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“…I suddenly felt very unwell.”</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it. Saying so, she entered the room and sat on the bed next to mine.</p>
<p>“…Are you okay not lying down?”</p>
<p>“I got better after coming to this room, as expected of the infirmary. It’s filled with healing powers.”</p>
<p>“That’s an overestimation.”</p>
<p>Kujo-san, who placed her full trust in the infirmary, didn’t seem to be particularly unwell.</p>
<p>“…I heard you were hit by a ball.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I didn’t know soccer balls were that hard.”</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>My head is slightly dizzy, and I feel a bit off balance, so I can’t return to the classroom yet, but it shouldn’t be a big deal.</p>
<p>“I’ll go back to the classroom after the afternoon classes.”</p>
<p>It’s the fourth period now, and lunch break is next. I should be okay after resting for that long.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the infirmary teacher will come by then.</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Kujo-san stared intently at my face. What’s wrong?</p>
<p>“Is there something on me? Ah, I don’t think I have a nosebleed.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that, …earlier the ‘stress value’ was…”</p>
<p>“‘Stress value’?”</p>
<p>“Never mind, never mind, it’s nothing, it’s nothing. So, in short, you seem a bit down.”</p>
<p>Kujo-san spoke quickly, and I laughed while hiding my right hand that was oozing blood.</p>
<p>“I’m fine, but thank you.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like…”</p>
<p>──Did Kujo-san come to the infirmary worried about me?</p>
<p>It feels a bit self-conscious to think that, but still, the color I see from her made me think so.</p>
<p>“…It’s nice weather.”</p>
<p>Breaking the brief silence, Kujo-san said that while looking outside the window.</p>
<p>Holding the dense light of summer in her eyes, she adjusted her slightly reddish hair with her hand, always seeming like some kind of joke.</p>
<p>An unreal beauty.</p>
<p>I remember clearly being completely captivated the first time I saw her. When Kujo-san suddenly appeared in the art room, I thought God had shown me an illusion.</p>
<p>This is what is referred to as beauty.</p>
<p>If there’s something even slightly comparable, aim to paint it.</p>
<p>That’s what I thought, absent-mindedly.</p>
<p>“…It’s beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Yes, the sky is very beautiful. It’s definitely summer. Will you paint a sky next?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. …I do paint skies from time to time. I like them. My name has ‘Sora’ in it, after all.” (tln : Kanji for Kuuya has Sora in it)</p>
<p>“I see, that makes sense.”</p>
<p>Kujo-san, whose name carries the character for ‘red,’ smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Being alone in the room with her, it’s hard not to be conscious of the color I see from her. It’s a constant feeling like walking on thin ice.</p>
<p>I’m scared of love. The past, where something important was taken from me, remains cold and silent, always by my side.</p>
<p>I think I shouldn’t get close to Kujo-san. I don’t know when my body and heart might start to feel unbearably cold again.</p>
<p>Being together in fear would be disrespectful to her.</p>
<p>“Does your name come from the sky, Miyashiro-kun?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s more from being empty. Like an empty canvas that hasn’t been painted on, that’s the naming sense. Both my parents were painters.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s nice.”</p>
<p>Talking about my parents will always be an open wound for me. Even having this conversation is pushing it. I’m aware I’m crossing a dangerous bridge.</p>
<p>“What are your parents like, Kujo-san?”</p>
<p>“Normal, completely normal. Even if you take the average, median, or mode of all Japan, I feel like families like mine would come up. I often hear, ‘How did a daughter like you come from us?'”</p>
<p>But, talking with Kujo-san was enjoyable. Her spirited way of speaking and the mountain of words and knowledge she brought up.</p>
<p>Her intellect shines as brightly as her appearance. I liked that. So, I ended up talking.</p>
<p>What I should do or what I want to do, I’ve become unsure.</p>
<p>While talking with Kujo-san, the fourth period had ended.</p>
<p>“Hm, did someone come?”</p>
<p>“Seems like it.”</p>
<p>And right as lunch break started, there was a knock on the infirmary door.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me…! Ku-Kuuya…!”</p>
<p>When I answered, the one who entered was Suika with a pale face.</p>
<p>“Suika! That face, are you feeling unwell… Ah, no, that’s not it. Did you come for me?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Are, are you okay!? Does it hurt!?”</p>
<p>Suika rushed over with incredible speed, yet her actions were graceful. She then sat on the chair between me and Kujo-san’s beds, leaning forward to look at my face.</p>
<p>Her expression was so worried it made me feel guilty.</p>
<p>“The ball hit your face, and you fell down and were brought here to the infirmary…”</p>
<p>“I’m okay, just a bit dizzy.”</p>
<p>Even as I said that, Suika looked like she was about to cry.</p>
<p>“I can’t trust the ‘I’m okay’ that Kuuya says about himself…”</p>
<p>“That’s not…”</p>
<p>I wanted to deny it outright, but I couldn’t, knowing there were many instances where Suika’s words couldn’t be discounted.</p>
<p>“Ku-Kuuya, I have a good idea! Let’s ban soccer from this town…”</p>
<p>“No, no, no, it’s my fault for being distracted.”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, sorry, it’s my bad habit. Um, um, then…”</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and corrected herself.</p>
<p>“Let’s ban soccer from this world…”</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect you to scale it up, not what I had in mind.”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, then let’s do this! Archery!”</p>
<p>“Archery?”</p>
<p>“When you’re having PE, I’ll stand a little away with a bow and arrow! If a ball looks like it’s going to hit you, I’ll shoot it down! This is a brilliant idea!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, thank you, Suika. I’m really happy about your feelings. But let’s not.”</p>
<p>“Are, are you doubting my skills!?”</p>
<p>“I’m not worried about that at all, it’s everything else. Like the law.”</p>
<p>After such an exchange, Suika finally calmed down.</p>
<p>“…Um, isn’t the infirmary teacher here?”</p>
<p>“Seems like they haven’t come yet. But I’m feeling much better, so it’s okay. I’m planning to go back to the classroom after lunch.”</p>
<p>“Uu… are you really okay? Really?”</p>
<p>“I even have an appetite, so I’m mostly healed.”</p>
<p>“…Then it’s okay, but if you feel any discomfort, please tell me immediately…”</p>
<p>She said, gripping my sleeve tightly. I always seem to worry her.</p>
<p>“…By the way, Kuuya”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Could it be, is there something else? …You look a little down.”</p>
<p>Suika is incredibly sharp when it comes to matters about me. But, this is something I can’t talk about.</p>
<p>“Nothing in particular.”</p>
<p>“…Is that so.”</p>
<p>She might not be convinced, but she didn’t pry further. That distance was comforting for me.</p>
<p>“That’s right, if you have an appetite, let’s have lunch, Kuuya. Eating and drinking are allowed in our infirmary! Some students sometimes eat lunch here with the infirmary teacher.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I should. Ah, but my bag is in the classroom.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ve got it covered!”</p>


<p>Or perhaps she’s trying to cheer me up, Suika smiles brightly. From under her feet, she lifts two bags into her hands. I had thought she was carrying something when she entered the room…</p>
<p>“I also picked up yours from the classroom! Hatsuse-senpai handed it to me.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, I’ll thank Yuuji later. Let’s eat at that table.”</p>
<p>It seems I’m already okay</p>
<p>I slowly getting off the bed and standing on the floor.</p>
<p>“You seem fine, that’s good.”</p>
<p>Kujo-san, still seated on the adjacent bed, said that with a smile.</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry Kujo-san, for making noise over here.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Kujo-senpai…! Ah, if senpai is here, perhaps we should eat somewhere else. We’ll be too noisy.”</p>
<p>“No, don’t mind me.”</p>
<p>Kujo-san gracefully got off the bed and left the infirmary.</p>
<p>It felt like we had driven her out. I had done something terrible.</p>
<p>“…Could you apologize to her later?”</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>After such a conversation, the two of us sat opposite each other at the table, spreading out our lunch boxes.</p>
<p>Suika’s was homemade too, as was mine, sort of. I just packed leftovers from dinner.</p>
<p>“…Kuuya.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it.”</p>
<p>“No, I have to say this! This is important! You go to school every day, do household chores, draw pictures, you’re really admirable, Kuuya. But, because of that… there are things you can’t do. …Let’s stop with the cooking…!”</p>
<p>“Is it that bad?”</p>
<p>“It’s two-toned…! White rice or the black of burnt side dishes! Monochrome…!”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, maybe.”</p>
<p>I had gotten used to it, so it didn’t bother me much. Well, of course, it’s not delicious.</p>
<p>“When I eat it in class, everyone says, ‘Let’s exchange side dishes!’ Probably that’s…”</p>
<p>“Your friends are all such nice people… Then, today I will…”</p>
<p>“Ah, hold on.”</p>
<p>Suika swiftly swapped our lunch boxes entirely.</p>
<p>“Suika!”</p>
<p>“Maybe there’s not enough rice for a guy, let’s adjust the amount.”</p>
<p>“Hey hey hey, listen to me, Suika-chan.”</p>
<p>With astonishing skill, Suika adjusted the amount of white rice in both lunch boxes. Then, gracefully joining her hands, she said, “Let’s eat.”</p>
<p>“Are you really going to eat something that burnt?”</p>
<p>“The person who eats it every day says what? …Mmm.”</p>
<p>Biting into the burnt meat, Suika laughed. For some reason, her smile was very satisfied.</p>
<p>“I’m eating a side dish made by Kuuya.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s bad, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“What do you think? Hehe, …hehehe!”</p>
<p>Suika is a very kind, cute, and exceptional girl, but a bit odd.</p>
<p>I felt that trying to take back my (poorly made) lunch from her seemed like a terribly cruel act, so in the end, I said, “Let’s eat,” and started with the meal placed in front of me.</p>
<p>“…Delicious.”</p>
<p>Suika’s lunch was perfect in color, nutritional balance, and taste. Especially, the egg omelet was exquisite.</p>
<p>“Is that so? I’m glad…”</p>
<p>“No, really, it’s amazing. Feels like a luxury to be eating something this delicious at school.”</p>
<p>“My lunch isn’t anything grand… But, Kuuya.”</p>
<p>Turning towards me, Suika softly smiled, suddenly changing the topic.</p>
<p>“Let’s go on a trip during the summer break. You know about my father’s passion for photography, right? He’s found several places he wants to shoot, and he’s fully intent on taking you along.”</p>
<p>“I always feel bad joining you every year.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. There’s nothing bad about it. It’s the summer, after all, lots of fun is waiting for us. A new pool is opening in the next town, let’s go together. The movie you wanted to see is also showing.”</p>
<p>“That’s a lot.”</p>
<p>“Yes. …Eat lots of delicious things, see many beautiful things, and go to fun places.”</p>
<p>You will have more wonderful experiences than anyone else.</p>
<p>Suika said that very clearly.</p>
<p>“Because otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”</p>
<p>“Unfair?”</p>
<p>“You always draw such beautiful things, protecting someone’s heart. That’s a wonderful thing. So, in return, you must also have lots of wonderful experiences. Otherwise, it would be a lie.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I carefully exhale the breath I had been holding.</p>
<p>I say to the girl in front of me.</p>
<p>“Hey Suika, I’ve… never bought a lottery ticket.”</p>
<p>“…? Is that so? I’ve never heard you talk about buying one.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, because it won’t win. But I’ve already had luck better than winning the lottery.”</p>
<p>“…Eh?”</p>
<p>I tell Suika, who doesn’t get the point.</p>
<p>“After everything that happened back then, being able to live somewhat normally now, thanks to people like Daisuke-san , Ran-san, Kinue-sama, and especially more than anyone, thanks to Suika… Sometimes I think, if Suika wasn’t by my side, my life would have been pretty much over.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Im the luckiest guy to anyone, anywhere. I’m Suika’s childhood friend, right? You couldn’t replace that for five thousand trillion yen.”</p>
<p>There’s no falsehood or boasting, this is my honest feeling.</p>
<p>“So, if you’re talking about having wonderful experiences, I’m having plenty. Every day.”</p>
<p>“…Me.”</p>
<p>Suika, looking at me, …if I’m not mistaken, seems like she’s about to cry.</p>
<p>“Suika? Sorry, I said something weird…”</p>
<p>“No, no, …Kuuya, I am…”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/00018.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Suika bit her lip hard. It looked like she was holding back her words or trying to force them out.</p>
<p>“I am, I… am not the kind of girl Kuuya thinks I am──”</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>The infirmary door opened with a burst. The person who entered was someone who had just been here a little while ago.</p>
<p>“Kujo-san? What’s up, did you forget something?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She, Kujo-san, briskly approached us with her belongings in hand.</p>
<p>And then──sat down next to me and spread out her lunch on the table.</p>
<p>“…Kujo-san?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to eat here too.”</p>
<p>Word by word, clearly, Kujo-san declared.</p>
<p>I couldn’t keep up with the sudden turn of events, but Suika immediately spoke up.</p>
<p>“Kujo-senpai.”</p>
<p>Suika smiled.</p>
<p>“Thank you for worrying about Kuuya. But, I’m with him, so it’s okay.”</p>
<p>“That is”</p>
<p>With a certain firmness, Kujo-san replied to Suika.</p>
<p>“It’s not something for you to say anything about.”</p>
<p>“…Kujo-san?”</p>
<p>“Moreover, I don’t need to be thanked by you.”</p>
<p>Ignoring my call, Kujo-san smiled thinly at Suika and said that.</p>
<p>Eh, wait, this is…</p>
<p>The atmosphere became so tense it felt like it was piercing the skin.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for being presumptuous.”</p>
<p>Suika apologized smoothly, but really, even though she apologized, there wasn’t even a hint of her backing down.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Without a word, the two remained silent.</p>
<p>I accidently “saw” the colour they harbored for each other with my eyes.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>I catch my breath.</p>
<p>The haze that appeared bore the same color for both of them.</p>
<p>It was… the purple of hostility, lying between the red of affection and the blue of aversion.</p>
<p>“Kuuya, let’s continue with our meal. Was the omelet good?”</p>
<p>“W-what, Ah of course…”</p>
<p>“I’m glad, it’s my specialty! By the way, I think that fried dish over there turned out well too. I thought it might be a taste that men would like.”</p>
<p>Suika speaks in exactly the same tone as before Kujo-san appeared. Her expression, tone, and atmosphere, as if the previous scene was an illusion. It was an overwhelming display of self-control, making one feel accustomed to it.</p>
<p>“I see, yeah, it’s delicious.”</p>
<p>“Miyashiro-kun, but that alone might not be enough for you. How about this as well? Let’s exchange side dishes, like we always do in the classroom. No, but I don’t need anything in return, I eat little.”</p>
<p>Kujo-san, with an insistence that brooks no refusal, adds some of her side dishes into my (technically Suika’s) lunch box.</p>
<p>“Thank you… That helps.”</p>
<p>Incidentally, while it’s true that we often exchange side dishes in the classroom, Kujo-san has never participated in it.</p>
<p>After that, Suika only conversed with me, and Kujo-san did the same.</p>
<p>Honestly, I couldn’t really taste the food.</p>


<p>“Suika, it’s okay, really, Suika.”</p>
<p>“No, there’s always a possibility.”</p>
<p>After school. I’m walking home with Suika. Our house is just around the corner.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with my head that hit the ball (the school nurse came by around the end of lunch break and confirmed it was fine), so I went on drawing today as well.</p>
<p>Suika had waited for me, and now we’re walking home together.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing flying around in the middle of the town.”</p>
<p>“You never know what might happen…!”</p>
<p>Suika seems quite concerned about me being sent to the infirmary after being hit by a soccer ball.</p>
<p>She’s been on alert the whole way home.</p>
<p>“I’ll stop whatever comes our way, I swear on the name of Ado.”</p>
<p>“With Suika, it feels like even arrows or guns.”</p>
<p>“Guns would be tough after they’re fired… Good thing we’re in Japan.”</p>
<p>“…What about arrows?”</p>
<p>“I can catch those.”</p>
<p>I didn’t verify the truth or falsehood. I knew without asking; it wasn’t a lie.</p>
<p>Eventually, we reached my house. Thankfully, there were no flying objects on the way.</p>
<p>“Then, Suika. See you tomorrow… Oh, wait, tomorrow is Saturday.”</p>
<p>I really wanted to escort Suika to her house, as a man should, but unfortunately, doing so would result in Suika escorting me back to my house, creating an infinite loop.</p>
<p>When I consulted Daisuke-san about it, he advised, “I struggled with the same issue in the past, but with the level of weapons available in modern Japan, they can’t even scratch those people…” I can’t forget his distant gaze, he must have experienced a lot.</p>
<p>“…Um, Kuuya!”</p>
<p>“Hm, what?”</p>
<p>As I was about to open the front door, Suika called out to me with a serious tone.</p>
<p>“…Don’t push yourself today, just take a nice bath, have a good meal, and get a good night’s sleep.”</p>
<p>“What’s with you all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“Because, …you’ve been looking troubled… ever since you were in the infirmary bed.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I thought I was acting normally. But, it seems I can’t fool Suika’s eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing like that. But, thanks.”</p>
<p>“Please remember two things. You don’t have to push yourself anymore. And no matter who turns against you, I will always be on your side… Never forget that.”</p>
<p>Suika’s eyes shone even amidst the dim darkness.</p>
<p>“…Yeah, thanks.”</p>
<p>After thanking her once more, Suika, though seemingly hesitant, nodded. I watched her back as she headed home, then entered my house.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>An empty house.</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>I worried her so much, I should do as she said.</p>
<p>It’s summer, so I usually make do with showers, but today I filled the tub and took a bath. Then, I ate the awkwardly made dinner I prepared myself.</p>
<p>And without staying up late, I went straight to bed.</p>
<p>For tomorrow.</p>
<p>The next day.</p>
<p>I woke up and immediately changed out of my pajamas into my work clothes. The same overalls I use at home. Just like I do at school, for painting.</p>
<p>I opened the door to the first-floor studio.</p>
<p>Stepping in, I placed a new canvas on the easel.</p>
<p>I hadn’t primed it, but it’s okay. Today isn’t about finishing a perfect painting.</p>
<p>“…Huuuuh.”</p>
<p>I exhale and prepare the palette. And the tubes of paint that should go on it.</p>
<p>I pick up a tube labeled Cadmium Red.</p>
<p>Instantly, I felt a chill at my fingertips. That sad coldness seeps into my body.</p>
<p>Still, I slowly pinched the cap.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I think of Yuuji. My friend who said he was “protected” by my paintings.</p>
<p>Hey, but Yuuji. If I could use the color red, I could paint a better picture… A picture that protects more firmly.</p>
<p>So, that’s why.</p>
<p>Today, I am going to do it.</p>
<p>“…!!”</p>
<p>With all my heart, I motivate myself, warming up my chilling body.</p>
<p>Then, there was a click. The cap was open.</p>
<p>It was anticlimactic. There was no intense heartbeat or nausea.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I place the color on the palette. The red color. How many years has it been?</p>
<p>Mixing it with oil using a paintbrush, I then apply that color to the canvas.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>Pat, pat, pat. I paint. Following my heart’s direction, I keep painting.</p>
<p>“Ha Ha.”</p>
<p>Ah, how, how.</p>
<p>“Ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha… ha, ha.”</p>
<p>──How utterly empty this color is.</p>
<p>Red.</p>
<p>Vivid, flashy, eye-catching.</p>
<p>Yet, to me, it was just a cold, empty color. That’s how I felt, no matter what.</p>
<p>Nothing has changed.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah…”</p>
<p>I couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>“U, ah, ah…”</p>
<p>Tears shamefully started to fall.</p>
<p>“Uuuuuuuhhhhhhh…! …─Damn it, damn it, …f*ck!!”</p>
<p>My vision blurred, tears spilled over.</p>
<p>I knew it, even before trying. Such a color, I really can’t use it.</p>
<p>If it’s a beautiful color, I’m motivated. If it’s an ugly color, all the more reason.</p>
<p>But what about an empty color? How do I use a color that feels empty to me?</p>
<p>There are things I can’t paint without using it, and things I can paint if I use it, but my senses just perceive the color red as empty.</p>
<p>“U, uuuuuaaaaaahhhh…! …Sorry, sorry, sorry Yuuji…!”</p>
<p>I’m still a coward. Not the “amazing guy” you think I am.</p>
<p>“Ah, aaaaahhhhhh!!! F*ck! F*ck! …F*ck it!!!”</p>
<p>Mother.</p>
<p>Hey, mother.</p>
<p>“…Why did you!!”</p>
<p>Why did you, why did you.</p>
<p>Why did you leave us. Why did you leave dad.</p>
<p>Why.</p>
<p>──After curling up in the chair for a while, I eventually stood up and left the room.</p>
<p>And then, I decided to leave the house. There was one reason.</p>
<p>“…It’s cold.”</p>
<p>As I opened the front door, the high sun scorched my body. Without wearing a hat or anything, the exposure felt sharp.</p>
<p>That’s what I wanted, I wanted the heat.</p>
<p>“…It’s cold.”</p>
<p>But still, I felt terribly cold. The heat and warmth were utterly unfelt.</p>
<p>Ever since I touched the red paint, that coldness that seeped into my fingertips hasn’t left my body.</p>
<p>I stagger through the streets.</p>
<p>I don’t know where I’m heading. Along the way, my phone in my pocket vibrated. I tried to pick it up, but my chilled fingertips dropped it.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I have to pick it up.</p>
<p>Continuing to stagger, did I pick it up? …Did I? I can’t remember.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It’s cold. Cold, cold.</p>
<p>Cold.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p><strong>Kujo’s PoV</strong></p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>It was past noon when I, who was in my air-conditioned room at home, realized something odd.</p>
<p>“…Huh, why…”</p>
<p>After wrapping up my hobby programming at a good stopping point and wanting to energize myself, I launched the Miyashiro monitoring app.</p>
<p>Then, I noticed his “current location” was stuck in a strange place downtown and hadn’t moved at all.</p>
<p>“Hmm…?”</p>
<p>It was in the middle of the street. Looking at the data more closely, he had been in that spot for about two hours.</p>
<p>In this heat? Miyashiro-kun doesn’t play location-based games either…</p>
<p>“Ah, then…”</p>
<p>He must have dropped it. That’s probably it.</p>
<p>I have to retrieve it for him! Needless to say, that’s the best course of action here.</p>
<p>I quickly got ready and left the house.</p>
<p>Conveniently taking a bus that went nearby, I arrived at the spot in about twenty minutes.</p>
<p>“Found it, found it.”</p>
<p>Muttering to myself, I retrieved the smartphone. Mission complete. Truly, it was just lying by the side of a completely ordinary street.</p>
<p>Now, heading back home… what to do, maybe deliver it to his house? I know where he lives, of course, but that’s through illegitimate means, so he’d be shocked if I showed up.</p>
<p>What to do, what to do.</p>
<p>But I have to return it to him. For modern people, losing a smartphone is a major disaster.</p>
<p>Using the Miyashiro monitoring app, I tapped on “Stress Value.” Surely, it would show a high value…</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s impossible, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>The screen showed No Data. Of course, that makes sense.</p>
<p>This “Stress Value” is calculated from heart rate data measured by Miyashiro-kun’s smartwatch (by the way, it’s not a simple conversion where a faster heartbeat means higher stress and slower means lower stress… it’s a bit more complex calculation. For details, Google things like heart rate variability).</p>
<p>Miyashiro-kun’s smartwatch can’t connect to the internet on its own; it uses his nearby smartphone as a gateway for data communication. Therefore, since he has dropped his smartphone, his smartwatch isn’t connected to the net, and I can’t extract any data.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I somehow checked Miyashiro-kun’s “Stress Value”…</p>
<p>“…Eh?”</p>
<p>And saw the extremely high value recorded a few hours ago.</p>
<p>“…What is this?”</p>
<p>A high-level value that suggests significant autonomic nervous system disruption. Something must have happened.</p>
<p>Despite the heat, my body shivered as if in response.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Logically, it’s not that the stress came from dropping the smartphone. Something happened that caused stress, and then he went out into the city, dropping his smartphone there.</p>
<p>Maybe he was in a panic…?</p>
<p>“…Could it be?”</p>
<p>Something. Something bad might be happening.</p>
<p>Am I overthinking it?</p>
<p>Honestly, the stress value measurement using heart rate isn’t that accurate. It could be just a randomly high value…</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>My own smartphone vibrated. It was a call from my sister.</p>
<p>“…Hello?”</p>
<p>“Hey nee-chan? Are you outside by any chance? If so, could you buy me some ice cream?”</p>
<p>Her cheerful voice made such a request when I answered.</p>
<p>“…Hey, Touko.”</p>
<p>“Mint ice cream, mint ice cream, I really want mint ice cream… Ah, what?”</p>
<p>“Do you believe in a woman’s intuition?”</p>
<p>“Haa?”</p>
<p>I could hear my sister’s deep, deep sigh over the phone.</p>
<p>“Like, nee-chan, you’ve been a woman for seventeen years, right? Then you should know. Humanity hasn’t yet invented a sensor more accurate than a woman’s intuition.”</p>
<p>“…Right.”</p>
<p>“So, about the ice cream… are you listening, nee-chan?”</p>
<p>I cut off the call with a click. If I remember, I’ll buy the ice cream.</p>
<p>“…Huuuuuh.”</p>
<p>A woman’s intuition, huh.</p>
<p>Got it. …I’ll follow it now.</p>
<p>So, I made a call to a certain person.</p>
