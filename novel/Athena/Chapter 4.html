<h2>Chapter 4: Don’t Disturb My Heart</h2>


<p>「Kensuke, how about this? I think Himawari will like it.」</p>



<p>「Rejected. No matter how much Shishido likes manga and anime, wearing a T-shirt with a character printed on it on a date is a no-no.」</p>



<p>Hearing Kensuke’s harsh but reasonable opinion, Kamome says, “You’re right,” and returns the T-shirt he was holding back on the hanger rack.</p>



<p>After all, there are things that he, with his limited knowledge, wouldn’t understand, but with an objective perspective, it becomes clear.</p>



<p>It was truly appreciated.</p>



<p>Today, Kamome came to buy clothes together his best friend, Ojiya Kensuke.</p>



<p>On the date the other day, the outfit he chose compared to the other couples he saw… was a bit plain, or rather, lacked a certain stylishness, so he reflected on it and came here to carefully select clothes for going out.</p>



<p>Last time, it didn’t go well because he was alone.</p>



<p>That’s why this time, he asked Kensuke, who is experienced with women (and dating), to help and provide him proper advice.</p>



<p>In a large department store, the two are strolling through the floors crowded with apparel shops.</p>



<p>「Well, Kamome doesn’t have looks either.」</p>



<p>A clean white V-neck shirt and a thin jacket.</p>



<p>Kensuke, who was dressed in black slim pants and had a somewhat mature atmosphere for a high school student, said as he looked at the clothes on the hanger.</p>



<p>「You have a good physique, so as long as you’re dressed in a clean and fresh style, it should be fine, right? Look, like this one.」</p>



<p>「I see… I see…」</p>




<p>Kensuke puts the clothes he picked out at random into the shopping basket and Kamome obediently follows his lead.</p>



<p>In this way, after trying on a few of Kensuke’s choices, Kamome decides to buy the top and bottom set he liked best.</p>



<p>「Thanks for coming along with me today.」</p>



<p>After finishing their shopping, the two walked out of the building.</p>



<p>And Kamome thanks Kensuke.</p>



<p>「It’s fine, it’s fine. I bought some for myself too. Besides, when I’m with a girl, I have to be considerate, so I can’t look for myself like this.」</p>



<p>「But you properly picked out clothes for me, right?」</p>



<p>「Just randomly. Besides, I don’t have to be considerate when dealing with you.」</p>



<p>Saying that, Kensuke laughs.</p>



<p>Although he is often criticized by Misaki for his relationships with women, Kamome considers him a great best friend.</p>



<p>He claims to have relationships with multiple women, but strictly speaking, he doesn’t have an official girlfriend and only engages in casual dating, choosing partners who understand and accept that.</p>



<p>Misaki called him a fully automatic “shuraba” machine, but they haven’t heard of this actually happening.</p>



<p>In a sense, he is a man who lives by drawing properly a line on his own principles and beliefs.</p>



<p>「…So, anyway.」</p>



<p>There, Kensuke puts his arm around Kamome’s shoulder and whispers in a hushed voice.</p>



<p>「So, how did the other day date go? Did it go well?」</p>



<p>「Eh? Ah… Umn…」</p>


<p>To Kensuke who asks, Kamome shows a face that clearly suggests something happened.</p>



<p>「Like, you have a face that says there’s something bothering you. Well, if that weren’t the case, you wouldn’t have invited someone other than your girlfriend to come shopping like this. What’s up, what’s up, did you have a fight?」</p>



<p>「No, there was no particular problem between me and Himawari. Actually…」</p>



<p>There, Kamome tells Kensuke that he was followed by Suyu, Himawari’s older sister, suddenly kissed, had his picture taken and was threatened, and he had a terrible experience.</p>



<p>Furthermore, even before that, when he first met her again at her girlfriend’s house, he also detailed what she did to him.</p>



<p>「Fuun, that’s, well, very unfortunate.」</p>



<p>「…Why would she do something like that?」</p>



<p>Recalling that incident, Kamome gradually feels his emotions rising.</p>



<p>To the point of realizing that even for him it is rare to feel such emotions.</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s careless words and meaningless, malicious actions make him feel uneasy.</p>



<p>「She should know that I’m dating Himawari… And even though she has a boyfriend herself. I can’t believe it.」</p>



<p>Saying that, Kamome becomes indignant.</p>



<p>「Hmm, that’s right…」</p>



<p>Hearing Kamome’s story, Kensuke crosses his arms and ponders.</p>



<p>「Is she simply frustrated… Or maybe she became worried about whether she had any attractiveness as a woman.」</p>



<p>「Worried?」</p>



<p>「From what you just said, umn, Tsuyu-san has a boyfriend, right? Maybe things aren’t going well with that boyfriend.」</p>


<p>There, Kamome recalls what happened in the street the other day.</p>



<p>Tsuyu was arguing with a man who appeared to be her boyfriend.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>…I’m starting to get kind of worried.</p>



<p>Kamome’s expression turns stern.</p>



<p>「…Hey, Kamome.」</p>



<p>There, seeing Kamome’s expression, Kensuke speaks up.</p>



<p>「You, despite everything, you’re concerned about that Tsuyu-san after all, aren’t you?」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>「I think you’re still hanging onto your first love.」</p>



<p>「Na… There is no way!」</p>



<p>He tries to retort, but Kensuke stares at him intently with serious eyes.</p>



<p>Being met with such a gaze, Kamome once again falls into deep thought.</p>



<p>「…Do I really, about Tsuyu?」</p>



<p>Come to think of it, Kamome remembers where they are now.</p>



<p>This is the street where he had seen Tsuyu the other day.</p>



<p>Despite expressing anger towards Tsuyu in front of Himawari and Kensuke, could it be that by coming here like this, somewhere deep down he hopes to meet her again?</p>


<p>Is he subconsciously yearning for Tsuyu?</p>



<p>「No, that can’t be… hmm?」</p>



<p>While muttering, Kamome suddenly turned his gaze around.</p>



<p>There, he happens to see a familiar figure walking the sidewalk across the street.</p>



<p>Long, blond hair and slightly tanned skin.</p>



<p>Just like Tsuyu…</p>



<p>…Really, I’m starting to hate myself.</p>



<p>There’s no way such a coincidence could exist.</p>



<p>Seeing someone who resembles her and immediately thinking it’s her, it’s like a disease already──</p>



<p>「…Eh?」</p>



<p>No, it’s not a mistake.</p>



<p>It’s Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Without a doubt.</p>



<p>What’s more, that face ── her expression is distorted, as if she’s crying.</p>



<p>「What’s wrong? Kamome.」</p>



<p>Kensuke calls out to him, but his gaze follows Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Automatically, Kamome started running.</p>


<p>「Hey, Kamome!」</p>



<p>「Sorry! Thanks for today, Kensuke! See you later!」</p>



<p>「No, wait, what are you… That’s fast!」</p>



<p>Before Kensuke could call out to stop him, Kamome was running away from the place.</p>



<p>「As I recall, this way…」</p>



<p>Kamome chases after Tsuyu.</p>



<p>He spots a crosswalk, crosses the street, and runs in the direction she went.</p>



<p>Scanning the area as he goes.</p>



<p>「Ah!」</p>



<p>A little ahead, he spotted a familiar back.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu!」</p>



<p>「Eh…」</p>



<p>Hearing her name, she turns around.</p>



<p>He caught up with her.</p>



<p>Indeed, it was Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Turning around, Tsuyu realizes that the person who called out to her is Kamome and widens her eyes in surprise.</p>



<p>「…Why, are you.」</p>



<p>「It’s a coincidence.」</p>



<p>Kamome stares at Tsuyu’s face.</p>



<p>Her expression is back to normal now, but her eyes are still red.</p>



<p>「Were you crying?」</p>



<p>「…That’s none of your business.」</p>



<p>To Kamome questions, Tsuyu replies while averting her gaze.</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu, I have something to ask you.」</p>



<p>There, Kamome looks at Tsuyu’s leg.</p>



<p>She still has a bandage wrapped around her right ankle.</p>



<p>Has the ankle she twisted the other day not completely healed yet?</p>



<p>Was it really that badly injured?</p>



<p>「Let’s see…」</p>



<p>I think I did something bad, so, I wonder if there is some place where we could sit comfortably.</p>



<p>Kamome, who was looking around with this thought in his mind, notices something.</p>



<p>The two of them are right in front of a café.</p>



<p>「Standing around talking is not a good idea, so let’s go in.」</p>



<p>Saying that, Kamome invites Tsuyu.</p>


<p>「…Are you being considerate?」</p>



<p>Looking down at her foot, Tsuyu says so, and Kamome asks back with a “Eh?”.</p>



<p>「…It’s nothing. I don’t have much time, so just for a little.」</p>



<p>Despite her curt response, she obediently followed Kamome’s words and quietly entered the cafe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two of them were guided to a seat by the window upon entering the cafe.</p>



<p>After sitting down and placing their orders…</p>



<p><a>「</a>So, what do you want to ask?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu asks in a brusque manner while directing her gaze out the window.</p>



<p>「It’s about the other day.」</p>



<p>Kamome asks Tsuyu while looking straight at her from the opposite.</p>



<p>「Why did you do that?」</p>



<p>「That, you say?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu asks back with a smile at her mouth.</p>



<p>Kamome continues, conscious not to let his emotions be swayed by her teasing attitude.</p>



<p>「Why did you attack me?」</p>



<p>「“Attack you”. You make it sound like I’m an animal…」</p>



<p>While muttering, she must have noticed Kamome’s serious gaze.</p>



<p>「…Because I found your constant prying and meddling in my life annoying. That’s why I tried to threaten you and establish a master-slave relationship. That’s all.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu replied with a sigh.</p>


<p>But──</p>



<p>「No, that’s not what I’m asking about.」</p>



<p>He had already heard the reason about the incident at the amusement park the other day.</p>



<p>What he wants to ask now is about the thing that happened the first time when he went to her house with Himawari.</p>



<p>She dragged him into her room, stole his lips, and seduced him.</p>



<p>I want to know the reason for that ── and so, Kamome asks again.</p>



<p>「To do something like that out of the blue, no matter how you look at it, it’s strange.」</p>



<p>「……I was under a lot of stress.」</p>



<p>To Kamome’s questioning, Tsuyu answers while playing with the ends of her hair.</p>



<p>It’s not an “I don’t care” kind of gesture, but rather one that seems to be hiding her true feelings.</p>



<p>「I was frustrated, I thought it would be a good vent, and that it would make you happy, so I made a move on you. That’s all, thought.」</p>



<p>Kamome bites his lip tightly at those words.</p>



<p>「That’s not something you should do for such reason.」</p>



<p>Upon hearing Kamome’s straightforward words, Tsuyu mutters “Annoying…” irritated.</p>



<p>Downcast eyes, gaze that don’t meet.</p>



<p>An attitude as if she was suppressing her true feelings, as if she was rejecting mutual understanding.</p>



<p>Facing such Tsuyu, Kamome felt his heart tremble.</p>


<p>This isn’t good.</p>



<p>Even though he was consciously trying not to let his emotions be swayed.</p>



<p>When he talks to her, he gives in to his emotions as if he is losing himself.</p>



<p>That’s right, Kamome is aware of this.</p>



<p>As if to demonstrate this awareness, there, Kamome found himself making a bold statement.</p>



<p>「Perhaps, Tsuyu… Things aren’t going well with that boyfriend of yours.」</p>



<p>He relays the speculation he had during his conversation with Kensuke earlier.</p>



<p>At that moment, Tsuyu furrowed her brows and directed a sharp gaze to Kamome.</p>



<p>「Ha? What’s that? Why do you think so?」</p>



<p>「Because, when I think about the reason, that’s the only one I can think of. Things weren’t going well with your lover, you stressed out, and then Himawari brought me along at a time like that.」</p>



<p>「…So, I got jealous because the two of you who were doing well appeared in front of me? Is that what you’re trying to say?」</p>



<p>「…It’s all just my speculation but allow me to speak assuming that speculation.」</p>



<p>Kamome says it clearly.</p>



<p>「If that’s the case, then you really need to stop. Such a thing is bad for Himawari. Himawari is the real victim here.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>It happened in an instant.</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s expression became completely hostile, glaring straight at Kamome.</p>



<p>「What do you know?」</p>



<p>Faced with her fierce attitude, Kamome involuntary gasps.</p>



<p>I’m right.</p>



<p>Tsuyu is the one who is wrong.</p>



<p>He could affirm with confidence.</p>



<p>But for some reason, the words didn’t come out.</p>



<p>There was that much intensity in her gaze.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>「…Excuse me.」</p>



<p>A faint voice could be heard.</p>



<p>Looking up, they see a café waitress standing in front of their table, with coffee on a tray.</p>



<p>Perhaps she brought their orders but found such an intense situation with no openings unfolding that she didn’t know when to intervene.</p>



<p>「S-Sorry! Thank you!」</p>



<p>Kamome hurriedly accepts coffee from the waitress.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Tsuyu also seems to cool down with a sigh.</p>



<p>「…I understand, I won’t do it anymore, and I won’t get involved with you either.」</p>



<p>After taking a sip from the iced coffee placed before her, she tells Kamome again.</p>



<p>「I don’t have any particular interest in you, and you don’t care about me anymore. Let’s pretend nothing ever happened and treat each other like strangers from now on. We’ll act like we don’t know each other. That should be fine, right?」</p>



<p>「There’s no way that that’s fine.」</p>



<p>Before he knew it, Kamome said so.</p>



<p>Faced with Tsuyu’s incredibly nonchalant, or rather, desperate way of speaking, anger wells up within him.</p>



<p>「What? Why, isn’t fine?」</p>



<p>「That’s…」</p>



<p>──Kamome is more than a little concerned about Tsuyu’s existence.</p>



<p>──Because I’m worried about you.</p>



<p>…He can’t honestly say that.</p>



<p>Even more so after having just mentioned Himawari.</p>



<p>Besides, Tsuyu’s proposal is too extreme.</p>



<p>Something like becoming complete strangers.</p>



<p>Something like acting like they don’t know each other.</p>



<p>That’s just too…</p>



<p>「…What kind of person is that boyfriend?」</p>



<p>A tangled thought processes.</p>



<p>Messed up emotional expressions.</p>



<p>Perhaps because of that, Kamome was unconsciously saying such things.</p>



<p>「…To be honest, he didn’t seem like a very nice person.」</p>



<p>Upon hearing that, Tsuyu made an annoyed face.</p>



<p>「What do you know about him?」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>「What? You want to lecture me? You think the old me was better, and the current me isn’t good at all? You’ve become quite the great one in the time we haven’t met. Do you feel like you have enough experience in life and know everything to be able to lecture people like that?」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>「Explain it to me, specifically. What kind of person he is, what’s wrong with him, and what I should do about it. Go ahead.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>He doesn’t know.</p>



<p>When she put it that way, there was nothing that Kamome could know, nothing that he could say.</p>



<p>Not with his flimsy life experience.</p>



<p>He can’t even choose the right clothes to wear on a date.</p>



<p>「I don’t know…」</p>



<p>He doesn’t know, but…</p>



<p>Kamome raises his face, which he had dropped.</p>


<p>He faces Tsuyu with a look of deep-seated concern.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu, you were crying earlier, weren’t you? Those tears were caused by that person?」</p>



<p>Kamome’s sad expression, directed at her.</p>



<p>Seeing Kamome like that, Tsuyu also changes her complexion.</p>



<p>As if her chest has been tightened, a face like that.</p>



<p>With her lips pressed together, Tsuyu hurriedly took out her wallet from her bag.</p>



<p>「Ah, Tsuyu…」</p>



<p>After putting money on the table, she stands up from her seat.</p>



<p>「…Anyway, I won’t see you or get close to you anymore. You do the same. That should be fine, right?」</p>



<p>And then, she quickly turns to leave the place.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu, wait!」</p>



<p>Kamome panics.</p>



<p>He realizes that he went too far.</p>



<p>He reflects that he stepped too bluntly into her space.</p>



<p>At the same time, he thinks he must do something to follow up.</p>



<p>His train of thought is a tangled mess.</p>



<p>Then, what flashes to his mind was the conversation he had with Kensuke earlier.</p>



<p>『Or maybe she became worried about whether she had any attractiveness as a woman──』</p>



<p>「Tsuyu!」</p>



<p>Kamome yells with a serious face to Tsuyu, who turned around when she was stopped.</p>



<p>「I think Tsuyu is attractive enough as a woman!」</p>



<p>Because he shouted so loudly, he attracted the attention of other customers and employees in the store.</p>



<p>Inside the quiet store.</p>



<p>Being told such a thing in front of the public, Tsuyu blushes and looks at him as if to say, “What on earth are you saying all of a sudden?”.</p>



<p>「Idiot!」</p>



<p>She shouted, grabbed a hand towel from the shelf beside her, and threw it at Kamome’s face.</p>



<p>「Ouch!」</p>


<div><img src="https://sinkuredtranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/knav1ilus4.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>Tsuyu leaves with a quick step.</p>



<p>Seeing her back, the employee modestly sends her off with a “Thank you very much…”</p>



<p>「…I made her angry.」</p>



<p>Completely, he made the wrong choice.</p>



<p>Kamome ended up depressed in the window seat for a while.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>──And the next day.</p>



<p>「Oossu, Kamome.」</p>



<p>Kamome, who was on his way to school, was called out from behind.</p>



<p>It was Kurose Misaki, his classmate and friend.</p>



<p>「…Good morning.」</p>



<p>Seeing Kamome’s expression as he turned around saying that, Misaki blinked his eyes in surprise.</p>



<p>「That’s unusual, are you angry?」</p>



<p>「Do I look like I’m angry?」</p>



<p>「Well, rather than angry, you seem to be in a bad mood. It’s unusual to see you like this.」</p>



<p>“You read me well”, Kamome expresses slight admiration.</p>



<p>「What’s the matter, did some weirdo mess with you or something?」</p>



<p>「…Yeah, well, something like that… No, I’m lying, it’s not like that.」</p>



<p>「Which is it?」</p>



<p>The hesitant denial came because Misaki’s words had strangely hit the mark.</p>



<p>(…Tsuyu.)</p>



<p>Even though he had made up his mind not to care anymore.</p>



<p>To be emotionally disturbed like this.</p>



<p>「But aren’t you with Shishido today?」</p>



<p>「Yeah, kind of. We stopped meeting up and going to school together.」</p>



<p>Kamome and Himawari used to meet up at the same time and go to school together, but since a while ago, they started to get teased by those around them when they were together.</p>



<p>That seemed to be embarrassing for Himawari.</p>



<p>Kamome didn’t particularly mind.</p>



<p>He thought it was a special and important time to spend with Himawari, but… If Himawari says doesn’t like it, he should prioritize her feelings.</p>



<p>So, they decided to go to school separately instead of meeting up.</p>



<p>『I-I’m sorry… for being selfish.』</p>



<p>『No, not at all, we can do it whatever Himawari likes.』</p>



<p>To Himawari, who was apologetically, Kamome offered reassurances.</p>



<p>『T-Then… how about this? If we happen to run into each other on the way to school, we’ll go together then.』</p>



<p>『Is that okay?』</p>



<p>『Yes, because that’s a coincidence.』</p>



<p>“Is that how it is?”, Misaki interjected after hearing him.</p>



<p>「If Himawari is fine with that, then I am too.」</p>


<p>「Fuun.」</p>



<p>──And.</p>



<p>As Kamome and Misaki were talking like that.</p>



<p>「Good morning, Kamome-kun.」</p>



<p>From the side, the one who had just been mentioned in the conversation, Himawari, called out to him.</p>



<p>「Ah, good morning.」</p>



<p>「Oh, good for you, Kamome. It’s a coincidence.」</p>



<p>Misaki said, and Himawari’s cheeks blushed in embarrassment.</p>



<p>When Kamome glares at him and says, “Don’t tease me”, Misaki puts her hands together and says, “Sorry, sorry”.</p>



<p>「Ah, that’s right. Shishido, this Kamome guy seems to be in a bad mood. You should talk to him.」</p>



<p>「Eh? Is that so?」</p>



<p>「No, I’m not particularly…」</p>



<p>Kamome tried to brush it off by saying that, but Himawari directed a worried gaze at him.</p>



<p>「Kamome-kun… If you have any worries, you can talk to me. I don’t know if I can help you, but…」</p>



<p>The sight of Himawari looking up at Kamome is so endearing that Kamome naturally smiles and says, “Thank you”.</p>



<p>She is indeed a healing presence.</p>



<p>A big contrast from Tsuyu.</p>


<p>(But…)</p>



<p>Whenever he let his guard down, he remembers the image of Tsuyu crying.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Why he’s so concerned about her?</p>



<p>It shouldn’t be that way.</p>



<p>What he need to prioritize the most, what he needs to cherish the most, is supposed to be Himawari.</p>



<p>「Ah, by the way. Kamome-kun, are you okay with your schedule?」</p>



<p>「Eh? Schedule?」</p>



<p>Being suddenly asked there, Kamome tilts his head.</p>



<p>「Yeah… Ah, sorry, it was too soon to ask, wasn’t it?」</p>



<p>Himawari became flustered.</p>



<p>「…Ah」</p>



<p>Kamome remembers.</p>



<p>That’s right.</p>



<p>There’s less than a month left until Himawari’s birthday.</p>



<p>On that birthday, Himawari had proposed to spend it together.</p>



<p>「Of course, it’s okay!」</p>



<p>In a panic, Kamome replies with that.</p>



<p>There is no need to check his schedule.</p>



<p>He doesn’t have any plans to begin with, and no matter what happens, his girlfriend’s birthday is his top priority.</p>



<p>「Thank goodness…」</p>



<p>Hearing Kamome’s reply, Himawari’s face shows an expression of relief.</p>



<p>「Then, I’m looking forward to the day. I’ll prepare food, drinks, games, and all sorts of things!」</p>



<p>Himawari, looking very excited, waves cheerfully as they arrive at the school’s entrance and heads for her classroom.</p>



<p>Kamome sees her off with a smile.</p>



<p>「…Oi, Kamome.」</p>



<p>There, Misaki whispered from behind.</p>



<p>「You know, it’s your first girlfriend’s first birthday, right? Have you already prepared a gift?」</p>



<p>「…Ah.」</p>
