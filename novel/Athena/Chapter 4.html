<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>After that.</p>
<p>Just as I declared, I headed to the &lt;&lt;Treasure Labyrinth&gt;&gt; with Lara and Marise.</p>
<p>“A-A-A-A-Are you really sure it’s okay!?”</p>
<p>“There are monsters in the Labyrinth, you know!? Coming here all of a sudden&#8230;i-is an act of suicide!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry”</p>
<p>It seems that if you meet certain conditions, you can challenge the &lt;&lt;Treasure Labyrinth&gt;&gt; right away.</p>
<p>When I asked Sensei, she replied, “If Kurt is there, I have no complaints”, and so I was able to get her permission.</p>
<p>When I stepped into the &lt;&lt;Treasure Labyrinth&gt;&gt;, I could smell the peculiar scent of magic elements.</p>
<p>Mmm, I miss this scent.</p>
<p>This burnt scent reminds me of the time when I explored more than 100 Labyrinths in my previous life.</p>
<p>“It’s gloomy&#8230;but there’s nothing I can’t see. Why is it like this even though it’s all pitch black in here?”</p>
<p>“And it looks spacious. It’s amazing that something like this span across the underground of the Royal Capital&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Ah. About the Labyrinth, it’s like an alternate dimension, so there’s nothing strange about it”</p>
<p>““?””</p>
<p>They both tilted their heads at the same time.</p>
<p>“Listen. The Labyrinth has magic elements that can distort dimensions”</p>
<p>“Dimensions&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“Yeah&#8230;well, you can think of it as another world that has been stretched outwards”</p>
<p>For example ── let’s say it looks like it’s only about the size of a house from the outside.</p>
<p>But once you get inside, the dimensions are distorted and you’re transported to a location where it looks like another world.</p>
<p>As such it’s more spacious than it looks&#8230;some of them have layers inside the Labyrinth that are bigger than the Royal Capital itself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the different magic elements getting mixed, the treasures within the &lt;&lt;Treasure Labyrinth&gt;&gt; can be replenished after a certain period of time, even if they are taken away.</p>
<p>That’s one of the reasons why the Labyrinth is also called a ‘Resource’ and is useful in some cities.</p>
<p>“Thus, magic elements are essential to the Labyrinths and Dungeons. I don’t know all the details, but I do know more about the Labyrinth than the two of you”</p>
<p>“Kurt&#8230;who on earth are you?”</p>
<p>“How do you know so much about it even though we are the same age?”</p>
<p>“If you think about it, there’s also the crucial details that I do not know of”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right”</p>
<p>They curiously asked me.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Would you two believe me if I told you that I’ve reincarnated from a thousand years ago?”</p>
<p>“What are you saying, Kurt?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Isn’t something like that impossible?”</p>
<p>Both of them have a stupefied expression on their face.</p>
<p>As I thought, they wouldn’t believe me, huh?</p>
<p>Well, that’s fine. It’s not like it would be a problem even if they don’t believe me right away.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we proceeded towards the first layer of the Labyrinth.</p>
<p>And as soon as we step foot in the first layer.</p>
<p>“Wah! It’s a monster!”</p>
<p>A small Lizardman suddenly appeared from the front.</p>
<p>“It’s a monster that lives in the &lt;&lt;Treasure Labyrinth&gt;&gt;. That being said, if it’s just a mere Lizardman, I think both of you can handle it. Let this be the first test. I’ll show you a demonstration first, then you can try to defeat it in the same way”</p>
<p>I draw my sword.</p>
<p>Those who challenge the &lt;&lt;Treasure Labyrinth&gt;&gt; are provided with a weapon. And right now, I’m using that weapon.</p>
<p>Quick Move and Rise Power were activated simultaneously. I then launched an attack on the Lizardman.</p>
<p>The Lizardman’s head was severed in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>“What do you think? Easy, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s not easy!”</p>
<p>“It was too fast to see&#8230;”</p>
<p>Both of them retorted.</p>
<p>“Truth be told, Lizardman isn’t that big of a deal as a monster. Both of you need to be brave…. Look, the Lizardmen are here again”</p>
<p>“Now there’s even two of them!”</p>
<p>“You’re right. This is my first time fighting against monsters&#8230;but I’ll definitely defeat them!”</p>
<p>Marise was the first one to hold up her hand.</p>
<p>“Gather yourselves together in these hands, O flame. Be a spear, pierce the enemy and burn them!”</p>
<p>She unleashed an attack.</p>
<p>The Fire Spear that was released was a direct hit. It hits the Lizardman, toppling it.</p>
<p>“Let’s finish them in one go!”</p>
<p>“I-I can’t lose either. Gather yourselves together in these hands ──”</p>
<p>It was a pleasant sight to see them successfully defeat the two Lizardmen.</p>
<p>“I did it! Thank you, Marise-chan!”</p>
<p>“W-We did it! Likewise, thank you very much!”</p>
<p>Even though they had only defeated a Lizardman, they were holding hands and jumping with joy.</p>
<p>But as soon as Marise noticed that, she let go of her hands.</p>
<p>“O-Of course! I’m going to graduate from the Magic Academy as the top student after all! So I have to be able to do at least this much!”</p>
<p>She said that while trying to hide her embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Now…it seems that there’s no stronger monster than the Lizardman on the first layer ── hmm?”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Kurt?”</p>
<p>From the moment I entered the Labyrinth, the Detection Magic was kept activated.</p>
<p>And right now, a certain reaction is being caught.</p>
<p>“Oh? This is interesting”</p>
<p>“Kurt?”</p>
<p>“Could you two come over here for a moment?”</p>
<p>I lead them to a dead-end.</p>
<p>“It’s a dead-end, you know? What are you planning to do?”</p>
<p>“Has no one noticed it up until now?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“There’s a path ahead”</p>
<p>Instead of answering the dubious looks on their faces, I cast Fire Spear onto the wall of the dead-end.</p>
<p><strong><em>*Ker-bonk*</em></strong></p>
<p>The wall crumbled with a loud bang.</p>
<p>“The wall!”</p>
<p>“What is the meaning of this! A Labyrinth wall can never be destroyed. That’s why we have no choice but to conquer it slowly…at least that’s what I’ve read from some books”</p>
<p>“That common sense is wrong. As you can see”</p>
<p>It also depends on the strength of the wall, but there’s absolutely no such thing as a wall that can’t be destroyed.</p>
<p>“Does the path continue?”</p>
<p>With a common sense as wrong as that, we will not be able to discover the path beyond the wall.</p>
<p>“Whoa! There are so many Lizardmen!”</p>
<p>“They are coming at us!”</p>
<p>A horde of Lizardmen at the other side of the path can be seen coming right at us.</p>
<p>There are about 20 of them in total.</p>
<p>Because of the reaction coming from these Lizardmen, I knew that if I destroy the wall, there would be a path here.</p>
<p>This is a bit too much for the two of them, I guess.</p>
<p>“This is just the right time for a warm-up”</p>
<p>With my back facing the frightened Lara and Marise, I took a step towards the horde of Lizardmen.</p>
<p>And then sprinted.</p>
<p>I went into the middle of the horde and deployed lightning magic.</p>
<p>“Thunderstorm”</p>
<p>Lightning appeared from my hands and was promptly aimed towards the Lizardmen.</p>
<p>When the Lizardmen saw the danger and tried to escape, it was already too late for them as my lightning magic chased them down.</p>
<p>Eventually.</p>
<p>“All right. It’s over”</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the Lizardmen were all electrocuted to death.</p>
<p>I looked at the Lizardmen lying on the ground and patted some dust off my hands.</p>
<p>“Kurt, that was amazing!”</p>
<p>“As I thought, you really are a ridiculous person. To have defeated so many monsters in an instant&#8230;”</p>
<p>They seem to be in high spirits, but I wish they wouldn’t praise me for this level of magic.</p>
<p>We continued walking on the path for a while, but this time we were at a real dead-end.</p>
<p>“This is a&#8230;magic stone?”</p>
<p>A magic stone had fallen there, so I picked it up.</p>
<p>“It’s a small magic stone, but it could be used to process something. Let’s keep it”</p>
<p>I felt disappointed.</p>
<p>I thought there would be better treasures.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that a magic stone is so expensive that even one of it is enough to build a house, you know?”</p>
<p>“It’s Kurt, after all. Somehow I can understand it even without changing the color of my eyes to look at the magic stone”</p>
<p>For some reason, they seemed to be dumbfounded seeing my slumped down shoulders.</p>
<p>For some reason, they seemed to be dumbfounded seeing my slumped down shoulders.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>As we start descending to the second layer, a lush green forest could be seen.</p>
<p>“Eh, why?”</p>
<p>“Kurt already told us, remember? The Labyrinth is like an alternate dimension”</p>
<p>“That’s how it is”</p>
<p>It is not unusual for the surrounding landscape to change completely as the layers change.</p>
<p>“This is just the second layer after all. The one I have conquered ── no, from what I’ve heard, there are some Labyrinths where the entire fields are just magma”</p>
<p>“That’s…we can’t even walk on that in the first place!”</p>
<p>“It’s true. So you’re saying that no human can conquer it?”</p>
<p>I conquered it easily in my previous life.</p>
<p>It wasn’t particularly difficult.</p>
<p>To withstand the high temperatures, you only need to modify the magic for body protection.</p>
<p>Rather than that, in the Labyrinth where you could be thrown into the gap of the dimension if you let your guard down for a bit was much more troublesome.</p>
<p>The enemies I encountered were weak, so it was easy to get carried away and let my guard down.</p>
<p>It was difficult to return to the original space by interfering with the time axis every time I was thrown from one space to another in the dimension.</p>
<p>“All right, let’s continue on to the second layer”</p>
<p>“The deeper the layer, the harder it is to conquer the Labyrinth, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right”</p>
<p>I nodded at Lara’s question.</p>
<p>“Will it be fine? Even on the first layer, I already had to give it my all&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. The way I see it, even if it’s just the two of us, we should be able to conquer the second layer”</p>
<p>From my point of view, the first layer and the second layer are too low level, and the two layers aren’t that much different from one another.</p>
<p>We made our way through the forest, taking in the scenery around us.</p>
<p>“Gather yourselves together in these hands, O flame. Be a spear, pierce the enemy and burn them!”</p>
<p>A crab-shaped monster, Crab, appeared and Marise unleashed her magic.</p>
<p>By the way…I basically left it to Lara and Marise to exterminate the monsters.</p>
<p>At first, they were stiff, but gradually they got used to fighting against monsters.</p>
<p>As I thought, they are talented.</p>
<p>However….</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, you two? You look tired”</p>
<p>“Haaa, haaa&#8230;I-I’m still okay. But I’ve never used so much magic before”</p>
<p>“I can still go on!”</p>
<p>Even so, both of them are panting heavily.</p>
<p>In addition to all of that walking, they are also consuming their magic power.</p>
<p>It can’t be helped.</p>
<p>“Let’s take a break here”</p>
<p>“I-Inside the Labyrinth?”</p>
<p>said Marise, with her eyes wide in shock.</p>
<p>“Is that weird?”</p>
<p>“Weird or not, I can’t stay calm when I think that monsters could attack us at any time&#8230;”</p>
<p>“It’s not unusual to take a break inside a Labyrinth. Sometimes it takes days to conquer a Labyrinth. Besides ── you don’t have to worry about the monsters”</p>
<p>I went to a slightly open area and cast a Barrier Magic, Holy Circle.</p>
<p>“I’ve now set up a barrier here to ward off evil things. The monsters shouldn’t even be able to find us”</p>
<p>“You just used difficult magic as easily as that, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that Barrier Magic is quite difficult though?”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise were surprised, but after all this time, I no longer care as I already know that this world has low magic skills.</p>
<p>We sat down on the ground.</p>
<p>“Phew, I’m alive again”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise also sat in a circle.</p>
<p>A brief respite.</p>
<p>“Hmm&#8230;what’s that?”</p>
<p>Just then, suddenly, a glowing, palm-sized object appeared in front of the barrier and Marise noticed it.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a spirit?”</p>
<p>“Spirit? Why is it here?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it was drawn to my magic power”</p>
<p>Even so, this is unusual.</p>
<p>The spherical light came straight into the barrier and landed on the palm of Marise.</p>
<p>Holy Circle is a barrier that wards off evil things.</p>
<p>A spirit with no hostility can pass through like this.</p>
<p>“It’s cute. I had only seen spirits when I was little…”</p>
<p>Marise was gently stroking the spirit with her other hand.</p>
<p>“Spirits are born where there is plenty of magic power and magic elements. However, since there aren’t many magic elements in this Labyrinth, I guess only small spirits are born”</p>
<p>“As I recall, in places with more magic power, there are humanoid spirits as well?”</p>
<p>I nodded in response to Marise’s question.</p>
<p>It seems that the existence of spirits hasn’t changed since my previous life.</p>
<p>Just like Marise said, there are also adult-sized spirits.</p>
<p>To distinguish them from the small spirits, we call them the Great Spirits.</p>
<p>However, it is also hard to find them when they reach that stage.</p>
<p>Some people are afraid of the Great Spirits who look like them.</p>
<p>“Marise-chan, it’s not magic power”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lara interrupted.</p>
<p>“It’s not magic power, but Mana. To us, it’s magic power, but the spirits call it Mana”</p>
<p>“I-Is that so? Lara, you know it well”</p>
<p>Marise looked surprised, but Lara looked somewhat uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;she knows it very well.</p>
<p>As I recall, the issue of such a designation was that it is not well known.</p>
<p>“Even so&#8230;with our magic power, we are having a hard time defeating even one monster”</p>
<p>With the spirit on her palm, Marise let out a gloomy tone in her voice.</p>
<p>“That’s true. But Kurt defeated so many Lizardmen in an instant”</p>
<p>“Why is there such a difference between us and Kurt’s magic?”</p>
<p>They seemed to have doubts.</p>
<p>“If it’s a Lizardman of that caliber, both of you will be able to hunt it in no time, too. There’s no need to rush”</p>
<p>“The level I’m at now, it’s frustrating but I can’t be thinking that now. How do I unleash magic like you, Kurt?”</p>
<p>Marise got closer to me on her knees.</p>
<p>Good grief, I haven’t said I’d teach them magic yet.</p>
<p>But a little bit would be fine, probably. Besides, I’m also concerned about qualities like how quickly they can cope with what I’ve taught.</p>
<p>I replied as I pictured the scene where both of them were casting their magic in my mind.</p>
<p>“Hmmm, that’s right&#8230;why don’t you try to stop using the embarrassing chanting?”</p>
<p>“Stop chanting&#8230;? Are you telling us to unleash magic without chanting?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. When you get used to it, it’s easier”</p>
<p>“As I said during the entrance exam&#8230;only Kurt can do that!”</p>
<p>Marise reacted with a strong tone.</p>
<p>I looked at Lara, too, and she nodded her head in agreement, “Yes, yes”.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>“It’s not that difficult to do it without chanting. Besides, if it’s chanting magic, the magic power will be fixed and inevitably not as powerful as it could be”</p>
<p>Chanting magic is a method that was prevalent before the magic revolution, where chanting would automatically construct the magic formula.</p>
<p>However, since the magic formula is automatically constructed, it is not effective for practical use.</p>
<p>Moreover, because you have to chant the incantations one-by-one, the deployment speed will be slowed down, too…it’s also difficult to make improvements to the magic formula in the first place, so the limits are quickly reached.</p>
<p>No matter how talented Lara and Marise are, if they keep this up, they’ll probably reach their limits soon.</p>
<p>“What have you two heard about chantless magic?”</p>
<p>“I heard that if you don’t chant, the magic formula will be constructed imperfectly and become useless”</p>
<p>“I also heard that you can only pour a tenth of the usual amount of magic power without chanting”</p>
<p>“What the hell?”</p>
<p>Seriously&#8230;.</p>
<p>Why is it that the magic revolution didn’t happen at all?</p>
<p>Such a classic way of using magic.</p>
<p>If it was 1000 years ago, this would probably be a laughing stock.</p>
<p>“But how do we use chantless magic?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You should be aware that your common sense is not the same as our common sense”</p>
<p>“Is that so? If it’s the current Lara and Marise, you’ll be able to use the chantless magic in no time. That’s right ── first, Lara”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>I got Lara to her feet and took her hands from behind.</p>
<p>“Ku, K-K-Kurt! What are you trying to do all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“You’re shameless!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What on earth are you two mistaking me for? Listen, I’m going to assist you now, so gather magic power in your hands”</p>
<p>“Um, like this?”</p>
<p>I felt the magic power gathering in Lara’s hands.</p>
<p>“That’s right. How do you feel now?”</p>
<p>“I feel&#8230;I feel like my hands are getting warm. And my heart is pounding. Ah ──”</p>
<p>A sound emanated from Lara’s mouth.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Um, nothing&#8230;this is somewhat a strange feeling. I feel like I could suffocate when my chest tightens”</p>
<p>“No problem. That’s probably because your heart rate is going up”</p>
<p>“Maybe, but I think it’s because Kurt is holding my hands…”</p>
<p>I could see Lara’s ears gradually turn red.</p>
<p>Because Lara is leaning on me as if she were entrusting her body to me, I can feel the touch of the girl’s soft body.</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;that’s right, this magic power is….</p>
<p>I see. I didn’t realize it when I first came to the Royal Capital and analyzed Lara’s magic power, but thanks to the small spirit, I remembered it.</p>
<p>But it’s unlikely that Lara will speak to me about it. Let’s not question her.</p>
<p>I continued, manipulating Lara’s magic power.</p>
<p>“Keep going and try forming the magic formula of Fire Spear in your mind”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Is this okay?”</p>
<p>“That’s enough. Keep your eyes open, all right?”</p>
<p>“Whoa!”</p>
<p>Lara was surprised.</p>
<p>That’s because a Fire Spear was shot out of her hand and landed on the ground.</p>
<p>“J-Just now! Even though I didn’t chant, a Fire Spear flew out!”</p>
<p>“That’s right. This is chantless magic. How was it?”</p>
<p>“The magic power gathered with a bang and also flew out of my hand with a bang!”</p>
<p>It’s a fairly abstract expression, but if she does it a few more times, she’ll get the sense of chantless magic.</p>
<p>That way, the rest will be quick.</p>
<p>“Kurt! Me too!”</p>
<p>“Mmm”</p>
<p>With the small spirit on her shoulder, I hold Marise’s hands from behind.</p>
<p>The smell of soap tickled the bridge of my nose.</p>
<p>It was the same for Lara, too, but girls really do smell good.</p>
<p>“Ugh&#8230;it’s my first time holding hands with a man…”</p>
<p>said Marise, blushing from the neck up to her face, but why’s that, I wonder?</p>
<p>── About an hour later.</p>
<p>I taught them chantless magic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaaa!”</p>
<p>“Haaa!”</p>
<p>The two shouted at the same time.</p>
<p>Of course, they didn’t utter the useless chanting.</p>
<p>A small Fire Spear was fired from Lara’s and Marise’s hands.</p>
<p>“We did it! We’ve succeeded for the first time without Kurt’s help!”</p>
<p>“But…as expected, this is all we could do, isn’t the chanting magic stronger in this case?”</p>
<p>Certainly, the Fire Spear that was released from both of them from before was more powerful and accurate, but to me, it looked weak.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“That’s because you’re not used to it yet. If you practice a few times, you’ll soon get stronger with chantless magic”</p>
<p>“How soon will that be?”</p>
<p>When Lara asked, I crossed my arms and thought for a moment.</p>
<p>“About three days”</p>
<p>“Three days!? That fast!?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s a longer estimation though?”</p>
<p>After hearing my words, their eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>At any rate, even if it’s just the two of them, I’m glad that they noticed the inefficiency of chanting.</p>
<p>“Well then, it’s about time, let’s get going. The second layer doesn’t seem particularly unusual, so let’s move on to the third layer”</p>
<p>If I carve up a weak monster and bring it back, I could probably make some money from it, too, but there’s no point in just making a small sum of money.</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Spirit-san. I’ll come here again”</p>
<p>When the barrier was lifted, the spirit that had been attached to Marise flew away.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“The third layer is a prairie?”</p>
<p>“Looks like it”</p>
<p>When we descended to the third layer, Lara looked around restlessly with her eyes wide open.</p>
<p>It is understandable.</p>
<p>The first layer has ruins, and the second layer was like a forest.</p>
<p>It is understandable to be suddenly perplexed by such a big space.</p>
<p>“The area up to this point will be used for the exhibition game, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Marise asked.</p>
<p>She’s right, the exhibition game will be held from the first layer to the third layer.</p>
<p>As for me, I’m fine with diving deeper, too&#8230;but it seems to be for the safety of the students that they are narrowing it down to the first few layers.</p>
<p>“Oh, here comes the monsters”</p>
<p>“Wahhh, there’s a lot of bird-like monsters coming!”</p>
<p>When I strained my eyes, I could see a great multitude of monsters coming towards us from afar.</p>
<p>Are those Evil Birds?</p>
<p>Lara and Marise assumed a fighting stance.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s make this the final test. Defeat the group of Evil Birds that are about to arrive with the chantless magic I taught you earlier”</p>
<p>“EH!? Isn’t that too sudden to try it on monsters?”</p>
<p>“That’s crazy!”</p>
<p>They panicked.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter? Since you’ll be forming a party with me, you’ll need to be able to do this much at least, else it would be troubling. That’s right&#8230;whoever defeats the most monsters can pass unconditionally, too”</p>
<p>“── !”</p>
<p>Hearing those words, Marise’s eye color changed.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget what you just said”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Besides, I’m saying this because I know you two can handle it. If by any chance that it gets dangerous, I’ll lend you a hand”</p>
<p>The Evil Birds are getting closer and closer, finally coming close enough to be clearly within striking range.</p>
<p>Lara and Marise shot Fire Spears at the flying Evil Birds.</p>
<p>They had difficulty hitting the Evil Birds with their magic at first, and seemed to have a hard time.</p>
<p>At this point, both of them are evenly matched in power. It won’t be surprising since either of them could win.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“Haaa, haaa…”</p>
<p>Marise is breathing heavily.</p>
<p>She must be exhausted and reaching the end of her strength.</p>
<p>I wonder if that’s because ──</p>
<p>“Marise-chan!”</p>
<p>Lara shouted suddenly.</p>
<p>An Evil Bird attacked from behind Marise.</p>
<p>“Eh…?”</p>
<p>Marise couldn’t react in time to the attack from behind and is about to get hit at this rate.</p>
<p>However, Lara rolled over to grab Marise and sidestep the attack from the Evil Bird.</p>
<p>“Are you okay!? Marise-chan!”</p>
<p>There was some dirt on Lara’s cheeks, but she was more worried about Marise.</p>
<p>“W-Why did you save me? Didn’t you hear? This is the final test, and whoever defeats the most monsters will pass…”</p>
<p>“A-haha, you’re right&#8230;my body just moved on its own. But I’m going to be friends with&#8230;no, I can’t abandon my friend Marise-chan”</p>
<p>“Friend&#8230;?”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise stood up and stared at the Evil Birds.</p>
<p>A closer look reveals scratches on Lara’s right knee.</p>
<p>“I want Kurt to teach me magic. But I also want to get to know you better, Marise-chan”</p>
<p>“What merit is there by being friends with me&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“I don’t need any merits to become friends with you! Besides ── we’ll talk later! Now we have to work together to defeat the monsters”</p>
<p>“Y-You’re right”</p>
<p>The two changed their minds and mustered up the last of their strength to take down the few remaining Evil Birds.</p>
<p>Then&#8230;a short time later.</p>
<p>The sight of Evil Birds that had been there for so long, had finally disappeared.</p>
<p>“W-We did it…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, thanks to you, Marise-chan. I couldn’t have done it alone myself…”</p>
<p>They both sounded like they were exhausted.</p>
<p>“Oh, right! Kurt&#8230;which one of us passed?”</p>
<p>“We were so desperate that we didn’t even count how many we defeated”</p>
<p>The two suddenly approach me.</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;although they are practically evenly matched, Marise was slightly ahead in defeating the Evil Birds.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“You girls don’t have to worry about who defeated the most Evil Birds. Because both of you passed”</p>
<p>“Eh&#8230;? Then does that mean…!?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ll teach both of you the essence of magic. But be prepared, okay? I’m not used to teaching, so it can get a little tough”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Lara jumped up and down in excitement, and Marise clenched her fists in joy.</p>
<p>&#8230;I was going to teach them magic even before I gave them this test in the first place.</p>
<p>Judging from the entrance exam, both of them have a talent for magic. I can’t wait to see how far they will grow as I teach them.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, even if we are to form a party together, if we can’t trust each other, then we won’t be able to show our full potential. It’s not a very pleasant thing to watch if they are on bad terms with each other.</p>
<p>But surprisingly&#8230;</p>
<p>I did wonder what would happen at one point but looks like there was nothing to worry about after all.</p>
<p>Lara’s willingness to sacrifice herself to help her friends was enough to reassure me.</p>
<p>“Lara…”</p>
<p>Marise gently holds out her hand to a happy Lara.</p>
<p>“Eh&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“Um, it’s a handshake! D-Don’t get me wrong. I just need to be strong on my own after all&#8230;but, if we are going to form a party, it’s better to get along with each other&#8230;and…it seems like there are various benefits to that!”</p>
<p>“Geez, you’re not being honest with yourself! But&#8230;again, I’m looking forward to working with you, Marise-chan! And Kurt, too!”</p>
<p>Hmm, a handshake, huh?</p>
<p>Lara is trying to get along with me. It’s a bit embarrassing, but I can’t refuse her here.</p>
<p>She took Marise’s and my hand alternately.</p>
<p>“Since this is a good chance&#8230;why don’t you shake hands with Marise, too?”</p>
<p>“Eh? T&#8230;T-T-That’s right. Kurt is our friend too, right? I-I look forward to working with you”</p>
<p>I shook hands with Marise, too.</p>
<p>Lara continued to smile the whole time, but Marise shyly had her head down and averted her gaze.</p>
<p>“Now&#8230;this kind of thing is nice, but don’t let your guard down yet, you two”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“A Behemoth is coming this way. Let’s engage it here”</p>
<p>Hearing my words, Marise let go of her hand and said in a panic.</p>
<p>“T-That’s absurd! When you think of a Behemoth, isn’t it a &lt;&lt;Disaster-Class&gt;&gt; monster!”</p>
<p>Behemoth is a &lt;&lt;Disaster-Class&gt;&gt; monster…?</p>
<p>Wasn’t it the kind of monster that children who just started learning magic used to hunt when they were practicing in my previous life?</p>
<p>Without a doubt, it’s stronger than a Lizardman or an Evil Bird.</p>
<p>But to me, they were more akin to small animals than monsters.</p>
<p>They aren’t even a threat.</p>
<p>“Hmm, what’s the matter? Perhaps both of you are excited that a Behemoth is coming?”</p>
<p>““I’m scared!””</p>
<p>cried the two.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Behemoth came up before us.</p>
<p>“H-Huge!”</p>
<p>Lara looked up at the Behemoth.</p>
<p>Behemoth is a giant four-legged monster.</p>
<p>“GUOOOOO!”</p>
<p>Behemoth raised its front legs to intimidate us.</p>
<p>“Both of you stand back, I’ll settle this in 3 seconds”</p>
<p>“Even if it’s Kurt, 3 seconds is just impossible!”</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>For me, it’ll be as easy as yawning for 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Behemoth came at us with a roar.</p>
<p>I unsheath my sword and jumped after covering myself with Body Strengthening Magic.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a lot of nerve to come at me”</p>
<p>I got over the Behemoth’s head in no time at all.</p>
<p>The Behemoth doesn’t seem to be able to keep up with my movements.</p>
<p>I enchanted the sword itself with |Sharpness| magic.</p>
<p>I immediately went to the front of the Behemoth, and then severed its head and torso.</p>
<p>“If it’s a Behemoth, then that is all there is to it, I suppose”</p>
<p>The Behemoth’s body slowly fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“W-What happened!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It was too fast for me to see”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise came running up to me.</p>
<p>“It’s called Enchantment Magic. Instantly strengthening the sword&#8230;hmm?”</p>
<p>I looked at the sword I had brought with me.</p>
<p><strong><em>*Crack*</em></strong></p>
<p>“Whoa! The sword cracked!?”</p>
<p>Lara’s eyes widened in surprise when she saw it.</p>
<p>The sword then shattered into pieces. It made a sound like glass shattering.</p>
<p>“Hmm…as I thought, the sword provided by the academy couldn’t keep up with my Enchantment Magic”</p>
<p>I stroked my chin as I looked at the sword with only the handle left intact.</p>
<p>The sword couldn’t withstand my magic power and disintegrated from the inside.</p>
<p>If it was a cheap sword, I wouldn’t be surprised that it happened.</p>
<p>Or rather, I’m amazed that it had endured this long.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to buy a new sword that’s a little sturdier when we leave the Labyrinth”</p>
<p>I muttered.</p>
<p>“Now&#8230;it’s about time we return to the Royal Capital. That’s all for today. It would be great if I could get to the 100th layer, but&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Please don’t say something so outrageous such as going to the 100th layer!”</p>
<p>“Strangely enough, if it’s Kurt, I can’t help but think that he might just be able to do it”</p>
<p>But I need money to buy a new sword.</p>
<p>I want to use the magic stone to process weapons and stuff like that&#8230;.</p>
<p>In that case.</p>
<p>“Should I bring back the Behemoth with us?”</p>
<p>I shifted my gaze to the fallen Behemoth.</p>
<p>“How are you going to bring it back though?”</p>
<p>“Lara, it has to be dismantled first to bring it back. Even so, it’s not possible for the three of us to dismantle it completely&#8230;”</p>
<p>“What a waste”</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped”</p>
<p>What are they talking about?</p>
<p>“Let’s bring back all of it”</p>
<p>““Eh?””</p>
<p>“Yosh”</p>
<p>When I held my hand up to the Behemoth, a pale light appeared.</p>
<p>By the time, the light disappeared.</p>
<p>“T-The Behemoth is gone?”</p>
<p>“Where did it go!”</p>
<p>Lara placed a hand over her mouth, and Marise leaned forward in surprise.</p>
<p>“I used Storage Magic. This way, we can bring all of it back with us without the need to do troublesome jobs such as dismantling, right?”</p>
<p>That being said, I personally don’t really like Storage Magic. While using Storage Magic to carry things around, I would have to constantly consume my magic power all the time.</p>
<p>Although this isn’t enough to cause me to run out of magic power, it does make me feel somewhat uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Storage Magic! Wasn’t that a lost magic!?”</p>
<p>“I’ve only seen it in books&#8230;”</p>
<p>It seems like Storage Magic isn’t common in this world either.</p>
<p>Just which one is the common one and which one isn’t common….</p>
<p>Well, let’s look into that slowly.</p>
<p>“With this, I don’t have any regrets left. Let’s get out of the Labyrinth”</p>
