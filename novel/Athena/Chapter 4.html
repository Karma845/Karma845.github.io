<h2>Chapter 4</h2>


<p>Shu, facing me, had a truly calm expression.</p>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, he must have thought about various things during these two months. If it’s heading in a positive direction, I have no objections… Now, I really want to hear what Shu has to say.</p>



<p>“I’ve thought about a lot… Since I stopped talking to you guys and spent more time alone. In the end, I realized I was only thinking about myself, and I hadn’t really thought about you or Ayana… It was just as you pointed out to me on the rooftop.”</p>



<p>Shu said that much and then looked away from me, gazing up at the sky. From his profile, I could sense an atmosphere as if a burden had been lifted, so it seemed unlikely that we’d end up arguing like we did on that rooftop.</p>



<p>“At that time, I didn’t try to understand the meaning behind your words, no matter how much I thought about it… But now I understand. It’s really too late, I wish I had realized it sooner.”</p>



<p>“Well, it was indeed late.”</p>



<p>“Yeah… Seriously, I’m at my wits’ end.”</p>



<p>With that, Shu cut his words short and stood in front of me.</p>




<p>“First of all, Towa… I want to apologize to you. The apology in that hospital room wasn’t enough.”</p>



<p>“No, that wasn’t your fault.”</p>



<p>“No, it was an accident caused by my carelessness. So Towa… I’m really sorry.”</p>



<p>With a serious expression, Shu bowed deeply to me.</p>



<p>Accepting this apology brought back memories of that time within me… It’s no longer a trauma since it’s a past we’ve overcome, and it’s not something to condemn again.</p>



<p>That accident… certainly happened as I tried to protect Shu, who was absent-minded.</p>



<p>However, it seemed there were still words Shu needed to say.</p>



<p>“Towa, you were someone I admired. You were good at studying, good at sports, and above all, kind and cool… But you never flaunted any of that. While I admired you for being so amazing, at the same time, I felt intense jealousy.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>




<p>Shu’s voice was trembling, but he wasn’t shedding tears.</p>



<p>He struggled to hold back the tears that threatened to spill over, and continued speaking.</p>



<p>“I remembered what Ayana said to me… why I laughed at you when you were in despair. I laughed at you out of jealousy… I laughed at you when you were desperate because you couldn’t participate in the competition… I… I…”</p>



<p>At that point, Shu couldn’t hold back his tears any longer.</p>



<p>Shu, shedding large tears, desperately tried to stop them from flowing by bringing his hands to his eyes… Ahh, he really is such a crybaby.</p>



<p>“…Seriously, you’re still a crybaby even in high school.”</p>



<p>Unable to bear watching Shu like that, I stood up and hugged him.</p>



<p>It’s a shame it’s not Ayana I’m holding… I couldn’t help but smile wryly at that thought, and I gently stroked his back to calm him down.</p>


<img src="https://i0.wp.com/soafp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-4.jpg?w=608&ssl=1" alt="" />


<p>“I accept your apology… so don’t cry about it anymore.”</p>




<p>“Towa… I…”</p>



<p>“Come on, don’t get snot on my shirt, okay?”</p>



<p>I said that, but it was already too late. My shirt was already stained with Shu’s tears and snot. A~ah, I’m probably going to get questioned about this by my mom.</p>



<p>“I thought you’d end up crying, seeing your determined face slowly starting to tremble. You really thought things through.”</p>



<p>By admitting the reality he didn’t want to face, Shu must have struggled. By reflecting on himself, he could calmly analyze the situation around him, which he hadn’t been able to see before… that led to the Shu of today and, consequently, this apology.</p>



<p>“I want your forgiveness… no, it’s okay if you don’t forgive me. But I wanted to apologize to you… Even if I’m told it’s unnecessary, the regret from back then continues to haunt me… so I wanted to apologize to you.”</p>



<p>“Yeah… I understand.”</p>



<p>“And… I wanted to say this too. I… liked the time we spent together with everyone. That’s why I want to talk to you and Ayana again… and I just hope you two will be happy.”</p>



<p>“Yeah…I get it.”</p>




<p>No matter what form it takes, it’s painful and sad when someone you’ve always been with starts to leave… even if you think it’s not worth worrying about, it will continue to weigh on your heart.</p>



<p>“Thanks. I’m glad we could talk like this.”</p>



<p>“Yeah… yeah…!”</p>



<p>A~ah, he’s crying even more now.</p>



<p>But that’s how it’s always been… Shu is a crybaby, and Ayana and I have comforted him like this many times before.</p>



<p>“I accept your apology again. But as I said before, both Ayana and I have started to move forward. So I don’t mind anymore, and I don’t worry about it. So don’t worry about it… Shu, you too, hold your head up high and move forward.”</p>



<p>“Towa… thank you.”</p>



<p>Well, I continued.</p>



<p>“To be honest, it’s not like I didn’t care. Even though we had those misunderstandings, it wasn’t a lie that we laughed like idiots together… hey Shu, remember when we played soccer together and Ayana swung and missed so badly?”</p>




<p>“…Of course I do. We laughed at Ayana when she fell over.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, yeah! And then Ayana got all mad and chased us with that scary face.”</p>



<p>“At that time, Ayana was faster than Towa, so I was surprised.”</p>



<p>“That’s right.”</p>



<p>Shu was still crying, but I was relieved to see his smile had completely returned.</p>



<p>Thinking back, it was clear that what we really needed was a conversation, but what Shu needed most was time to reflect on himself.</p>



<p>“Ah, there’s one more thing I haven’t responded to.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>I separated from Shu for a moment and extended my fist toward him.</p>




<p>“I’ll take care of Ayana. We’ll definitely be happy together. I’ll protect her smile forever.”</p>



<p>Shu nodded in response to my declaration.</p>



<p>“Yeah… Towa and Ayana will be fine. I’m rooting for you.”</p>



<p>And then, our fists lightly collided.</p>



<p>This scene could easily be from a youth drama or a fantasy story, with a reconciliation scene.</p>



<p>“Today… was a good day. I almost forgot about the morning anxiety.”</p>



<p>“Anxiety?”</p>



<p>“Ah, it’s nothing. Want another juice?”</p>



<p>“Sure. This time, I’ll treat you.”</p>




<p>“Thanks.”</p>



<p>Yeah, there’s clearly no longer any barrier between us.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t completely awkward either. With this, one of the big obstacles in my path has been removed.</p>



<p>“So Towa, what are you going to do now?”</p>



<p>“I’m bored, so I think I’ll go home now.”</p>



<p>“I see. Then I’ll head home too.”</p>



<p>“Are you going to talk to Ayana about this?”</p>



<p>“You know Towa, I still think I’m a coward. I gathered the courage to talk to you today, so I want to pick another day to talk to Ayana.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>




<p>Well, I think that’s fine. Certainly, Shu seemed admirable today, but at the same time, he seemed to be pushing himself… For now, I think it’s best to give him time to calm down, and if he wants to talk to Ayana again, I’m willing to help.</p>



<p>“When that time comes, I might be nervous in many ways. Because Ayana’s charm is incredible, especially since she’s with you.”</p>



<p>“Ah, you’re saying something nice. That’s right, Ayana’s charm knows no bounds.”</p>



<p>“Haha, Towa, you’re saying that kind of thing too.”</p>



<p>“I do. About my cute girlfriend, I can say it as much as you want.”</p>



<p>But… now that it’s come to this, there’s something I want to ask.</p>



<p>“What about you, Shu? Especially with Iori… I mean, the student council president?”</p>



<p>“I-Iori…!?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, she stood next to you this morning.”</p>




<p>“…!”</p>



<p>Shu blushed so clearly that it was almost comical.</p>



<p>I think it might be rude to ask any further, but as childhood friends, these things do pique my curiosity!</p>



<p>“I talked to her… I mean, she listened to me today. I gathered the courage to do it myself today, but she’s the one who gave me the strength to start walking forward again.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“…Not just Iori. Mari also reached out to me… I apologized for ignoring her all this time.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>Apart from Iori, it seems things have settled with Maria as well. It’s not something I should be asking about here… Ayana might ask subtly, but anyway, I’m glad.</p>



<p>(But… now I’m curious about where these two are headed.)</p>




<p>What will happen with Shu and Iori… I’ll watch over them and lend a hand if something happens—it’s for my childhood friends.</p>



<p>“But really, when was the last time we walked together like this?”</p>



<p>“Yeah… Even though it’s been quite a while, two months ago this was normal.”</p>



<p>“Yeah…”</p>



<p>From then until we parted ways, we walked… It was during that time.</p>



<p>It was a place with poor visibility, but without checking, a moped turned the corner.</p>



<p>“!?”</p>



<p>“Towa!”</p>



<p>Shu grabbed my shoulder in surprise and pulled me back.</p>




<p>Thanks to that, we didn’t collide with the moped, but the young man riding it bowed deeply, looking very apologetic, and then hurried away.</p>



<p>“That was close…”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I think he should have at least apologized instead of just bowing his head.”</p>



<p>Certainly, it was that close.</p>



<p>I think I reacted in time to avoid a collision… but I was saved by Shu this time.</p>



<p>“Haha, I guess I was the one who got saved this time?”</p>



<p>“This time… Towa! That’s not something to joke about, you know!?”</p>



<p>“Sorry, sorry. Well, it’s been quite a while since then, and thanks to what happened earlier, I can say this now. It would be nice if someday, when we talk about old times, we can laugh about this incident too, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>“It’s not something to joke about!?”</p>




<p>It’s just a wish that we could laugh about it someday when reminiscing about the past, even if it’s a joke.</p>



<p>“I can’t let that happen again. If something like Towa getting into an accident happens in front of me again, I don’t think I’ll ever recover.”</p>



<p>“My bad, seriously, I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>“I mean it!”</p>



<p>After that, needless to say, I found myself apologizing to Shu several times. Later, we parted ways at the fork that leads to each other’s homes… Just as I thought earlier, I feel refreshed as if a large burden has been lifted off my shoulders.</p>



<p>“….Hehe.”</p>



<p>Almost unintentionally, I burst into a surprisingly innocent laughter, feeling unusually cheerful right now.</p>



<p>Right after I decided to talk to Ayana about this tonight, I coughed a bit stronger than I intended.</p>



<p>“Cough!? Cough!?”</p>




<p>It was such a big cough that I involuntarily stopped walking.</p>



<p>It was intense enough that I had to lean my back against a utility pole, but no matter how much I coughed, the uncomfortable tickling sensation in my throat wouldn’t go away.</p>



<p>“… Could it be a cold? … Cough!?”</p>



<p>No, I probably don’t have a cold… But seriously, this cough won’t stop.</p>



<p>I could endure it if I tried… But still, my throat is tickling, and without coughing, I can’t feel even a moment of relief.</p>



<p>“Towa-boy, are you okay?”</p>



<p>“… Eh?”</p>



<p>At that moment, I was approached while rubbing my back.</p>



<p>The voice was gentle and comforting, and the way she called me was familiar. I couldn’t believe it when I looked up.</p>




<p>“Cough… Kanzaki-san?”</p>



<p>“That’s right, it’s me. Here, calm down and drink some water… It’s my half-empty bottle, but please help yourself.”</p>



<p>“I don’t particularly mind that… Thank you.”</p>



<p>I took the PET bottle from Kanzaki-san and gulped it down eagerly.</p>



<p>While the tickling sensation didn’t completely disappear, the water helped alleviate it to some extent.</p>



<p>Gradually, the intense cough subsided, and I finally felt relieved enough to take a breath.</p>



<p>“Is it a cold?”</p>



<p>“No… My throat suddenly started tickling while I was walking… Ah, thanks for the water.”</p>



<p>“It’s fine. But I was surprised, you know? Towa-boy suddenly coughing so violently… Are you really okay?”</p>




<p>“Yes, I’m okay… I think?”</p>



<p>Wait, huh? Behind Kanzaki-san… is someone there?</p>



<p>Thanks to the cough subsiding, I noticed, but there was a woman standing behind Kanzaki-san… She seemed to be in her late twenties, very beautiful, but like Kanzaki-san, she gave off a somewhat cold impression.</p>



<p>“… Who are you?”</p>



<p>“Oh, this one’s my underling. And she’s a big fan of Ane-san.”</p>



<p>“A big… fan?”</p>



<p>My mom’s fan… What is she talking about with a fan for my mom?</p>



<p>Looking at the woman again, she blushed slightly and bowed her head shyly towards me.</p>



<p>“This kid looks cool on the outside, but she’s actually shy. But she’s like my secretary, good at her job.”</p>




<p>“I see… Well, I won’t ask for details.”</p>



<p>“That’s the spirit.”</p>



<p>If Kanzaki-san’s family background is like that, I thought they might have subordinates or something… But to actually have one.</p>



<p>“… Fue.”</p>



<p>However, that cough earlier was really bad.</p>



<p>I want to believe it’s nothing serious, but I’ll make sure to check my temperature before going to bed so I don’t worry Ayana or my mom.</p>



<p>“A roundabout indirect kiss with Towa-boy, huh~”</p>



<p>“Kanzaki-san, you really don’t mind saying things like that, do you?”</p>



<p>“Ara… Towa-boy, you really don’t see me as a woman, do you?”</p>




<p>“Please don’t look so disappointed.”</p>



<p>I wasn’t sure how serious she was, so I was at a loss for how to react. Hearing this, Kanzaki-san burst into laughter, as if her earlier concern had been a lie, and playfully patted my back.</p>



<p>“You dodged that like a pro, Towa-boy… Truly, you’re something else.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean…?”</p>



<p>“Well, if nothing happened, then that’s fine. We’re heading off now, but we’ll visit you again sometime. Oh, and if you see us around town, feel free to say hi~”</p>



<p>“O-Okay.”</p>



<p>I waved back enthusiastically as Kanzaki-san left, then resumed my journey homeward.</p>



<p>I cleared my throat a few times and checked my throat, feeling remarkably clear.</p>



<p>Maybe it really wasn’t anything serious after all.</p>




<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>As I neared home, I noticed a message from Shu had arrived.</p>



<p>“Thanks for today, Towa. I’m going to face Kotone and Mom properly. You’re an important childhood friend to me.”</p>



<p>“… This guy, he’s really changed.”</p>



<p>Kotone and Hatsune-san… Shu’s family, and for me, people with whom there’s an unspoken connection.</p>



<p>Things have turned out well for Shu, but I’ve resigned myself to not being able to get along with them… I’ll tell Shu not to strain himself and that there’s no need to worsen family relations because of me.</p>



<p>“But it wouldn’t hurt if I laid it out straight to Iori sometimes… Maybe that would actually be a good thing.”</p>



<p>Thinking about such matters, I arrived home. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Once I arrived home my mother greeted me, her head tilting slightly in curiosity, then she flashed a smile.</p>



<p>“It seems like something good happened for you, Towa, something you genuinely feel good about.”</p>



<p>“Yeah… Something did. I managed to reconcile with a childhood friend.”</p>



<p>Just saying “childhood friend” should let my mom know who it is.</p>



<p>My mom’s eyes widened briefly in surprise, but then she quickly smiled and gently patted my head.</p>



<p>“Hey, why are you patting my head?”</p>



<p>“Fufu, isn’t it nice? Lately, everything seems to be going well for you, Towa. It’s all because of the results you’ve been pulling in.”</p>



<p>“… Yeah, I think I’ve been working really hard these past few months.”</p>




<p>“You sure have. I think you’ve been doing incredibly well.”</p>



<p>My mom didn’t press for more details and instead hugged me tightly.</p>



<p>…Ah, being embraced by my mom like this really calms me down… It’s oddly comforting, almost like my head is floating… All my exhaustion just melts away.</p>



<p>“W-wait a minute. Towa, your face is really red?”</p>



<p>“… Eh?”</p>



<p>My face is red…?</p>



<p>Could it be because I’m embarrassed by my mom hugging me…?</p>



<p>“…I’ll touch your forehead.”</p>



<p>My mom’s hand touched my forehead, and the cool sensation felt pleasant.</p>




<p>“Mom… Could it be?”</p>



<p>“Yes, you have a high fever. Go lie down in bed right away.”</p>



<p>“… Alright.”</p>



<p>I let out a deep sigh and headed to my room.</p>



<p>Using the thermometer my mom handed me on the way to my room, I measured my temperature. It wasn’t just a small fever; it was quite high, and as soon as I realized this, my body started trembling uncontrollably.</p>



<p>“… S-so cold.”</p>



<p>And then a sudden wave of chills hit me.</p>



<p>Aside from the discomfort of my whole body tingling, my head was spinning and I felt nauseous.</p>



<p>“Cough… Cough…”</p>




<p>It’s gotten to the point where the cough won’t stop… Damn it.</p>



<p>“Really… I finally had a good talk with Shu and felt so relieved, but why does this have to happen now?”</p>



<p>“Towa, I’m coming in.”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“How’s your fever?”</p>



<p>“It’s quite high.”</p>



<p>“I see… Then you’ll be taking the day off tomorrow.”</p>



<p>“…I figured that would be the case.”</p>



<p>“But isn’t it fine? It’s not bad to stay home and rest while your classmates are studying. Oh, but I wonder if Ayana-chan will feel lonely.”</p>




<p>Setting aside the first part of her words, Ayana would probably feel lonely, but I don’t want to worry her more than necessary… Come to think of it, it’s been quite a while since I caught a cold.</p>



<p>“Knowing Ayana, she might be unable to concentrate in class because she’s worried.”</p>



<p>“You’re saying that, Towa? But yeah, that seems likely! She might even leave early because she can’t bear it anymore.”</p>



<p>“Well…”</p>



<p>It’s hard to deny.</p>



<p>Well, it’s not like I’m too unwell to make a phone call, so before going to bed, I should call Ayana to let her know about catching a cold and briefly talk about Shu.</p>



<p>“Mom, I’m fine now, so I don’t want to worry her about catching a cold.”</p>



<p>“Sick people shouldn’t worry about others. But that’s true… Anyway, I’ll bring some rice porridge over later.”</p>



<p>“Thanks.”</p>




<p>And then Mom left the room.</p>



<p>Until Mom brought the rice porridge, there was nothing… no, I couldn’t do anything. Not only was my body hot and making it hard to sleep, but I was also feeling unusually down, whether due to the cold or not.</p>



<p>“… Haa.”</p>



<p>And I’ve been sighing repeatedly since earlier.</p>



<p>It’s weird… I can even say that myself. Is it because of the cold?</p>



<p>“Towa, can I come in?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>With rice porridge in hand, Mom entered the room again. She saw me struggling to get up due to joint pain and offered her hand… Today, Mom is exceptionally kind.</p>



<p>“Hey, do you think I’m unusually kind today?”</p>




<p>“Hmm… You figured it out pretty quickly?”</p>



<p>“It’s because it’s you. Always overwrite the ‘always kind’ information.”</p>



<p>“Haha… Yeah, that’s right. Mom is always kind.”</p>



<p>She laughed heartily and then tried to feed me the rice porridge, despite my protests.</p>



<p>She didn’t have to go that far, but Mom wouldn’t budge.</p>



<p>In the end, I let Mom feed me everything.</p>



<p>“Thank you for the meal.”</p>



<p>“You’re welcome. Since you probably won’t be hungry, I’ll make something light for you later.”</p>



<p>“Thanks a lot.”</p>




<p>“It’s okay… Fufu, Towa looks so fragile today, maybe because of the cold. It’s quite refreshing.”</p>



<p>Well, it’s because of the cold.</p>



<p>I don’t want her to be satisfied with such things, but Mom kept saying how cute I am and patting my head before leaving.</p>



<p>Honestly… My mom really loves me too much, it’s troublesome.</p>



<p>It’s not troublesome in the literal sense… I’m just troubled by how much she cares about me in a good way.</p>



<p>“… Alright, I’ll call Ayana.”</p>



<p>Even though my body still felt hot and my head was foggy, eating the rice porridge helped me regain some energy to a certain extent. However, I still felt intense chills, so I wrapped myself up in the blankets and called Ayana… but she didn’t answer even after waiting for a while.</p>



<p>“Maybe she’s in the bathroom… well, these things happen.”</p>



<p>Come to think of it, it’s strange for her to usually pick up after just one ring of my call. My head is starting to feel fuzzy… Maybe I should just go to sleep soon.</p>




<p>I always want to hear Ayana’s voice, but today, perhaps because I’m weakened by this cold, I long for her voice more than ever… or maybe I’m just terribly lonely.</p>



<p>“… I’m feeling anxious.”</p>



<p>I said it out loud and understood… Oh, this anxiety is from earlier this morning.</p>



<p>“What… what is this feeling?”</p>



<p>My body began trembling more strongly… Is this really just a cold? Could there be some serious illness hidden beneath it all?</p>



<p>“… It’s cold.”</p>



<p>Am I… am I really this weak of a person?</p>



<p>At that moment, just when I was waiting anxiously, she finally called me.</p>



<p>“Ayana…?”</p>




<p>“Hello, Towa-kun? I was in the restroom, so I missed your call… Is something wrong with your health?”</p>



<p>“… Why?”</p>



<p>“I don’t know… Maybe. Your voice sounded a bit weak, and also, it’s just my intuition.”</p>



<p>“Haha… As expected of you.”</p>



<p>Truly, Ayana notices everything.</p>



<p>Her words and voice brought me relief, and not only did it lessen my loneliness, but it also eased the chills a bit.</p>



<p>“I’ve caught a cold… My temperature is quite high.”</p>



<p>“Even so, you called me!? I’m happy that you called, and it’s wonderful to hear your voice before going to bed! But please prioritize your own health!!”</p>



<p>Ah… I immediately understood that she was really angry.</p>




<p>Yeah… Even if it’s just a slight fever, with such a high temperature, I shouldn’t have called.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry… I just felt unusually lonely and anxious… I really wanted to hear your voice, Ayana.”</p>



<p>“… Well, if you put it that way, I can’t really tell you strongly to go to bed.”</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry… I actually wanted to talk about a lot of things, and I intended to finish today by talking about them.”</p>



<p>“I see… It does concern me… concern me a lot!”</p>



<p>“… Haha, I guess I should wait until I recover.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I can’t keep worrying Ayana any further, so I’ll just rest for today.</p>



<p>“I’ll end up taking the day off tomorrow… So Ayana, please don’t worry too much because I’m just down with a cold, okay?”</p>



<p>“When school ends, I’ll come visit you, okay? Maybe… um, if I can’t bear worrying, I might leave early and come over.”</p>




<p>“No, that’s…”</p>



<p>“Please forgive me. I’m sure my mom and everyone else would say the same.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>It’s Ayana we’re talking about, so I expected this. But… I’m still happy… that she cares this much, that she prioritizes me.</p>



<p>“In this case, I don’t think I should be happy… but… Ayana, I’m happy.”</p>



<p>“Fufu, I’m almost certain I’ll come, so I’ll contact Akemi-san in the morning beforehand. But… you seem much weaker than usual, Towa-kun… I’m sorry!”</p>



<p>That time must be when I had the accident… From Ayana’s perspective, it means that I seem very weak right now.</p>



<p>“You don’t need to apologize. Well then, Ayana, thanks for today.”</p>



<p>“No, no, I’ll definitely come tomorrow! … Um.”</p>




<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“If you find it difficult to sleep soon or wake up in the middle of the night feeling lonely… please feel free to call me. Don’t think it’s a bother, okay? I just want to reassure you, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>Unconsciously, Ayana seemed to be thinking about me. Her voice sounded more anxious than mine, who called because of anxiety. After hearing her voice like this, I couldn’t say I was lonely.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Ayana… but if you say that, I might not be able to.”</p>



<p>“W-well… that might be true!”</p>



<p>“I really feel relieved and grateful. I think I can sleep well tonight.”</p>



<p>“Is that so? That’s good… but! If you really feel lonely, please call me, okay? I won’t say I’m awake all the time, but if it’s you, Towa-kun, I’ll wake up!”</p>



<p>“That’s definitely the case, isn’t it?” </p>




<p>“Well then… see you tomorrow. Good night, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Good night, Ayana.”</p>



<p>With that, the call ended, and quietness returned once more. The anxiety and loneliness I held in my chest resurfaced, but Ayana’s voice lingered in my ears, canceling them out to some extent.</p>



<p>“Should I sleep while this feeling remains… Fuwaa”</p>



<p>Welcoming a big yawn that signaled the arrival of sleepiness, I closed my eyes.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>Since I was reincarnated into this world, I’ve been having a lot of dreams. I can’t count how many times I’ve thought that—though maybe saying that it’s that important or that unimportant would be going too far. I see things in dreams, whether they’re important or trivial, and I remember them.</p>



<p>And apparently, today’s dream was the worst nightmare I’ve ever had.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, goodbye.”</p>



<p>“Towa, goodbye.”</p>




<p>Ayana and Mom disappearing right before my eyes—it was such a damn shitty dream.</p>



<p>With sad expressions, the two of them disappeared into white smoke… I tried to reach out to them in an instant, but my hands cut through empty air, not allowing me to touch them.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun…”</p>



<p>“Towa…”</p>



<p>“Yukishiro-kun…”</p>



<p>“Yukishiro-senpai…”</p>



<p>Seina-san, Shu, Iori, Mari, and others I’ve met in this world—all of them were disappearing right before my eyes.</p>



<p>It wasn’t just people—this house where I live, this town, all of them were disappearing.</p>



<p>“What the hell is this…”</p>




<p>The scene before my eyes mercilessly wounded my heart, creating a gaping hole.</p>



<p>I just wanted to touch something, so I reached out… but as if rejecting me, everything disappeared.</p>



<p>“Ayana… Mom… everyone…?”</p>



<p>And then, everyone was gone… everything was gone.</p>



<p>I felt like everything I had built up, everything I had acquired, all the precious things had been mercilessly taken away from me… I woke up with that worst feeling.</p>



<p>“Eh!?”</p>



<p>When I opened my eyes, what greeted me was the ceiling of my room.</p>



<p>The sun was already up, and I could hear the chirping of birds from outside the window… I slowly got up, realizing that I was sweating profusely.</p>



<p>“…Feeling nauseous.”</p>




<p>My pajamas were sticking to my skin and it felt disgusting… and not just that, my body felt overwhelmingly heavy compared to yesterday.</p>



<p>“Where’s the thermometer…”</p>



<p>I picked up the thermometer placed beside my pillow and measured my temperature… indeed, it was quite high, to the point where I dryly chuckled.</p>



<p>“Even worse than yesterday… no wonder I felt so miserable.”</p>



<p>Actually, could this stickiness on my skin be because I didn’t take a bath yesterday…?</p>



<p>I wanted to take a shower… but my body felt so heavy that I didn’t even want to do that.</p>



<p>However, I wanted to relieve the dryness in my throat, so I went out to the living room, enduring the chills.</p>



<p>“Good morning, Mom…”</p>



<p>“Good morning, Towa… you look really pale!?”</p>




<p>“Yeah… seems like it’s gotten worse.”</p>



<p>Mom came over with a changed expression, but I had to stop her from getting too close just in case I might infect her with a cold.</p>



<p>(… Mom.)</p>



<p>Mom was right in front of me… and I felt so relieved because of that.</p>



<p>I almost felt like crying because Mom was here, probably because I remembered that damn nightmare… though no tears actually came out.</p>



<p>“It’s nice that you care whether I’ll catch it or not, but you can’t stop a mother from caring about her son in this condition, can you?”</p>



<p>“Ah…”</p>



<p>She put her hand on my forehead with a thud.</p>



<p>The cool sensation of her hand felt so good that I almost lost consciousness for a moment, but I managed to hold on somehow.</p>




<p>“We’re going to the hospital. Even if it’s just a cold, I want to be sure you’re okay.”</p>



<p>“…I understand.”</p>



<p>Mom immediately informed her workplace that she would be late, and after a while, I headed to the hospital in the car she drove.</p>



<p>The diagnosis result was just a cold.</p>



<p>Even though the severity of symptoms can vary from person to person, this time it seemed I caught a particularly nasty cold… truly unlucky, seriously.</p>



<p>“Towa, if anything happens, please contact me immediately? Ideally, I’d want to be there to nurse you all day.”</p>



<p>“I’ll be fine. Well then, Mom, good luck at work.”</p>



<p>“…Alright. I’ll see you later.”</p>



<p>When I came back from the hospital, Mom said she would take the day off to take care of me, but it was me who initially refused.</p>




<p>I’m a high school student, after all, not a kindergarten or elementary school student.</p>



<p>I can’t believe I’m at this age and still having such a bad cold, but it’s pathetic to have Mom take care of me around the clock.</p>



<p>“…Towa… Towa…?”</p>



<p>“Have a safe day, Mom.”</p>



<p>“Ugh… I’m off…”</p>



<p>After seeing Mom off, I quickly returned to my room because I wanted to lie down immediately.</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>I lay down on my bed and picked up my smartphone.</p>



<p>There was a morning greeting from Ayana and a message asking about my condition.</p>




<p>“She messaged quite a while ago… I should reply.”</p>



<p>I replied, saying I’m fine and there’s no need to worry.</p>



<p>I knew she was quite worried about me from yesterday’s state, so I didn’t want to cause her any more concern by telling her that my condition had worsened.</p>



<p>“…Fuu.”</p>



<p>Without waiting for a reply from Ayana, I closed my eyes.</p>



<p>I felt so drained… sleepy… lethargic… As I tried to drift off to sleep again, that uneasiness began swirling in my chest once more.</p>



<p>It felt like a whisper in my mind telling me it’s not safe to sleep… but I couldn’t resist the drowsiness—my consciousness drifted far away, and I distinctly heard a sound like something crumbling away.</p>

<p>[Third person PoV]</p>



<p>“……?”</p>




<p>The young man suddenly woke up.</p>



<p>“Eh… Why am I like this?”</p>



<p>He was puzzled to find himself asleep with his head on the desk, but quickly reasoned that it happened occasionally.</p>



<p>“…Did I doze off?”</p>



<p>On the desk in front of him, the desktop computer was still on, showing traces of casual web browsing.</p>



<p>“I managed to sleep like this… Impressive.”</p>



<p>He marveled at how he could sleep in such a position, yet sighed heavily at the thought of the electricity bill possibly increasing.</p>



<p>“This feels… unsettling.”</p>



<p>He muttered to himself. There was an inexplicable sense of discomfort lingering within him.</p>




<p>This place was his home, his familiar environment—his room, as his memories confirmed without doubt.</p>



<p>“Well, I’ll get over it soon.”</p>



<p>With that, the young man began his day, which swiftly passed by.</p>



<p>Throughout the day, he couldn’t shake off… couldn’t stop thinking about it.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the unsettling feeling never left, and it haunted him relentlessly, preventing him from concentrating on anything else.</p>



<p>“Senpai? Is something wrong?”</p>



<p>“!?!”</p>



<p>Lost in thought, he had forgotten about the woman beside him.</p>



<p>“Seriously! You’ve been like this all day, haven’t you? Even when I call out to you, you’re somewhere else. Is everything really okay? I’m genuinely worried.”</p>




<p>“…Sorry. It’s nothing.”</p>



<p>She was his junior—a young woman with long black hair, a well-defined face, and a figure that highlighted her curves distinctly… especially her ample ch*st. If she were to playfully press her body against his, it would be quite troublesome.</p>



<p>(Why does she even bother paying attention to someone like me?)</p>



<p>Come to think of it, had he ever met this girl before?</p>



<p>He couldn’t help but imagine how she might cry if he said something wrong. Yet, it didn’t seem so strange for her to be by his side.</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>“What’s up? Why are you staring at me like that… Hey?”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>“I-it’s getting embarrassing… but I’ll forgive you if you’re like this, Senpai!”</p>




<p>As he stared, the young woman blushed and fidgeted shyly.</p>



<p>Even such a gesture seemed adorable, adding to her charm, and the young man couldn’t help but acknowledge it.</p>



<p>(She reminds me of someone… Who was it?)</p>



<p>Although he wondered if there were another beauty like her around, he couldn’t shake the feeling of wanting her to be by his side, feeling as though he had vowed to keep her there forever.</p>



<p>(I… I…)</p>



<p>Who did he want to be with…?</p>



<p>Who did he want by his side…?</p>



<p>“Senpai?”</p>



<p>[Towa-kun?]</p>




<p>Suddenly, the image of the woman in front of him overlapped with someone else, and the young man widened his eyes in surprise.</p>



<p>He almost reached out his hand instinctively, but stopped himself, apologizing to the bewildered woman and trying to maintain his composure.</p>



<p>“I feel like something’s off with Senpai today. Maybe you should rest a bit?”</p>



<p>“…You might be right. Sorry about that.”</p>



<p>“It’s okay. Rest when you can, do your best when you have to… And when it gets tough, don’t hesitate to rely on me. Because that’s how we are, right?”</p>



<p>“…You…”</p>



<p>“So please, come back to me… I’ll be waiting.”</p>



<p>With those meaningful words as a farewell, the young man parted ways with the woman. After finishing all his errands, he returned home and time passed again in that room where he had awakened earlier.</p>



<p>“…”</p>




<p>He recalled the voice he thought he had heard while talking to his junior.</p>



<p>“Towa…?”</p>



<p>Towa… The young man knew that name. Not as someone he knew personally, but merely as a character’s name from a game stored in his memory.</p>



<p>“Surely it’s here…”</p>



<p>Living alone meant there was no need to hide it, so he quickly found it among the items near his computer.</p>



<p>“‘I Was Robbed of Everything’… and the fan disc.”</p>



<p>It was an eroge that the young man had become deeply engrossed in. Calling it just an eroge would be disrespectful; it was a game that captivated him with its story and characters.</p>



<p>He especially adored the heroine Ayane Otonashi and had played through both the main game and the fan disc multiple times.</p>



<p>“Towa… and Ayane.”</p>




<p>As he spoke the names of the characters from the game, Towa and Ayane, a strangely fitting sensation accompanied by lingering echoes settled in his ears.</p>



<p>Driven by an inexplicable force, the young man launched the game once again.</p>
