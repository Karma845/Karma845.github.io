<h2>Chapter 7: The Same Old You</h2>



<p>──One day after school.</p>



<p>Today, Kamome is on his way home alone.</p>



<p>Himawari is not with him.</p>



<p>She is still at school because she has a club activity today.</p>



<p>If possible, he would like to go home with her every day, but the club is one of her important activities.</p>



<p>He can’t take that away from her because of his own selfishness.</p>



<p>Above all…</p>



<p>『Kamome-kun, this.』</p>



<p>A short while ago, in the school corridor.</p>



<p>It was when he said goodbye to Himawari, who was heading to her club activity.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Himawari tugged at the front of her uniform and showed Kamome what was underneath.</p>



<p>『H-Himawari, we are at school…』</p>



<p>『N-No, that’s not what I meant.』</p>



<p>To Kamome who was flustered, Himawari, her cheeks blushing pink, pointed to her neck saying, “Here, here”.</p>



<p>Looking at it, she was wearing the necklace Kamome had given her the other day, hidden under her uniform.</p>


<p>『Oh, that’s…』</p>



<p>『Ehehe, I was so happy, I wore it to school.』</p>



<p>Himawari whispers with a smile.</p>



<p>『Himawari…』</p>



<p>Kamome says to such Himawari with a serious expression.</p>



<p>『Wearing accessories to school is against the school rules. If you get caught, it will be confiscated.』</p>



<p>Kamome warns her with a serious face.</p>



<p>It’s a serious response.</p>



<p>But after saying it, he hurriedly apologizes, saying, “Ah, s-sorry, I said something that doesn’t read the mood.”</p>



<p>『No, Kamome-kun, you are serious after all.』</p>



<p>In response, Himawari smiles.</p>



<p>『I’m sorry, this will be the last time I’ll wear it to school. But I was that happy.』</p>



<p>Then, looking around, she stretches up, brings her face close to Kamome’s ear, and whispers.</p>



<p>『There won’t be any teachers around after school, so I’ll keep wearing it until I get home today.』</p>



<p>With that, Himawari headed off to her club activities.</p>



<p>(…I didn’t know Himawari had that side to her.)</p>



<p>Accessories and piercings are technically prohibited by the school rules.</p>


<p>It’s a rule that has become a mere formality, except for the days when the school conducts inspections, but even so, Kamome felt a little happy that Himawari had broken that rule to wear his gift, even though he knew it was wrong.</p>



<p>A smile naturally appears on Kamome’s face.</p>



<p>Well──</p>



<p>With that thought in mind, Kamome rides the train, gets off at the usual station, and walks home.</p>



<p>As he walks through the landscape he has been familiar with since he was a child ── suddenly, he hears a rumbling sound from the sky.</p>



<p>Looking up, he sees dark clouds spreading.</p>



<p>「Looks like it’s going to rain…」</p>



<p>There are many sudden heavy rains this season.</p>



<p>I don’t have an umbrella, so I have to hurry home──</p>



<p>He thought so, and decided to speed up his pace.</p>



<p>And then.</p>



<p>「Huh?」</p>



<p>Just as he was about to reach home, he spotted a person leaning against a block wall, gazing up at the sky as if in a daze.</p>



<p>「…Eh?」</p>



<p>Inadvertently, he let out a voice.</p>



<p>Perhaps hearing Kamome’s voice, that person turned around.</p>



<p>「…Welcome back.」</p>



<p>The one who was there, was Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu? Why are you here?」</p>



<p>「…Because I thought that probably I could see you if I came here.」</p>



<p>When she said that, he realized.</p>



<p>That this is the alley where he used to play with Tsuyu when they were young.</p>



<p>It’s a place where they nurtured shared memories when Tsuyu was still living in the neighborhood of Kamome’s house.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Kamome looks at Tsuyu’s demeanor.</p>



<p>There is no trace of the disturbing atmosphere she showed when she suddenly seduced Kamome after meeting him for the first time in a long time, or when she followed him on his date to the amusement park.</p>



<p>Her toned-down expression and gloomy mood are shadowy and fleeting, causing concern and unease in his heart.</p>



<p>「Did you come to see me?」</p>



<p>When Kamome asks, Tsuyu silently nods.</p>



<p>「What’s the matter today…」</p>



<p>「I wanted to apologize for the other day.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu says hesitantly.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry that Akito suddenly hit you. Are you okay? Your injury…」</p>



<p>「No, I’m fine now. I just cut the inside of my mouth a little, it wasn’t a serious wound. So, don’t worry──」</p>


<p>「…I knew it, you were hurt.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s face looks like she’s about to cry.</p>



<p>Seeing her expression, Kamome is shaken.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu, I’m really okay. Why are you so…」</p>



<p>At that moment.</p>



<p>A cold sensation hit the tip of Kamome’s nose.</p>



<p>「Huh?」</p>



<p>Looking up at the sky, it was completely covered with dark clouds.</p>



<p>This is bad ── the moment he thought that, raindrops started pouring all at once.</p>



<p>「Uwaaaa!」</p>



<p>「Kyaa!」</p>



<p>They both let out a scream reflexively.</p>



<p>It was that intense.</p>



<p>It was a real downpour.</p>



<p>「T-Tsuyu! For the time being, my house is close! Let’s run for now!」</p>



<p>In the heavy rain that made it hard to see, Kamome and Tsuyu headed to Kamome’s house.</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>

<p>Escaping from the sudden heavy downpour, the two of them arrived at the Ooshima house.</p>



<p>They opened the front door and went inside.</p>



<p>「What should I do… I would feel bad if I came in such a soaked state.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu, who was completely soaked, looks at Kamome apologetically.</p>



<p>「Ah, wait a minute.」</p>



<p>However, he can’t leave her in that state.</p>



<p>Kamome went up to the house and brought back a bath towel.</p>



<p>「For now, use this.」</p>



<p>「Okay, thank you.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu borrows the bath towel and wipes her body.</p>



<p>However, her clothes are naturally still soaked from absorbing the water.</p>



<p>For now, they can dry her clothes using a dryer but…</p>



<p>「Tsuyu, do you want to use the bath?」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>At Kamome’s suggestion, Tsuyu looks up.</p>



<p>「You’ll catch a cold if you stay like that, and you might warm up if you take a bath. In the meantime, we can dry your clothes.」</p>



<p>「U-Uh, okay… I’ll just borrow the shower then.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu, who has wiped off some of the water, goes up to the house.</p>



<p>Kamome guides her to the bathroom.</p>



<p>「In the meantime, don’t worry. I’m the only one in the house right now. I don’t think anyone will see you.」</p>



<p>「Okay…」</p>



<p>After explaining how to use the bathroom, Kamome says, “Well then, I’ll go to my room to change,” and points to the ceiling.</p>



<p>It’s a gesture to say that his room is on the second floor.</p>



<p>「…Nee.」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu, who had been quiet until then, opened her mouth.</p>



<p>「If I go in first, Kamome’s body will get cold… Umn, should we go in together?」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>At Tsuyu’s unexpected suggestion, Kamome is at a loss for words.</p>



<p>「N-No, it’s okay. I’ll just wipe my body…」</p>



<p>Kamome hurriedly refuses.</p>



<p>Then, Kamome suddenly realizes and glares at Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「Are you trying to take advantage of my weakness like that again?」</p>



<p>As if to cover his embarrassment, Kamome says in a joking tone.</p>



<p>At his words, Tsuyu was silent for a moment ── then she laughed.</p>


<p>「You found out. Well, it’s okay, they say fools don’t catch colds.」</p>



<p>Leaving those words behind, she goes into the changing room.</p>



<p>「Who’s the fool.」</p>



<p>Kamome retorts that, but he was smiling secretly, feeling happy to be able to have such a casual exchange with her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>「…Well then.」</p>



<p>In Kamome’s room on the second floor.</p>



<p>As Kamome was changing, he heard the sound of someone coming up the stairs.</p>



<p>Could it be ── he thought and turned around…</p>



<p>「Ah, sorry. I came to your room without asking.」</p>



<p>「No…」</p>



<p>Tsuyu, who had just returned from the bathroom, came to Kamome’s room.</p>



<p>Now she is only wearing a bath towel wrapped around her body.</p>



<p>Kamome was involuntarily captivated by Tsuyu’s appearance.</p>



<p>Realizing this, Kamome shakes his head.</p>



<p>「It will take some time for your clothes to dry… um, would you like to sit?」</p>



<p>He pointed to the bed as he said this.</p>



<p>「Yes, thanks…」</p>



<p>Tsuyu nodded and sat down on the bed.</p>



<p>──Tsuyu, wrapped in a bath towel, is sitting on the bed.</p>

<p>Silence envelops the room.</p>



<p>The atmosphere is quite eerie.</p>



<p>…On second thought, it might have been better to give her something to change into and wait for her outside the room.</p>



<p>(…I feel like I’ve added another thing I can’t tell Himawari…)</p>



<p>Kamome thought to himself.</p>



<p>「…Etto, it’s not good to stay in that outfit, isn’t it?」</p>



<p>To dispel that atmosphere, Kamome switches to another topic.</p>



<p>「Something to change… Ah, I see.」</p>



<p>Kamome realizes.</p>



<p>That’s right, there is no clothes in this house that he could lend to Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Now that his mother isn’t here, there are no women’s clothes.</p>



<p>「It’s okay, you don’t have to be so attentive.」</p>



<p>In contrast, Tsuyu puts a smile on her face.</p>



<p>It was a self-deprecating smile.</p>



<p>「The fact that I came near your house on my own accord, and that I got caught in the rain, it’s all my fault.」</p>



<p>「No, but…」</p>



<p>At that moment.</p>


<p>The sound of something agile climbing the stairs was heard.</p>



<p>「Eh, w-what? Wasn’t there anyone else but Kamome?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu was frightened.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Kamome, who knew the owner of the footsteps, was about to say, “Ah, it’s okay,” when──</p>



<p>There, a large dog burst into the room where the door had been left open.</p>



<p>「Kyaa!」</p>



<p>「Ah, Barry!」</p>



<p>The large dog that entered ── Barry, the Samoyed owned by the Ooshima family, jumped onto Tsuyu, who was sitting on the bed, with all his momentum.</p>



<p>Barry leaped over Tsuyu’s body and rubbed the tip of his nose against her face affectionately.</p>



<p>「Eh, eh? Does Kamome’s house have a dog?」</p>



<p>「Yeah, it’s our dog. His name is Barry. You can rest assured. He’s used to people and doesn’t bite, even if it’s his first time meeting them.」</p>



<p>While playing with Tsuyu, Barry licked her face all over.</p>



<p>At first, Tsuyu was wary of him because he suddenly jumped on her, but she seemed to quickly let her guard down.</p>



<p>「Ahaha, that tickles! And it feels so fluffy and nice!」</p>



<p>Seeing Tsuyu laughing happily, Kamome also smiled.</p>



<p>…But.</p>



<p>There, he notices.</p>


<p>Due to being played with by Barry, the bath towel Tsuyu was wearing has completely come off.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu! Your towel!」</p>



<p>「Eh…」</p>



<p>Tsuyu also realized that she was completely naked.</p>



<p>Thanks to Barry’s close proximity, her chest and crotch are somewhat hidden by his white fur, but…</p>



<p>Still, from Kamome’s point of view, it’s an appearance that can’t be seen directly.</p>



<p>「I-I’ll get you some clothes to change into after all!」</p>



<p>「Y-Yeah, sorry for the weird appearance.」</p>



<p>Even Tsuyu, who was usually calm, blushed.</p>



<p>「…Eeto, could I borrow one of Kamome’s T-shirts? Something a bit oversized would be just right.」</p>



<p>「Okay, got it.」</p>



<p>Kamome took a T-shirt out of his drawer as he’s told and handed it to Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「Hey, Barry.」</p>



<p>Then, while making sure not to look at Tsuyu, he pulls Barry off and walks out into the hallway.</p>



<p>During that time, Tsuyu puts on the T-shirt.</p>



<p>“You can come back in now”, she called, and Kamome returned to the room.</p>



<p>「Ahaha, it’s so big.」</p>

<div><img src="https://sinkuredtranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/knav1ilus7.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div><p></p>


<p>There was the sight of Tsuyu, who had put on the oversized T-shirt.</p>



<p>It covered her upper body without any issues.</p>



<p>However, her lower body was just barely covered, with her thighs exposed from the hem down.</p>



<p>Moreover, Tsuyu wasn’t wearing anything other than the T-shirt, not even underwear.</p>



<p>Either way, it was hard to know where to look.</p>



<p>「You’ve really grown up.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu, who was innocently saying this while in such a provocative outfit, made Kamome’s heart flutter even more.</p>



<p>「B-By the way, is your foot… okay?」</p>



<p>He had sent Barry back to the first floor.</p>



<p>Returning to the room and sitting back down in the chair he was sitting before, Kamome changed the subject.</p>



<p>「…Eh?」</p>



<p>When asked, Tsuyu widened her eyes in surprise.</p>



<p>「You know, you sprained it the other day.」</p>



<p>「…Ah, right, that time.」</p>



<p>Reminded by Kamome, Tsuyu remembered.</p>



<p>It was a long time ago, but, when he ran into the scene where Tsuyu and her boyfriend were arguing, he pulled her along and ran away with her.</p>


<p>Her right ankle, which she had sprained at the time, was red and swollen.</p>



<p>「It’s okay. It’s completely healed now. The redness has gone down, see?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu lifted her own right foot and rubbed the ankle area.</p>



<p>Inevitably, by lifting her foot, the inner part of her thigh, which had been hidden by the hem of the T-shirt, was about to be exposed, and Kamome quickly averted his gaze.</p>



<p>(…This is bad! No matter what I say, the danger follows me!)</p>



<p>「But I was surprised at that time. Kamome, you’re pretty fast.」</p>



<p>Whether she knew of Kamome’s inner turmoil or not, Tsuyu continued the conversation.</p>



<p>「Cloud it be that, you do any sports? Like track and field?」</p>



<p>「Ah… yeah, I used to. But I don’t anymore.」</p>



<p>When he told her this, Tsuyu looked a little sad.</p>



<p>「Why did you quit? I mean, you were so amazing…」</p>



<p>「…After Tsuyu moved away from this town… I started track and field because I admired Tsuyu.」</p>



<p>There, Kamome confides in Tsuyu.</p>



<p>About his life after Tsuyu was gone.</p>



<p>「Eh…」</p>



<p>「Back then, Tsuyu was often featured in newspapers and online news as a hope of the track and field world. I started track and field because I wanted to chase after Tsuyu, who was like that. But from a certain time… maybe when I was in my second year of middle school, I stopped hearing Tsuyu’s name.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>


<p>「I didn’t know what happened, but that’s why I quit too.」</p>



<p>I’m pathetic.</p>



<p>While despising himself inwardly, Kamome speaks to Tsuyu as if repenting for his sins.</p>



<p>「…Originally, it was for impure reasons. I wanted to see Tsuyu, whom I admired, again… I thought that if I continued track and field, I might be able to meet you again someday at a big competition or something. I thought that then, I would be able to show you a more respectable side of myself, that I could impress you, and with that desire, I poured my heart and soul into track and field.」</p>



<p>「…I, see.」</p>



<p>When told this, Tsuyu’s face blushed as if her happiness and embarrassment were mixed.</p>



<p>And then, she was biting her lip in a somewhat sad way.</p>



<p>…A heavy atmosphere flows through the room.</p>



<p>Only the sound of the clock ticking resounds, and a lewd atmosphere floats.</p>



<p>「Speaking of which, Tsuyu, about your track and field…」</p>



<p>Trying to keep the conversation going, Kamome suddenly breaks off his words.</p>



<p>Because he noticed that Tsuyu’s gaze was directed at his body.</p>



<p>Tsuyu came to the room while he was wiping his wet body with a bath towel.</p>



<p>After that, because he somehow missed the timing, Kamome is still not wearing anything on his upper body.</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s gaze drifted from Kamome’s chest to his abs.</p>



<p>For Kamome, it was a gaze that gave him a thrilling sensation, as if her fingertips were touching his body.</p>



<p>「…Nee.」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu calls out to Kamome.</p>



<p>「With Himawari…」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>「…Have you already done it with Himawari?」</p>



<p>Not understanding the meaning of the sudden question, Kamome tilts his head.</p>



<p>「Done it, you mean…」</p>



<p>「So, have you made a move on her?」</p>



<p>When she said that, he finally understood the meaning of the question.</p>



<p>Kamome’s eyes go black and white.</p>



<p>「No, no… not yet.」</p>



<p>Somehow calming himself down and averting his gaze, Tsuyu continued to look at Kamome with a passionate gaze.</p>



<p>「…I asked you the same thing before, didn’t I?」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>「You know, the first time we met.」</p>



<p>That’s right, when he was invited to Himawari’s house and reunited with Tsuyu after several years.</p>



<p>He remembered being teased by Tsuyu and asked the same question because he had accidentally entered her room.</p>



<p>…Honestly, he wasn’t in a state to think right, or rather, he was a mess with various emotions mixed together, so it’s a vague memory.</p>

<p>「We couldn’t do it then, but… What do you say?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu leans closer.</p>



<p>「What do you mean…」</p>



<p>「Do you want to practice?」</p>



<p>「Prac, tice…」</p>



<p>「With, me.」</p>



<p>Kamome noticed that Tsuyu’s breath was uneven.</p>



<p>Even though it was the same line, he could tell that the feelings she’s holding in her heart are different from those at the time.</p>



<p>That gaze, that clinging gaze, conveys it to him.</p>



<p>A tremendous tension, as if his heart was being gripped, ran through his entire body.</p>



<p>「…N-No.」</p>



<p>But there, Kamome’s reason kicked in.</p>



<p>「That’s the kind of thing you do when you’re in a proper relationship.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>「We both have important people we shouldn’t betray. It’s not good.」</p>



<p>Kamome said, trying to be serious.</p>



<p>At that statement, Tsuyu was stunned and then──</p>


<p>「…You’re right. That’s normal. To seek comfort from someone else when you have a lover… something like that, it’s wrong, isn’t it?」</p>



<p>She said.</p>



<p>He probably thought he would be met with exasperation for his fossilized way of thinking, but it was unexpected.</p>



<p>「It would be bad for Himawari if we did this.」</p>



<p>「That’s right, and… it would be bad for Tsuyu’s boyfriend too.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>When he said that, Tsuyu made a painful face.</p>



<p>Again.</p>



<p>Every time the topic of her boyfriend comes up, Tsuyu always makes that face.</p>



<p>It’s the opposite of him and Himawari.</p>



<p>If they were building a happy and fulfilling relationship, she wouldn’t make that face.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu… I know it’s a little late for this, things aren’t going well with that boyfriend of yours after all?」</p>



<p>Kamome asks with a serious expression.</p>



<p>「…Probably, no, definitely, he’s cheating on me.」</p>



<p>In response to Kamome’s question, this time Tsuyu didn’t get angry.</p>



<p>Without evading or sidestepping, she said it.</p>



<p>Clearly, as if spewing out the pent-up frustration she had been holding back in her heart.</p>

<p>「…I say that, but it’s not the first or second time. You saw us arguing before, right? That was also because I found out he was with another woman, and we got into a fight…」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>「…So, the other day was supposed to be an apology date for that. But he was nearly an hour late for our meeting, and he didn’t even reply when I contacted him… He probably thinks I’m just a troublesome woman with a strong sense of restraint.」</p>



<p>「Tsuyu…」</p>



<p>Her voice was weak, her words disordered.</p>



<p>Really, just how much stuff had she been storing up ── it was enough to make one feel pained, seeing her now with such a pitiful expression.</p>



<p>「…To be honest, I had fun. Talking with Kamome, playing around, I was able to genuinely laugh from the bottom of my heart for the first time in a long while. That’s not a joke.」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu stares intently at Kamome.</p>



<p>「How about you, Kamome? I’ve changed a lot… but did you enjoy being with me? Or are you not interested in me anymore since I’ve changed?」</p>



<p>「That’s…」</p>



<p>Kamome was shaken by Tsuyu’s words.</p>



<p>Her words sounded as if she was depending on him.</p>



<p>As if she was asking for his help.</p>



<p>He can’t simply dismiss her.</p>



<p>If he rejects her here…</p>



<p>Even though he knows it’s wrong.</p>



<p>Even though he knows what he should say.</p>

<p>Words wouldn’t come out from his throat.</p>



<p>Cold sweat runs down Kamome’s cheeks like a waterfall.</p>



<p>Silence flows like an eternity.</p>



<p>「……Just kidding.」</p>



<p>Eventually, Tsuyu opened her mouth.</p>



<p>「It’s a lie, don’t worry about it.」</p>



<p>A cheerful smile on her face, filled with loneliness.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry for saying strange things. I must have troubled you. Forget what I just said.」</p>



<p>「Tsuyu…」</p>



<p>「It’s okay, I feel better after talking to Kamome. I’ve already come to terms with it, so I’m fine. I don’t care about that guy anymore. Or rather, I’m used to it. That’s the kind of man I’m suited for.」</p>



<p>With an unnaturally bright tone and expression.</p>



<p>「Besides, no matter what I say, he saved me in the past. So, I have to overlook a few things, you see?」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>…No, that’s not right.</p>



<p>He doesn’t know what happened in the past, but now, that guy is tormenting Tsuyu.</p>



<p>It’s not fair for Tsuyu to be bound by such a thing.</p>



<p>「I guess my clothes should be dry by now. And the rain has completely stopped, so I’ll be going.」</p>


<p>「Ah…」</p>



<p>Saying that, Tsuyu quickly leaves the room.</p>



<p>Then she headed to the bathroom and quickly changed into the clothes that had been put in the dryer.</p>



<p>「Here, thank you.」</p>



<p>The T-shirt is returned.</p>



<p>「Um, Tsuyu…」</p>



<p>After receiving it, Kamome calls out to her.</p>



<p>But even though he stopped her, he doesn’t know what to say.</p>



<p>「What is it?」</p>



<p>「…I’m worried after all.」</p>



<p>Her words from earlier.</p>



<p>Don’t worry about it ── even though she told him that, his heart won’t clear up of worry after all.</p>



<p>「I’m really fine.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu said so… but she probably doesn’t think so deep down either.</p>



<p>There is a faint shadow on her expression.</p>



<p>Seeing Tsuyu’s face like that made his heart disturbed even more.</p>



<p>He wants to do something for her.</p>


<p>He wants to help her.</p>



<p>But is it really okay to make that choice?</p>



<p>Is it a territory that he’s allowed to go deep into?</p>



<p>Hesitation and anguish run around.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Neither of them knows how to connect each other’s words.</p>



<p>A silence filled with hesitation and expectation flows for a few seconds──</p>



<p>「…W-Well, then.」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu broke the silence.</p>



<p>「Do you want to exchange contact information?」</p>



<p>「Contact information…」</p>



<p>「So we can consult each other if we have any problems. Just as a consultation partner, okay?」</p>



<p>「R-Right.」</p>



<p>There’re no guilty feelings.</p>



<p>He’s just worried.</p>



<p>While thinking something like, I don’t even know who I’m making excuses for, Kamome exchanged contact information with Tsuyu.</p>

<p>「Well then, sorry for today.」</p>



<p>「Ah, yeah.」</p>



<p>And then, she left Kamome’s house.</p>



<p>Kamome stood at the entrance, staring blankly at the messaging app where Tsuyu’s account was registered, for a while.</p>
