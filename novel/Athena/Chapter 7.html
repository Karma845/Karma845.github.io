<h2>[Stage-Sub] The Last Day</h2>

<p>Deep underground where even moonlight couldn’t reach.<br /> <br />In a room illuminated only by eerie flickering flames, Reina and I were conducting the final check of our plan.<br /> <br />This place would be familiar to Reina,<br /> <br />although she wasn’t the type to get emotional about it.<br /> <br />“Are you sure everything is prepared?”<br /> <br />“Yes, everything is proceeding smoothly.”<br /> <br />“That’s good, that’s good. I’ve raised you and nurtured you for ten years. Finally, the time has come for you to be of use to me. Make sure you do it properly.”<br /> <br />“I am sincerely grateful.”<br /> <br />I wonder what Reina is thinking under that emotionless mask-like face.<br /> <br />If a [vessel] to replace herself has appeared, she could have been more agitated… Well, it’s just a puppet, after all.<br /> <br />It’s downright creepy.<br /> <br />…Well, it’s fine. I only have a little more time to spend with this thing.<br /> <br />“We will definitely obtain Mashiro-Leiche this time.”<br /> <br />Opportunities with such favorable conditions for me don’t come by often.<br /> <br />The land of the Ramdarb Kingdom, where I can have as much leeway as I want.<br /> <br />An island nation far away from other countries, making it difficult for interference from the outside.<br /> <br />And the only academy head who thinks of me as an ally.</p>







<p><br />To capture Mashiro-Leiche, this is indeed the perfect opportunity.<br /> <br />The only concern is that damn brat’s unknown technique.<br /> <br />If that kid hadn’t put Mashiro-Leiche within his reach, things would have been much easier.<br /> <br />That brat is really getting in the way of my plans…!<br /> <br />“Damn it… If you had been more trusted by the Vellet…”<br /> <br />“I apologize sincerely.”<br /> <br />“It’s fine. I didn’t have much hope in that direction anyway.”<br /> <br />There aren’t many people who would care about such a person who doesn’t have a trace of sex appeal.<br /> <br />Especially considering the girls around Vellet that has been entertaining him.<br /> <br />“…It’s finally here. The realization of my ambition is near.”<br /> <br />I can feel that my lifespan is coming to an end.<br /> <br />It’s been common knowledge for a long time that the lifespans of talented magicians are short.<br /> <br />The days when things I could do in the past become impossible due to aging are more terrifying than the battlefield.<br /> <br />I don’t want that. I want to keep living. I want to wield my power to the fullest.<br /> <br />I want to go back soon. To the peak of my youth.<br /> <br />“…The final day. Do you know what you must do?”<br /> <br />“Of course. I haven’t forgotten the words that were given to me by Teacher. I will… “<br /> <br />“…That’s right. You must accomplish it without fail.”<br /> <br />“Yes. My life exists for Teacher’s sake.”</p>
