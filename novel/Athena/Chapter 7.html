<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p>On a holiday morning.</p>
<p><strong><em>── Knock, knock.</em></strong></p>
<p>I woke up early and was relaxing in my room when there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Hm… What&#8217;s the matter, Lara? It’s early in the morning.”</p>
<p>I opened the door and saw Lara.</p>
<p>“Kurt. It&#8217;s our day off, and I&#8217;m thinking of heading toward the city. I was wondering if you&#8217;d like to go with me?”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t mind, but… what about Marise?”</p>
<p>“Marise-chan is still sleeping. She was up late last night practicing her magic.”</p>
<p>She is as ambitious as ever.</p>
<p>But ── why does Marise work so hard?</p>
<p>I will ask her when I get the chance.</p>
<p>“Mmm, sure. I was free anyway.”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness…! Thank you.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll get changed, so please wait a minute.”</p>
<p>With that, I closed the door.</p>
<p>But still, for Lara to say that… I wonder if something happened.</p>
<p>At any rate, I put on the best clothing I had brought with me from the village and set out for the city with Lara.</p>
<p>“Wow, those crepes look delicious!”</p>
<p>While wandering around the city with Lara, we arrived at a large central plaza.</p>
<p>There, she was enticed by a crepe stall.</p>
<p>“Why don&#8217;t we eat now? It&#8217;s just about lunchtime, too.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>I used some of the rewards from defeating the behemoth in the &lt;&lt;Treasure Labyrinth&gt;&gt;, and paid for Lara&#8217;s crepe, too. We then sat down on a bench in front of the fountain.</p>
<p>“Mmmm, it’s delicious!”</p>
<p>Lara was smiling blissfully as she ate her crepe.</p>
<p>She was right, this is pretty good.</p>
<p>The fluffy dough is filled with fruits such as strawberries and grapes, which are then covered with whipped cream.</p>
<p>It was difficult to eat without leaving behind a mess, but once in the mouth, the sweetness spreads quickly.</p>
<p>“Does Lara like sweet things?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do! There&#8217;s no girl who doesn&#8217;t like sweet things!”</p>
<p>“Haha, I see.”</p>
<p>In my previous life, such peaceful moments were rare, so I feel quite comfortable in these moments.</p>
<p>“Oh, Lara. You&#8217;ve got cream on your mouth.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>I then wiped the cream off the corners of Lara&#8217;s mouth with my index finger.</p>
<p>“You are just like a child.”</p>
<p><strong><em>*Muuu*, </em></strong>“Don’t say that. It&#8217;s quite difficult to eat a crepe cleanly.”</p>
<p>Lara, who was acting a little upset, was cute and made me smile.</p>
<p>We were having a leisurely time while chatting about such things.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Lara suddenly exclaims.</p>
<p>A balloon floated away from the hands of a child who was running near us.</p>
<p>“Ahh, my balloon!”</p>
<p>The child jumped several times as he chased after the balloon.</p>
<p>But he could not reach it.</p>
<p>The balloon was soaring higher to the point that it went over the roof of a building.</p>
<p>“Kurt&#8230;! Can&#8217;t you do something about that…?”</p>
<p>“Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>I stood up and raised my right hand to cast a gravity spell on the balloon.</p>
<p>The balloon, which had flown higher and higher, suddenly descended and returned to my hand.</p>
<p>“Here you go. Don&#8217;t let go of it again.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Thank you, big brother!”</p>
<p>I returned the balloon to the kid, and he thanked me and left.</p>
<p>“Kurt is really amazing. That was so cool!”</p>
<p>“That was nothing. If you want… I can grab that sun for you, too.”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t be ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m kidding.”</p>
<p>That being said, it is possible to do that if I really want to, but there is no need for that now.</p>
<p>After finishing the crepe, we left the central plaza.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kurt. Can you listen to me?”</p>
<p>As we were walking, Lara suddenly stopped and looked back at me.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“E-Err… I&#8217;ve got something I want to tell you, Kurt. Don&#8217;t be surprised, okay?”</p>
<p>Just me?</p>
<p>I wondered if she had taken me out to the city to talk about it.</p>
<p>Lara, however, was reluctant to speak.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Kurt, you might come to dislike me if I say it. So that’s why…”</p>
<p>“I can already guess what you are going to tell me.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>I continued, disregarding Lara, who looked surprised.</p>
<p>“It’s about Lara&#8217;s mother being… the Great Spirit?”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“How did you know!?”</p>
<p>Lara opened her eyes even wider in surprise and spoke louder.</p>
<p>Well, looks like it was spot on.</p>
<p>I could not determine whether it was her father or mother, but… it seems like I got it right.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve seen Lara&#8217;s magic power many times. After all this time, there&#8217;s no way I won&#8217;t notice.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I-Is that so&#8230; Kurt really is amazing. You know everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sensed a strange magic power when I analyzed Lara&#8217;s magic power.</p>
<p>It was not only humans.</p>
<p>There were parts of the magic power that were quite similar to spirits.</p>
<p>It was mixed with a human&#8217;s magic power, so it was not possible to identify it immediately.</p>
<p>I have met spirits in my previous life.</p>
<p>A great spirit would have a body structure similar to that of a human, so it would theoretically be possible for a spirit to have a child with a human.</p>
<p>As expected, I had never seen a mixture of human and spirit magic power… Thousand years ago, people and spirits distanced themselves from each other. So it can’t be helped.</p>
<p>“What was your mother like?”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t remember much. She died when I was very young.”</p>
<p>“I see. Is it perhaps difficult for you to talk about it? If it&#8217;s hard, you don&#8217;t have to force yourself.”</p>
<p>“No… I want Kurt to hear it, so I will talk…”</p>
<p>Lara continued as if she had made up her mind.</p>
<p>“My father married my mother, who was a Great Spirit. But… a child born between a human and a spirit is creepy. That’s why I was bullied when I was little.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not very common. There will be some idiots like that.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, maybe because it’s not common. There are others, but… I&#8217;ve never seen them ── and anyway, children born to other species are considered creepy.”</p>
<p>I do not mean to dwell on race, but… I think I understand her feelings.</p>
<p>It was almost like a different being from a different race. It has not been common for humans to live with spirits or demons for a thousand years.</p>
<p>“So I fled the village with my father after my mother died… and in the next village, I lived hiding the fact that I was the child of a human and a spirit.”</p>
<p>“Was it because you thought you would be ostracized again?”</p>
<p>Lara nodded in response to my question.</p>
<p>“I have been trying to make friends in the village by being cheerful. I didn&#8217;t want to be alone anymore. Maybe because of that, I made some friends there.”</p>
<p>She may have been pushing herself, but it was probably due in part to Lara&#8217;s natural cheerfulness.</p>
<p>“Then why leave that village and come to the royal capital? Did you want to enroll in the magic academy that badly?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… Listen, Kurt. I hope you won&#8217;t laugh, but I want to go to the Magic City of Sternia.”</p>
<p>“Magic City of Sternia…”</p>
<p>As I recall, it was an imaginary city where those who had mastered magic or spirits were supposed to go after they died.</p>
<p>It often appears in children&#8217;s picture books.</p>
<p>There were no such stories a thousand years ago. So, it must be a fairy tale that was created in the past thousand years.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t remember much about it, but my mother always looked apologetic when she saw me being bullied all the time. She would say, <em>‘I&#8217;m sorry,’</em>&#8230; But I am grateful that she gave birth to me. So I want to go to the Magic City and tell my mother, <em>‘Thank you’.</em> That&#8217;s why I came to the Magic Academy. If I studied magic here, I thought I could learn something about Sternia.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you thought I was being childish, didn&#8217;t you? You don&#8217;t think there is such a magic city, do you?”</p>
<p>“Me? I don&#8217;t think of it that way.”</p>
<p>It is a fool&#8217;s errand to assume something is impossible and not try before doing it.</p>
<p>The magic city might even exist.</p>
<p>I do not know when the legend was made, but there must be a reason why it was created. Just because it might be hard to find doesn&#8217;t mean it does not exist.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Kurt.”</p>
<p>said Lara, and she then went on with a sudden look of anxiety.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kurt. Don&#8217;t you hate me? Won&#8217;t Kurt be weirded out by the fact that I&#8217;m a child born between a human and a spirit? Will you continue to be my friend?”</p>
<p>What, she was worried about such a thing?</p>
<p>I cannot help but smile.</p>
<p>I stroked Lara&#8217;s head and said,</p>
<p>“Why would I hate you? There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to hate Lara for that reason.”</p>
<p>I said reassuringly.</p>
<p>“R-Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it&#8217;s true.”</p>
<p>A child born between a human and a spirit is rare.</p>
<p>So why should we hate them?</p>
<p>No matter who a person or a spirit loves, what does that have to do with others?</p>
<p>So even the existence of Lara, the fruit of that love, to me, I was in a, <em>“So what of it?”</em> mood.</p>
<p>“Thank you… Kurt, I&#8217;ve been worried about this for a long time that Kurt would leave me after I said it.”</p>
<p>“It’s an unnecessary worry. Let’s go back to the dormitory now. We&#8217;ve walked around enough.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I turn my back to Lara.</p>
<p>“Kurt.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Lara called out to me again.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>The moment I turned around ── Lara&#8217;s face was right next to mine.</p>
<p>Lara pressed her lips over mine.</p>
<p>I could clearly hear Lara&#8217;s breathing. And I could feel her body temperature rising through her lips.</p>

<img title="TRM_Vol1_10" alt="TRM_Vol1_10" src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/trm_vol1/cache/TRM_Vol1_10.jpg-nggid0235-ngg0dyn-800x800x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg" width="563" height="800" style="max-width:100%;">

<p>“&#8230;It’s my thanks for today.”</p>
<p>After a while, Lara pulled her face away.</p>
<p>“Um, ah&#8230; thanks for today? I didn&#8217;t do anything.”</p>
<p>When I recall the sensation of the kiss earlier, I feel like I&#8217;m no longer my usual self.</p>
<p>“You are wrong. And not just today. I have received so much from Kurt.”</p>
<p>Before I could respond, Lara hurriedly turned away.</p>
<p>Her earlobes were so red that even from behind, I could see that her face was bright red.</p>
<p>Seriously… What was that all about?</p>
<p>I was more puzzled by this than by the fact that Lara was the child of a human and a spirit.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>After my outing with Lara, I was back in my room and sitting on the couch.</p>
<p>“Hm…? Good grief, here we go again.”</p>
<p>Lara and Marise are coming to my room.</p>
<p>In my previous life, assassins were often sent to me while I was relaxing in my room. Thus, I developed a habit of always deploying detection magic, even in my room.</p>
<p>“I wonder what they&#8217;re going to do this time…”</p>
<p>Eventually, the door to the room was opened.</p>
<p>“Kurt, is this a good time?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry to interrupt your leisure time, but… there&#8217;s something I really wanted to tell you.”</p>
<p>said the two girls in their uniform.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t mind. What is it?”</p>
<p>Lara wriggled her body, but eventually, as if she had made up her mind, she moved her face closer to me and said,</p>
<p>“Please! Please make me a woman now!”</p>
<p>S-She just said something outrageous.</p>
<p>“Lara! Kurt will misunderstand you if you say it like that!”</p>
<p>“What? Did I say something wrong?”</p>
<p>Marise blushed bright red and rebuked her, but Lara, who had her finger to her mouth, didn&#8217;t seem to understand.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll say it on behalf of Lara. Kurt, we… want to become stronger mages. To do that, we have to work harder…”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s right! I want you to make me a fine sorceress&#8230; and I will endure any kind of difficult training. So please teach me! I don&#8217;t want to lose to Marise.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s my line! I won&#8217;t lose to Lara either!”</p>
<p>&#8230;Oh boy.</p>
<p>Apparently, her <em>‘Please make me a woman’</em> meant <em>‘Please make me a stronger mage’</em>.</p>
<p>Lara surprises me again.</p>
<p>“Okay, I get it. I&#8217;ll teach you a simple magic exercise that you can do indoors.”</p>
<p>““Thank you very much!!””</p>
<p>Both of them said happily.</p>
<p>Normally, it&#8217;s important to take proper rest whenever it’s possible.</p>
<p>However ── they are so determined to become stronger. I cannot just dismiss their feelings.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t mind, but… why are you wearing uniforms?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m trying to get you to teach me magic. So I feel more motivated this way.”</p>
<p>“Me too.”</p>
<p>They were all set, huh?</p>
<p>I was more impressed by their feelings.</p>
<p>“Well, I&#8217;m going to teach you more about magic power control today. I taught you two chantless magic, right?”</p>
<p>They both nodded.</p>
<p>“The many tricks to chantless magic is to know how to construct the magic formula, flow of magic power, images, et cetera.”</p>
<p>The most effective way to do this is to control the magic power that flows within you.</p>
<p>In the case of chanting magic, the magic formula can be constructed to some extent by chanting out the magic formula itself.</p>
<p>Chantless magic, however, requires the control of magic power and the construction of a magic formula from scratch.</p>
<p>In that sense, chantless magic is more difficult, but considering what we will be doing in the future… their growth rate will be much faster if we choose this option.</p>
<p>“What is this magic power control?”</p>
<p>“Hmm. First of all… Right. Can the two of you lie down on the floor?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>At my instruction, the two girls lay down on the carpet.</p>
<p>Their uniform skirt is short, drawing my eyes to their two white thighs.</p>
<p>“Okay… Then, let&#8217;s get started.”</p>
<p>I will not feel like myself again if I look too much at it.</p>
<p>First, I put my hand on the hem of Marise&#8217;s jacket and&#8230;</p>
<p>“What are you doing… Kyaa!”</p>
<p>I flipped it up a little and touched her skin, and she let out a short scream.</p>
<p>“It may tickle you, but bear with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gently place my hand on her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>As I stroked it, I could feel the sensation of her smooth skin on my hand.</p>
<p>“W-W-W-W-W-What the hell are you doing!!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What are you misunderstanding here? I&#8217;m going to transfer you magic power now. You have to feel it with your whole body.”</p>
<p>In general, it does not have to be in the lower abdomen. It can be the hands or shoulders. But the method of transferring it from the navel area is the best way to distribute it through the entire body.</p>
<p>“M-Mmmmmm ── !!”</p>
<p>Marise&#8217;s body slightly arches back as the magic power is transferred to her.</p>
<p>Her hands are clutching the carpet as if she is trying to hold on to something.</p>
<p>…Was it a little intense to do it out of the blue?</p>
<p>“How do you feel?”</p>
<p>“Hm, it’s a strange feeling. The feeling is similar to the first time I was taught chantless magic&#8230; but, it is incomparable to that&#8230; and it kind of tickles my body.”</p>
<p>“The amount of magic power that is sent into your body has also increased. What do you want me to do, weaken it a little?”</p>
<p>“N-No! I&#8217;ll do my best if this is what it takes to make me stronger. Besides, it doesn’t feel that bad, so…”</p>
<p>Marise regained some of her composure and began to let the magic power take over.</p>
<p>Gradually, Marise&#8217;s magic power is concentrated on her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>“Kurt, me too, me too!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, of course. First of all, could you do what Marise did first?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Lara puts her hand on her jacket.</p>
<p>I meant to roll it up until I could see her belly button, but…</p>
<p>“H-Hey ──”</p>
<p>She just took off her jacket before I could stop her.</p>
<p><strong><em>*Boing*</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Two bulges wrapped in underwear become exposed.</p>
<p>There was a small red ribbon in the center that was so feminine and cute.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s the matter, Kurt?”</p>
<p>“You didn&#8217;t have to take it all off…”</p>
<p>“Ehh, why not? I’m starting to sweat. And Kurt&#8217;s seen it all when we were in the bath together. It&#8217;s embarrassing, but Kurt is special.”</p>
<p>“I-I see.”</p>
<p>It is going to be hard for me to concentrate.</p>
<p>&#8230;Well, that is fine.</p>
<p>She would not listen to me even if I stopped her, so I’ll just let her do what she wanted.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>I put my other hand on Lara&#8217;s lower abdomen.</p>
<p>“Mm, ahhh!”</p>
<p>The moment I touched her, Lara&#8217;s body shook a little. Her breasts swing in tandem, and almost spill out of her underwear…</p>
<p>I have to stay focused and try not to look at them as much as possible while sending in the magic power.</p>
<p>“Mm, ahhhh! T-This is amazing, Kurt!”</p>
<p>Lara arched her back and spoke sweetly.</p>
<p>“I can feel Kurt&#8217;s magic power throughout my body! Ahhh ── !”</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, that&#8217;s it. You have to feel the magic power.”</p>
<p>Before long, perhaps they were getting accustomed to the sensation of the magic power, and their breathing calmed down.</p>
<p>That being said, their bodies are still twitching.</p>
<p>However ── at this rate, they will be able to get the sense of controlling the magic power.</p>
<p>“Kurt… I&#8217;m kind of getting used to it.”</p>
<p>Marise spoke with beads of sweat on her forehead, as she breathed slowly.</p>
<p>Just as planned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, too. You can pour in more magic power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I want it too, please. I feel like I can get stronger that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both of them were still twitching, but they spoke as if they were desperate for something.</p>
<p>Mmm… I did not expect them to be this ambitious.</p>
<p>“T-Then let&#8217;s do it. But be prepared, okay? My magic power is nothing ordinary.&#8221;</p>
<p>They nodded resolutely at my call.</p>
<p>Mmm. It looks like they are ready for this.</p>
<p>I stroke their bellies and gradually increase the amount of magic power I pour into them.</p>
<p>“Aaah!”</p>
<p>“Nnngh!”</p>
<p>Their charming cries.>></p>
<p>Gradually, their legs spread open, revealing more of the underwear that hid their lower bodies.</p>
<p>Marise’s jacket also slipped off, exposing her brassiere just like Lara.</p>
<p>“Hang in there. We&#8217;re just getting started.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their cheeks were flushed bright red as they tried their best to respond.</p>
<p>This makes me feel like I am doing something weird.</p>
<p>But still, I have to focus. Although it is unlikely, if I make a mistake in adjusting the amount of magic power that I am pouring into their body, there is a possibility that the magic power will run amok in their body.</p>
<p>Tiny beads of sweat started to appear on the surface of their skin. They were dripping down from their thighs and necks. At this rate, the carpet on the floor would be soaked.</p>
<p>“Marise-chan…”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lara turned to Marise, who was lying next to her.</p>
<p>“W-What is it? I&#8217;m concentrating right now, so don&#8217;t talk to me ──”</p>
<p>Without waiting for Marise to continue further.</p>
<p>Lara raised her upper body slightly and placed her right hand on Marise&#8217;s chest.</p>
<p>“Ah! What are you doing!?”</p>
<p>Perhaps because of her heightened sense of sensitivity, Marise screeched.</p>
<p>“If I don&#8217;t do this, I feel like I&#8217;m going crazy&#8230; Besides, Marise has a beautiful body. We&#8217;re both girls, but I still feel jealous.”</p>
<p>“Lara ── ! T-That’s…!”</p>
<p>Marise’s back started to arch more, almost like a shrimp.</p>
<p>Hmm… Perhaps unconsciously, Lara&#8217;s magic power started moving towards Marise. She is doing the same thing I did to both of them. But Lara&#8217;s handling is clumsy, and she is getting pretty rough.</p>
<p>“Nn, ah! Please, not there!”</p>
<p>said Marise in a shrill voice, but she did not even try to escape.</p>
<p>Eventually,</p>
<p>“I-I&#8217;m starting to feel kind of weird, too…!”</p>
<p>Marise puts her face closer to Lara&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>“Hyaa!”</p>
<p>She then held Lara from the side, with her hand resting on Lara’s back.</p>
<p>“Lara&#8217;s body is soft…”</p>
<p>“Marise, what are you doing all of a sudden!?”</p>
<p>Marise&#8217;s hand was heading for Lara&#8217;s breasts. Her right hand went inside Lara&#8217;s underwear, and her five fingers sank deep into her breasts.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>Lara raises her voice and face towards the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Marise-chan&#8217;s magic power is coming in, too. It&#8217;s amazing! I&#8217;ve never felt anything like this before!”</p>
<p>Marise must be sending magic power from Lara&#8217;s breasts. The magic power moves slowly, but their magic power are now mixed together.</p>
<p>“The more you try to feel the magic power, the more you can understand how to control it. Let&#8217;s keep going like this.”</p>
<p>As it is, I gently touched Lara&#8217;s lower abdomen once again.</p>
<p>“Nnn! You two, don&#8217;t touch that part. It makes me feel really weird!”</p>
<p>Lara&#8217;s breathing became faster.</p>
<p>“Amazing… I feel like I&#8217;m going crazy!”</p>
<p>“M-Me too! I feel weird, even though Kurt isn&#8217;t touching me…”</p>
<p>“You didn’t think I could pour magic power into you without direct contact?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marise is directly touching Lara now.</p>
<p>Therefore, through Lara, I’m also able to transfer my magic power to Marise.</p>
<p>Our magic power are mixing together.</p>
<p>“Lara, Marise. Take a breath, then focus.”</p>
<p>“Fuuu! Haaa!”</p>
<p>“Nnnnghhhh!”</p>
<p>Their mouths gaped wide, and their voices were louder than ever.</p>
<p>Marise squeezed Lara&#8217;s breasts even harder.</p>
<p>Sweat clung to my fingers. It was sticky…</p>
<p>Lara made such a sound when I stroked her navel with my fingers,</p>
<p>“Nn, aahhh ──! Kurt, I feel amazing!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ahh, ahhh… I didn&#8217;t know it was this good!”</p>
<p>“I haven&#8217;t transferred all of my magic power yet.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? Even with this much, you still aren’t transferring all of it yet!?”</p>
<p>“What would happen… if you transfer all your magic power…?”</p>
<p>Naturally, if I really transfer all my magic power, they will break down unbearably. So I need to make sure that does not happen.</p>
<p>I then gradually increase the amount of magic power.>></p>
<p>The two were wiggling their hips and desperately trying to keep up with it.</p>
<p>“How do you feel?”</p>
<p>“Aaahhh! Y-Yeah. I can feel the magic power! I can almost feel something coming!”</p>
<p>“Me too! Nnn-ahh, I&#8217;m going crazy!”</p>
<p>I could see that Marise was clinging to her and increasing the grip of her left hand around Lara’s waist.</p>
<p>Sweat splashed all over the place, and a stain began to form on the carpet below.</p>
<p>── It was about time.</p>
<p>“Then let’s get to it.”</p>
<p>“Ehh?”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“This will be the last. I hope both of you can take the magic power.”</p>
<p>“Ah, mmm! ── Mmm! Kurt, hurry it up! Give it to me now!”</p>
<p>“Now!? Please wait a minute. If you do it now, I might really lose myself…”</p>
<p>I would not wait. Now is the best time.</p>
<p>“Nnnghhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Aaah! It&#8217;s coming ── something amazing is coming!”</p>
<p>The moment they clench their jaws, I released a large amount of magic power into their bodies.</p>
<p>“Mmmm ────── It&#8217;s hot! W-What is this!? It&#8217;s amazing!”</p>
<p>“I feel something in my stomach! Aah, aaah ────── !”</p>
<p>Both of their toes are curled up tight.</p>
<p>Their backs arched, and their mouths were hanging open.</p>
<p>““Aaaaahhh ───────── !””</p>
<p>Their voices echoed through the room.</p>
<p>Eventually, they slowly straightened their backs, leaving them limp and weak.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Are you both okay?”</p>
<p>Their cries just now were indeed loud, so I became concerned and called out to them.>> >> >> >></p>
<p>They are now lying down and taking their breath.</p>
<p>Their clothes were stripped off, and to be honest… their underwear was quite revealing, but they did not seem to mind. Their cheeks are flushed, and beads of sweat are visible on their neck and forehead. It made them both look glamorous and mature.</p>
<p>“Yeah… I’m fine. But it&#8217;s amazing. Kurt has so much magic power… I didn’t know what was going to happen to receive that much magic power… but it was good.”</p>
<p>“Me too. After getting used to the feeling of the magic power, it seems so easy to control it. We are in your care. Please do it for us again.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes.”</p>
<p>They are excellent students.</p>
<p>“T-That&#8217;s the spirit. You two should send magic power to each other even when I&#8217;m not around. That experience will come in handy in the future. If both of you can feel the flow of magic power, it will be possible to do things like Unison Raid.”</p>
<p>A situation in which one person&#8217;s magic power is not enough to form an advanced magic formula. They can then compensate for such problems by casting the spell together. By doing so, they would be capable of using magic at a level that is impossible for a single person to do alone.</p>
<p>It would be a great feat if they could handle magic power to such an extent.</p>
<p>But to cast the spell together, they have to trust each other. It is not easy, so I wonder how it will turn out.</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s go for a second round, shall we?”</p>
<p>They are still struggling to catch their breath, but still ──>></p>
<p>““I-I will be in your care…!””</p>

<p>“Lara must have exhausted herself and fallen asleep.”</p>
<p>Lara, who has completed her intensive training, now lies on the sofa, sleeping and dressed in her uniform.</p>
<p>Even though she is in a man&#8217;s room, she did not look at all alarmed but looked rather happy.</p>
<p>“Seriously… Lara is sloppy. I can&#8217;t believe she would tire herself out at this level.”</p>
<p>“Marise is being harsh.”</p>
<p>“I-I’m…!”</p>
<p>“It was very intense.”</p>
<p>As I said this, Marise blushed a bright red right up to her earlobes, as if she remembered what had just happened.</p>
<p>Her reactions are as interesting as Lara&#8217;s, which makes me want to tease her.</p>
<p>“Kurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marise regained her composure and put her face closer to mine.</p>
<p>“Where did you get that strength, Kurt?”</p>
<p>“Uh-uhm. That’s a bit sudden.”</p>
<p>“Kurt is very strong. I want to become strong like you. I&#8217;ll do anything for it. So Kurt, will you tell me the secret of your strength… just for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmm… She probably would not believe me if I told her, <em>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been reincarnated from a thousand years ago.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>“Because I worked hard.”</p>
<p>“I can be as strong as Kurt just by working hard?”</p>
<p>It was true that I had made efforts in my previous life, but Marise seemed confused.</p>
<p>“Can I ask you something, too?”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Why does Marise want to become strong so badly?”</p>
<p>“Eh…?”</p>
<p>Marise stopped moving for a moment.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about this since we met, but she seems to be in a great hurry.</p>
<p>“Marise’s strength is definitely among the best in the entire school… No, maybe even the best, if I was excluded. So why are you in such a hurry to seek strength?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Must I say it?”</p>
<p>Marise looked up at me.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to say it if you don’t want to. Everyone has something like that. This is but a simple curiosity of mine. Knowing why you seek strength makes it easier for me to teach you in the future. I&#8217;d like you to tell me if possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>Marise stayed silent for a moment.</p>
<p>She seemed to be thinking about something while playing with her own hair.</p>
<p>But then,</p>
<p>“All right. I trust you.”</p>
<p>She spoke as if she had made up her mind.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“You know that I am the daughter of a famous magic family… the Sizenosna family, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>As I recall, one of the candidates said so during the entrance examination.</p>
<p>“Isn&#8217;t it amazing? One’s birth doesn&#8217;t determine everything, but one’s origins may become a hindrance.”</p>
<p>“A hindrance, you say? I don&#8217;t think so.”</p>
<p>Marise continued on.</p>
<p>“I was born with inferior magic power. It is considered inferior to the perfect magic power and is frowned upon by the Sizenosna family. On top of that, I was always compared to my brother and sister, who were both better than me. Thus, I was treated as an ‘unwanted child’.”</p>
<p>What a foolish magic house.</p>
<p>Inferior magic power&#8230; In other words, the purple magic power. It is not even inferior. And magic color alone does not determine the future of a mage. How you train and live your life after that is more important.</p>
<p>“But weren’t you the center of attention at the entrance examination? You don’t seem to be hated. Some even called you a genius mage.”</p>
<p>“That’s because they don’t know about the Sizenosna family. People look at me with rose-tinted glasses just because I am from the Sizenosna family.”</p>
<p>Marise smiled.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s why I want to graduate at the top of this magic academy and prove it to my family. The family that hated me just because I had the inferior magic power. If I’m able to do that, surely they will recognize me.”</p>
<p>Marise puts her hand on her chest and brings her face even closer to mine.</p>
<p>“Um&#8230; Do I look like an idiot to you? Kurt seems to have a sense of self. You don’t seem to care what others think of you. So how do I look… from Kurt’s perspective?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marise looks straight at me with moist eyes.>></p>
<p>Her voice was trembling.</p>
<p>Is she afraid of my response?</p>
<p>But still, it was such a stupid question.</p>
<p>“Whatever the reason. In my eyes, Marise looks so beautiful trying her best.”</p>
<p>“Eh…?”</p>
<p>Marise looked surprised.</p>
<p>“You want to prove it to your family? Isn&#8217;t that a good thing? Prove it to the people who look down on you just because you had the inferior magic power. For that, I will help Marise.”</p>
<p>I do not know how Marise sees me.</p>
<p>But I was just like her.</p>
<p>In my previous life, people called me a heretic and hated me.</p>
<p>But I ignored them and continued to seek strength.</p>
<p>Unlike Marise, I did not have to prove it to anyone, but that seemed to be a minor difference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurt… Thank you very much. That’s a relief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marise patted her chest in relief.</p>
<p>She was probably worried that I would come to dislike her for this.</p>
<p>“Well then, I should take Lara with me and go back to my room now. I&#8217;m sorry to have disturbed you ── <strong>Kyaa</strong>!&#8221;</p>
<p>A short scream from Marise.</p>
<p>As she stood up, Marise&#8217;s foot slipped, just like the time in the bath, and her body fell towards me.</p>
<p>I immediately tried to support Marise, but ── it was a little too late.</p>

<img title="TRM_Vol1_11" alt="TRM_Vol1_11" src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/trm_vol1/cache/TRM_Vol1_11.jpg-nggid0236-ngg0dyn-800x800x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg" width="563" height="800" style="max-width:100%;">

<p>With the extra forward momentum, our lips touched.</p>
<p>The feeling of soft lips.</p>
<p>Even though our lips were only touching, I began to feel dizzy, and I could not react immediately.</p>
<p>And so, we stayed that way for a while.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>After that, Marise quickly pulled away from me.</p>
<p>She puts her hands over her mouth. Her hands were shaking, and she blushed a bright red more than ever. </p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry… Marise. I know it was uncomfortable. I should have avoided it right away, but I was slow to react.”</p>
<p>“N-No, it was my fault that I fell. I-I&#8217;m sorry!”</p>
<p>Marise bowed her head in a panic.</p>
<p>However… I never thought I would go blank for a second.</p>
<p>It will be a fatal wound if I get hit like this in the middle of a fight. I will be more careful next time.</p>
<p>“Hm~ What is it? It&#8217;s kind of noisy.”</p>
<p>Lara sat up, rubbing her eyelids.</p>
<p>“Lara! W-When did you wake up?”</p>
<p>“Ehh? Just a moment ago…”</p>
<p>“Then… you didn&#8217;t see what happened earlier…?”</p>
<p>“What is it? What just happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lara tilted her head.</p>
<p>Good. It seems that she really did not see it.</p>
<p>“L-Lara. Let’s go back to our room. It&#8217;s late now.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Hm~ I don&#8217;t want to. I want to sleep here a little longer. Let&#8217;s all sleep together.”</p>
<p>“Lara, you’re being selfish! Let’s… Wait, wha-!?”</p>
<p>Lara got up from the sofa and dived right into us.</p>
<p>“Let’s all sleep together here~”</p>
<p>Lara’s skirt was rolled up, and her white thighs were exposed. With her soft and warm body, she hugged us and began to sleep again.</p>
<p>“She must have been half asleep.”</p>
<p>“That seems to be the case.”</p>
<p>“What do we do? Should we force her to wake up?”</p>
<p>“No ──&#8221;</p>
<p>Marise stroked Lara&#8217;s head with compassionate eyes.</p>
<p>“Let her be. I think I will sleep here today, too. If you don’t mind, of course.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? I&#8217;m fine with that.”</p>
<p>I also feel sorry to wake Lara up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took Lara in my arms and put her on the bed.</p>
<p>“Marise can sleep next to Lara, too. I&#8217;ll sleep on the sofa…”</p>
<p>“But that&#8217;s not right ──”</p>
<p>Without waiting for her response, I lay down on the sofa and closed my eyes.</p>
