<p>Year 25 of the Anbarld Calendar, ðŸŒ™ Month, Day 0<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>After finishing the duel, I became Karen&#8217;s fiancÃ©.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hold on a second.<br>&nbsp;<br>Something&#8217;s weird here. I should be protesting to the headmaster who did set me up, and why is Karen&#8217;s shitty dad readily accepting this?<br>&nbsp;<br>If he looked regretful I could persist.<br>&nbsp;<br>I still haven&#8217;t met with Karen since that day.<br>&nbsp;<br>I heard preparations are necessary. I was relieved it&#8217;s not a wedding ceremony at leastâ€¦<br>&nbsp;<br>Thinking about it now, I guess it can&#8217;t be helpedâ€¦<br>&nbsp;<br>For now, I&#8217;ll try to improve Mashiro&#8217;s bad mood after my engagement got decided.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>I was the shallow one it seemsâ€¦<br>&nbsp;<br>Judging and evaluating people by their outward appearance alone.<br>&nbsp;<br>I regret my terrible conduct.<br>&nbsp;<br>Karen stopped crossdressing and came to school wearing the girls&#8217; uniform.<br>&nbsp;<br>One big change.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her chest had gotten incredibly thick.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her uniform was strained to the limit by her swollen breasts.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I accepted being engaged to Karen.<br>&nbsp;<br>I mean, I had no choice right?<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;d be weird to reject a girl with such huge, cute breasts who likes me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I probably wouldn&#8217;t find better conditions if I searched the whole academy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Therefore, I will strive as Karen&#8217;s fiancÃ©.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>I was appointed to the student council executive committee.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hey now, thinking about it again, the meaning is unclear.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s the result of considerations by the headmaster so my standing improves even a little after becoming Karen&#8217;s fiancÃ©.<br>&nbsp;<br>What happened to checks and balances? Use your authority to make it irreversible before announcing it.<br>&nbsp;<br>That shitty old hag, I&#8217;ll definitely send her flying someday.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s not the only problem.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mashiro was also appointed to the student council executive committee.<br>&nbsp;<br>She had opposed having alone time with Karen increasing, so she volunteered herself.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I objected, Karen and Mashiro, my two mega-boobed heroines, pleaded with upward glances.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tch! I won&#8217;t lose to breasts.<br>&nbsp;<br>I won&#8217;tâ€¦!<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>I became a student council executive committee member.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t want to see, hear, or recall anything.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just remembering my disgraceful figure wounds my heart, so I&#8217;ll seal those memories.<br>&nbsp;<br>Milfonti&#8217;s smile as if saying she saw right through me extremely pissed me off. That&#8217;s how I ended up joining the student council, but they don&#8217;t seem to expect me for normal duties.<br>&nbsp;<br>The headmaster&#8217;s real aim was me and Mashiro becoming representatives for the Magic Academy Competition.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>The Magic Academy Competition is where the nine magic academies scattered in each region compete in student abilities, in other words a student boasting event.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thirty representatives are selected &#8211; ten teams of three people each.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s divided into various categories to compete in, but it seems they want me and Mashiro in Milfonti&#8217;s team.<br>&nbsp;<br>According to the rumors, despite having Milfonti &#8211; disciple of the renowned [Flone the Lightning Strike ] &#8211; they took second place in last year&#8217;s Magic Academy Competition, and the seniors in the same team really took a bashing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since it&#8217;s all nobles, losing to academies with a mix of commoners must have been humiliating.<br>&nbsp;<br>Milfonti herself drew a storm of criticism despite producing results it seems.<br>&nbsp;<br>Looking at it like that, I&#8217;m probably a sacrificial lamb.<br>&nbsp;<br>In a situation where not even defeat is permitted, the other guys escaped the pressure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m a man steeped in ill rumors, so I&#8217;m just right as a target of criticism.<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#8217;t want to join the student council, but it&#8217;s convenient for participating as a representative.<br>&nbsp;<br>As a competitor I can connect with promising students from other schools for future poaching.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not everyone in the world is a good person, and some students want employment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our Royal Academy is the only place nobles&#8217; children gather so much.<br>&nbsp;<br>For students like them, I&#8217;m a prospective employer with a Duke house backing me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Searching for harem candidates in the academy is difficult now.<br>&nbsp;<br>So it&#8217;s time to broaden my horizons!<br>&nbsp;<br>I wonder if there&#8217;s one there~ a girl with big breasts who&#8217;s cute!<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>Spending a lot of time together made me realize Reina is capable.<br>&nbsp;<br>She&#8217;s attentive, gets along well with Mashiro and the others, and doesn&#8217;t fear me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Above all, the tea she brews is delicious.<br>&nbsp;<br>So delicious that even Alice, who rarely praises anything outside of mine, sulks.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then I realized that fellow is a comrade.<br>&nbsp;<br>As someone who walked the same path, I thought I&#8217;d save her from that cunningly cruel Flone.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>The Magic Academy Competition is held in the Kingdom of Ramdarb.<br>&nbsp;<br>I heard it&#8217;s Reina&#8217;s hometown.<br>&nbsp;<br>It once hit rock bottom after the war with demons, but now thrives as a sightseeing spot.<br>&nbsp;<br>We who have no direct future riding on our performance here are in a trip mood.<br>&nbsp;<br>Reina probably wants to visit a lot of places in her long-unseen hometown.<br>&nbsp;<br>She seems to be taking independent action more than usual for someone who rarely voices opinions.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll keep an eye on her.<br>&nbsp;<br>That aside, Ms. Mashiro? Please stop getting jealous and pulling on my clothes.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>Our team is entered in the magic battle category to make use of Reina and Mashiro&#8217;s abilities, as expected.<br>&nbsp;<br>The lottery divided us into four blocks, and the winning academy will be decided via a tournament system.<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#8217;t expect there to be guys like Arnia in other academies tooâ€¦ I wonder if there&#8217;s one in every academy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ah, just remembering pisses me off.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll prove which of us is truly strong in tomorrow&#8217;s main matchâ€¦!<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>I really liked Reina&#8217;s scent.<br>&nbsp;<br>Compatibility makes a difference, huhâ€¦<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Year 25 of the Anbarld Calendar, â˜† Month, Day A<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Our team safely advanced to the finals, but some fishy talk has been going around.<br>&nbsp;<br>It seems several representative students from each academy have gone missing.<br>&nbsp;<br>To prevent any more victims, it was decided teachers from each academy would patrol.<br>&nbsp;<br>While it&#8217;s just circumstance, the members included me, Mashiro, and Reina, but it can&#8217;t be helped. I&#8217;ll write this off as necessary expenses.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m also about to start patrolling with Mashiro, so I want to brace myself.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ll continue after finishing patrol.<br>&nbsp;<br><del>~~The diary cuts off here~</del>~~</p>
