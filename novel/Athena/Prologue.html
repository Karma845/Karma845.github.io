<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>“Too weak”</p>
<p>I muttered to myself as I looked at the demon Vonbax who had collapsed in front of me.</p>
<p>“Even though I came all the way here…it isn’t what I expected”</p>
<p>I let out a sigh and stopped the magic that was surging from my body.</p>
<p>&#8212;Is there no one in the world who is stronger than me?</p>
<p>I continued to train and research day and night with the aim of becoming the strongest mage.</p>
<p>As a result, I found out that all the magic I had believed in were inefficient.</p>
<p>I smashed the old ‘common sense’ of magic to atoms and chanted new magic theories.</p>
<p>It was just to make myself stronger.</p>
<p>As I was just doing that, there was a revolution happening in the world before I even knew it.</p>
<p>It was later called the ‘magic revolution’.</p>
<p>People called me a ‘heretic’ for breaking the existing ways and opening the door to a new magical world.</p>
<p>I didn’t care that the magic civilization had a revolution or that I was called a heretic, but there was one thing that troubled me.</p>
<p> The thing is that before I knew it, there was no one left who could compete with me on equal terms. </p>
<p>Even if I develop new magic, there’s no one for me to hit with all my power.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had come to sincerely seek out strong individuals.</p>
<p>Then I heard a story and went to the ruined castle.</p>
<p>There is a demon here called Vonbax.</p>
<p>Apparently, he is also called the God of Slaughter, and when he appeared in this world, he destroyed the Empire without any warning.</p>
<p>After the demon destroyed the Empire, he declared, “Is there no one who can relieve my boredom?” and is said to be waiting for a strong person in the castle.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where I felt sympathy and headed for the demon.</p>
<p>I thought that Vonbax could be the strong guy I was looking for.</p>
<p>However, the outcome was disappointing.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe the Empire was destroyed by such trash”</p>
<p>The moment we met, I cast grand magic instead of a greeting.</p>
<p>It looks like the demon was deploying barrier magic, but to me it’s like a piece of paper.</p>
<p>And now&#8212;the demon is lying on the floor in a sorry state.</p>
<p>He died on the first blow.</p>
<p>It was a very short scene of an act.</p>
<p>“Could it be that there’s no one in this world who can entertain me anymore?”</p>
<p>&#8212;I’ve always been all alone.</p>
<p>There was no one to walk alongside me, and even if such person appeared, they naturally left me.</p>
<p>Even if I had brought about a magic revolution and enriched this world with magic&#8212;people would call me a ‘heretic’ and no one would praise me.</p>
<p>But I thought it was okay.</p>
<p>Because even if I didn’t have any friends, I thought it would be fine if I could master magic alone.</p>
<p>But…what is this empty feeling in my heart?</p>
<p>Having defeated the demon Vonbax, there is no one in this world who can compete with me anymore&#8212;I wonder if that’s what I’m despairing of?</p>
<p>This me?</p>
<p>An empty laugh came out of me.</p>
<p>&#8230;I had enough.</p>
<p>&#8212;I’m already bored of this life.</p>
<p>In that case.</p>
<p>If the world were 1000 years from now, wouldn’t there be something that can keep me entertained?</p>
<p>For a long time, I had considered the possibility that the demon was trash.</p>
<p>Besides, I’m also tired of being envied by the nobles and being harassed for no good reason.</p>
<p>That’s why I was creating a certain kind of magic.</p>
<p>“Reincarnation magic&#8212;deploy”</p>
<p>A magic formula was being formed.</p>
<p>That’s right, it’s reincarnation.</p>
<p>This life is no good anymore.</p>
<p>In that case, let’s reincarnate to a world 1000 years from now.</p>
<p>If it is a world 1000 years from now, I’m sure there will be even more breakthroughs in the art of magic.</p>
<p>I’d like to see such a world.</p>
<p>Because there might even be someone who can satisfy me if it’s that kind of world.</p>
<p>“Good. It looks like the reincarnation magic will activate with no issue”</p>
<p>The light of magic filled the castle.</p>
<p>Gradually, my vision became blurred and I felt like my soul was being pulled away.</p>
<p>I prayed&#8212;</p>
<p>Wishing there would be someone stronger than me in a world 1000 years from now.</p>
<p>Thus, without telling anyone about this, I activated the reincarnation magic.</p>
