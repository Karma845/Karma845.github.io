<h2>Prologue: My Girlfriend’s Older Sister Was My First Love</h2>


<p>「Ooshima Kamome-kun! I… I like you, Kamome-kun.」</p>



<p>Early summer sky.</p>



<p>A rocky mountain-like cumulonimbus cloud looks down on them from the azure sky.</p>



<p>It was the season when the new students were getting used to high school life, and the relationships and communities that had been established.</p>



<p>At the back of the school building of a certain high school, that ceremony was being held.</p>



<p>A naive girl conveyed her deepest feelings to a boy of the same age who she likes.</p>



<p>And this ceremony was one to wish to become lovers, to monopolize each other’s love.</p>



<p>A confession, that is.</p>



<p>First-year high school student Kamome Ooshima received a confession from Shishido Himawari, a female student in the same grade who he had been on good terms with since the beginning of school.</p>



<p>「T-Thank you.」</p>



<p>Kamome replied, trying to his inner turmoil.</p>



<p>The girl in front of him, Himawari, is a petite girl.</p>



<p>Her hairstyle is a brown bob that is neatly trimmed above her shoulders.</p>



<p>With cute round eyes.</p>



<p>She has a rather weak and reclusive personality, giving the impression of a pet.</p>


<p>Due to the tension and embarrassment of the confession, she is looking down to hide her expression, so Kamome, who is relatively tall, can see her hair whorl.</p>



<p>Even that hair whorl is dyed bright red, and you can see that it is shaking in a full, wiggling manner.</p>



<p>It is an adorable figure, reminiscent of a young puppy.</p>



<p>「Eeto…」</p>



<p>The moment she told him that she liked him, his heart pounded so hard that it felt like his body was floating.</p>



<p>Kamome also likes Himawari, so it’s mutual love.</p>



<p>「I also… like you Himawari.」</p>



<p>Kamome said.</p>



<p>He had wondered if he should respond with fancy or cool words, but Kamome doesn’t have that kind of good-looking vocabulary.</p>



<p>Since Kamome has an honest, serious, and straightforward personality, could only come up with a straight answer.</p>



<p>「If it’s you’re okay with someone like me, I’d look forward to go out with you.」</p>



<p>In response to Kamome’s OK reply, Himawari raised her downcast face.</p>



<p>A refreshing scent of shampoo wafted through her fluttering hair.</p>



<p>With a scintillating radiance dwelt in the depths of her tear-stained eyes, she stares at Kamome as if she was witnessing something unbelievable.</p>



<p>Officially, the two become lovers.</p>



<p>Himawari slowly, slowly grasps at that reality…</p>



<p>「I-I’m glad…」</p>


<p>While smiling, she leaked out his voice as if to squeeze it out.</p>



<p>The tears that had accumulated in her eyes spilled out.</p>



<p>「Ah, s-sorry!?」</p>



<p>「N-No, that’s not it. This is because I’m happy… Kamome-kun, there’s no reason for you to apologize.」</p>



<p>Himawari chuckled softly to Kamome, who panicked by her reaction.</p>



<p>Her cheeks were flushed with happiness.</p>



<p>With slightly drooping eyes that draw a gentle arc when she smiles.</p>



<p>In Kamome’s eyes, all of these things are lovingly reflected.</p>



<p>「Ah, haha, I see.」</p>



<p>「Yeah… Eh, ehehe」</p>



<p>An air of nervousness, restlessness, sweetness and freshness surrounds the place.</p>



<p>For a while, Kamome and Himawari spent their time idly, laughing softly at each other.</p>



<p>Then, the sound of stepping on gravel is heard from afar, and Kamome and Himawari come back from the world of just the two of them.</p>



<p>It was the sound of someone’s footsteps coming this way.</p>



<p>「For now, shall we go back?」</p>



<p>「Y-Yeah.」</p>



<p>Having regained their senses, the two left the place.</p>


<p>On the way, they ran into a male a student who was the owner of the footsteps.</p>



<p>The student glanced at the two as they passed each other.</p>



<p>What would he think of them?</p>



<p>These two are dating.</p>



<p>They are lovers, would they look like that to him?</p>



<p>Thinking about that, Kamome felt somewhat embarrassed even though some time has passed.</p>



<p>「…Kamome-kun.」</p>



<p>Then, Himawari, who was next to him, called out to him.</p>



<p>She may have felt the same way as she looked up at Kamome’s face.</p>



<p>Like Kamome, her skin turns vermillion from her face to the nape of her neck and tells him shyly.</p>



<p>「Once again… From now on, please take good care of me.」</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>「Oh, you guys are finally dating, huh?」</p>



<p>1st year class B.</p>



<p>In the classroom, three male students are gathered at one desk.</p>



<p>The owner of the desk, Kamome, is visited by his best friends, who congratulate him on the start of his relationship.</p>



<p>「The girl is Shishido Himawari from class A… Rather, I thought you were already dating long ago, but both of you are late bloomers.」</p>

<p>The one who says that with a laugh is a blonde-haired boy.</p>



<p>He has a nicely hairstyle and a neat face.</p>



<p>With a sweet appearance, you can see the aura that implies that he clearly likes to play around.</p>



<p>And he’s in fact quite the playboy.</p>



<p>His name is Ojiya Kensuke.</p>



<p>「Well, if you say it, everyone would be like that.」</p>



<p>The other one who admonishes him for his lighthearted comments with a look of exasperation, is a boy with shoulder-length black hair.</p>



<p>He often speaks openly, but conversely, he has a personality that allows him to interact with anyone in a natural way without hesitation.</p>



<p>His name is Kurose Misaki.</p>



<p>Both of them are Kamome’s classmates and friends.</p>



<p>「Ahh, yes.」</p>



<p>On the other hand, in response to the celebratory mood of those two people, Kamome gives that simple answer as if his mind wasn’t here.</p>



<p>「What the heck, you should be happier. Shishido is quite popular among boys, you know? She is cute, petite buy charming, like a small animal that arouses the desire to protect her.」</p>



<p>「Yeah, I know.」</p>



<p>At Kensuke’s comment, Kamome nodded honestly.</p>



<p>Was a comment he really meant from the bottom of his heart, but Misaki said, “It’s the first time I’ve seen a guy to speak of his girlfriend with such a serious expression”.</p>



<p>「Well, on the contrary, Shishido is shy and quiet, however, it was clearly that she gets along well with you. I guess everyone thought it was only natural for you two to go out, so they gave up, but… Are you dissatisfied with something?」</p>



<p>「No, I have no complaints. I’m honestly happy. That’s true.」</p>



<p>In response to Kensuke’s question, Kamome quickly hastily corrects it.</p>



<p>However, immediately after that, he turned serious again.</p>



<p>「I’d like to ask you for advice.」</p>



<p>Kamome asked them in a low voice.</p>



<p>Both Kensuke and Misaki are taken in by this mood, and their expressions become serious, but…</p>



<p>「Umn… What should you do when you are “going out”?」</p>



<p>Right after that, at the question that came out of Kamome’s mouth, his two friends lost their balance with a jerk.</p>



<p>「Ha? What do you mean?」</p>



<p>「When one says “going out”, it means becoming a couple, right? But, what it is the difference compared to before, or what I should do, I don’t really know.」</p>



<p>「You’re so serious, dude.」</p>



<p>Misaki’s exasperated face as usual floats at what Kamome said with a straight face.</p>



<p>「Hmm, well, it depends on what purpose the couple is dating, doesn’t it?」</p>



<p>On the other hand, Kensuke responds to Kamome’s question while folding his arms.</p>



<p>「There are two patterns in the reasons why men and women go out… In other words, there are two types of contract patterns.」</p>



<p>While saying this, Kensuke holds up a finger and explains.</p>



<p>He is a so-called womanizer who frequently changes girlfriends, or rather, has relationships with several women at once.</p>


<p>But because of that he has a lot of experience in love.</p>



<p>「The first one consists to continue and made exclusive the relationship they have at that moment because they enjoy it. The other one is to share time with each other, deepen the understanding between the two and investigate their compatibility, if the compatibility is good, then the matching is successful. In Kamome’s case, it’s the former, so isn’t it okay to leave it as it is now?」</p>



<p>「A contract… I see.」</p>



<p>In that case, the relationship between Kamome and Himawari is definitely the former.</p>



<p>When they first entered this high school, Kamome and Himawari became good friends due to a certain incident, and since then they have maintained a good friendship to this day.</p>



<p>He enjoys being with her.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Himawari must have had the same feelings toward Kamome.</p>



<p>That’s why they became lovers like this.</p>



<p>Perhaps it may be good to recognize that from now on, they will have more such time to enjoy together, and will be able to spend it in more diverse kinds of ways than ever before.</p>



<p>「…But in a way, you could say it’s the same as before.」</p>



<p>「Well, yeah. By the way, in such a case can result in “Is there any point in dating?” or “It’s boring” and then another contract with a different purpose may arise.」</p>



<p>Kensuke lifts a third finger next to the two he was holding up.</p>



<p>「Find another person to share good times with. It’s a relationship where you’re dating a certain woman, but you’re also dating another woman.」</p>



<p>「That’s cheating.」</p>



<p>Kensuke, who is explaining his own theory, is confronted by Misaki.</p>



<p>Misaki is the type that takes a lot of care of his relationships.</p>



<p>He may have been thinking that it would not be a good idea to make this kind of conversation for Kamome, who just got a girlfriend today. Maybe he’s taking that kind of precaution.</p>


<p>「Yes, cheating.」</p>



<p>On the other hand, Kensuke continues his explanation.</p>



<p>「Cheating, is not a praiseworthy nor a wholesome thing. But people cheat. Cheating abounds in this world. Why? That’s all because it’s done with uncontrollable emotions, and it’s immoral, exciting, and fascinating.」</p>



<p>「But wouldn’t it be a big problem if you get found out?」</p>



<p>Kamome also try to join the conversation.</p>



<p>Kensuke in his own way is developing this conversation with Kamome in mind.</p>



<p>“I’m sure there must be some parts he can learn from”, he thought.</p>



<p>「There’s no one who cheats with the intention of being discovered. Well, maybe there are some of them. Still, even if you know the collapse and despair that will come when you’re found out, even if you understand that it’s dangerous, you can’t help but attracted to do it.」</p>



<p>「Hmm…」</p>



<p>It’s a feeling Kamome doesn’t understand well.</p>



<p>If he were to cheat on her, Himawari would feel sad.</p>



<p>That’s a very unpleasant feeling.</p>



<p>If Himawari were to cheat on him, Kamome would feel betrayed.</p>



<p>Truly sad.</p>



<p>…As expected, it’s an unthinkable feeling for Kamome now.</p>



<p>「Well, if you’re going to cheat, be careful, Kamome. Because you can’t do it unless your good at lying and deceiving, and have a thick mask.」</p>



<p>「You’re cheating too, aren’t you? Because all that is a boomerang for you, too.」</p>


<p>Misaki says to Kensuke, who speaks without any shame.</p>



<p>「Also, you say that it’s natural for people to cheat, but most decent people don’t do that. Only some heartless people would do that.」</p>



<p>「Really? Of all living beings on this planet, humans are the only ones who fall in love with another person while having a specific partner, developing a secret lover’s relationship, and flirting with each other.」</p>



<p>Rather, isn’t it the most human-hearted act?</p>



<p>「It’s a crap sophistry.」</p>



<p>Rejecting what Kensuke says, Misaki looks at Kamome.</p>



<p>「Or rather, without worrying about it, Kamome would never cheat on his girlfriend. To begin with, it’s impossible for Kamome to cheat. Since he can’t do something like lie.」</p>



<p>「You can’t lie? No, you’re really serious, Kamome. If you value human relationships, sometimes you need to lie. There is such a thing as a kind lie, isn’t there?」</p>



<p>「Kind lie… I don’t know exactly what is that…」</p>



<p>After thinking about it for a while, Kamome makes a statement with a serious expression.</p>



<p>「I don’t think even I can’t lie. But if possible, I don’t want to lie or hide anything from the person I like.」</p>



<p>「Well, he’s super faithful and super serious. Unlike you.」</p>



<p>「I’m not worried about it either. Kamome’s parents police officers and he’s fucking stubborn. Whether it’s cheating or adultery, no matter what the reason, it’s your nature that you can’t forgive it, right?」</p>



<p>「…Well, it doesn’t give me a good impression.」</p>



<p>Kamome clearly expressed his opinion.</p>



<p>As Kamome says it, Misaki sighs at how serious he is while also worrying about what Kensuke, who is in front of him, is about to say.</p>



<p>「Personally, I think cheating is okay as long as both parties agree to it.」</p>


<p>「Yeah, if the people themself agree to that, it’s not be cheating.」</p>



<p>Kensuke nodded deeply.</p>



<p>「By the way, your girlfriends naturally agree that you’re cheating on them, right?」</p>



<p>Misaki asks Kensuke.</p>



<p>「No, no, I wouldn’t bring it up in the first place. A wise man keeps away from danger​. You know what they say, “Let sleeping dogs lie”, right?」</p>



<p>「You… I’m going to peel off that thick skin mask of yours and feed it to the dogs.」</p>



<p>「Well, but first of all, relax and enjoy from now on. For Kamome, this is his first love and first girlfriend, right? Good for you, isn’t it?」</p>



<p>He’s a good friend who frankly congratulates him.</p>



<p>Humanity aside.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>However, at that moment, at Kensuke’s words, “first love”, Kamome made an expression as if something was stuck in his throat.</p>



<p>(…First love, huh.)</p>



<p>That being said, the first thing that comes to Kamome’s mind isn’t the image of Himawari.</p>



<p>──A girl with short, boyish black hair and a lively expression on her face.</p>



<p>Brilliant and bright, like the sun herself, she was dazzling.</p>



<p>『Kamome!』</p>



<p>In a landscape from his childhood, the girl who goes ahead turns around and calls Kamome’s name.</p>


<p>Just that one thing makes his heart flutter, and it gradually warms him up.</p>



<p>『Wait, Tsuyu──』</p>



<p>Calling her name as she runs ahead, Kamome chases after her.</p>



<p>…First love.</p>



<p>A faint feeling that he had when he was still in elementary school.</p>



<p>At that time, he wasn’t aware of such things as love or romance.</p>



<p>However, even now, he recalls the memories like this, and makes him feel sad.</p>



<p>This is…</p>



<p>The feeling of admiration and wish for that figure.</p>



<p>That was a splendid first love for Kamome. Perhaps, it’s right to say so.</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>──A few days later.</p>



<p>「…Kamome-kun… A-Are you okay?」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Today, Kamome was visiting Himawari’s house.</p>



<p>It was his first visit to her house.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s no way he wouldn’t be nervous.</p>


<p>Get off at a different station than usual and walk through a quiet residential area.</p>



<p>During that time, Kamome was behaving somewhat suspiciously, looking around restlessly.</p>



<p>「Ah, s-sorry, thinking about going to Himawari’s house made me nervous… Should I have brought a souvenir or something!?」</p>



<p>「I-I’ts okay, there’s no one at home at this time. D-Don’t worry about it.」</p>



<p>Even the Himawari, who said that, seemed to be a little nervous.</p>



<p>Looking at Kamome, “Ehehe”, she also smiled embarrassedly.</p>



<p>With such exchanges, they arrived at a rather splendid house.</p>



<p>It feels like the home of a fairly wealthy family.</p>



<p>Also, it’s probably bigger than Kamome’s house.</p>



<p>「Sorry for the intrusion.」</p>



<p>Himawari unlocks the front door.</p>



<p>And Kamome is being led and brought into the house.</p>



<p>“Here you are”, she says, holding out a pair of slippers.</p>



<p>「Ah, my room is on the second floor, come this way.」</p>



<p>Invited by Himawari, they head towards the stairs together.</p>



<p>(…I never came to Himawari’s house when we were just friends?)</p>



<p>In other words, this is what it means to be in a relationship.</p>
