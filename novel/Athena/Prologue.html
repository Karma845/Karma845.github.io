      <span class="c19">Electronic Version Short Story: Yuki's Birthday Gift</span>
    </h1>

    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">During our lunch break on the rooftop after practicing our lines, we sat down for our usual meal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"I wanted to talk to you about something, Rena."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"What is it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"I'm curious about what kind of birthday present women would appreciate."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">As soon as I said that, Rena dropped the chopsticks she was holding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Although they rolled onto the floor, she didn't bother picking them up and leaned in closer to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"W-what do you mean? Birthday present? For a woman?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Um, what's wrong, Rena?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Hmm... I see. Well, I guess it's normal for someone like Kaito-kun to have some close female friends."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Female friends? Oh, no, it's not like that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">It seemed like I had unintentionally caused a misunderstanding. I hurriedly clarified.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Sorry, I might have phrased it poorly. Actually, Yuki-san's birthday is next Monday, and I'm struggling to decide what to get her."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Huh? Yuki-san?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Rena suddenly toned down, exhaling as if she had been relieved.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"I see. Kaito-kun, you're taking care of your manager like that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"I really appreciate everything Yuki-san has done for me. Last year, I didn't have much income, so I could only afford cheap things like a pen case. But this year, thanks to her, I've earned some decent money. I want to show my gratitude by getting her something nice."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">I kept slipping in auditions and faced numerous setbacks, but Yuki-san never abandoned me; she always encouraged me. It's been hard for me to express my gratitude directly, so this seemed like the perfect opportunity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"But, Kaito-kun, considering your long history with Yuki-san, shouldn't you already know her preferences and what she desires?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"The thing is, Yuki-san doesn't reveal much about her private life. Even though we've been friends for over three years, when it comes to birthday gifts, I'm completely clueless about what would make her happy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"I see. That's a challenge..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Rena rested her chin on her hand, pondering the situation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Well, what about you, Rena? What would make you happy as a gift?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"I'd be happy with anything Kaito-kun gives me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">As I asked, Rena responded promptly. Her straightforward words made my cheeks warm, but she continued.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Though if I had to choose... something that lasts, rather than consumables. It feels a bit sad if a present disappears once you've used it, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Something that lasts, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Certainly, I wouldn't want consumables if they were a gift from Rena. They'd feel too precious to use.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">But what about Yuki-san? We weren't as close as Rena and I, not childhood friends. Despite being quite open with each other, our relationship was more like actor and manager.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">As I began to ponder again, Rena clapped her hands as if she had a great idea.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"That's right; you have a much better person to consult with than me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Huh? Who?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"My manager, Karin-san. There are sisters, so she should know what Yuki-san wants, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, you're right! But I don't have Karin-san's contact information..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"I'll take care of that for you. Just wait a moment. I'll ask if she's available."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Rena took out her phone and confidently started typing a message. After a short exchange, she smiled at me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, it's fine to call her now. Should I connect the call?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Thank you, please!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">As she dialed the number, Rena switched her phone to speaker mode and placed it between us. Karin-san answered after just one ring.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c1">"Hello? Is something the matter, Mizusawa-san?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, Karin-san? Actually, Kaito-kun has something he wants to consult with you about. He's right next to me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c1">"Amano-san? What is it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Sorry, Karin-san. There's something I'd like to ask... um, well, you know, Yuki-san's birthday is next week."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c1">"Yes, that's correct. You're aware of it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"So, I'm planning to get her a nice present this year, but I'm not sure what would make her happy. Any suggestions?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">When I casually posed the question, there was a brief pause on the other end of the line. It seemed like Karin-san was taking a moment to think.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Eventually, she spoke up thoughtfully.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c1">"Well... honestly, I think just the sentiment alone would make my sister happy. But I understand you want to get her something she'll truly appreciate."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Yes, that's right."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c1">"Since my sister isn't particularly interested in fashion, she might not be too thrilled with accessories or cosmetics. She tends to appreciate practical gifts like boxes of nutritional drinks, but as a present, it might seem a bit dull..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Having said that, Karin-san paused for a moment, then seemed to recall something.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c1">"Come to think of it, she mentioned something she's been undecided about buying recently."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, really?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c1">"Yes. She loves collecting character goods, and there's a new one that came out recently."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Character goods?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">I was a bit surprised. I've never seen Yuki-san with something like that, but if Karin-san says so, it must be true. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c1">"I'll send you the link to the product. She mentioned just recently that she'd have to give up buying it this month due to a tight budget, so there shouldn't be any overlap."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Thank you so much, Karin-san! I appreciate it!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c1">"Not a problem. Well then, let's meet again on set sometime."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">After the call ended, Rena shared the link with me. As we both opened the link, we couldn't help but exchange glances at the image of the product.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Hmm, is this cute?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, so you also think it's a bit strange?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Rather than cute, it's more eerie... it has a weird face."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">It was a character with fish and legs – something quite peculiar that we had never seen before. Its large eyes and slightly unsettling expression made it stand out. The product was a mega-sized plush toy that seemed just big enough to be cradled in both arms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"I wonder if Yuki-san really collects these..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"But Karin-san doesn't joke about these things. I don't think she'd lie."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"That's true... but it's hard to imagine."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">I tried to picture Yuki-san happily hugging this plush toy, but I couldn't form a clear image.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Still, Karin-san provided the information, and there was no reason not to take advantage of it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"I'll go ahead and buy this."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Yeah, I think it's a good choice. Personally, I might have a mixed reaction, though..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Despite feeling a hint of uncertainty in Rena's words, I went ahead and purchased the relatively expensive plush toy as a birthday present.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8 c7">
      <span class="c0"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c34">
      <span class="c0">*</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c34 c7">
      <span class="c0"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">And so, the day of Yuki-san birthday arrived.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Yuki went about her day as usual, efficiently handling work. After the shoot concluded, she came to call us from the dressing room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Great job, both of you. Mizusawa-san, are you ready to head home too?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, wait, Yuki-san!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"What's up, Amano-kun?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Here, please take this."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">I handed her a prepared bag. Yuki-san blinked in surprise as she accepted it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"It's a birthday present. I'm not sure if you'll like it, but please take it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, wow! Thanks, Amano-kun! Can I open it right here?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Yes, go ahead."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Okay, let's see... Wow!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">As Yuki-san pulled out the contents, she let out a loud cheer, unlike anything I had heard before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Excitedly holding the plush toy, she turned towards me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"W-What's going on, Amano-kun? This is Hopper's newly released merchandise for this month!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Well... when I consulted with Karin-san, she mentioned that you wanted this."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Really? Oh, I really wanted this! But I've been spending quite a bit this month, and if I bought this too, I would have been in quite a tight spot... Thank you, Amano-kun!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Her reaction exceeded my expectations. I was completely taken aback by how well it was received.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"But, Yuki-san, you don't usually wear this kind of merchandise, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Oh, yeah. Karin-san keeps pestering me about it. She says it's tacky and insists I shouldn't put it on as a strap or use it as my wallpaper. She nags me about it so much it's like having a broken record. It's really annoying, you know? Even though it's so cute. Right, Amano-kun? Mizusawa-san?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Uh, yeah..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">After giving vague responses, Rena and I exchanged glances.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Yuki-san, seemingly unbothered by our reactions, held the plush toy tightly, wearing a blissful expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">"Wow, I'm so happy..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">It was a side of Yuki-san that I had never seen before—a moment that made me unconsciously loosen my lips into a smile.</span>
    </p>
