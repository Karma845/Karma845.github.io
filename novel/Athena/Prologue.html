<h2>Prologue</h2>


<p class="calibre2">Bang-bang-bang~</p>



<p id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre2">In a room where the intense sound of gunfire echoed from a PC, there was a man streaming a game called <a href="#calibre_link-92" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">[ABEX]<sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a>.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, I hear two sets of footsteps from the right. Looks like the small fries are here!” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The moment the man heard the enemy’s footsteps, he added excitement to his stream, executed a slide to take cover behind an obstacle, and then faced the player from an advantageous position.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was a 2 vs 1 shootout.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Despite being at a numerical disadvantage, the man displayed such incredible movements that one might wonder if he even needed the advantageous position.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After taking down the first enemy with a headshot, he danced around while swapping weapons, skillfully avoiding bullets from the enemy behind.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Sensing that the enemy was running low on ammo, he quickly closed the distance with swift movement and delivered the finishing blow to the last opponent.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Immediately afterwards, an accompanying kill sound can be heard, signaling the end of the fight.</p>



<p class="calibre2">A sudden silence descends upon the battlefield that was just bustling moments ago.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Alright, there we go~” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">There was no tension in this man’s voice. With a carefree voice, he fished through the items of the defeated enemies.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thanks for the item donation~ Please come again!” (?)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre2">He started <a href="#calibre_link-92" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">tea-bagging<sup class="calibre4">2</sup></a> on top of the enemies’ corpses. There’s no real meaning behind doing this; it’s just a taunting gesture. Yet, this was exactly what makes this streamer, “<a href="#calibre_link-92" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">Oni-chan<sup class="calibre4">3</sup></a>“, popular.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Just by acting like this, his channel managed to reach 100,000 subscribers.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre2">As he does his usual taunting, the <a href="#calibre_link-92" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">comment<sup class="calibre4">4</sup></a> section with 1,500 viewers is flooded with reactions.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5"><a href="#calibre_link-92" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">Superchat<sup class="calibre4">5</sup></a> (240 yen)</strong>: [What a clean kill!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Superchat (1000 yen)</strong>: [Nice!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Superchat (2000 yen)</strong>: [This man is too powerful.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Additionally, regular comments start pouring in.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [This is frustrating. I don’t care who, someone, teach this guy a lesson!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [This is seriously disgusting. I don’t understand the point of doing something like this. Just play normally.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [I agree.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [He was tea-bagging so fast. This man has totally gotten used to it.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Nice, keep it up!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">The mixed reactions from chat were a daily occurrence.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The man knows full well that he can get a lot of views by acting toxic so he kept doing it.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As a result, despite being the most criticized and least-liked figure in the ABEX community, this man has gained a large number of viewers by streaming content that even engages those hoping to see him defeated.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, let’s just quickly win and call it a day.” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even with that bold declaration mid-game, the man never actually died.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With every kill he gets, he continues to taunt the enemies.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While the word ‘CHAMPION’ was being displayed on screen, he spoke in a proud way.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, it’s the same as usual, huh? Maybe I should have held back a bit so the enemies could have played more. Oh, and thanks for the donations!” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Don’t throw your money to someone like this.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [It would’ve been more fun if you had lost.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Wow! What a one-sided domination.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [It would be enjoyable if he didn’t taunt…]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [He’s just too good.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Reading through numerous comments, the man wraps up.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“There you have it. As mentioned before, we’re done for today. Thanks for tuning in, everyone!” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Good job!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Thanks for your hard work!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Why not one more round!?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Just quit this game already.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Well, that was fun.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">After wrapping up, he moves the mouse, turns off the comment section, and puts the PC into sleep mode, plunging the screen into darkness.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Due to the mundane routine of these actions, the man lets his guard down after finishing his stream and skips over a crucial step in the process.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The step of actually ending the stream…</p>



<p class="calibre2">To make matters worse, he even made the critical mistake of forgetting to turn off his microphone…</p>



<p class="calibre2">Naturally, viewers were now able to hear the background.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Unaware of the situation and thinking that the stream had completely ended, the man was about to unwittingly reveal his true self.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Sigh… I did quite a bit of taunting today… I hope the players aren’t too bothered by it…” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The tone, the voice &mdash; they were nothing like the man who was streaming just moments ago.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Huh? Is this voice ‘Oni-chan’? He sounds completely different, doesn’t it?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Is this some kind of prank?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Hey! The mic isn’t off! Someone tell him!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [No need to tell someone like this.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Ooo, I’m getting really excited…]</p>



<p class="calibre2">The thoughts of those still watching were all the same.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;This might turn into a streaming incident.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The man, oblivious to the fact that chat was more lively now than during his actual game, is about to showcase something irreversible.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre6">*Knock knock*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="calibre2">A gentle knocking sound echoed from the other side of the room door and was quickly followed by a girl’s voice.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Onii-chan, can I come in? The stream’s over, right?” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, yeah. Come on in.” (?)</p>



<p>The person who entered the man’s gaming room was his imouto (<em class="calibre6">younger sister</em>), who had brought in a tray of food.</a></p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, you brought me something to eat. Thanks!” (Brother)</p>

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vampiramtl.com/wp-content/uploads/TGS_6.jpeg?w=1091&ssl=1">

<p class="calibre2">“Good grief. Here I was making dinner, and you’re prioritizing your game. If you’re going to do that, I won’t make you dinner anymore.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“S-sorry. I’ll be more careful next time. Ahaha…” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The microphone this man was using was quite high quality, so the friendly banter between the siblings could clearly be heard by the viewers.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Oi oi! Oni-chan has an imouto!?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Isn’t her voice kinda cute!?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Her voice is totally my type.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Having an imouto who cooks for you is the best!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Poor imouto, having a brother like this.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Is the channel called ‘Oni-chan’ because his sister calls him ‘Onii-chan’?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Maybe he likes his imouto lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2">The gender ratio of viewers on this man’s channel was 9:1, with most of them being males.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With the introduction of the girl’s voice, the comment section becomes even more lively. It’s as if a festival has begun.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You say keep saying you’ll be more careful, but you never really change. And stop doing weird things with your online friends. I can hear it in my room, you know. Saying things like ‘Small fry~’ or ‘Baka (<em class="calibre6">idiot</em>) ~.'”</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Hearing imouto-chan say that is pretty cute lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [She seriously has a nice voice.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Oni-chan plays the game while his imouto does the taunting. Perfect combo.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Exactly, that’s how it should be.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Unbeknownst to the siblings, comments continue to flow.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While the sister knew that her brother does game commentaries, she was unaware of how his channel operates.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Exploiting this lack of knowledge to the fullest, the brother was now facing the consequences of his actions as the streaming incident unfolds.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Th-that’s just your imagination, right? I don’t say things like that.” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm. You say that even though there’s a script right here. Look, it’s labeled ‘List of Taunts’.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“H-hey, hey! You can’t take that!” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Stop making excuses, onii-chan.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The sister placed the meal on the desk, snatched the script which was taped up with transparent tape, and gave her brother a stern look.</p>



<p class="calibre2">What should have been the usual light banter between the two has turned into a streaming incident that could be heard online.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Eh? You’re kidding, right? Did ‘Oni-chan’ really create a script just to taunt people?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [So meticulous LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [He was trying his best to entertain us in his own way, huh?.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Btw imouto-chan is too cute.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [He should just switch places with his imouto!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [From now on, it should be his imouto’s turn!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [You’re not needed anymore. You’re imouto is enough.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">As behind-the-scenes information was exposed, the comment section continued to buzz with excitement while the conversation between the siblings kept going.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“While it genuinely makes me happy that you’re earning money for me, onii-chan, couldn’t you do it in a more normal way? Your personality isn’t even like that.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well… I mean, the number of viewers increased when I act like this and if I suddenly change my streaming style now, I might lose viewers-san which could affect our income.” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But not everyone would stop watching, right? Besides, I already have a part-time job, so I’ll be fine.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“True, things might be okay now, but whether we can afford to send you to university or not might depend on this.” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-It’s not like I want to go to university or anything…” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Sure, you liar. Don’t worry about it too much. Honestly, despite the content, I enjoy streaming, and I’ve gotten a lot of comments.” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This was a conversation that gave a glimpse into their private lives.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Through this exchange, the reason why Oni-chan engages keeps acting toxic becomes clear.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Seriously, this is starting to get dangerous. Personal information are coming out.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Wait, maybe this guy is actually a really nice person?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [He’s using polite language even when talking about our comments, lol.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [He even called us viewer<strong class="calibre5">-san</strong>.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [His quite a nice brother, isn’t he?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [That’s what I was thinking.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Viewers were gradually realizing Oni-chan’s true self. At this moment, there was no one attacking Oni-chan. The comments were unified in praising him as a ‘good brother’ or ‘good guy’.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…I understand.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Un un (<em class="calibre6">yeah, yeah</em>).” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“How about we go out to eat together next time? I’ll treat my hardworking onii-chan.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh! In that case, I’ll gladly accept that offer.” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You free on Saturdays, right?” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, it’s the only day where I don’t have part-time work” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Then, how about we go on Saturday evening? I have work until the afternoon, so I’ll be free after that.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Got it. Thanks a lot.” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The conversation flows seamlessly. As the conversation continues, oni-chan’s image was slowly improving in the viewer’s eyes.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Based on this conversation, maybe oni-chan doesn’t have parents…]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Supporting his family with six days of work while streaming. That’s seriously impressive.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [For the sake of sending his sister to university, no less.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [If his sister is heading to university next, that means that she is around the age of a high school student. Oni-chan must be quite young, huh?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [I can’t see him the same way from now on.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Wait, was Oni-chan was just acting toxic for business? lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Amidst the comments speculating on his family situation, the sister touches upon a specific topic.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, onii-chan. There’s something I’ve been wondering about ever since I came into your room.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“What is it?” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Your phone has been vibrating non-stop since a while ago. Don’t you have a lot of notifications?” (Sister)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre2">“Oh, yeah. I think people are sending feedback on <a href="#calibre_link-92" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">Twitto<sup class="calibre4">6</sup></a> now that the stream’s over.” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Has it ever vibrated this much before?” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, now that you mention it…” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The sister’s words became the trigger that revealed the streaming incident.</p>



<p class="calibre2">When the man picked up his phone, the notification bar was filled with messages.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Forgot to turn off the mic!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [The mic is still on!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Isn’t this a streaming incident?]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [We can hear the conversation with the sister.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash; And more.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“U-Um, onii-chan? What’s wrong? Your face looks really pale.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, it’s nothing. Really. Um, so, about that? I need to do some editing, so I’ll be in the room a bit longer. Thanks for the meal.” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Okay. Well, I have school tomorrow, so I’ll go to bed early. You should rest soon too, onii-chan.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah… Good night.” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Good night, onii-chan.” (Sister)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With those parting words, the door closes with a <em class="calibre6">*clang*</em>.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After confirming the fading sound of his sister’s footsteps, the man unlocks his PC from sleep mode.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Then, once again, he brings up the comment section.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, well, how do I put it… I’m sor&mdash;no, wait, I mean, uhh… don’t you idiots realize that what just happened was all part of the act?” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s too late to try to cover it up. Everything has already been exposed.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [How is that possible lmao]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [You sure switched gears quite fast.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Are you whispering to not disturb your imouto lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [You’re really bad at covering it up… Your voice is totally different.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [GG for being exposed as a nice guy.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Good night, onii-chan!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Comment</strong>: [Looking forward to how you’ll stream next time!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Comments flowed in like a waterfall.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, well, I won’t forgive anyone who spread this around. Seriously, promise me. Okay? Thank you.” (Brother)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Leaving those words behind, the man shuts down the PC as if fleeing.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Though he warned them not to spread it, there’s no viewer who will keep such a promise. After all, there’s no reason to oblige.</p>



<p class="calibre2">On that day, the words ‘Streaming Incident’ were trending on Twitto.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Clips of it were naturally uploaded.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was also featured on summary websites with titles like “Toxic Streamer Prepares Script For His Streams LOL” circulated.</p>



<p class="calibre2">On that day, Oni-chan became a hot topic of discussion leading to more exposure. Misunderstandings were cleared. Viewer’s impressions were improved.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With this incident, the channel’s subscriber count increased by 40,000, reaching a total of 150,000 subscribers.</p>
