<h4>Aya’s PoV</h4>



<p class="calibre2">Right after parting ways with Haruto…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ugh, I’m such an idiot…! Ahh <em class="calibre6">mouu</em>! Why didn’t I just hold hands with him!? It was such the perfect opportunity, wasn’t it!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya, who had flopped onto the sofa in the living room, buried her face in the cushion, and flapped her legs in frustration.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Even though it was a perfect chance, why do I go and do something so stupid!? <em class="calibre6">Mouu</em>…!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Expressing her regrets, Aya kept fidgeting until she eventually stopped, as if she wore herself out.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>… I could have held hands with Haruto-san…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The heavy weight of ‘regret’ pressed against her back.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“This is normal for someone from an all-girls school, right? It’s not like I’m the only one who’s weird when in such a situation…” (Aya)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre2">She attended an <a href="#calibre_link-104" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">escalator all-girls school<sup class="calibre4">1</sup></a> from middle school to high school.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Interactions with the opposite sex were practically nonexistent, and the last time she held hands with someone was during an elementary school field trip.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But being able to grasp the hem of his clothes is a big step forward! Yeah…! It was nerve-wracking, but I did it properly!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was a shift in mindset.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haruto-san probably hasn’t even caught on, but we’re going on a date! Oh, I should check my schedule…!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While the decision to go on a date had been made, the date was still undecided.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She quickly stood up and moved to her streaming room.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Without even sitting on her gaming chair, Aya hurriedly brought her PC out of sleep mode and opened the management software.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uh, let’s see… Saturday, Saturday is…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This Saturday &ndash; assignments.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Next Saturday &ndash; collaboration.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The Saturday after &ndash; a tournament.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The Saturday after that &ndash; no plans.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“The earliest date is three weeks from now… Well, I guess there’s nothing I can do about it…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">If possible, she would want to go on the date as soon as possible, but work had to take priority.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“All right! I look forward to it! Having more time means I can use it to plan the date!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Reassuring herself, she clicked on the calendar for the Saturday three weeks from now and reached for the keyboard and typed in: “Date with Haruto-san (Temporary).”</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Let’s add a heart. And make it pink. Hehe.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was still a long way off, but just putting those words in her schedule made her genuinely happy.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Wait, I-I’m smiling too much… Th-This much is not good…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Looking at her face faintly reflected on the computer screen, she realized she was loosening up a bit too much.</p>



<p class="calibre2">She tried pinching her cheeks to regain composure, but it didn’t quite work as smoothly as she hoped.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Wah my face is getting hotter…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It wasn’t just that. Even her heartbeat was beating louder.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-I’m being too easy! I… I won’t even be able to handle the real thing at this rate…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, her body lost strength. She spun the chair around and quickly sat down.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I… I might seriously be in love with Haruto-san after all…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Before, it was just a matter of being interested. But now, it’s more than that.</p>



<p class="calibre2">To hide the overwhelming embarrassment, she buried her face on the desk.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…<em class="calibre6">Unn</em>, I really like Haruto-san…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was at that moment that she understood her own feelings.</p>
