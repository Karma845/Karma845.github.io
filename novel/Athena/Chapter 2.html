<h2>Chapter 2: Regular Customer &amp; University Student</h2>


<p class="calibre2">“A regular-sized Hot Maple Latte and Iced Cocoa, right? The total will be 780 yen.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was past 5 p.m.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto, dressed in the uniform of the book cafe, smoothly handled customer service with a friendly demeanor. He skillfully operated the register, made drinks, and saw off another customer with practiced movements.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Having worked six days a week since high school, it was a workplace where he initially kept messing up, but now he had integrated into the business as a valuable asset.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Alright, five more hours…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He glanced at the time displayed on the register, mustering up the determination to continue working for an additional 30 minutes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Then, a familiar face entered the store.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haruto-san! Yahoo~~ I’m here again today.” (?)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, good afternoon, Shirayuki-san.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>She had milk-tea-colored hair cut into a bob. Fair skin with pink eyes. The petite girl with a white brand bag slung over her shoulder, Shirayuki Aya, approached the register with a wave.</a></p>



<p class="calibre2">“Finished with your classes for today?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah! I only have one class in the afternoon today (<em class="calibre6">regional</em> <em class="calibre6">dialect</em>). I mean… I only have one class, so I’m full of energy (<em class="calibre6">Tokyo dialect</em>).” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, it’s okay to speak in your usual tone. Nobody teases you here.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…W-well, because Haruto-san keep spoiling me like that, my dialect hasn’t changed even after two months.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Please don’t falsely accuse the waiter in such ways.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">From this conversation, you can tell that she is a new first-year student who came to Tokyo from a rural area to attend a university. She’s working hard to suppress her dialect because she doesn’t want to be teased by her new peers and prefers not to show it outside.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“So… what will be your order for today? The usual?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course! A large Strawberry White Mocha! I have… exactly enough money.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Got it.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Can you draw something on it too?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Latte art, right?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Un! Thank you.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Whenever she comes in and the store isn’t all that busy, she always asks me to, “Draw something on the drink!” According to her, it adds to the charm of being a regular customer.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, what are you going to draw today…? The day before yesterday, it was a dog, right?” (Aya)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre2">“The day before yesterday, it was a tanuki.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…That was a dog, wasn’t it?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It was a tanuki.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh? R-Really?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While tilting her head, Aya quickly took out her smartphone from her pocket and showed a picture of the latte art from the other day on the screen.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, it was a tanuki. Look at the thick tail.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“S-So it was a tanuki..” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While staring at her smartphone with wide eyes, there’s an expression on her face that seems to say, “Seriously?”</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, Shirayuki-san, do you always take a picture of the latte art?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, seeing it kind of cheers me up~” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Because of the bad drawing?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“T-they’re unique!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She swiftly covers up with a light-hearted tone.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thank you but… well, the art speaks for itself ahaha.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He’s aware that he lacks artistic talent. Nevertheless, the fact that his drawings managed to capture her heart well enough for her to photograph them is already a win in his books.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“But you know, I’m confident in today’s art. I’ve been practicing them a lot lately.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Really!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yup. Watch as I draw a frog.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Mmm, I’m watching.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Since you’ve been practising, wouldn’t it have been better to keep it a secret and surprise me when you draw it?)” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Although it was a missed opportunity, Aya just smiled and thought to herself, “That’s just like Haruto-san”.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Unaware of such thoughts, Haruto’s pen raced across the cup as he finished the drawing.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, oops… Sorry, I messed up. The eyes got squished.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, I see. You’ve been practicing drawing frogs that got punched.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, just kidding.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Shirayuki-san, it’s a bit rude to ask, but… can I redo it once? The drawing’s bothering me.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He couldn’t replace the cup just because he made a mistake. When he asked to redo the art on the same cup, he received an unexpected response.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course~! But, you can just draw it on a new cup…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That way, I can treat you to a drink, Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya, with her hands behind her back, leaned forward with a carefree smile. While being tempted by her cute expression to accept her offer, Haruto held on to his pride as the older person.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“While I appreciate that, I can’t let you go through that much trouble…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s a thank-you for always taking care of me! Besides, you’re always indulging in my whims, so… if you won’t let me treat you, then, um… yeah!!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“’Yeah’?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well… umm… yeah!!!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It seemed like she intended to suggest some sort of punishment game, but she couldn’t come up with one immediately. She covered it up by nodding enthusiastically.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“So… you’re really okay with doing that, right?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, that’s right.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, in that case… I’ll take you up on your offer. Thank you very much.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No problem! Thank you for everything as always.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Shaking her head from side to side, she let her milk tea-colored hair sway, and with one corner of her mouth lifted, she crafted a mischievous, devilish smile.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“In return, make sure to show the results of your practice, okay?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, putting that kind of pressure on me is unnecessary…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, I’m doing it on purpose, you know?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s mean… But, I really did practice, so it should be fine. All right.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Changing his expression to a serious one, he started moving the pen on the new cup but then…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The sound of surprise escaped from his mouth as he looked at the final product.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In the end, what Aya received was a cup with a frog drawn on it, just like the first one, with squished eyes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In the end, Haruto had succumbed to the pressure.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Um, well… This is…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Did you want to match with me?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I, uh, wanted to match you.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hehe, don’t say such embarrassing things.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You’re the one who made me say it, Shirayuki-san…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He replied, enduring the embarrassment. If admitting to it meant he would be forgiven for the mistake, he had no choice.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, here you go, sorry for the wait. This is the Strawberry White Mocha you ordered.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thank you! Well then, good luck with the rest of your work, Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You too, Shirayuki-san.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course~!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Haha, let’s both do our best.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Un~!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">That was their last conversation at the register. After Aya received her drink, she sat on an empty seat and took out her laptop from her bag.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Seeing this, Haruto moved on to serve a new customer who had just entered the cafe.</p>



<p class="calibre2">=====================</p>



<p class="calibre2">It was 10:05 PM.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Good work today, Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You too, Shirayuki-san.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Having finished his part-time work and changed into casual clothes, Haruto met Aya in the parking lot of the closed book cafe.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He couldn’t recall when it started but it had become a habit for them to leave the cafe together until the point where their paths diverged, especially when both of them remained at the cafe until closing time.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“How’s your video editing work been progressing?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well… honestly, it’s a bit tricky.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha, sounds tough.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah… It’s hard because I’m not used to it. Even if I try my best, at most, I could only manage two videos a month…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Still, that’s impressive. There aren’t many university students who can edit videos, and you’re juggling it alongside your studies.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thank you…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This was not just flattery.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While he hadn’t inquired about the specifics of her video editing work, he had recorded and edited gameplay videos for ABEX so Haruto himself was familiar with the challenges of editing such content.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It must be tough, thinking about thumbnails and deciding where to cut.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, thumbnails are like headlines for videos, so I have to make them catchy to grab people’s interest. And depending on where I cut the video, it can change the video’s appeal… By the way, Haruto-san, you seem to know a lot about this?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah… well, actually, I have a friend who works in editing, so I’ve heard various things from them!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">His eyes widened as she questioned him, and he made up an excuse on the spot.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s common for content creators to edit their own videos.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If he was producing videos that didn’t offend people, it would be one thing, but he was posting videos that focused on acting toxic. He couldn’t risk being exposed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The moment he got caught, it would make working with others uncomfortable, people would keep their distance, and he would likely be met with disdainful glances&mdash;a series of worst-case scenarios entered his mind.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, Shirayuki-san, what do you plan to do when you get home? Your university assignments?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ll be gaming again! I’m all about games at home.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, is that so? When you say games, are they puzzle games or simulation games?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I-Is that how you see me?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I just thought you’d be into more peaceful games… Was I wrong?” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-67" class="calibre2">“The games I play are actually the opposite. They are games where you shoot and defeat enemies. Or a simpler term for it would be FPS.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Wait, you play FPS games!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“That’s right!” (Aya)</p>



<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vampiramtl.com/wp-content/uploads/TGS_7.jpeg?w=1131&ssl=1">



<p class="calibre2">She had milk-tea-colored hair cut into a bob. Fair skin with pink eyes. The petite girl with a white brand bag slung over her shoulder, Shirayuki Aya, approached the register with a wave.</em></a></p>

<p><strong◆◆◆◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre2">The male-to-female ratio in FPS games is roughly 8:2. It’s no wonder Haruto was surprised.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The number of female players in this genre is overwhelmingly low.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Have you heard of ABEX, Haruto-san? It’s a really famous game.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“?! If you’re talking about ABEX, I play it too!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Eh!? Haruto-san plays it too!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Not wanting to delve into the topic of video editing, Haruto forcefully changed the subject, which somehow led to the unexpected discovery of a common interest.</p>



<p class="calibre2">However, the conversation was still in the “dangerous” zone.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Invitations like “Let’s play together next time” are something to be wary of.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto is a game streamer. His ABEX username is the notorious “Oni_chan,” and he holds the top rank, Predator, which only the top 750 people can achieve.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It is crucial to avoid revealing his main account at all costs.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If he had to mention his account, it could only be in the form of a sub-account.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“By the way, what’s your rank, Haruto-san? Maybe you’re actually quite high-ranked…?” (Aya)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-3" class="calibre2">“No, no! I just reached Platinum 1, so I’m in the middle.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m in Platinum too!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Wow, what a coincidence…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">To maintain fairness in ABEX, even if you are friends, if there is a significant difference in rank, you cannot play ranked matches together. However, in casual matches where the outcome of a match doesn’t affect your rank, it’s a different story.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, we should totally play together next time, right!?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ahaha, yeah, of course.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Haruto felt grateful for having a sub-account. He was surprised that she played such competitive games, but considering her personality, she probably enjoyed the liveliness of them.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While imagining such things, they continue talking about ABEX for several tens of minutes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Uwah~ We’re here already…” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Aya’s cheerful tone suddenly shifted and a disappointed voice filled the air.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In front of them was a familiar crossroad. This was the usual intersection at which they parted ways.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Time sure flies when you’re having fun, huh? I wonder if there’s a way to make it last.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It makes me happy to hear you say that. I was thinking the same thing.” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-4" class="calibre2">“You’re actually much happier than you make it out to be, right? That’s quite the act~ (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While jokingly conveying this with a slight twitch of her thin eyebrows, there was a sly grin on her face. It seemed like she understood my true feelings behind the words.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Pfft, hehe.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While staring in silence and thinking about what to say, she covered her mouth and burst into laughter.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey~ it’s okay if you just lie to me, you know? Like, you can just say, ‘That’s not true!'” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You probably already know how I feel even if I said that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm. Well then, next time, I’ll act like I don’t know.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Knowing you, it’ll probably show on your face anyways.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“When that happens, I’ll rely on Haruto-san to stop me.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“What’s up with that?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Her response was typical of her, and it seemed she was self-aware that she was quite expressive.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, it’s getting late, so let’s call it a day. I live alone, so it’s fine for me, but Haruto-san might not be the same.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thanks. I’ll go with that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s dark outside, so be careful on your way home, Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You too, Shirayuki-san.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah! Well, let’s play ABEX next time, okay? Promise?” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Of course. See you then.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“See you! Bye-bye!” (Aya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He waved as he watched her leave. When her back disappeared around the corner, Haruto took out his phone from his pocket and immediately made a call.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After two rings, the other person picked up.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-5" class="calibre2">“(Hello, Yuu? How’s everything today?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Yeah, everything’s fine. What’s up, onii-chan?)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oh, nothing. Just letting you know I’m on my way home, should be reaching back quite soon.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Hmm? You can just send a message instead of calling, you know?)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Well, well. I just feel more at ease with a call.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Since they were just a family of two, constantly keeping in touch, and consulting with each other had become somewhat of a family rule.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Well, that’s true… Oh, also, thanks for your hard work at work today.)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Haha, thanks, Yuu. How was school today? You didn’t run into any problems, right? Are you okay?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>… Onii-chan, you worry too much. It’s the same as usual.)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Got it. As long as you’re okay.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even though he knew he was being overprotective, he continued to ask these questions every day.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno was a second-year high school student who had lost both parents. This makes her family situation vastly different from those around her. Despite it being a sensitive topic, it is commonplace to talk about family in school. This was from Haruto’s own experience.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Ah, onii-chan. There’s something I wanted to ask while we’re at it.)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Hmm?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(I’m thinking of inviting Suzuha-chan over to our place next Sunday… Do you have any streams scheduled for that day…?)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oh! Suzuha-chan is coming over? I don’t have any streams planned, so feel free to invite her over. By the way, have you decided on a time?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(For now, we’re planning to hang out from 1 PM to 5 PM.)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Got it. I’ll make sure not to stream on that day. I can’t let her hear that, after all…)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While Haruto streams from his gaming room, the room itself is not soundproofed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;The small fry is here~!</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Alright, thanks for the goods~!</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Please come again~!</p>



<p class="calibre2">To avoid having such voices heard by others, Haruto had decided to never stream when there were guests.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If someone were to hear them, even if they were work-related… it’d probably be weird.</p>



<p class="calibre2">&mdash;Yuno-chan’s onii-chan is a dangerous person.</p>



<p class="calibre2">To prevent such rumors from spreading, he had to be extra vigilant.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Well, no matter what onii-chan is doing, I think Suzuha-chan will understand, given the circumstances.)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Well, I feel that way too, but it’s always good to be cautious. If I end up being disliked, that’s fine, but if it might affect Yuu…)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(If it comes to that, we’ll deal with it when it happens. We can handle it together, just like always.)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Yeah, you’re right.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Perhaps due to living without her parents, Yuno had truly become strong. Haruto felt a sense of joy from her growth, and he let out a happy laugh.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-6" class="calibre2">“(Anyways, come back quickly, onii-chan. I’m making Oyakodon today.)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(What, oyakodon!? Seriously!? I’m coming!)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(I’m happy that you’re looking forward to it but be careful. If something were to happen to onii-chan…)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(I-I know, of course.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Alright then. I’ll warm it up so we can eat as soon as you’re back.)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Thanks. See you at home.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Okay.)” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">After that conversation, he ended the call and let out a small sigh.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Really, I need to be more careful…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">What came to mind were Yuno’s words from earlier.</p>



<p class="calibre2">(If something were to happen to onii-chan…)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As her brother and the only family left, he didn’t want her to evoke such thoughts. He didn’t want to say or hear such things.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“All right, safety first on the way home. If I boast about this later, maybe she’ll feel a bit more reassured… probably.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He knew a retort like ‘Don’t boast about something so obvious’ was coming, but reassuring her was more important.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Un, Un.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He nodded firmly to himself, and just as he was about to power off his phone to avoid using it while walking, something caught his eye.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">On the Twitto app’s icon, in the top right corner, the number ’99+’ was displayed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">This was undoubtedly the number of notifications, meaning there were more than 99 things sent to him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What’s this? W-What’s going on…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He had just noticed it because he usually turned off notifications while at work. His face momentarily became tense.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He hadn’t seen a number like this since the day of the streaming incident.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Although he had a bad feeling, he couldn’t just ignore it and decided to check.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“T-These notifications… Criticism messages for hitting Ayaya-san, maybe?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">If there was something he could think of, it would be this.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He had acted rudely against a streamer with over 300,000 subscribers. It was only natural for Ayaya’s fans to be upset, and receiving criticism wasn’t surprising.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Well, as Oni-chan, it’s not a bad thing… In fact, it’s kind of nice.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">For a regular streamer, this might have been damaging, but the situation had changed since that streaming incident. Rumors of him being a ‘good guy’ had spread for some reason.</p>



<p class="calibre2">To continue keeping the status quo, that would be the ideal situation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’m sure they’re all hate comments, but let’s check them now.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He decided not to delay it, as he didn’t want to get distracted by it for too long and miss out on Yuno’s homemade oyakodon.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Bracing himself for what he was about to see, he opened Twitto and checked the notifications.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">To his surprise, there were comments he never expected.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Please collaborate with Ayaya again! It was super fun!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">This was the first message that caught his eye.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [You’re seriously a good guy. I’ll support you from now on. Keep it up!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…Huh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This was the second message that caught his eye.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [When’s your next stream? Let me send you a donation.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This was the third message that caught his eye.</p>

<p><strong◆◆◆◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre2">Despite the rude behavior towards Ayaya, for some reason, he was receiving only positive comments.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-No way, why are these messages coming…? I hit Ayaya-san… Fans should normally be angry, shouldn’t they…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Checking the profiles of the users who left these messages, it was overwhelmingly clear that they were Ayaya’s fans.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Muttering to himself, he continued scrolling through the notifications.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The reason as to why this was happening became clear when he opened the URL that had been sent to him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-What’s with this clip…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The first thing that caught his eye was a clip with the title: “Toxic Oni-chan Being Too Kind to Ayaya (lol).”</p>



<p class="calibre2">It had 50,000 likes and had been retweeted over 20,000 times.</p>



<p class="calibre2">There were several other clips and videos in a similar situation.</p>



<p class="calibre2">One such video included the highlights of all the good moments from the collaboration with Ayaya.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He had given away the only Assault Rifle, the R-301, claiming he already had it.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He handed over one extra healing item.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He praised both enemies and allies.</p>



<p class="calibre2">All of these acts were meticulously edited into a well-crafted and funny video.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While watching the video, there was a part of him thinking, “Is it okay for me to interact with someone like her?”</p>



<p class="calibre2">Checking the comments section of the video, there were only positive reactions from Oni-chan’s perspective.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Oni-chan is really kind LOL]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Such a cute klutz.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [I can tell. He was treating Ayaya like a little sister.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [I know right? You can see how he interacts with his little sister in this video lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2">Not a single negative comment. Not one.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-No, this is bad… If they see me like this, it’ll be difficult to continue keeping the status quo… Why is this getting so much attention in the first place?!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The reason became apparent from the comments below.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-No way… right?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It wasn’t a mistake.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-43" class="calibre2">Ayaya, a professional gamer with over 200,000 followers on Twitto and the person featured in the various clips and videos, was helping to fuel the fire with comments like, “Oni-chan and I accidentally collaborated! Check out the details in my stream VOD</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ugh. To think that I would be used as a stepping stone…!” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Feeling like his knees were about to give out, he understood that this was karma.</p>



<p class="calibre2">He was the one who had initially tried to use her so there was no room for complaint.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“This is bad. This is really bad… I need to do some damage control quickly…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Cold sweat dripped down.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While holding his head and thinking about his next move, he prioritized posting a message to contain the situation.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>. I just finished my business and the moment I checked in on Twitto, all I saw was a mess of lies. Do you guys really want my attention that badly? It’s a hassle, so I won’t bother dealing with it.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">He pushed away the users showing goodwill and intentionally posted a cold response. However, it was all in vain.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [I heard you’re working six days a week, so you’ve been working all this time!? Thanks for your hard work!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Take it easy and rest~]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Saying “It’s a hassle” is basically equivalent to saying “I got no counterargument”!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Honestly, I want you to pay attention to me!]</p>



<p class="calibre2">In just about 10 seconds, comments like these appeared. Was it a mistake to post here in the first place? He began to think.</p>



<p class="calibre2">No, he became convinced after seeing the next message.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Yay~! Pay attention to me too!] &mdash; Such a comment came from Ayaya’s account, which had over 200,000 followers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">If this continued, there would be no way to contain the situation. It was like pouring fuel on a fire.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“N-No… You really didn’t have to post that. Even if it’s in your personality.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto’s face became filled with distress, but upon further thought, he realized this might be a good opportunity. After all, it seemed like this person loved to get involved in lively scenes, even if it meant bothering ordinary people.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Oi, I won’t forgive you for all this. Let me punch you again.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">On Twitto, this exchange was visible to all users. In other words, he thought that he could restore his image by fully embracing his toxic persona at this opportunity.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [What a unique way of inviting me to another collaboration! I’m okay with it!!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [I’m okay too… Not!! Stop messing with me.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">While responding to Ayaya, a thought struck him.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Because of the dialect, it feels like I’m talking to Shirayuki-san…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Whether it was because he just found out that she was an ABEX player or not, he couldn’t help but feel that way. He felt a sense of guilt creeping up to him, thinking he might be using rough language with someone he knew.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [I’m not messing around!]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [Alright, I won’t reply to you anymore.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">He understood that things were getting out of hand so he chose a strategic retreat.</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [What’s with this banter lol]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [You guys might as well start dating now…]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [No, that’s not possible. Ayaya’s mine.]</p>



<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre5">Twitto Post</strong>: [She’s not yours! She’s mine.]</p>



<p class="calibre2">When something unpleasant happens, it tends to escalate into more unpleasant things.</p>



<p class="calibre2">As if to prove that, this exchange alone quickly surpassed 500 likes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“T-The notifications won’t stop…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even after checking the notifications, new ones kept pouring in. There seemed to be no end to it.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre6">Haa</em>… That’s enough for today. Let’s just wait for things to settle down… I hope this was the right decision…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Deciding to put this matter on hold, he powered off his smartphone.</p>



<p class="calibre2">With nothing going well and a heavy heart, he headed home prioritizing safety.</p>



<p class="calibre2">And after returning home…</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Thanks for the meal. Today’s dinner was delicious too. Thanks as always.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It’s nothing special. I’m just doing the usual.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He finished the meal that Yuno had prepared, expressing his gratitude as usual.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Oh, Onii-chan, is it okay if we have oyakodon for breakfast tomorrow too? If it’s lackluster, I can make more side dishes.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, it’s fine! By the way, I can’t keep relying on Yuu, so… maybe it’s about time you taught me how to cook…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He cast an expectant gaze with his amber-colored eyes at Yuno, but his request was easily brushed off.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I can’t let someone who confuses sugar and salt in the kitchen. I feel that you might cause a fire someday.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, haha… I’m really sorry for that incident.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, in a way, it became a good memory, so I won’t say it was all bad.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“‘In a way’ sounds a bit pathetic, doesn’t it?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">This happened on Yuno’s birthday. Haruto, who was not used to cooking, tried his best to prepare a celebratory meal but made the mistake of confusing the seasonings.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“‘It’s delicious,’ she said as she ate, but since then, Yuno has banned me from the kitchen.</p>



<p class="calibre2">I still remember her saying, ‘I’ve never seen someone who doesn’t taste their own cooking.’</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well… on a serious note, you don’t have to worry about anything, onii-chan. Taking care of household chores is my responsibility.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Even so, wouldn’t it be easier if I learned to cook?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm. It would be a lie to say that it wouldn’t be easier. But I enjoy doing it, and if you push yourself any harder, onii-chan, you’ll definitely end up overworking yourself, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">As she twirled a strand of her antennae-like hair with her index finger, Yuno continued speaking.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I know it perfectly well, you know? Even after finishing your cafe job, you’re streaming until late at night and editing videos. If you’re already this busy, you’re definitely going to overwork yourself if you do the chores too.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, you’re not any better. You’re going to school, working part-time, doing household chores, and even studying for university. You’re much busier than I am.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You’re busier, onii-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yuu is busier.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Onii-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, it’s Yuu.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In reality, both of them are busy. It’s precisely because they care about each other that such arguments arise.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The uncompromising battle unfolds in the living room for a few minutes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Whether it can be considered good timing or not, Haruto’s smartphone, which was on the table, vibrates with a buzz.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“A message?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. I set it up so that I only get notifications for Twitto DMs, so it’s probably that…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">His account is configured to receive direct messages only from mutual followers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In other words, messages will be from people he’s connected with.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Who could it be… I don’t have any particularly close connections.” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-44" class="calibre2">“Isn’t it LAIN?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, I turned off notifications for that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While responding, upon checking the notification, there it was… the name of Ayaya, a streamer with over 300,000 subscribers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oni-chan! When can we collaborate again? I’ve been thinking about adjusting my schedule accordingly! Is now a bad time?)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">An invitation from someone who has more than double the number of subscribers… This collaboration won’t have much merit for her, but she’s still willing to adjust her schedule and go through with the collaboration.</p>



<p class="calibre2">There are probably very few streamers out there without hidden agendas like her.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“… ” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hey, onii-chan. That message is from a girl, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Why do you think so?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Because you looked so happy staring at the screen.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">When he raises his face from the smartphone, Yuno is leaning on her hand with a sulking expression.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, it’s not because it’s from a girl that I’m happy. I’m happy because of the content of the message.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Really?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, really. It was a message from someone about wanting to collaborate with me.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ehhhh!?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Yuno appeared surprised, but her expression quickly turned complex.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“It seems like it’s going to be a chaotic stream. Collaborating with you means that person is probably also someone who likes to taunt others…” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, that’s kind of normal for pro gamers.” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-45" class="calibre2">“Pro gamer!? Doesn’t that affect their reputation? Like, ‘Collaborating with this person means they condone such behavior.'” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, um… it should be okay.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“R-really?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“If they’re the ones inviting, I think it should be fine.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">What Yuno was saying makes sense. He had been concerned about the same thing. That’s why he had been avoiding collaborations with others and tended to work alone. However, after the incident with Ayaya, the situation became somewhat peculiar.</p>

<p><strong◆◆◆◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre2">“I see. If that’s the case then you should reply right away. After all, it’s someone important to onii-chan, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, I’ll reply right after I finish washing the dishes.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I’ll do the dishes for you, so go and reply.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Huh…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Just do it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Ah, thanks for looking out for me.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…I didn’t mean it like that.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, thanks anyways.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“You don’t have to say it twice.” (Yuno)</p>



<p id="calibre_link-79" class="calibre2">Although she was acting tsun, it was obvious that she was looking out for him. He decided to just rely on her kindness.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well then, I need to go and think about my schedule, so I’ll move to the other room.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Okay.” (Yuno)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Haruto took his smartphone to the gaming room and spent 15 minutes on Twitto talking to Ayaya to come up with a schedule. Once they successfully determined the collaboration date and time, they engaged in casual conversation, including private topics.</p>



<p class="calibre2">During this conversation, Ayaya sent the following messages:</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Hey, hey, it’s sudden, but I have to consult you about something, Oni-chan.)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(That’s sudden. I don’t know if I can help, but go ahead.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Thank you!)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">With the collaboration confirmed, they were currently in the midst of trying to deepen their trust and friendship. After all, being comfortable around each other is more enjoyable for viewers compared to having a tense atmosphere.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In response to that sentiment, I decided to reply in a more casual tone:</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(All right, let’s get to it! <em class="calibre6">De-den</em>! If you want to get along with someone you’re interested in, what should you do, Oni-chan!?)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Huh, a love consultation?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Ah, don’t get me wrong! This isn’t about me; it’s about a friend! A friend! They came to me for advice, and I couldn’t really be of much help.)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">While emphasizing the word ‘friend,’ she added, “They want to hear the opinions of the opposite sex!”</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Hey~ what should I do?)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Can I get some information first?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oh! Right, right!)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s heartwarming seeing how her on-stream and off-stream personalities are so similar.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“R-really, Ayaya-san is amazing… Being a streamer is one thing, but not everyone can close the distance like this.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">She is a person who primarily manages and operates her channel through streaming. Moreover, she achieved a subscriber count of over 300,000 in just one year.</p>



<p class="calibre2">By interacting with her like this, the reasons for her popularity are gradually becoming apparent.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Her cheerful personality, friendly demeanor, and the way she treats everyone the same in an industry where hierarchy is often determined by channel subscriber counts.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oh, before that, I was curious. Why did you choose me as the person to consult with? We haven’t really known each other for long, right?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Because Oni-chan wouldn’t go around spreading this kind of things, right? I at least know about the other side of Oni-chan.)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Ah, I see.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Being exposed as someone who would lend an ear to consultations would be a blow in itself. Based on this, there isn’t really any reason for me to spread such things around.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Besides, you two kinda resemble each other, Oni-chan and that person.)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oh, really?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Well, the safest thing would be to consult someone in real life, but I wonder if she doesn’t have anyone around like that… Ayaya seems to have a lot of friends, though.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">In this industry, prying into someone’s private life is considered bad manners so I kept that question to myself.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(By the way, I’m curious about what kind of person Ayaya-san’s friend is interested in.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Well, you know! She’s into a café staff, someone mature and kind! Oh, this is just what I heard, so I don’t know the details!)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Café staff, huh. Indeed, many of them give off a calm and composed vibe.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“We have the same profession…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">He muttered quietly to himself as he replied.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(So, Ayaya-san’s friend is attracted to the mature and kind part of him?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Not just that, but there were also some really cool moments too!)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oh?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">When was the last time I had a conversation like this? It feels like it’s been several years.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Even though I’m in the position of giving advice, it’s starting to get exciting.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre2">“(Well, you know, just like me, that friend also moved to a different prefecture. And, like me, they have a regional dialect, so they were teased by people around them.)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(I see, I see.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(And then! In the midst of all that, when that person went into the cafe where they work and placed an order, they accidentally spoke in their dialect. And then, it seems like the customers behind them started whispering, saying it sounded country-like or something.)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Hmm?” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">At this point, I suddenly feel a sense of discomfort.</p>



<p id="calibre_link-81" class="calibre2">“(And you know what? That Onii-san boldly confronted them and stood up for her! How cool is that!?)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oh… That’s quite courageous.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The discomfort intensifies.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“W-Wait, isn’t that… No, it must be a coincidence.” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">I’ve encountered the same situation that she just described before.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(And besides, he pays a lot of attention to her! He earnestly draws latte art for her, write messages that make her happy, and was very caring! Isn’t he great!?)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Yeah, that’s nice.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">I can only give vague replies, as I’m doing similar things.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“I wonder if his drawings are bad… What’s going on? This sense of familiarity…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">I scratch my head, furrowing my brow.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The more I hear the story, the more I picture the silhouette of this ‘friend’ of hers.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Bob-cut milk tea-colored hair. Fair skin with pink eyes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It matches the silhouette of Shirayuki, a first-year university student and a regular customer who came to the shop today.</p>



<p class="calibre2">However, that’s impossible. The typical age for a first-year university student is 18 or 19. It’s unbelievable that someone of that age would have over 300,000 subscribers on their channel.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(By the way, does that cafe staff member have a girlfriend?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Ah.)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">A brief one-word reply.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Huh?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(I didn’t ask!! My friend didn’t ask either!!)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Ehh? Well, you should confirm that first.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(But if you ask someone if they have a girlfriend, they’ll know that you’re interested in them, right!?)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Well, that’s true.)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">It’s unavoidable that I can’t give good advice. I don’t have experience in this area.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oh, but you know! My friend made a promise to play ABEX with that cafe staff! If he has a girlfriend, wouldn’t he avoid making such a promise!?)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Oh, yeah, that makes sense. Wait, ABEX?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Yeah! It’s the same ABEX that we’re playing!)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(What’s his rank?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(We’re both in Platinum! We haven’t decided whether to play ranked or casual matches, though!)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">The moment I read this reply, I release my phone as if it’s too hot to touch.</p>



<p class="calibre2">I cover my mouth with my hand, looking up at the ceiling with indescribable emotions.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“This… this feels familiar… No, it’s probably just a bunch of coincidences piling up…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">I pick up the phone from the desk again.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Ah, but that staff member will be totally surprised when my friend plays ABEX with him!)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Surprised?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Yeah, because my friend has reached the top rank (Predator) before. She gave the sub-account she used for practicing to him.)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Wow, that’s amazing!)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Predator is a rank that only 750 players in the world can achieve.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It signifies a professional level of skill.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“Even if you don’t tell him, it should be pretty obvious when they start playing…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">After all, I’m also a player who has reached Predator rank. By observing character control and tactics, you can get an idea of a player’s skill level.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(Ayaya-san, can I ask you something?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(What, what?)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(When is your friend going to play ABEX with the cafe staff member?)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(It’s in five days!)” (Ayaya)</p>



<p class="calibre2">“(I see…)” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p class="calibre2">Five days from now is the same day as the promised date with Shirayuki Aya.</p>



<p class="calibre2">“No, it can’t be. Such a coincidence…” (Haruto)</p>



<p class="calibre2">That was the only reaction I could muster.</p>
