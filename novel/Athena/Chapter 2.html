<h2>Chapter 2: Date</h2>


<p>After that, Himegi stayed over at my house. It seems she didn’t want to cause unnecessary confusion by returning to her parents’ home.</p>
<p>I felt an urge to question her why she didn’t extend the same consideration to the Ouji household, but I held back and decided to entertain her graciously.</p>

<p>My mother and father were overjoyed. They truly welcomed her with open hearts.</p>
<p>My father declared to Himegi, ‘You’re my son’s wife. Whether it’s a few days, a hundred years, or even a thousand years, you can stay here as long as you like.’</p>

<p>So, it seems she’ll be staying in our house for a while.</p>
<p>She apparently didn’t bring a change of clothes, so I reluctantly lent her some of my clothes.</p>
<p>I lent her a relatively unused favorite hoodie and sweatpants. Upon seeing the hoodie, Himegi nostalgically remarked, ‘Wow, this brings back memories. I borrowed this hoodie the first time I stayed over at this house back then!’</p>

<p>I was curious about the circumstances that led her to stay at our house, but I decided to let it go since I had a feeling I might regret asking.</p>
<p>However, I mustered the courage to ask Himegi, ‘Are you okay with underwear?’</p>
<p>Then she responded with seemingly unconcerned response, ‘I forgot. Well, it’s fine even without them, so don’t worry.’</p>
<p>Ultimately, I rode my bicycle to the discount store to buy some for her while she soaked in the bath.</p>

<p>I never thought that the day would come when I, a virgin, would be buying women’s underwear. And so, the eventful day came to an end with her falling asleep.</p>
<p>Himegi slept in the guest room on the second floor, and I went to my own bed and attempted to sleep, but her words, ‘I am your destined victorious bride!’ kept echoing in my mind, so I ended up hardly sleeping that night.</p>

<p>——The next day.</p>
<p>With dark circles under my eyes, I made my way to the living room on the first floor.</p>
<p>The air was filled with a tantalizing, fragrant smell. I know that she is behind this door.</p>
<p>Thinking that, I found myself hesitating to turn the doorknob like I usually do.</p>

<p>When I open the door, will it be Himegi-san?</p>
<p>Or as usual, will my mother be there, busily preparing breakfast?</p>
<p>For a moment, I imagined such a scene, but from the other side of the door, I heard a young woman’s cheerful humming.</p>
<p>After all, yesterday’s events weren’t a dream.</p>

<p>I have no idea what kind of face I should make when I confront her, but either way, running away isn’t an option for me.</p>
<p>So, even if I’m bewildered, all I can do is push forward. With a bit of resolve, I opened the door to the living room.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Ha-kun!”</p>

<p>A woman in an apron greeted me with a smile.</p>
<p>She was wearing the clothes I had lent her, her hair was tied up at the back, and she wore the apron of a mysterious character that my mother always wore.</p>

<p>“When someone greets you, it’s good manners to return the greeting.”</p>
<p>“G-Good morning…”</p>
<p>“Yes, good morning.”</p>

<p>She seemed like an older sister.</p>
<p>Well, she’s six years older than me in reality, so it’s only natural to think so.</p>

<p>“Are you hungry? Would you like to eat the breakfast made by your new wife?”</p>

<p>She smiled and set breakfast on the table.</p>
<p>I took a seat and stared at the morning menu that was different from usual. There was a variety of colorful sandwiches arranged on the table.</p>

<p>“I know Ha-kun prefers rice, but we decided that on Saturdays and Sundays, we would have bread. You’ll have to endure it today.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine, they look really delicious. Did you make these yourself?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Ha-kun really likes these sandwiches.”</p>
<p>“Huh? I really like them huh…”</p>

<p>Asserting that I like a menu I’ve never even tried feels a bit odd, or rather, uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, my brain is craving this sandwich. I sit down, put my hands together, and grab a sandwich filled with boiled eggs, ham, avocado… um… I grab the sandwich with all sorts of various ingredients.</p>

<p>“Can I start eating?”</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>

<p>I put my hands together and say ‘Itadakimasu,’ then take a bite.</p>

<p>“Oh? It’s delicious. Incredibly delicious.”</p>

<p>I can see why Future Me would become fond of this. This sandwich is quite tasty.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a little hard to eat, that’s the problem…”</p>
<p>“As always, you’re quite picky.”</p>

<p>Himegi continued to look at me with a proud expression, even though she voiced her dissatisfaction. Then she takes off her apron, sits across, and smiles at me with an angelic smile.</p>
<p>If Future Me gets to monopolize this smile every day, then he’s quite the lucky guy.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mom and Dad? “</p>
<p>“They’re both working.”</p>
<p>“I see…I’m sorry to ask this during a meal, but I have so many questions.”</p>
<p>“It’s not really polite to ask during a meal, but you seem like you’ve been itching to ask for a while now. Alright, I’ll allow some questions.”</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll ask.”</p>

<p>There are countless things I want to ask, but the most pressing question I have for her right now is,</p>
<p>“First of all, um, when you say ‘Ha-kun,’ are you referring to me?”</p>
<p>“Huh, now you ask?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve been curious for a while, but the timing never felt right…”</p>
<p>“Sigh…It’s so like you, Ha-kun, to start with a question like that.”</p>
<p>“Sorry for not having a good sense of questioning.”</p>

<p>Even if it’s a question that might seem uninteresting to Himegi, it’s an important question for me.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t until we started dating and a few months had passed that I began calling you ‘Ha-kun.’ “</p>

<p>Since my classmate Himegi-san calls me ‘Ouji-kun’, I feel strange when someone who looks the same calls me with something different.</p>

<p>“I see. Then, can I ask a more serious question?”</p>
<p>“If it’s within my ability to answer.”</p>
<p>“Alright, Question 1: How did you travel from the future to this timeline?”</p>

<p>Surely, she didn’t modify a car and time travel to this timeline. Then, how on earth did she arrive to this timeline from the future?</p>
<p>(TN: I guess modifying a car for time travel is referencing ‘Back to the Future.’)</p>

<p>“That’s a good question. To be honest, I expected it to be the first question.”</p>
<p>“Sorry for not meeting your expectations. So, how did you come to this timeline?”</p>
<p>“Before I explain, I need to show you something.”</p>

<p>She takes something out of the front pocket of her apron and places it on the table.</p>

<p>“…A pocket watch?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I used this to travel back in time.”</p>

<p>What she showed me was an antique pocket watch.</p>
<p>Its color was a faded gold, truly a watch that perfectly embodied the word ‘retro’.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“It looks like the kind of pocket watch the White Rabbit would carry in Alice in Wonderland. Can I touch it?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>Given permission, I touch the pocket watch without hesitation. I open the lid and inspect the dial.</p>

<p>“The numbers on the dial are in English and digits. Is this foreign-made? Also, it seems to be broken.”</p>

<p>The pocket watch wasn’t ticking. Neither the second hand nor the minute hand nor even the hour hand was moving.</p>
<p>I try turning the crown left and right, but the clock hands show no sign of movement.</p>

<p>“That’s normal for now.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Before explaining that matter, let me first tell you the circumstances of how I acquired the pocket watch.”</p>
<p>“The circumstances of how you acquired it?”</p>
<p>“The original owner of that pocket watch was my grandmother. I had a certain bet with my grandmother and won quite spectacularly, receiving this pocket watch as a prize. Oh, by the way, my grandmother is a witch.”</p>

<p>She revealed something extraordinary so casually…</p>

<p>“A witch, huh…”</p>

<p>After the time traveler, now we have a witch.</p>
<p>I don’t want to imagine it, but I wonder if aliens or zombies will show up eventually.</p>

<p>“You’re not very surprised, are you?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m quite surprised. Um, your grandmother was actually a witch?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know all the details, but she said she wasn’t the type of witch who can conjure flames from her hands or transform into a dragon. Apparently, she excelled at creating mysterious items. She was that kind of witch.”</p>
<p>“It’s quite an incredible story.”</p>

<p>I see, there are types of witches who can transform into dragons or conjure flames from their hands in this world…</p>
<p>It seems that there are even more incredible people in this world than I had thought.</p>
<p>It’s a fact that’s hard to accept for someone like me who’s anti-occult.</p>

<p>“If it’s not broken, could you show me how to use it?”</p>

<p>I no longer doubt that Himegi-san is a time traveler.</p>
<p>So, why did I make such a request? Simply out of curiosity.</p>
<p>If possible, I’d like to etch the moment of time travel into my eyes.</p>

<p>“I’d love to fulfill your expectations, but… it’s impossible.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I’ll explain that right now.”</p>

<p>Himegi stands up from her chair and approaches me. Then,</p>

<p>“——Huh!?”</p>

<p>She suddenly starts taking off her red hoodie.</p>
<p>Naturally, after removing her clothes, her upper body is in her underwear—meaning she’s only wearing the bra I bought yesterday.</p>

<p>“W-Wha—”</p>

<p>I can’t comprehend why she suddenly took such an action——</p>
<p>Either way, there’s absolutely no reason for me to blatantly stare at Himegi’s chest, so I avert my gaze from her.</p>

<p>“Don’t be shy, look over here, Ha-kun.”</p>
<p>“N-No, it’s not that I’m shy… It’s just not okay, seriously.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t look, then there’s no point in me undressing.”</p>
<p>“No-no-no. No matter how much you ask, I can’t do it. Please spare me.”</p>
<p>“Just look this way!”</p>

<p>Himegi firmly grabs my face and turns it in her direction.</p>
<p>Then, my eyes meet her two prominent bosoms. Embarrassingly enough, I’m captivated by their size.</p>
<p>Black and pink bra. For someone like me with no experience with women, this is an extremely stimulating sight.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/B9.png" alt="" />

<p>“… See the number on the right breast?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Numbers?”</p>

<p>Indeed, there are numbers on Himegi’s chest.</p>
<p>Engraved in black letters, it reads ’55.’</p>

<p>What? I’m sure it was ’60’ yesterday…</p>

<p>“It seems like you’ve noticed.”</p>
<p>“I think it was ’60’ yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Yesterday’s number was ’60.’ But today, it’s ’55.’ Do you understand the meaning behind this?”</p>

<p>To be asked ‘Do you understand the meaning behind this?’——I think only a great detective could instantly come up with an answer.</p>
<p>At the very least, I, an ordinary person, have no clue.</p>

<p>“No, I have no idea. By the way, is that some kind of tattoo?”</p>
<p>“Do you think tattoos in this world would change every now and then?”</p>
<p>“…isn’t that possible in the future?”</p>
<p>“There’s no way that’s the case. By the way, it’s not written in marker either. This is evidence of time travel. You can think of it as a magical imprint engraved by magic.”</p>
<p>“A magical imprint…”</p>

<p>A little while ago, this word would have been one I would’ve laughed at and made fun of, but now, I can easily accept it.</p>
<p>Hmm, no doubt I’ve been influenced by her. Thinking that way, I feel a bit conflicted.</p>

<p>“By the way, what does that number mean?”</p>
<p>“This number represents how much longer it can stay in this timeline. In other words, it’s a number indicating a time limit.”</p>
<p>“Um… Does that mean that when the number reaches ‘0,’ you’ll return to the future?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. When the number engraved on this chest reaches ‘0,’ it means I’ll return to the timeline I came from.”</p>
<p>“In other words, there’s a limitation…”</p>

<p>“Well, considering it’s Ha-kun we’re talking about, you must have thought it was something related to breasts, right?”</p>
<p>“…Sorry. I thought you put the number ’60’ because your breast size is 60 inches.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing my words, she pressed her temple and looked at me with an exasperated expression.</p>

<p>“60 inches would be 152 centimeters when converted. It’s not that big, of course.”</p>
<p>“I-I see.”</p>
<p>“By the way, my bust size is an H-cup with a measurement of 95. Also, if I remember correctly, I think I was an F-cup back in high school.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san keeps revealing something amazing with a blunt face.</p>
<p>For some reason, an image of Himegi-san in a school uniform appeared in my mind.</p>
<p>I see, so that size is an F-cup. Even now, it’s really big, but to think it could still get bigger…</p>

<p>“Hehehe. Blushing and giving cute reactions, huh?”</p>
<p>“P-Please don’t make fun of me…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Lately, whenever I’ve tried these kinds of jokes on Ha-kun, he just brushes them off. So, seeing your reaction felt fresh, or rather, nostalgic.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine to reminisce, but please don’t make fun of me.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san says, ‘Stingy, huh’ and takes a big bite of her sandwich.</p>
<p>Hmm, just as I thought, the Himegi-san I know is slightly different from the one before me.</p>

<p>In my mind, Touka Himegi was a cool and stylish girl, but the current Himegi-san is frank, has a sense of humor, and gives off a friendly impression.</p>
<p>Have the six years influenced her personality in some way, or was she always like this from the start?</p>
<p>Either way, I’ve come to know this unexpected side of her.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Let’s get back to the topic. Regarding the impossibility of time travel that I mentioned earlier, as long as these numbers are engraved, I can’t return to my original timeline or jump to a different timeline.”</p>
<p>“Meaning, once you use it, you can’t use it again until the number becomes ‘0’?”</p>
<p>“That’s how it works.”</p>
<p>“It’s not as versatile as I thought, this pocket watch.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it’s still an incredibly overpowered item.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, I think it holds more value than all the inventions in this world combined.</p>
<p>After all, if you wanted, you could go back in time to alter history or make a fortune in lotteries or FX trading.</p>
<p>Hence, depending on the user, it can become a very dangerous item.</p>

<p>“I understand that the decreasing number on your chest means returning to your original timeline. So, what’s the rule for the countdown? Can the number increase?”</p>
<p>“According to my grandmother’s explanation, the countdown always decreases by ‘1’ each day. The number should never increase.”</p>
<p>“In other words, you can only stay in this timeline for a maximum of sixty days…Huh? Then why is the current number ’55’? Isn’t that strange?”</p>

<p>If the number decreases by only ‘1’ each day, the current number should be ’59’ for the calculation to make sense.</p>

<p>“It’s a penalty.”</p>
<p>“A penalty?”</p>
<p>“Yes. To prevent abuse, various regulations are magically set in place.”</p>
<p>“Meaning, you originally should’ve only lost ‘1’ count, but because you violated the rules, the number suddenly decreased by ‘5’?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>“What did you do?”</p>
<p>“It’s probably a spoiler.”</p>
<p>“A spoiler?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Last time, I talked to the Ouji family about various things from the future. Most likely, that’s what caused the number to decrease.”</p>
<p>“I see. So it all fits together.”</p>

<p>They’ve implemented measures to prevent misuse, it seems.</p>

<p>“I never thought that revealing just a bit of information would lead to such a decrease in the number.”</p>

<p>With a sulky expression, Himegi leaned on her hand and voiced her discontent.</p>
<p>Though it might have been just a casual revelation for you, for me, it was shocking enough to make my heart leap out…</p>

<p>“With this, I can’t casually talk about things from the future anymore.”</p>
<p>“Then, the discussion about the sandwich earlier and… well, the matter about your chest size too…they are both off-limits too, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s why I conducted an experiment to determine what’s safe and what’s not, as I’m not sure where the line between them lies. I need to first discern the boundary that won’t incur a penalty.”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you given detailed explanations about these things by your grandmother?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. She said, ‘I don’t have to tell you that much.’ Probably, given her demeanor, she might not even fully understand everything herself. After all, this pocket watch seems to be just one of many magic items.”</p>
<p>“One of many of these overpowered items… It’s quite a scary thought.”</p>
<p>“Either way, I have to be cautious.”</p>

<p>Saying so, Himegi had a serious expression.</p>
<p>Her face exuded an extraordinary determination.</p>

<p>“For now, could you please put your clothes back on? I’ve already understood enough about the matter with the number on your chest.”</p>
<p>“Oh, are you done staring? Have you burned it into your memory?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve seen enough, so please put your clothes on quickly.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san says, ‘I know you really want to see more,’ as she puts on her red hoodie again.</p>

<p>“There are many things I want to ask, but I think I can’t ask careless questions since I don’t know where the penalties might come in.”</p>
<p>“Well then, you can ask just one more question. Of course, within the limits of what I can answer.”</p>
<p>“Then, just one more question.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Why did Himegi come to this timeline?”</p>

<p>Personally, I was more curious about this than the method of time travel.</p>
<p>If you intentionally chose this timeline rather than by chance, could it be because you had a purpose?</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Exactly as it sounds. From listening to your story, it seems like you had a purpose and traveled to this timeline. Is that not the case?”</p>
<p>“…That’s correct. There’s something I really want to do in this timeline. That’s why I traveled through time.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say that yet. I have a purpose for coming to this timeline, but I can’t explain it right now.”</p>

<p>Himegi bows her head to me and says, ‘I’m sorry.’</p>

<p>There must be circumstances that she can’t explain even if she wants to.</p>
<p>To be honest, I’m curious. I’m really curious.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think I should press on about the purpose she came to this timeline if it’s going to trouble her.</p>
<p>So, I decided to patiently wait for Himegi to tell me if and when she was ready.</p>

<p>“Alright. I will not pursue any further. But if there’s anything that even someone like me can do to help, feel free to ask.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you.”</p>

<p>She smiles gracefully and looks at me with a gentle smile.</p>
<p>I felt my heart skip a beat at her gesture.</p>

<p>“By the way, I’ve been wondering about something for a while.”</p>

<p>Himegi’s expression suddenly turns serious, contrasting with her smile from before.</p>
<p>What’s wrong? Did I do something to upset her?</p>

<p>“Um, could you stop calling me ‘Himegi-san’?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Have we become distant enough to address each other so formally?”</p>
<p>“…Distant…? For me, I’ve always called you Himegi-san…”</p>
<p>“From now on, call me ‘My Beloved Touka.'”</p>
<p>“I’d rather not….”</p>

<p>I hate it to the point of death. It’s like calling someone ‘My beloved Takakyun~’, just like a certain silly childhood friend.</p>
<p>I would never want to call her that.</p>

<p>“How about we compromise with ‘Touka-san’ then?”</p>

<p>Though it sounds like she’s conceding, I’m sure she intended to be called ‘Touka-san’ from the start.</p>
<p>Well, I guess it can’t be helped. I’ll yield this point to her negotiation skills.</p>

<p>“…Okay. I’ll compromise with that.”</p>

<p>Well, it’s definitely better than calling her ‘My Beloved Touka.’</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Hehehe, you’re quite cooperative. Now, go ahead and call me that.”</p>
<p>“…Touka-san.”</p>

<p>Just saying her name makes me feel a bit embarrassed.</p>

<p>“…Not bad. Yes, it has a nice ring to it.”</p>

<p>Seems like I hit her heartstrings there.</p>
<p>Though I can’t shake the feeling that Touka-san is subtly manipulating me, let’s not dwell on that for now.</p>

<p>“By the way, Ha-kun, what are your plans for now?”</p>
<p>“I’m going shopping. I’ll get whatever you need.”</p>

<p>I remember clearly that Touka-san asked me yesterday to buy essential items.</p>

<p>“That’s honest of you. For now, we need to gather the essential items for our immediate living needs.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true.”</p>
<p>“I also need underwear. And I want to change my pillow. Oh, and shampoo and stuff too.”</p>

<p>Touka-san unties her bundled hair and touches it with a dissatisfied expression on her face.</p>

<p>“My bad. Sorry for making you use our cheap shampoo …”</p>

<p>I feel genuinely sorry for having made her beautiful silky hair touch a shampoo that costs less than a thousand yen.</p>

<p>“By the way, you cut your hair, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>I didn’t notice earlier because she had it styled, but Touka-san’s hair is slightly shorter than the high school student Himegi-san.</p>

<p>“Hm? Did I cut my hair? …Ah, yeah, that’s right. When I was in high school, my hair was a little longer than it is now. But more importantly, there are two big problems.”</p>
<p>“Two big problems?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m really troubled by this. If possible, I’d like to ask for Ha-kun’s wisdom on this.”</p>

<p>With a troubled expression, she takes out her smartphone and a long wallet from her power band and places them on the table.</p>

<p>“Huh? Is there a problem with these two?”</p>

<p>At a glance, I can’t really tell where the problem is.</p>

<p>“Yes, big problems. First, take a look at this device. The thing is, it’s been acting up since this morning.”</p>
<p>“Acting up? Specifically, how?”</p>
<p>“Just take a look. You’re a gadget geek, I’m sure you’ll quickly figure out the cause.”</p>
<p>“Being a gadget geek doesn’t mean I’m into smartphones; I just like computers… Anyway, I’ll check it for now.”</p>

<p>I pick up the red smartphone and proceed to examine it.</p>

<p>“The four-digit passcode is 1117.”</p>
<p>“…1, 1, 1, 7… Wait, isn’t that my birthday?”</p>
<p>“What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>“No, no problem.”</p>

<p>Well, it’s somewhat more secure than using her own birthday as a password.</p>
<p>After inputting the four-digit code, the smartphone’s screen unlocks.</p>

<p>“I have to say, the screen is really clear. The movement is smooth too. What’s the refresh rate of this?”</p>
<p>“Ri, rifuresshurēto???” (Re-refresh rate???)</p>
<p>“But honestly, the design is super lame. If I were the company’s president selling this smartphone, I’d stomp this design in front of the developers.”</p>
<p>“…Ha-kun recommended this smartphone to me, saying it’s good.”</p>
<p>“Wha-what!? I recommended this smartphone to you? That’s impossible! There’s no way I did that!”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>“Because I’m someone who prefers smaller smartphones! Carrying around a heavy phone with such a big screen all day would give me tendonitis.”</p>

<p>Wait, hold on.</p>
<p>Future Me converted to the big-screen smartphone camp?</p>

<p>“By the way, how much does it cost?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s… three hundred thousand yen.”</p>
<p>“Wow! That’s expensive! Future smartphones are costly, huh? It’s an astonishing price…With three hundred thousand yen, I could build a high-spec gaming PC!”</p>
<p>” …. “</p>
<p>“——How good are its benchmark scores? How’s the heat? But seriously, it’s not just that it’s big, it feels terrible too! The only thing praiseworthy is the screen’s beauty, huh? Even so, if it claims to be a smartphone of the future, I’d expect features like holograms emerging, the body of the smartphone being transparent, or at least some kind of transformation into a robot. <br />It seems that smartphone technology has hit a plateau at this stage, huh?”</p>

<p>Well, even so, YouTubers who specialize in gadget reviews would probably want this device badly.</p>

<p>“…Hey, gadget geek!”</p>
<p>“What’s up? What is it?”</p>
<p>“If you diss my phone any further——I won’t hesitate to use force.”</p>

<p>With a subtle smile, Touka-san raises a clenched fist.</p>
<p>It’s a nice smile, but her eyes aren’t smiling. Is she actually angry?</p>

<p>“Sorry… I got carried away. I’ll check it properly, so please forgive me.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you quickly figure out why it’s acting up?”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>I gaze at the smartphone’s screen. There are a few apps I’m not familiar with.</p>
<p>Perhaps these were created during these six years.</p>

<p>“The screen isn’t frozen, and it moves smoothly. Charging works fine?”</p>
<p>“Charging is fine.”</p>
<p>“Then, how about restarting and shutting down?”</p>
<p>“They work fine too.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Then what’s wrong with it?”</p>
<p>“For starters, none of the apps work.”</p>
<p>“The apps, huh…”</p>

<p>So that’s the issue. I touch some of the apps on the screen.</p>

<p>“…Indeed, they’re not responding. Did you drop the phone or anything?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t drop it. Also, I can’t make calls.”</p>
<p>“Calls too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I tried calling Ha-kun’s number, but there’s no response.”</p>
<p>“Can I call my smartphone…?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Go ahead and try.”</p>

<p>With Touka-san’s permission, I touch the calling app.</p>

<p>“This app responds, huh? Oh, I see. My number is already registered.”</p>

<p>My phone number was displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>Considering we’re a couple in the future, it’s quite natural for my number to be registered.</p>
<p>That’s fine, but I’d like you not to name it ‘My beloved Ha-kun.’</p>

<p>I’ll edit the name later…</p>
<p>For now, let’s try calling my phone.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Hmm… Right. It certainly doesn’t connect.”</p>

<p>The screen of the smartphone showed the message ‘Mobile network is unavailable.’</p>

<p>“It’s not working, huh?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right! Ha-kun, try calling my phone from yours.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Please give me your number.”</p>

<p>Touka-san verbally gives me her phone number.</p>
<p>I take out my white smartphone from my pocket, input Touka-san’s number, and make the call.</p>

<p>“Huh… It’s connected?”</p>

<p>The familiar sound of ‘ring, ring’ comes from my phone.</p>
<p>And then——</p>

<p>『——Yes?』</p>

<p>From the other end of the smartphone, I hear the lovely voice of a woman who could rival popular voice actresses.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the owner of this voice is undoubtedly a beautiful and cute girl.</p>
<p>However, what is it? This voice sounds familiar.</p>

<p>I feel like I was listening to it just a moment ago…</p>

<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>『I can hear you. Excuse me, but may I ask who’s calling?』</p>
<p>“…Ah!”</p>

<p>Finally, I understood who was on the other end of the call.</p>
<p>It’s Touka Himegi-san! Touka Himegi, the high school girl from this timeline!</p>

<p>“Hellooo, this is the Japanese-Sumerian person, Maq Hajio, desu.”</p>

<p>I decided to play the role of a foreigner who can only speak broken Japanese.</p>

<p>『A-a Japanese-Sumerian person, Maq Hajio???』</p>
<p>“Like, I’m giving it my all at the Mesopotamia Stadium in my country~”</p>
<p>『W-What?』</p>
<p>“Nano desu, Japan wa okotowari~desu~!”</p>
<p>『Huh? Eh? What?』</p>
<p>“Aimu sori 〜 I wanted to have a dream in Japan, I’m sorry! The tempura in Japan, the sweets were delicious!”</p>

<p>I tapped the button to end the call and forcefully terminated the call.</p>
<p>I’m sure that by now, Himegi-san must think that some well-meaning foreigner dialed the wrong number.</p>
<p>Phew, if it weren’t for my quick thinking, I wouldn’t have been able to bluff my way out of that.</p>

<p>“…Touka-san.”</p>
<p>“Yes, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that you’ve been using the same phone number all along?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. I’ve been with the same mobile carrier since middle school, so it’s the same number.”</p>
<p>“Just as I thought…”</p>
<p>“Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>“It’s a major problem. It seems that there are currently two identical SIM cards in this world.”</p>
<p>“Ha-kun?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“That… SIM card…what is that?”</p>

<p>I held my head. I had one of the biggest headaches ever.</p>
<p>And then, I explained everything to this clueless woman from start to finish.</p>

<p>“I see. So, the card inside this smartphone and the card inside the smartphone I have in my time are the same. So, why aren’t calls coming through to this smartphone?”</p>
<p>“I can’t explain the technical details of the communication, but it seems that the other phone has priority.”</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t my smartphone have priority? I feel like I’m losing to my past self.”</p>

<p>Why is this person competing with her past self?</p>

<p>“Anyway, the call function of this red smartphone isn’t broken.”</p>

<p>Earlier, when I swapped my smartphone’s SIM card with this red smartphone and called my parents, I was able to make calls without any issues.</p>
<p>This means that the call function of this smartphone isn’t broken.</p>
<p>However, even though communication worked, I couldn’t open other apps.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you use other apps? I don’t know, but I can speculate.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell me?”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s not a malfunction; maybe it’s just magic that’s preventing it from working.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, maybe there’s some kind of magical restriction in place.”</p>

<p>Honestly, it’s hard to explain it without thinking that way.</p>

<p>“So, that means LINE, Instagram, and Twitter won’t work either?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Well, even if it was a malfunction, it’s impossible to repair.”</p>

<p>Sending a new smartphone from six years in the future to be repaired would cause a huge mess.</p>
<p>After all, at this time, smartphones like this one don’t even exist, so sending something like this for repairs would create chaos.</p>
<p>In that sense, I can’t help but say that this smartphone is dangerous too.</p>

<p>“It was working normally until yesterday…”</p>
<p>“Probably, if you go back to the time you came from, you might be able to use it again.”</p>
<p>“Ha-kun, can’t you at least somehow manage to retrieve the wedding video I showed you yesterday?”</p>
<p>“I really want to help, but it seems beyond my capabilities.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>Touka slumped her shoulders and looked down.</p>
<p>Seeing her like this makes me want to help, but this is so far beyond my expertise that I can do nothing.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s no other choice. Let’s start by solving the other problem.”</p>

<p>Touka picked up her wallet from the table.</p>

<p>“This is just a wallet, right?”</p>
<p>“Ha-kun, the issue isn’t the wallet itself. The problem lies with what’s inside.”</p>
<p>“Inside?”</p>

<p>Touka took out several banknotes from her long wallet and placed them on the table.</p>

<p>“Wha—!? Is this…!”</p>

<p>For a moment, my body froze from the shock.</p>
<p>Something so astonishing had come out of the long wallet.</p>

<p>“Yes, the problem lies with these banknotes.”</p>

<p>The banknotes that came out of the long wallet were ones I had never seen before.</p>
<p>I tremblingly picked up one of those banknotes.</p>

<p>“…Th-this isn’t… It’s not Yukichi Fukuzawa… This ten-thousand-yen bill…”</p>

<p>I tried to convince myself that it might be foreign currency, but the banknote clearly read ‘Bank of Japan’.</p>
<p>Actually, the design depicts a man who definitely looks Japanese from every angle.</p>
<p>I’m sure this new ten-thousand-yen bill was supposed to be released next year…</p>

<p>“Maybe I’m the first person to get this new 10,000-yen bill…”</p>
<p>“Hehehe, that’s an interesting thought.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not a laughing matter. Just to be sure, this is real, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s real.”</p>

<p>So it seems. Touka-san really does seem to be from the future, after all.</p>

<p>“By the way, the 150,000 yen there is all I have to my name.”</p>
<p>“Meaning you’re currently broke. Is this the second issue?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>This money is unusable. The reason is that it hasn’t been circulated yet.</p>
<p>Well, even if we brought ten thousand bills with Yukichi Fukuzawa’s face from the future that we often see, using them would still be no good.</p>
<p>If we did that, the same serial number would end up circulating in the world.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Credit cards are likely unusable too. The only option for now is borrowing money from my parents.”</p>
<p>“I really don’t want to do that. Oh, I know! Maybe we can sell this for money?”</p>

<p>Seemingly struck by an idea, Touka-san attempted to retrieve something from her brand-named bag.</p>

<p>“Tou-emon, what are you going to take out from your future pocket this time?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ll be surprised.”</p>

<p>That’s what she said.</p>
<p>Honestly, I can’t imagine what could come out of that bag, but I’m sure I’ll be very surprised when I see it.</p>

<p>“Here it is.”</p>

<p>Then, she took out a card about the size of playing cards from the bag and placed it on the table.</p>

<p>“-???”</p>

<p>I had prepared myself to be flabbergasted, but what I saw was far from what I had imagined.</p>
<p>Honestly, I felt a bit disappointed.</p>

<p>“Te-te-teree~! It’s a Monster card!”</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, Touemon followed up on my previous setup with the same joke.</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised that she actually had a comedic side.</p>
<p>By the way, her imitation of Doraemon was unbelievably terrible. But, right now, that doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>“This is a card from a popular card game, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Nostalgic. I used to collect these a little bit back in elementary school.</p>
<p>The card placed on the table was a very famous Dragon Monster card that even someone like me could recognize it.</p>

<p>“I confiscated this from a certain guy.”</p>
<p>“A certain guy?”</p>
<p>“It’s a pitiful prince named Hakuba Ouji, but to my surprise, he was actually trying to engage in sugar dating.”</p>
<p>“S-sugar dating?!”</p>

<p>Oh come on, Future Me, what are you doing…</p>
<p>Also, that disturbing word is still in use six years from now.</p>

<p>“By the way, this card is worth a hundred thousand yen.”</p>
<p>“A hundred thousand yen?”</p>
<p>“Yes, without my permission. You’ve always been loose with your wallet strings, or rather, you’re a bundle of material desires.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>I can’t seem to refute her complaints, so I decide to remain silent.</p>
<p>Even if it seems cowardly, it’s best to keep my mouth shut here.</p>

<p>“That’s why, ever since we started living together, I’ve been managing the money, but that guy, by hook or by crook, sneaks things past me and secretly buys stuff like this…”</p>

<p>Touka-san stared at the rare card with a look of exasperation.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’m selling this card today.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Even though it was purchased with my money?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Any problem?”</p>

<p>She won’t let me refute her. Touka-san glared at me with a stern expression.</p>

<p>“What’s mine is mine, what’s yours is mine.”</p>

<p>She seems to be more of a Gian than a Doraemon.</p>
<p>From this exchange, I can easily imagine what the power dynamic between my future self and Touka-san is like</p>

<p>“Even if you want to sell it, you’ll need parental consent. I’ll download the consent form for you later.”</p>
<p>“I see. So, I’ll be a minor right now. In that case, this driver’s license won’t be usable either.”</p>

<p>With a disappointed expression, she took out her driver’s license from her wallet.</p>
<p>I gazed at the driver’s license Touka-san held in her hand.</p>
<p>The driver’s license had ‘Touka Himegi’ written on it.</p>

<p>I see——</p>
<p>Himegi-san’s birthday is on December 25th.</p>
<p>The address listed must be her parents’ address. If that’s the case, it’s quite far from my house.</p>
<p>Oh, she also has a license for driving small motorcycles…</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, a driver’s license contains various pieces of information.</p>
<p>The most noticeable among them were the expiration date for renewal and the date of issuance.</p>
<p>Both the expiration date and the issuance date were several years ahead of the current date.</p>

<p>“…you really are a time traveler…”</p>
<p>“I’ve been saying that all along, haven’t I?”</p>
<p>“It would have been better if you had shown me this license from the very beginning.”</p>
<p>“You would have insisted it’s a forgery if I showed it to you.”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess I wouldn’t have easily believed it.”</p>
<p>“In that case, don’t you think showing you the video of that wedding is the best option?”</p>
<p>“Being told that, I can’t argue. Anyway, the purpose today is to arrange for money and essential items for daily life. While we can get most things online, it’s better to purchase items we need immediately in person.”</p>

<p>And we also need a replacement smartphone.</p>

<p>“Yes. After finishing breakfast, let’s head out for shopping.”</p>

<p>So, with that settled, Touka-san and I set out for a shopping trip.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>In general, I spend most of my days off at home.</p>
<p>In other words, I’m a complete indoor person.</p>
<p>Building PCs, assembling plastic models, and practicing magic tricks—these three activities make up my routine on days off.</p>

<p>However, there’s a place I occasionally venture to on my days off. That place is a large shopping mall.</p>
<p>It’s located a bit outside the suburbs, not very convenient. But we were headed to that place.</p>

<p>“First of all, clothes,” she said.</p>

<p>Apparently, the set of clothes I lent her didn’t suit her taste.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, we had a lot of trouble getting to this shopping mall.</p>
<p>I thought about it, and it made sense right away.</p>

<p>If by chance she encountered someone she knew—if she happened to run into herself—the outcome was easy to imagine.</p>
<p>It would undoubtedly lead to chaos for sure.</p>

<p>So I insisted to Touka-san that I would go alone.</p>
<p>I told her that I would go shopping and purchase the items we needed alone.</p>
<p>However, my advice fell on deaf ears, and she dismissed it.</p>

<p>Touka-san confidently stated, 『I’ve only been to that shopping mall a few times, so there’s no chance of me running into myself. There’s no problem at all.』</p>
<p>Even so, I didn’t back down and advised her, 『It’s also not good to meet acquaintances other than yourself.』</p>
<p>She chuckled and said, 『Don’t worry, I have a secret plan,』 with great confidence.</p>
<p>In the end, I gave in, and things went according to her wishes.</p>

<p>I had always thought she was strong-willed, but I never imagined she would be so stubborn.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even seeing such troublesome aspects of her personality, my fondness for her didn’t diminish; on the contrary, I found myself falling for her even more.</p>

<p>Love is really something that can make people irrational.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Before shopping for clothes, we need to sell that item.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Let’s start by selling this card.”</p>

<p>By the way, the secret plan she mentioned was to wear a mask and sunglasses.</p>

<p>…Perhaps, she’s more of a klutz than I thought?</p>
<p>And so, we arrived at the card shop in the shopping mall, where we went to sell the rare cards with the consent form written by our parents.</p>
<p>By the way, I hadn’t visited this place since elementary school.</p>

<p>Amidst this, a man who seemed to be the store manager of the card shop was carefully examining the rare card with a serious expression.</p>

<p>“Th-This is…”</p>

<p>The store manager’s hand trembled as he looked at the presented rare cards, his eyes widening.</p>
<p>Was it really that surprising?</p>

<p>“To think I could touch a card of which there are only thirty in the world…”</p>
<p>“Oh? Thirty in the world?”</p>
<p>“Yes, this card was given only to tournament winners, and there are only thirty of them in the world. I thought it might be a counterfeit, but there’s no doubt that this is the real deal.”</p>

<p>Apparently, the card was even rarer than I had thought.</p>

<p>“The condition is excellent too. I’ll buy it for 200,000 yen.”</p>
<p>“200,000 yen!?”</p>

<p>They were offered double the price for a card worth 100,000 yen.</p>
<p>Now I can really understand why trading card game cards are called stocks.</p>

<p>“Then please.”</p>

<p>Touka-san said firmly, showing no trace of remorse in her expression.</p>
<p>In the end, the card was sold for about 200,000 yen.</p>

<p>I put my hands together and apologized to the future me who shouldn’t exist in this right now.</p>
<p>To the future Hakuba Ouji, I’ll use this 200,000 yen meaningfully, so please forgive me.</p>

<p>Touka-san was in a very good mood.</p>
<p>She seemed delighted that the card sold for a higher price than she had imagined.</p>

<p>“To think a 100,000 yen card would sell for 200,000 yen, I should’ve brought more.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t voice such wicked thoughts.”</p>

<p>But now there’s one more card in the world of which there are only thirty…</p>
<p>Let’s pretend we didn’t hear, see, or know about the explanation just now.</p>
<p>And then, after leaving the card shop, we decided to step into a nearby clothing store.</p>
<p>Upon entering, a cute and stylish female clerk welcomed us with a smile and a ‘Welcome~.’</p>

<p>Touka-san began to silently browse through the clothes hanging on hangers.</p>
<p>Seeing her with a serious expression, I thought she looked adorable.</p>
<p>Ah, I confirmed once again that I do like her.</p>

<p>“I’ve decided on this one.”</p>

<p>With a radiant smile, Touka-san picked up a mouse-colored outfit.</p>
<p>(TN: refers to a shade of gray or brown that resembles the color of a mouse’s fur. )</p>

<p>Then, she told me to ‘wait here for a bit,’ leaving those words and heading towards the fitting room, closing the curtain.</p>
<p>Now, what should I do? I’m kind of in a daze.</p>

<p>For the time being, I decided to sit on a bench near the fitting rooms.</p>
<p>Then, from the fitting room where Touka-san entered, I heard the sound of clothes rustling as if being taken off.</p>
<p>Inadvertently, that sound made my heart race.</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Could it be that Touka-san is in her underwear right now?</p>
<p>Even though I knew I shouldn’t imagine it, there I was, picturing her figure behind the curtain.</p>
<p>Lost in these thoughts, a female store employee came towards me with brisk steps.</p>

<p>“You have a pretty sister.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you siblings out for shopping today?”</p>

<p>Seemingly, this store employee has misunderstood and thinks that Touka-san and I are siblings.</p>
<p>In such situations, what’s the best response?</p>
<p>Saying something like ‘She’s my wife’ would make it seem like I’m overly confident and it’s embarrasing, which I don’t want, but I also didn’t want to say ‘She’s my sister’…</p>
<p>Well, I guess it’s a bit better than being mistaken for a girl as usual…</p>
<p>As I pondered what the best reply would be, Touka-san’s voice came from the fitting room,</p>

<p>“Ha-kun, this outfit is tight around the chest. Could you get me a size larger?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Even if you ask for a larger size…”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ll get that for you.”</p>

<p>The store employee gave a cheerful sales smile and quickly fetched a larger-sized outfit to take to Touka-san’s fitting room.</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>This is really uncomfortable…Just spacing out here won’t get me anything.</p>
<p>Besides, I definitely don’t want to be grilled with questions by the store employee.</p>

<p>“Touka-san, I’m a little thirsty, so I’ll go buy some drinks.”</p>

<p>I’m not really that thirsty. It’s just an excuse to escape this situation.</p>

<p>“…Alright.”</p>

<p>Getting permission from Touka-san, I feel relieved.</p>
<p>If she had told me to endure and wait a bit longer, I wouldn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>I left the words ‘Please take care of her’ with the store employee and left the store.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I was prepared for it to take some time, but surprisingly, after about ten minutes, Touka-san came out of the boutique and rushed over to where I was sitting on the bench.</p>

<p>“You’re quick.”</p>

<p>Uttering such a simple impression, I handed her a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Normally, I’m the one who buys drinks from vending machines, but this time, I decided to splurge a little and got two café au laits takeaway from the coffee chain on the second floor.</p>
<p>For a student like me, spending 700 yen on a cup of café au lait is quite a hit to my wallet, but I didn’t want to appear stingy in front of Touka-san.</p>

<p>“Oh? How considerate of you.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know your preference, so I went with a safe choice of café au lait.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I really like café au lait.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you liked it.”</p>
<p>“It’s quite strange to hear ‘I didn’t know your preference’ from Ha-kun’s mouth.”</p>
<p>“Well, it goes both ways.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p> </p>


<p>Touka-san gazes at me intently. Does she want to sit next to me on the bench?</p>
<p>Thinking that, I move from the center to the edge to make room for her.</p>

<p>“It’s not about that. Aren’t there things you should say before showing such consideration? Yes, there should be words you ought to say to your future bride.”</p>
<p>“What should we have for lunch?”</p>

<p>Touka-san responds with a slightly pouting expression.</p>
<p>Uh, even though I know it’s wrong, I really like this pouty expression.</p>
<p>I understand what she’s seeking from me and what kind of words she wants. I understand, but the mischievous part within me whispered that I should be a little mean.</p>
<p>That’s why I ended up saying something slightly mean.</p>

<p>At my age, I never thought I would understand the feeling of wanting to be mean to the girl I like…</p>

<p>“Ha-kun, you’ve always had that kind of side to you, huh?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Surprisingly, it seems I have a twisted side in my heart too.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, what do you think of this outfit?”</p>

<p>Touka-san’s appearance had naturally changed when she came out of the boutique. She had switched from a red hoodie to a beige knit dress.</p>
<p>If I were to honestly express my impression of the outfit, words like ‘sexy’ or ‘alluring’ would come to mind first.</p>

<p>However, those words might not be considered compliments for women.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this knit dress clung tightly to her body, emphasizing her curves. Particularly, the design revealed her cleavage, giving it an adult and alluring look.</p>
<p>Yeah, that’s it, a form-fitting dress that only the chosen ones can wear. While it’s visually appealing, it’s quite stimulating for my adolescent self.</p>

<p>“…Well, it suits you. It makes you look like a mature woman, and that’s incredibly attractive.”</p>

<p>I conveyed my honest thoughts to Touka-san while keeping my composure.</p>
<p>She responded with a smirk,</p>



<p>“Hehe, you’re blushing so much. Ha-kun, you are so cute.”</p>
<p>“…if you say so.”</p>
<p>“Now that I’ve seen the reaction I wanted to see, what should we do next?”</p>
<p>“I’m feeling a bit hungry.”</p>
<p>“Alright then, should we have something light to eat?”</p>
<p>“Sounds good. What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I feel like having takoyaki.”</p>
<p>“Should we head to the food court then?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Let’s do that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ll hold it.”</p>

<p>I’m not sure if I can properly escort her, but at the very least, I should help carry her belongings.</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Touka-san smiled at me and handed me the paper bag she was holding.</p>
<p>The bag seemed to contain the hoodie, tracksuit, sunglasses, and mask I had lent her.</p>

<p>“Do you want to hold hands?”</p>

<p>With a mischievous smile, Touka-san extended her hand toward me.</p>

<p>“Out of consideration for my future self, I’ll pass on that.”</p>
<p>“Really? I don’t think my husband would get jealous over something like that.”</p>

<p>While I trust her husband wholeheartedly, if my wife were to hold hands with another man, I would probably—or rather, I would definitely—feel jealous.</p>
<p>The source for this is none other than me. There’s no more reliable source than that.</p>

<p>“Shall we go then?”</p>
<p>“Do you know where it is?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Since graduating high school, Ha-kun and I used to come on dates here quite often.”</p>

<p>It’s an unbelievable story, but apparently, this shopping mall will become a regular date spot a few years from now.</p>

<p>“Oh, the elevator is coming down. Come on, Ha-kun.”</p>

<p>Following Touka-san’s lead, I got on the elevator. Inside were a couple, a bit older than me, who seemed like college students.</p>
<p>The man glanced at Touka-san with lustful eyes as he got on the elevator, and his girlfriend responded by stepping on his foot out of jealousy.</p>

<p>Witnessing this scene, I knew it wasn’t right, yet I couldn’t help but feel a bit amused.</p>
<p>After getting off the elevator, we made a beeline for the fourth-floor food court.</p>

<p>As we walked, both men and women stole glances at Touka-san.</p>
<p>She sure stands out. Stands out a bit too much.</p>
<p>It’s an honor to stand beside such a person, but I can’t help worrying about unexpectedly running into acquaintances.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I think we shouldn’t stay here for too long.</p>
<p>Let’s propose leaving after we’ve had the takoyaki we’re here for.</p>

<p>As I considered this, we somehow reached our destination.</p>
<p>The food court on Saturday was bustling with young people. Conversations among peers filled the air from left and right.</p>
<p>It was still before noon, but every food stall had a reasonable crowd and lines of people waiting.</p>
<p>Among them, the takoyaki stall we were aiming for had an especially long line.</p>

<p>“It’s really popular.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is.”</p>

<p>I stood in line with Touka-san at the end. The enticing smell of takoyaki tickled my nostrils.</p>

<p>“It was popular even before, but after being featured on TV, it became even more popular.”</p>
<p>“It’s nostalgic.”</p>

<p>To me, it’s a recent story, but for Touka-san, who came from a world six years ahead, it must be an event of a distant past.</p>

<p>“Is it still popular six years later?”</p>
<p>“Huh!?”</p>
<p>“So, is this takoyaki place still a big hit six years later?”</p>

<p>For some reason, Touka-san looks a bit awkward.</p>

<p>“Oh, right! Talking about the future results in a penalty, and the numbers will go down. Please forget my question.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that.”</p>

<p>Afterward, while waiting for our turn, Touka-san and I engaged in casual chat.</p>
<p>Then, our turn came, and we looked at the menu.</p>

<p>“Welcome.”</p>

<p>A cute female clerk greeted us with a business smile.</p>

<p>“Touka-san, how many pieces do you want? “</p>

<p>I consulted with her about our order, but she didn’t respond. I lifted my gaze from the menu and turned my eyes to Touka-san.</p>

<p>“Uh, Touka-san?”</p>

<p>For some reason, Touka-san was staring fixedly at the young female clerk’s face. Her expression was as if she had seen something unusual.</p>

<p>The clerk also had a perplexed look as she was being stared at.</p>
<p>What was going on? Judging by Touka-san’s expression, there didn’t seem to be any hostility.</p>

<p>I was about to remind Touka-san because I thought it was a bit rude, but she suddenly said,</p>

<p>“Eight pieces.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Ha-kun, let’s go with eight pieces.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Um, eight pieces, please.”</p>
<p>“Uh, sure. Eight pieces.”</p>
<p>“And, with toppings, mayonnaise and bonito flakes, please.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>

<p>As I was about to take out my wallet, Touka-san stopped me.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay for this.”</p>

<p>Touka-san took out a 10,000 yen bill from her wallet and handed it to the clerk.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the 10,000 yen. Here’s your change!”</p>

<p>Just as the clerk reached out to give us the change, Touka-san leaned forward, bringing her face close to the clerk’s ear, and whispered something.</p>

<p>“Huh!? H-How did you know that?!?”</p>
<p>“Just follow my advice.”</p>

<p>The clerk was clearly flustered.</p>
<p>What on earth did Touka-san convey to the clerk?</p>

<p>“… i-it’ll take a few minutes. Once it’s ready, we’ll call you.”</p>

<p>With a bewildered expression, we received the remote control for the one-touch call from the female clerk.</p>
<p>In order to secure a place to eat, we began looking for an available table.</p>

<p>“Over there is empty.”</p>

<p>Touka-san pointed to an available table, and then we sat down at the vacant table and took a breath.</p>

<p>“Are you curious about that exchange?”</p>
<p>“Well… I am curious. I am curious, but I’ll also choose not to ask this time.”</p>

<p>The fact that it was whispered meant that it was a conversation meant only for the parties involved.</p>
<p>If that were the case, it would be a matter of etiquette not to ask. So, I resigned myself to not pursue the matter.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Also, takoyaki doesn’t go well with café au lait, does it?”</p>

<p>I realized I completely forgot to order a drink.</p>

<p>“I’ll get something to drink. What would you like, Touka-san?”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll have tea, please.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>As I stood up, the one-touch call emitted a beeping sound.</p>

<p>“I’ll also get the takoyaki while I’m at it.”</p>
<p>“Please do.”</p>

<p>And so, I went to retrieve the takoyaki and buy the drinks.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I had planned to eat takoyaki and then head straight home. After all, I thought it would be dangerous to stay here any longer.</p>
<p>That’s why I tried to persuade Touka-san, but she started insisting that she wanted to watch a movie.</p>
<p>In the end, I gave in and we decided to watch a movie. As a result, we found ourselves at the movie theater on the top floor of the shopping mall.</p>

<p>“Let me cover this one.”</p>

<p>Since she treated me to takoyaki earlier, I thought I should cover the cost of the tickets this time.</p>
<p>,<br />“It’s fine. For a student, the cost of tickets can’t be taken lightly. Let this big sister pay it again.”</p>
<p>“No, that won’t work. My father gave me money to take care of you properly, so I’ll definitely pay this one.”</p>

<p>I had my father fill out the consent form as my guardian when selling the card.</p>
<p>At that time, my father told me, ‘Make sure to properly escort Touka-chan’ while handing me a 10,000 bill.</p>

<p>“In that case, I’ll accept it this time.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please do.”</p>

<p>We headed to the ticket machine and stared at the screen.</p>

<p>“Which one should we choose?”</p>

<p>To be honest, none of the movies piqued my interest. So, I decided to leave the choice up to Touka-san.</p>

<p>“Hmm… Ah, let’s go with this one.”</p>

<p>Touka-san pointed to the screen of the ticket machine.</p>
<p>The movie she pointed to was a Japanese animated film that had been gaining a lot of attention lately, even being advertised on TV commercials almost every day.</p>

<p>“Have you not seen this one?”</p>

<p>As far as I knew, it had earned over 20 billion yen in box office revenue. Considering that, I assumed Touka-san had probably watched it too.</p>
<p>But like me, had she not seen it?</p>

<p>“I’ve seen it five times.”</p>

<p>Touka-san declared resolutely.</p>

<p>“You probably haven’t seen this movie, Ha-kun.”</p>
<p>“…I haven’t.”</p>
<p>“I thought so. By the way, the future you was so into this movie that he watched it on subscription services and even went to see the sequel on its opening day.”</p>
<p>“Phrasing it that way actually makes me really curious.”</p>
<p>“Well, Ha-kun was furious when I spoiled the movie next to him…”</p>
<p>“…Please make sure not to spoil it for me either, under any circumstances.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe. That depends on how Ha-kun behaves from now on.”</p>

<p>Despite feeling uneasy, we purchased a high school student and an adult ticket from the ticket machine.</p>

<p>“Um, that’s 2,900 yen.”</p>

<p>Then I took out my velcro wallet from my pocket——rip rip rip! (TN: Sounds of velcro tearing.)</p>

<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“Hmm? Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>” …No, it’s nothing…”</p>

<p>The screening was about twenty minutes away. In the meantime, we passed the time in the merchandise shop.</p>
<p>An announcement played, signalling the start of entry to the theater.</p>
<p>People started forming lines at the entrance gates, and we joined the line and handed our tickets to the male staff.</p>

<p>“Are you really okay with choosing this movie?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I think it’s lucky that I can watch it on a big screen again.”</p>

<p>Now, let’s see if this movie is as amazing as Future Me made it out to be when he watched the sequel on opening day.</p>

<p>Several months had passed since the release date, so the theater was quite empty.</p>
<p>Commercials played on the big screen. Just watching those visuals heightened my excitement.</p>
<p>Our seats were right in the middle, and luckily, they were away from the other people.</p>

<p>“It feels nice, like we have this place all to ourselves.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>We sat down, and I took out my phone from my pocket to turn it off.</p>
<p>…Seriously?</p>

<p>“Is something the matter?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing…”</p>

<p>My phone had numerous missed call notifications.</p>
<p>Judging by the number, they were from the present-day Touka Himegi.</p>
<p>What should I do? How should I explain this to Himegi-san?</p>

<p>I was so pumped up anticipating this movie, but reality came crashing back.</p>
<p>While pondering over this, the lights in the theater dimmed a bit more. It seemed that the movie we were waiting for was about to start.</p>

<p>As the story began, I was drawn into the world of the film.</p>
<p>The bass resounded in my eardrums. Just that sound alone gave me goosebumps and raised my excitement again.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the movie was about time travel—a high school girl goes back in time to give love advice to her high schooler future mother.</p>

<p>Honestly, while I initially thought both the media and society were hyping the movie too much, this movie… was genuinely entertaining.</p>
<p>Intricately woven foreshadowing. A well-structured narrative that keeps me engaged.</p>
<p>The story took unexpected twists and turns, and I marveled at how it eventually tied up loose ends.</p>

<p>The final scene was nothing short of excellent. It might have been the best ending I have seen in any movie so far.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, there was nothing to complain about in this story. It was such a fantastic movie that I could understand why future me, who was spoiled with its content, might still have been so attached to it.</p>
<p>If everyone in the theater were like me, they’d probably give a standing ovation.</p>

<p>As the ending credits finished, the lights in the theater brightened again.</p>

<p>“It was an interesting movie——”</p>

<p>Touka-san next to me—large tears were rolling down her cheeks.</p>
<p>I was taken aback. While there were certainly moments that could make you want to tear up, I never imagined she’d be actually crying.</p>

<p>“…It’s still as interesting as ever, this movie.”</p>

<p>It was impolite, but I found it unexpected.</p>
<p>I had never imagined that she, who is usually so calm, would be so emotional. What scene could have struck such a chord with her…</p>

<p>“Touka-san, here.”</p>

<p>I offered her the handkerchief I took out from my pocket.</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>She took the handkerchief and wiped away her tears.</p>

<p>At times like these, what’s the right thing to say?</p>
<p>It’s embarrassing to admit, but I had no clue what the best action I should take was.</p>

<p>I was, however, certain about one thing.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, I will never come to like her crying face.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Ha-kun, I’m going to pick some flowers.” (TN: Toilet.)</p>

<p>Perhaps having calmed down a bit, Touka-san shared her physiological state with me.</p>
<p>We quickly made our way through the exit gate and headed straight to the women’s restroom within the movie theater hall.</p>
<p>Touka-san rushed in, and I patiently waited nearby for her to come out.</p>

<p>In the end, facing Touka-san’s tear-streaked face, I could only stammer and fumble.</p>
<p>Should I hug her at times like these? Or should I console her with gentle words?</p>
<p>Either way, it was quite a challenging situation for me.</p>

<p>“I need to strive harder.”</p>

<p>As I am now, I’m not good enough for her.</p>
<p>While pondering this, Touka-san emerged from the women’s restroom.</p>
<p>That was fast. It hadn’t even been a minute since she went in.</p>
<p>Moreover, she also told me, ‘I’ll also be fixing my makeup, so it might take a while.’</p>
<p>I was prepared to wait longer, but——</p>

<p>Strangely enough, Touka-san had changed her outfit.</p>
<p>She had transformed from the fitted knit dress that accentuated her figure into a feminine style that concealed her body shape.</p>

<p>A flared skirt in a gentle pastel pink and a cardigan with prominent buttons.</p>
<p>It was a very spring-like outfit. With grace and transparency, I believe this attire brought out her charm to the fullest.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, her swift change of clothes was like something a magician would do.</p>
<p>Could I possibly change this quickly as well? No, probably not.</p>
<p>Curiously, when her eyes met mine, she made an incredibly embarrassed face.</p>
<p>Oh? Her wedding ring on her ring finger was missing…. Co-could it be? Is she——?</p>

<p>“Whoops, Ha-kun, sorry for keeping you waiting—”</p>

<p>From the women’s restroom door emerged a smiling Touka-san freeze on the spot.</p>
<p>…If my intuition wasn’t playing tricks on me, I’m currently seeing two identical faces.</p>
<p>Wow, it’s like being shown a magic trick.</p>

<p>No wait, this is bad, this is really bad!</p>
<p>It’s not the time to feel like I’ve just witnessed a magic trick!</p>
<p>If this continues, it’ll be the worst outcome!</p>

<p>“Hm? A familiar voice from behind?”</p>


<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/B10.png" alt="" />

<p>With a puzzled expression, Himegi-san was about to turn around to look behind her.</p>

<p>“W-What a coincidence!”</p>

<p>I loudly called out to her, trying to stop her from looking behind.</p>
<p>Perhaps she couldn’t just ignore me like that. She abruptly froze in her tracks, turning to gaze at me.</p>

<p>What’s with the 『I’ve only been to that shopping mall a few times, so there’s no chance of me running into myself. 』 nonsense!</p>
<p>We totally encounter the present Touka Himegi right now!</p>

<p>Right then and there, I gestured to Touka-san to quickly escape to the restroom.</p>
<p>Touka-san, frozen in place, noticed my gesture and rushed back into the restroom.</p>

<p>“W-What’s going on all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“Ah, you see, it’s my usual habit to react with something like that at a moment like this.”</p>
<p>“I-I see.”</p>

<p>Damn it! Thanks to Touka-san, I must have come across as a weird guy!</p>

<p>“By the way, Ouji-kun, are you here to watch a movie too?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. What a coincidence!”</p>
<p>“I see, just like me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I suddenly felt like watching a movie, so I came here!”</p>

<p>Is it a prank of fate? Or was someone plotting this? Either way, this situation is really bad!</p>
<p>Two of them can’t meet here right now. </p>
<p>If that happens, it would cause too much confusion.</p>
<p>In any case, I need to separate them for now.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I grabbed her hand and led her to the ticket vending machine to purchase tickets.</p>
<p>While we’re watching the movie, Touka-san should find a way to escape.</p>

<p>“——Huh, wait, hold on!”</p>
<p>“Do you know how to buy tickets, Himegi-san?”</p>
<p>“Are you making fun of me? Of course I know how.”</p>
<p>“Then, please buy them quickly. The people behind us are waiting.”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>

<p>Despite wearing a bewildered expression, Himegi-san proceeded to touch the panel on the screen to buy tickets.</p>
<p>It seems the movie she’s going to watch is, strangely enough, the same animated film I saw earlier.</p>

<p>“Ah, please get my ticket too.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I’ll pay you later.”</p>
<p>“…O-okay, got it.”</p>

<p>It was a bit—well, quite forceful, but she managed to successfully purchase tickets for both of us.</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Although she seemed like she wanted to say something, Himegi-san handed me the tickets.</p>
<p>The movie screening is starting soon. There’s only enough time to buy some drinks.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll buy you a drink.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to do that.”</p>
<p>“No, no, let me treat you.”</p>

<p>I forcefully led her to the food counter despite her seeming reluctance.</p>
<p>Earlier, we watched the movie without getting any drinks, but now I’m so nervous that my throat feels dry.</p>
<p>Luckily, the movie time didn’t overlap with the earlier one. That’s a relief.</p>

<p>“What would you like to drink?”</p>
<p>“Um… I’ll have iced coffee.”</p>
<p>“Do you eat popcorn or anything like that, Himegi-san?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t eat snacks.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then, I’ll have an iced coffee and a cola, please.”</p>

<p>I placed the drink order with the cashier and took out my wallet to pay. ——rip rip rip!</p>

<p>“Ah?”</p>

<p>For some reason, Himegi-san looked at my wallet and had a surprised expression.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“N-No.”</p>
<p>“???”</p>
<p>“…Ouji-kun.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“T-That wallet of yours…”</p>

<p>Himegi-san pointed to my wallet with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>“Hmm? This wallet? I bought it when I was in elementary school. “</p>

<p>It’s a well-worn Velcro wallet that I’ve been using for about ten years.</p>
<p>It’s been by my side, supporting me through good times, tough times, and joyful times—a wallet that could be called a steadfast friend. ——rip rip rip!</p>

<p>“I see. By the way, could you please stop making that ripping sound? It’s making me feel uncomfortable…”</p>
<p>“Oh? You don’t like this sound…?”</p>
<p>“Next time you make that sound, I’ll pretend I didn’t know you.”</p>
<p>“Umm, well…”</p>

<p>It seems Himegi-san doesn’t quite understand the charm of this wallet.</p>

<p>Well, since she’s expressed her discomfort, I’ll just seal the wallet in my pocket for now.</p>
<p>I swore to do that, but then I remembered that I hadn’t paid her back for the ticket.</p>
<p>So, I took out my wallet from my pocket again——rip rip rip!</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Ah, I got a sharp glare…</p>
<p>By the way, I did return the ticket money properly.</p>


<p>***<br />TN: Himegi is referring to the present Touka Himegi, while Touka is referring to the future Touka Himegi.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>With the drinks from the cashier received, we headed toward the entrance gate.</p>
<p>As expected, the male staff member from earlier was standing at the entrance gate.</p>

<p>When we handed him the tickets, he looked at us with an incredibly puzzled expression.</p>
<p>It seems this staff member remembered our faces and was thinking something like,『Are these two going to watch the same movie again?』</p>

<p>“Is there something wrong? That person looked at us as if he had seen something unusual.”</p>
<p>“Ah-ahaha! I-It’s probably just your imagination, just your imagination.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>Despite looking puzzled, we entered the theater and sat in different seats from before.</p>
<p>I think last time we were in H-17 and H-18, and now we’re in the row in front, seats G-17 and G-19.</p>
<p>…I see. This probably represents the current distance between her and me…</p>

<p>Feeling a slight sadness, I turned off my smartphone and quietly waited for the movie to start.</p>
<p>By the way, the theater was even emptier than before.</p>

<p>“Hey, Ouji-kun.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? What is it?”</p>
<p>“Is this your first time watching this movie?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s my second time.”</p>

<p>In fact, I just watched it a little while ago.</p>

<p>“Oh? So it’s a movie you think is worth watching twice…”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m also looking forward to the sequel.”</p>
<p>“…Wait, they’ve confirmed a sequel?”</p>
<p>“Just a hunch, but I think the sequel will be out within six years.”</p>
<p>“Why six years?”</p>
<p>“…Just a feeling.”</p>

<p>I shouldn’t say anything more unnecessary.</p>
<p>However, with her current words, I understood one thing. Himegi-san is watching this movie for the first time.</p>

<p>Then, the lights dimmed, and the movie appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>Naturally, the content of the movie is exactly the same as before.</p>
<p>Normally, watching the same movie in succession might be tedious, but this movie is still interesting no matter how many times I watch it.</p>

<p>Moreover, I realized that there’s a different way to enjoy it on the second viewing.</p>
<p>I hadn’t noticed before, but some of these minor lines from the background characters might have been foreshadowing.</p>
<p>There were tiny details and Easter eggs woven into the scenes.</p>
<p>During the first viewing, I only appreciated the overall atmosphere and story, but now I realize there are many things I’ve missed.</p>

<p>More than anything, I found myself empathizing with the determined efforts of the protagonist.</p>
<p>I get it, I really do. Confessing to someone you like and getting harshly rejected——I can relate to that feeling.</p>
<p>And then, in the final scene of the movie, the protagonist is faced with a dilemma: choosing between her own happiness or her mother’s.</p>
<p>In the end, the young girl chooses her mother’s wish after a hard decision.</p>

<p>Perhaps I got too emotionally invested in the protagonist, as I found myself shedding tears during the final scene.</p>
<p>The first time I watched it, I didn’t shed any tears, but this time, tears were streaming down my cheeks.</p>

<p>Movies are great, aren’t they?</p>
<p>It’s totally different from watching movies at home.</p>
<p>I should buy a pamphlet on the way out.</p>
<p>And while I’m at it, I’ll also purchase a pen and a key holder. Himegi-san is probably crying too.</p>

<p>After all, Touka-san shed such large tears.</p>
<p>I’m sure she’s crying heavily again this time.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, I stole a glance at her.</p>
<p>Illuminated faintly by the screen’s light, her beautiful face showed no trace of tears.</p>
<p>She was staring at the screen with a calm expression, different from what I expected.</p>

<p>Even though she was crying so much earlier… now, her eyes weren’t even moist.</p>
<p>Just like me, did it not touch her heartstrings the first time she watched it?</p>

<p>Either way, knowing the scene from earlier, her current reaction was unexpected for me.</p>
<p>And, because I was so absorbed in staring at Himegi-san, she also noticed my gaze and turned to look at me.</p>
<p>Our eyes met in silence.</p>

<p>Himegi-san looked at my face and displayed a slightly surprised reaction.</p>
<p>It seems she didn’t expect that I would be crying.</p>

<p>Sh-she saw me…</p>
<p>Embarrassingly enough, the girl I like saw me in tears.</p>
<p>I tried to reach for my pocket to wipe away my tears with my handkerchief.</p>

<p>Oh, wait? My handkerchief is missing.</p>
<p>Right, Touka-san has my handkerchief right now.</p>
<p>While I was thinking about this, Himegi-san silently handed me a handkerchief.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of her kindness, I wiped my tears with the handkerchief she lent me.</p>
<p>Her scent lingered on the handkerchief.</p>
<p>It was sweet and gentle.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The movie ended, and I had initially intended to go home alone, but somehow I found myself heading to the food court with Himegi-san.</p>
<p>She seemed to really want to eat takoyaki.</p>

<p>Listening to her request, I thought about it.</p>
<p>If we were to go to that takoyaki shop together, it would definitely become complicated.</p>
<p>So, I opposed it. I rejected it with all my might. However, that suggestion was easily dismissed with a single word, ‘No.’</p>

<p>Well, it would be better to accompany her nearby and wander around rather than to the food court and make things complicated.</p>
<p>…However, I’ve noticed that suggesting something to Touka Himegi often results in rejection.</p>

<p>While thinking about that, I became really curious about how the other Touka Himegi is doing.</p>
<p>It has been two hours since the restroom incident.</p>
<p>Unless she is an idiot, I want to believe that she’s capable of making her way home on her own.</p>
<p>…Surely she’s not still wandering around this shopping mall, right?</p>

<p>Even if I wanted to contact her, she can’t use her smartphone, so that’s quite inconvenient.</p>
<p>And then we finally arrived at the food court.</p>

<p>“By the way, Himegi-san, do you like takoyaki?”</p>
<p>“Not so much. I don’t know why, but I suddenly really want to eat takoyaki.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>If her movie choices are the same, then maybe her food cravings are too.</p>
<p>Even after six years, her fundamental behaviors might not change that much.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>Perhaps due to the time of day or some other reason, unlike before, there are no customers in front of the takoyaki shop, and thankfully, it seems we won’t need to wait in line like before.</p>
<p>By the way, the person making the takoyaki in front of the counter is the same young female clerk who provided us with takoyaki earlier.</p>
<p>…It would have been better if it were a different clerk. Please, don’t notice us.</p>
<p>Praying silently in my mind, we stand at the counter.</p>

<p>“——Ah!”</p>

<p>In vain, the clerk notices our presence.</p>
<p>Cold sweat runs down my back. Why do I have to get nervous just from buying takoyaki?</p>

<p>“You’re here again.”</p>

<p>Perhaps because it’s our second visit, the female clerk speaks to us with a casual tone. I don’t mind the informality, but that word is troubling for us.</p>

<p>“Again?”</p>

<p>Himegi-san gazes at the clerk with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>I think that’s a sensible reaction. I would probably react the same way if I were in Himegi-san’s position.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Thanks for the advice earlier. You gave me the courage I needed. I’m planning to consult the police on my way home today.”</p>
<p>“Advice? Consult? Police?”</p>

<p>A bunch of question marks appear over Himegi-san’s head.</p>
<p>Well, it’s only natural that she can’t grasp the situation.</p>

<p>“Um, excuse me, can we order takoyaki?”</p>

<p>If I let the clerk continue speaking, she might provide unnecessary information and make things even more chaotic.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, I cut in and placed an order for takoyaki.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry. Please go ahead and place your order.”</p>
<p>“Um, a twelve-piece set, with mayonnaise as a topping… Himegi-san, what about a drink?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have oolong tea.”</p>
<p>“Two oolong teas, please.”</p>

<p>Since there are no other customers this time, we receive the pre-made takoyaki and drinks, and Himegi-san settles the payment.</p>
<p>By the way, when I tried to take out my wallet from my pocket to pay, Himegi-san stopped me with a silent stare.</p>
<p>It seems that this velcro wallet doesn’t sit well with her.</p>

<p>The clerk waved to Himegi-san with a smile.</p>
<p>It seems that Touka-san’s whispered advice to her was genuinely appreciated advice.</p>
<p>However, Himegi-san, who doesn’t know about this situation, looked a bit uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“…Is that clerk mistaking me for someone else?”</p>
<p>“Probably, I guess.”</p>

<p>For now, I want to take a breather.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect buying takoyaki would be so tiring. I sit at an empty table.</p>
<p>Naturally, Himegi-san also sits in the opposite seat.</p>

<p>…Well, what the heck.</p>
<p>I know it’s a little late to realize it, but it’s quite a weird situation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was rejected, but I’m on a date with her today.</p>
<p>My life sure is like a roller coaster.</p>
<p>And then, Himegi-san puts her hands together and says, ‘Itadakimasu’ picks up a piece of takoyaki with a toothpick and munching on it deliciously.</p>
<p>Being the same person, the way she eats is quite similar to Touka-san’s—well, almost the same.</p>

<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, you’re quite photogenic, enough to be in a TV commercial.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. However, excessive praise can be rude depending on the person, so be careful.”</p>
<p>“I was just honestly expressing my opinion.”</p>

<p>And then, I also eat one piece of takoyaki.</p>
<p>Yep, the octopus inside is tender, and the outside is crispy. It’s really delicious.</p>

<p>“What did you think of the movie?”</p>
<p>“It was good, and I enjoyed it. I think that person would be satisfied too.”</p>
<p>“That person?”</p>
<p>“…It’s nothing. Anyway, I have a question for you.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Are you knowledgeable about cards, Ouji-kun?”</p>
<p>“Cards?”</p>
<p>“Yes, like this…”</p>

<p>Himegi-san took out her smartphone from her pocket and showed me a certain image.</p>

<p>” …. “</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s a famous trading card game, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The image that Himegi-san showed me happened to be the same card that Touka-san had just sold earlier.</p>

<p>“This card is really popular, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s the most popular in the world. Do you want this card?”</p>
<p>“My little sister is really into it and her birthday is coming up, so I thought about giving this to her as a present.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>She’s a thoughtful older sister.</p>

<p>“But I don’t have the courage to go into that shop alone…”</p>
<p>“Ah, indeed, it can be a bit uncomfortable for a woman to go in there alone…”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly.”</p>
<p>“So, you want me to accompany you there?”</p>
<p>“To be honest, yes.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, but I think the card in this image is very expensive…”</p>

<p>After all, it was just sold for two hundred thousand yen a while ago.</p>
<p>It should now be priced even higher than that.</p>

<p>“For now, should we go to the card store and decide what to do?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, that would be great.”</p>
<p>“No problem, I’m glad I could help.”</p>

<p>If this can help clear my name even just a little, it’s a small price to pay.</p>
<p>While pondering on these thoughts, I picked up a toothpick and was about to spear a takoyaki when, in no time at all, the takoyaki container was empty.</p>
<p>…Wait, I’ve only eaten two, right?</p>

<p>“I’m going to the restroom. I’ll also throw away the trash.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. I’ll wait here.”</p>

<p>I stood up from my chair, took the trash to the bin, and headed to the restroom.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Upon returning from the restroom, I witnessed an event that I might only encounter once in a lifetime.</p>
<p>A guy I didn’t know was lounging in the chair I had been sitting in earlier.</p>
<p>Judging by his appearance, he seemed like a Yankee—flaunting his muscular build with a tank top.</p>

<p>Himegi-san was glaring at him fiercely without showing any fear.</p>
<p>She wouldn’t openly exhibit such hostility towards someone she knows.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s safe to say they’re complete strangers at first sight.</p>
<p>And considering the circumstances, he must be hitting on her.</p>

<p>Sighing heavily, I approached the man.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Hey, how about we have a quiz? I’ll guess what you were eating here until just now, and you can tell me if I’m right.”</p>
<p>“Takoyaki.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“The answer is takoyaki.”</p>

<p>The man noticed my presence, glared at me, and from the top of my head to the tips of my toes, he sized me up.</p>
<p>Then, with a clear smirk that belittled me, he stared me down and tried to intimidate me.</p>

<p>“What’s your deal?”</p>
<p>“Now, here’s a quiz. Who am I?”</p>
<p>“Ha? Are you making fun of me?”</p>

<p>That’s actually my line.</p>
<p>It’s his personal freedom to hit on someone, so I have no right to interfere.</p>
<p>But harassing someone who’s clearly uncomfortable is absolutely out of the question.</p>
<p>So, if this guy doesn’t back off quietly, I’ll deal with him. That’s what I was thinking, but…</p>

<p>“Ouji-kun, there’s no need to engage with idiots. Let’s just ignore him.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Himegi-san stood up from her chair.</p>

<p>“If Himegi-san says so, I’ll obediently comply.”</p>

<p>We ignored the man and left the scene.</p>
<p>I thought this would make him give up, but surprisingly, he followed us with a confident grin on his face.</p>
<p>This is truly exasperating. Or does he not understand the concept of no interest?</p>

<p>To be honest, I was feeling extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We were having a fun date, and now this guy’s interference has ruined everything.</p>
<p>If he keeps following us, I’m not going to let him get away with it.</p>
<p>That’s what I thought, so I stopped and glared at the smirking man.</p>

<p>We were so close that our faces almost touched.</p>
<p>The people around us noticed our presence and began to murmur, seemingly expecting a fight to break out at any moment.</p>
<p>Ignoring my gaze, the man turned to Himegi-san, who was standing behind me.</p>

<p>“Hey, how about going for a drive with me? I’ve got a super cool car. It would be much more fun to date me than with someone who looks like a girl over here.”</p>

<p>——He’s crossing the line.</p>
<p>I’m generally a mild-mannered guy around my parents and Kanako, but being ridiculed to this extent…even I can’t just let it slide.</p>
<p>Besides, I’ve decided I won’t tolerate anyone mocking my name and appearance.</p>
<p>I’ll make sure to shut this guy up my way.</p>

<p>“It’s parked right there in the parking lot. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“——How are you going to drive the car without the key?”</p>
<p>“Haa?”</p>
<p>“No, tell me, how are you going to open the door when you don’t have the car key?”</p>

<p>I chuckled at the guy condescendingly.</p>
<p>Then, the guy seemed to realize something and frantically rummaged through his pants pocket.</p>

<p>“Huh? Wait, what? The key’s gone!”</p>
<p>“Could it be that you’re looking for this key?”</p>

<p>I said, shaking the car key in my hand, making a jingling sound, and provoking him as much as I could.</p>

<p>“—Hey! That’s my car key!”</p>
<p>“Huh? Car key? What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“The key you’re holding is mine!”</p>

<p>I wrapped my hands around the key as if I were gripping a rice ball and squeezed it.</p>
<p>Oh, what a surprise?</p>
<p>The car key in my hand vanished into thin air.</p>

<p>“…I don’t have any key in my hand, though?”</p>

<p>I spread my hands wide, indicating that I didn’t have the key.</p>

<p>“—Hey! The key is gone! Bastard, where is my key?”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s here?”</p>

<p>With a smile, I pointed to my right chest.</p>

<p>“You! Give it back !”</p>
<p>“No, no. It’s not in my chest pocket. Maybe it’s in yours?”</p>
<p>“Ha? In my chest pocket, you say?”</p>
<p>“That’s right-that’s right. It might have moved to your chest pocket.”</p>

<p>While doubting my words, the guy inserted his fingers into his own chest pocket.</p>

<p>“There’s no way it was there. Are you an idiot?”</p>
<p>“—What?!”</p>

<p>And then, I took the car key out of my own shirt pocket.</p>
<p>Once again, I shook it noisily, taunting the guy.</p>

<p>“——You son of a b*tch!”</p>

<p>The guy finally snapped and lunged at me with intense hostility.</p>
<p>I dislike violence, and I think my physical strength is below average.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, if it came to a physical fight, there probably wouldn’t be a single factor in which I’d come out on top.</p>
<p>The other guy probably thought the same, which is why he must have decided to try and overpower me with brute force.</p>
<p>So, he began the motion to throw a punch, seemingly with all his might.</p>
<p>If his right fist landed, I would undoubtedly be blown away without a chance to respond.</p>

<p>——But that didn’t happen.</p>
<p>That guy, in his excess of momentum, ended up losing his balance and fell flat on his backside.</p>
<p>Clearly clueless about what had happened, e looked around with eyes darting back and forth.</p>
<p>Finally, he noticed something attached to his left hand.</p>

<p>“W-Why is there… handcuff on my… wrist?”</p>

<p>A long chain handcuff was attached to the guy’s left wrist.</p>
<p>It’s one of my original items made from a large dog leash chain.</p>

<p>“I can’t tolerate idiots, so I’ve handcuffed you to the handrail to prevent you from coming closer.”</p>
<p>“Damn it! Take them off! Get them off me!”</p>

<p>The guy pulled at the handcuffs with all his might.</p>
<p>Without Terminator-class strength, there is no way he can break that handcuff.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a chance. First, you need to apologize to her sincerely. Once you’ve done that, I’ll give you both the car key and the handcuff key.”</p>

<p>From the spectators around us, faint laughter and light applause could be heard.</p>
<p>For this guy, this situation must be utterly humiliating.</p>
<p>Whether out of anger or shame, either way, his face was as red as a tomato.</p>

<p>“Now, are you going to apologize?”</p>
<p>“Shut up! I’ll kill you, you bastard!”</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll leave the keys here. “</p>

<p>Saying that, I gently placed the car key and handcuffs key on the floor.</p>

<p>“——You bastard! You intentionally placed them just out of my reach in a spot like that! Bring them closer here!”</p>
<p>“No way… If you want the keys, why not ask the people around here?”</p>

<p>Judging by people’s reactions, it doesn’t seem like there’s anyone eager to help this guy.</p>

<p>“Well then, we’re kind of busy today, so we’ll take our leave.”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>

<p>In a last-ditch effort, the guy flips me the middle finger in provocation.</p>

<p>Sigh——it seems we’re destined to never get along.</p>
<p>So, taking a cue from the guy, I decided to make a small resistance.</p>

<p>“Oops! Sorry! I slipped!”</p>

<p>With a mischievous expression, I use my foot to kick the keys on the floor.</p>
<p>The two keys slide across the floor and end up under the vending machine.</p>
<p>Then, deliberately, I clap my hands together.</p>

<p>“I’m soo soorryy~”</p>

<p>I casually apologized to the man whose face had turned pale.</p>

<p>“Bastard…”</p>
<p>“Now, it’s quiz time. Who am I?”</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>“Wrong, I’m not a ‘shit’.”</p>

<p>Cough, I clear my throat, striking a dignified and a gallant expression.</p>
<p>Then, I turn toward the man and declare boldly!</p>

<p>“The correct answer is the one who protects the princess(Hime)——it was the prince(Ouji)!”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/B11.png" alt="" />

<p>Nailed it. That was incredibly cool.</p>
<p>Someone over there who’s taking pictures with a smartphone, please edit it nicely and send the image to my phone!</p>

<p>“Now, let’s go to the card shop, Himegi-san.”</p>

<p>Saying that, I grasped her hand, leaving the dumbfounded onlookers and the pick-up guy behind and left the scene.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>Finally, we arrived at the intended card shop.</p>

<p>“…There are so many types of cards here.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san gazes intently at the cards displayed in glass cases, her expression filled with admiration.</p>
<p>There seem to be more card varieties than she had imagined, and she’s quite surprised.</p>

<p>“Ah! This card… It’s the one Harune wants…”</p>

<p>She sets her sights on a card inside the display case.</p>
<p>The one Himegi-san was now intently examining was the very card Touka-san had sold earlier.</p>
<p>I found her counting the zeros displayed below the card.</p>

<p>“——ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand… f-five hundred thousand yen!”</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the card from earlier is being sold for five hundred thousand yen.</p>
<p>They’re quite aggressive with their pricing.</p>
<p>Well, they’re professionals; they probably judged that this price is reasonable.</p>

<p>“Ouji-kun you’re right, it’s an unbelievable price…”</p>

<p>To Himegi-san, who isn’t interested in card games, this price would likely seem surreal.</p>

<p>“It’s not impossible to buy it… but giving this card to an elementary schooler is bad for her education.”</p>
<p>“… So, it’s not impossible to buy, huh…”</p>

<p>As expected of someone who is arguably one of the wealthiest people in this town.</p>
<p>By the way, the store manager of the card shop is looking at us with a face that says, 『You’re here again.』</p>

<p>“What will you do?”</p>
<p>“…I wonder what should I do?”</p>

<p>I’m not that knowledgeable about this card game either.</p>
<p>So, I have no idea what kind of cards are popular right now.</p>
<p>I mean, if she were to buy a popular card, there’s a good chance her sister might already have it.</p>
<p>This is quite a difficult task…</p>

<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Look at that.”</p>

<p>I point at the figure displayed in the showcase.</p>
<p>Underneath the figure, there’s a handwritten sign that says, 『The popular Dragon Monster has been brought to life!』</p>

<p>“A dragon figurine?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a dragon figure. It’s the same one as the dragon from the 500,000 yen card earlier.”</p>
<p>“It certainly looks the same.”</p>
<p>“At twenty thousand yen, it’s quite expensive, but compared to the card from earlier, isn’t it more reasonable?”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>“How about giving your sister that dragon figurine as a present?”</p>
<p>“…Hmm, alright. I’ll buy that figurine.”</p>

<p>After a moment of hesitation, she picks up the figurine stacked next to the cash register and heads to the counter.</p>
<p>I guess we’ve managed to find a present for her sister.</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“No problem.”</p>

<p>We leave the card shop. And now we’re at the entrance of the shopping mall.</p>
<p>Why are we here? Because in about ten minutes, the car that’s coming to pick up Himegi-san will arrive.</p>
<p>Himegi-san told me I could go home, but I’ve decided to stay with her until she gets into the car.</p>
<p>I have no intention of acting like her boyfriend, but I feel like it’s my duty to watch over her until the car arrives, so I’m waiting here.</p>

<p>“Thank you for today. I think my sister will be happy.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, I’m glad I could help a little.”</p>

<p>The sky had completely turned orange, and the pleasant spring breeze gently cooled my slightly flushed face.</p>
<p>Families with children seemed to have had a lot of fun, walking hand in hand with smiles, presumably heading home.</p>

<p>At that moment, fluffy blue balloons floated in the sunset sky.</p>
<p>Himegi-san and I gazed absentmindedly at those blue balloons.</p>
<p>They must be the balloons they were handing out at the entrance.</p>

<p>Then, right in front of us, a child of about three years old was crying loudly.</p>
<p>Lying on the ground, he pointed to the balloons floating in the sky while sobbing.</p>
<p>Apparently, he had accidentally let go of the balloon he was holding, and that’s why he was crying.</p>

<p>His mother was calmly soothing the child, though she seemed to be embarrassed.</p>
<p>It seemed they had come shopping together and were on their way back.</p>

<p>“I feel sorry for him. I’ll go get him a balloon.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san said as she stood up from the bench.</p>
<p>I stopped her and hurried over to the crying boy.</p>

<p>“Hey, don’t lie on the ground; you’ll get your clothes dirty.”</p>

<p>I said that and helped the boy stand up.</p>
<p>The boy seemed a bit bewildered, probably not expecting someone other than his mother to talk to him.</p>

<p>“What color balloon do you want?”</p>

<p>When I asked, the boy, still crying, said ‘green.’</p>

<p>A green balloon… I remembered having one in my pocket.</p>

<p>“Look, pay close attention to my hand.”</p>

<p>I brought my palms together and clasped them like a certain alchemist.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s see…”</p>

<p>Then, I gradually separated my clasped hands.</p>
<p>Then, from my hands, a green balloon appeared, and the balloon slowly inflated.</p>

<p>“Wow~~~~~!”</p>

<p>Thankfully, the child’s eyes widened in amazement, and he was clearly surprised.</p>
<p>The mother, also taken aback by the unexpected turn of events, applauded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>When I get reactions like this, it really feels worth it to perform magic tricks.</p>

<p>“Here, to make sure it doesn’t fly away again, I put a playing card inside the balloon.”</p>

<p>I handed the green balloon with a playing card inside to the boy.</p>

<p>“Wow, there’s a tiny playing card inside the balloon!”</p>

<p>The boy looked at the balloon with a curious expression.</p>

<p>“Don’t pop it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, big sister (Onēsan)!”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>With a beaming smile, the boy expressed his gratitude.</p>
<p>Did I mishear something? I feel like he just called me ‘Onēsan.’</p>

<p>“I’m sorry-I’m sorry. H-hey, this person is a big brother.”</p>

<p>The mother bowed her head apologetically.</p>

<p>“What? You look like a big sister, not a big brother!”</p>
<p>“H-he might look like a big sister, but he’s a big brother!”</p>

<p>Himegi-san snickered behind me, struggling to hold back her laughter.</p>
<p>Now I feel like bursting into tears…could someone please perform a magic trick that will make me smile again?</p>

<p>“Thank you so much for the balloon!”</p>
<p>“…Well, I’m glad you liked it.”</p>

<p>Then, waving vigorously, the child walked with his mother towards the parking lot.</p>

<p>“You’re quite something. I had heard the rumors, but you really are skilled at magic.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san looked at the parent and child holding hands with a more proud expression than even mine.</p>

<p>“Well, I am the vice president of the Magic Research Club, after all.”</p>
<p>“From those handcuffs earlier to the balloon just now—where did they come from?”</p>

<p>With a curious look on her face, she touches my body.</p>

<p>“Excessive body contact with magicians is forbidden. Please don’t do it.”</p>

<p>Being touched a little won’t reveal the secret.</p>
<p>Well, there isn’t a secret, but since I’m a boy at this age, I can’t help but become conscious when someone I like touches me.</p>

<p>“Like a white dove, for example? Doesn’t it appear?”</p>
<p>“I only have inanimate objects on hand.”</p>

<p>I do have a white parakeet in my room, though…</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Fufu, Ouji-kun, I’m a bit relieved you’re not the kind of boy they talk about at school.”</p>
<p>“Um, are you referring to that embarrassing nickname?”</p>

<p>After a certain incident, I ended up being teased by my classmates as ‘Pitiful Prince.’</p>

<p>“Oh, did I offend you?”</p>
<p>“If I said I wasn’t bothered, it would be a lie, but it’s not to the point of being offended.”</p>
<p>“Well, I was taken aback by the ‘The correct answer is the one who protects the princess——it was the prince’——and your wallet was disappointing and a no-good.”</p>

<p>That’s what she said.</p>
<p>It seems she still doesn’t quite grasp the merits of that velcro wallet.</p>
<p>And then, a familiar black foreign car stops in front of us.</p>
<p>It’s the luxury car Himegi-san always uses when coming to and leaving school.</p>
<p>From the driver’s seat of the luxury car emerges a woman in a maid outfit, also a familiar sight.</p>

<p>“Miss (Ojou-sama), I’ve come to pick you up.”</p>

<p>In a calm tone, the maid lowers her head to Himegi-san.</p>
<p>As usual, she is an expressionless maid.</p>
<p>What if she’s actually an android?</p>
<p>Thinking such things, the blonde maid briefly glances at me.</p>

<p>“Good evening.”</p>

<p>I greeted the maid, but she ignored me. …Probably didn’t hear it. Yeah, that must be it.</p>

<p>“If you’d like, would you like me to take you home, Ouji-kun?”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, thank you. I appreciate the offer, but I’ll be taking the bus home today.”</p>
<p>“…I see. Well, this is goodbye then.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess so. I had a great time today. See you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, see you on Monday.”</p>

<p>I was reluctant to part, but that’s all for today.</p>
<p>I lightly wave to Himegi-san as she gets into the back seat of the car and bids farewell.</p>
<p>She opens the car window and gives me a slight wave too.</p>
<p>…Ah, I knew it, she’s so cute!</p>

<p>“See you later, Mr Japanese-Sumerian person, Maq Hajio-kun.”</p>

<p>She says with a sarcastic smile, it was a remark that was hard to ignore.</p>

<p>“…H-How did you know that?”</p>
<p>“Well, it just sounded like a voice I’ve heard before.”</p>
<p>“Um, yes. I’m Maq Hajio, the Japanese-Sumerian guy.”</p>

<p>I figured if I lied, I’d be exposed immediately, so I confessed honestly.</p>

<p>“I knew it. Did you ask Chikada or Takashi?”</p>
<p>“…Well, something like that. I’m sorry. It’s all my fault, so please don’t blame them.”</p>

<p>If I told her the real source of information, things would get really complicated, so I’m sorry for the two of them, but I’ll have to let them take some of the blame.</p>
<p>More importantly, T-Takashi?</p>
<p>Why are you calling Takashi Harukawa by his first name?</p>
<p>What’s the relationship between you two?</p>
<p>I’m really curious, super curious, but it’s not the right time to ask now.</p>

<p>“I’m not actually angry.”</p>

<p>True to her words, Himegi-san doesn’t seem to be angry.</p>

<p>“I’ll forgive you this time, but I want you to stop giving out the number without permission.”</p>
<p>“…Okay, I understand. I will not do anything without Himegi-san’s permission.”</p>
<p>“I’ll trust your word. I didn’t know much about Ouji-kun until today, but for me, you are a trustworthy person.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>I was deeply moved by her words.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I feel a slight twinge of guilt for keeping things hidden from her.</p>
<p>…Am I really a trustworthy person?</p>

<p>“For now, I’ll save your number.”</p>
<p>“Can I do that too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, because there might be times when I need to talk about my sister. So, save it.”</p>

<p>Himegi-san gives me permission to save her number.</p>
<p>Once I get home, I’ll save it right away.</p>
<p>And then, the car carrying Himegi-san left the shopping mall.</p>
<p>I keep waving my hand until I can’t see her anymore.</p>

<p>“I see. So, this is what happiness feels like…”</p>

<p>I broke into a light sweat at the end, but overall, it was a happy moment.</p>

<p>“Your nose is getting longer.”</p>
<p>“——!”</p>
<p>(TN: A Japanese idiomatic expression which implies someone is being obvious about their desires or feelings.)</p>

<p>I twitched. It was because I heard the voice of the person I had been chatting with just a moment ago, coming from behind me.</p>

<p>“You didn’t go home?”</p>
<p>“What, you wanted me to leave?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that…”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess you must’ve wanted to hang out with the younger version of me.”</p>
<p>“…Were you watching the whole time?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve been observing from a distance.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that more like being a busybody than observing?”</p>
<p>“Calling me a busybody is a bit much. I was just watching over my own fate.”</p>

<p>Somehow, I feel like I’m being given a pretty convoluted excuse…</p>

<p>“Anyway, instead of that, leaving me behind and having a fun date by yourselves—this kind of humiliation is a first for me.”</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry about that. Wait, are you jealous of your own self?”</p>
<p>“Is that not allowed?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s not allowed, but…”</p>

<p>Turns out she’s a rather troublesome person at times.</p>

<p>“Well, I have to admit that you deserve some credit for protecting me from that guy. As expected of my Ha-kun.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“But I really can’t accept that last line. ‘The correct answer is the one who protects the princess——it was the prince!’ gave me goosebumps!”</p>

<p>Saying that, Touka-san shows her arm.</p>
<p>By the way, not even a single goosebump appeared.</p>

<p>“By the way, I was debating whether to tell you or not, but your wallet is seriously tacky.”</p>

<p>As expected of the same person, her criticisms and remarks are just the same…</p>

<p>“By the way, what about all those bags?”</p>

<p>Touka-san had so many paper bags in her hands that she almost couldn’t carry them all.</p>

<p>“I got carried away, so I made some impulse purchases!”</p>
<p>“What?! Could it be…did you use today’s money?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a single yen left.”</p>

<p>Touka-san firmly declares it.</p>
<p>I’ve never seen someone so blatantly carefree like her.</p>

<p>“Ah~ I’m so tired today. Shall we go home now? “</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’m tired too. Let’s take the bus homr.”</p>

<p>With that, I take over more than half of the bags Touka-san is carrying and we walk slowly to the bus stop.</p>

<p>As we arrive at the bus stop, a bus is waiting, and we hurriedly board it.</p>
<p>I had given up on finding a seat because the inside of the bus was crowded, but luckily, there was one seat available.</p>
<p>I check if there are any elderly or pregnant people among those standing. It seems there aren’t any such people.</p>
<p>Then, I let Touka-san sit in the vacant seat.</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“It’s only natural.”</p>

<p>And with that, the bus starts moving towards its next destination.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as the bus starts moving, Touka-san lets out a big yawn.</p>

<p>“If you’re sleepy, go ahead and sleep. I’ll wake you up later.”</p>
<p>“Can I really do that? I was so enthusiastic since morning… and maybe I overdid it…”</p>

<p>She closes her eyes, and after a while, I can hear her steady breathing.</p>
<p>It seems Touka-san has left for the dream world.</p>

<p>“…Good night.”</p>

<p>I speak to her in a volume that won’t disturb the people around us.</p>
<p>Until we reach our destination, I will watch over her.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>It’s just my theory, but I think that ‘worries’ that can’t be resolved are like ‘curses’ themselves.</p>
<p>Ever since that day, I’ve been living with unresolved worries; I wonder if I’m being continuously cursed.</p>

<p>In the chapel illuminated only by the moonlight, there were four of us: me in a wedding dress, my husband in a tuxedo, my sister, who was the photographer, and my grandmother, who is a witch.</p>
<p>Our wedding ceremony ended without any issues, and just when I thought we could finally relax, my grandmother, who was always late appeared——no, not just late, she showed up after everything had finished.</p>
<p>Since that day, it had been six years since I last saw my grandmother.</p>
<p>As soon as I met her, my grandmother challenged me to a duel.</p>

<p>I won’t mention the details, but I managed to win the duel and received a pocket watch as the prize.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, this pocket watch seems to have the ability to leap through time. In other words, it’s possible to go back in time.</p>
<p>With this pocket watch, I could go back to six years ago…</p>

<p>From there, my grandmother began to talk at length about the pocket watch.</p>
<p>Apparently, this pocket watch is one of her many magical items that she’s particularly proud of.</p>

<p>“——That’s all for the penalty explanation.”</p>
<p>“In short, don’t do anything bad in the past. So, specifically, what actions would decrease the numbers?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have to tell you that much.”</p>
<p>“——Come on!”</p>

<p>As always, this grandmother has such a big attitude!</p>
<p>It’s my wedding day, so I thought she might treat me a bit more nicely than usual, but… well, expecting that from this stubborn person would be a big mistake.</p>

<p>“So, how can I go back to the past?”</p>
<p>“Don’t rush, I’ll explain that now. First, Rule 1: That pocket watch can’t go to the future.”</p>
<p>“I see. It can only go to the past…”</p>

<p>That’s not a problem. I just want to go back to the past after all…</p>

<p>“Rule 2: You can only go back in one-year increments.”</p>
<p>“..I wonder what that means?”</p>
<p>“In other words, you can’t go back to yesterday or six months ago, right?”</p>

<p>My husband, sitting on the bench, interjects from the side.</p>

<p>“As expected of my son-in-law. Unlike a certain grandchildren, you’re clever.”</p>
<p>“…So, what you’re saying is that since today is April 14th, you can only go back to April 14th of last year as the nearest past date, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>In other words, if you use this pocket watch today to go back to six years ago, you can only go back to April 14th six years ago.</p>

<p>“Rule 3: You can’t go back to the past unless you can visualize the memories within you.”</p>
<p>“Another complicated rule.”</p>
<p>“If you have a problem with it, give it back.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to. So, it means that you can’t travel to the past unless you can recall the events of the day you want to return to?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>“I see. So, that means even if something significant happened in a timeline before you were born, you can’t time travel.”</p>
<p>“My son-in-law is really smart.”</p>
<p>“No-no, you’re making me embarrassed…”</p>

<p>Praised by my grandmother, my husband looks pleased.</p>
<p>Unusually for my grandmother, who dislikes humans, she seems to really like my husband for some reason.</p>

<p>“It’s not a problem. I don’t want to go back to the Edo period or the Showa period.”</p>

<p>Yes, I want to go back only six years.</p>
<p>I’m not interested in anything else.</p>

<p>“But six years ago… Just thinking about what I was doing one year ago is difficult, let alone six years ago…”</p>

<p>Even if it’s just a day or two ago, I can’t recall what I was doing six years ago, let alone one year ago today.</p>
<p>Unable to help it, I try my best to recall the events that happened in April six years ago… It’s not working.</p>
<p>Events with specific dates are hard to remember quickly.</p>

<p>“Speaking of April six years ago, that’s the year my birthday party got cancelled.”</p>

<p>My sister in her dress recalled the events of six years ago and muttered softly.</p>
<p>Indeed, her birthday party six years ago was cancelled due to a certain incident.</p>

<p>“April six years ago… By the way, wasn’t that when the girl from the takoyaki shop was murdered by a stalker guy?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that tragic incident.”</p>

<p>That event was truly a heartbreaking event.</p>
<p>Because it happened in our town, the memory remains vivid even now.</p>

<p>“Oh yeah, I remember. It’ll be exactly six years the day after tomorrow…”</p>

<p>My husband took out his smartphone and looked up that incident on a website.</p>

<p>“I still remember watching the news at my parents’ house.”</p>
<p>“I was in elementary school, so I don’t remember it very well.”</p>
<p>“In that case, shall we leave the day after tomorrow?”</p>

<p>Saying that, my husband smiled and nodded at me.</p>
<p>Perhaps Ha-kun already understands that he can’t stop me anymore.</p>

<p>He’s always so supportive of me and gently pushes me forward. That’s why I fell in love with him.</p>
<p>I was drawn to his kindness and strength. That’s why I decided to live together with him until the end.</p>
<p>I want to convey that… to that person as well. I want to tell them and have them genuinely bless us.</p>

<p>“Oh? Come to think of it, I also confessed to Touka on April 14th.”</p>
<p>“——Huh? Confession?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I called you to an empty room at school and got beautifully rejected. Don’t you remember?”</p>
<p>“Oh! I remember now! You did confess to me, and I rejected you. Was that really on April 14th?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. April 14th.”</p>

<p>With those words, memories that were once vague now resurfaced vividly.</p>

<p>“That’s right. It was definitely April 14th.”</p>

<p>I gazed at the clock hanging in the chapel.</p>
<p>The time was past 23:50. It seems there’s hardly any time left to go back and prepare.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it best to go today?”</p>

<p>As I was feeling a bit uneasy, Ha-kun gently encouraged me.</p>
<p>Marrying this person was truly the right choice.</p>

<p>“Yeah, then let’s meet again in 60 days. For now, I’ll go see you later——”</p>
<p>“——Wait a moment.”</p>

<p>My grandmother stopped me from attempting time travel.</p>

<p>“What is it now? There’s not much time left until the date changes!”</p>
<p>“That’s why you need to listen to the explanation until the end. Rule 4: When you time travel, you appear at the place you travel to. So, if you time travel right here and now, you’ll end up in this chapel from six years ago. If there’s someone in the chapel from six years ago, you suddenly appearing would cause a huge confusion.”</p>
<p>“That’s true; suddenly appearing out of nowhere would cause a big commotion.”</p>
<p>“Then how about time travelling in a toilet cubicle?”</p>
<p>“That would be a bit better.”</p>

<p>That is nice advice, Ha-kun. So, I headed for the nearest restroom—</p>

<p>“We’re not done talking yet.”</p>
<p>“There’s more?”</p>
<p>“Even if you spend 60 days in the other world, it’s just 60 seconds worth of events here. In other words, you won’t exist in this world for just one minute.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a problem. If a grown adult disappears for 60 days, it would cause a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p>Disappearing for just a minute wouldn’t be a big deal; no one would really care.</p>
<p>I’ve been feeling a little bit unsettled about being gone for 60 days, but this was reassuring.</p>
<p>Time travel comes with many constraints, but this is one I appreciate.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“That’s a relief. If Touka disappeared for a whole month or two, the police would likely get involved, and my father-in-law might end up burying me in the mountains. To be honest, I was racking my brain trying to come up with excuses, but this is reassuring.”</p>
<p>“That’s about all I have to convey. Any questions?”</p>
<p>“Well… When you time travel, what happens to this wedding dress?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I’m not gonna show up naked like the Terminator, right?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about the Terminator, but your clothing remains the same. If it’s something small enough to carry, you can take it with you.”</p>
<p>“Thank god! So, can I bring this bag with me?”</p>
<p>“If it’s that small, it shouldn’t be a problem. Grandchild, close your eyes, turn the crown of the pocket watch, and recall the memories of the day you want to return to. If you do that, you should be able to go back six years.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. For once, thank you from the bottom of my heart.”</p>
<p>“Hmph, that was an unnecessary remark. I wonder who you take after…”</p>
<p>“To me, it looks like the two of you are quite alike.”</p>
<p>” ” Ha?! ” “</p>
<p>“…nevermind.”</p>
<p>“Well then, I’ll go back to the past for a bit.”</p>

<p>I hold the pocket watch tightly and approach my beloved husband.</p>

<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Come on, stand up. I think we need to say goodbye to each other.”</p>

<p>I make him stand and press my lips against his in a kiss.</p>

<p>“Ugh..this is more intense than the kiss during the vows…”</p>

<p>For Ha-kun, it’s just a minute of an event, but for me, it means being apart for two months.</p>
<p>To say I’m not going to be lonely would be a lie.</p>
<p>So, I fiercely press my lips against his with all my heart.</p>

<p>“Hey-hey! You haven’t forgotten that I’m here, have you?”</p>

<p>My sister started to protest, so I decided to stop the kiss here.</p>

<p>“Oh, but Ha-kun and Harune, you both have to kneel on the floor until I return.”</p>
<p>” “…Huh? Why?” “</p>
<p>“Do you recognize what this is?”</p>

<p>With a slightly annoyed expression, I show the item my husband purchased without my permission from my bag.</p>

<p>“How… How did you get that?”</p>
<p>“My eyes can’t be deceived.”</p>

<p>I was wondering what the two of them were doing sneaking around together… it turns out they had gone and bought an expensive item again!</p>
<p>Naturally, I intercepted the delivery from the courier before it reached my husband.</p>

<p>“Really, giving a high school girl a hundred-thousand-yen gift card to try to win her favor? Are you trying to be a sugar daddy or what!”</p>
<p>“…Sugar daddy… That’s a nostalgic term…”</p>

<p>It’s nice that he cares for my little sister, but he’s spoiling her too much.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’m confiscating this card.”</p>
<p>“So stingy! This is something Ha-kun promised to give me as a present! It’s Harune’s.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah. I made a promise that I’d give it to her if she won the violin contest, so I worked hard to get it.”</p>
<p>“Be quiet! A high school student doesn’t need a hundred-thousand-yen card!”</p>

<p>Only I can call him by that name…</p>

<p>“Hey, that’s oppressive!”</p>
<p>“I won’t accept any complaints. If you really want the card, buy it with your own money.”</p>
<p>“If a high school student wants to enjoy their youth, they don’t have time for part-time jobs…”</p>

<p>——Stares</p>

<p>“Ugh, never mind. Anyway, Touka-san, no need to get so angry…”</p>
<p>“For now, when I get back, both of you are getting a lecture. Be prepared!”</p>
<p>“Okay…”</p>
<p>“Stingy!”</p>

<p>Ha-kun looks sad as he sits in seiza waiting.</p>
<p>Naturally, my sister Harune, though she wears a discontented expression, sits next to Ha-kun in seiza as well.</p>

<p>“It’s not easy for you either, son-in-law…”</p>

<p>With an exasperated expression, Grandma commented.</p>

<p>“Touka-nee…”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Be careful.”</p>

<p>Harune’s face shows a hint of worry.</p>
<p>Well, considering I’m about to travel to the past, it’s natural for my family to feel concerned.</p>

<p>“Also, please make sure my birthday party goes well.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why?”</p>
<p>“Because when my birthday party got canceled last time, I was really down… And Harune has been regretting it all this time. If I can go back to that day six years ago, Harune definitely wants to play the violin. So, please, convince me when you’re back to six years ago!”</p>
<p>“…Okay. I’ll include that as one of my goals.”</p>

<p>Harune is overjoyed at those words.</p>
<p>She may have become a high school student and somewhat matured, but she’s still very much a child…</p>

<p>“Harune, is there anything else you want me to pass on?”</p>
<p>“…As promised, please tell her I won the violin competition.”</p>
<p>“Got it. I’ll make sure to convey that message.”</p>

<p>Thank you. Honestly, there are probably things you also want to say if you could go back six years.</p>
<p>But this time, I want you to let me handle that…</p>

<p>“Oh, and tell her that I’m more beautiful and popular than Touka-nee.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Who’s more beautiful than me?”</p>
<p>“Harune-chan, the fresh JK!”</p>

<p>Harune strikes an intentionally cute pose with both hands near her face.</p>

<p>“Ugh. To think she’d claim she’s more beautiful than me just because she’s a fresh high school girl. So silly.”</p>

<p>Well, I’ll let her know that this child is still as cheeky and lively as ever in the future.</p>

<p>“Oh, right. I’m giving this box to Touka.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Ha-kun produces a DVD case seemingly out of thin air and hands it to me.</p>
<p>I accept it and check inside.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing inside?”</p>
<p>“That’s a gift for your sister. When she opens it, Natsumi-san will appear.”</p>
<p>“So, it’s one of your favourite magic tricks. Got it, I’ll give it to my sister.”</p>
<p>“Touka, be careful.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. Well then, I’m going for real this time!”</p>

<p>Waving to the three of them, I left the chapel with a mix of anxiety and hope.</p>
<p>And then, I dashed into the restroom cubicle where the lights were dimmed in the hotel.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Um, while turning the crown of the pocket watch, I need to recall April 14th, six years ago.”</p>

<p>Following Grandma’s instructions, I closed my eyes and concentrated while turning the pocket watch’s crown, recalling the day Ha-kun confessed to me.</p>
<p>Honestly, I was a bit scared. I worried that when traveling back to the past, my head would spin or I’d feel pain all over my body. But those worries turned out to be unfounded.</p>

<p>——When I opened my eyes, I was greeted by a bright light.</p>
<p>I checked my own chest. Since I had been in a dark place for a while, my eyes hurt a bit.</p>

<p>“As Grandma explained, the number ’60’ is engraved…”</p>

<p>It seemed like time travel was successful.</p>
<p>My body didn’t seem abnormal. In fact, I felt pretty good.</p>

<p>“Now I need to confirm if this is the world of six years ago.”</p>

<p>Thinking that, as I tried to exit the cubicle——</p>

<p>“Nee-nee, where did you come from?”</p>

<p>I heard the voice of a young child from behind me.</p>
<p>Turning around cautiously, I found a little kid sitting on the toilet seat with a curious expression, as if they had discovered something fascinating.</p>
<p>Judging by her age, they seemed to be around the same age as Ha-kun’s twin siblings.</p>
<p>She was dressed adorably in a pink dress.</p>
<p>It seems like I’m like a child invited to someone’s wedding.</p>

<p>However, when I time-traveled, I had mistakenly assumed that this world’s time would be past 11 PM.</p>
<p>It turns out that was my misunderstanding; there’s a slight discrepancy in the time when it comes to time travel.</p>

<p>“Suddenly appearing, big sister, are you a wizard?”</p>

<p>With eyes sparkling in curiosity, the girl asked in an unexpectedly nonsensical yet not entirely implausible manner.</p>
<p>Considering that I time-traveled using items from a witch, I might be a kind of wizard in a way.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m a wizard.”</p>
<p>“I knew it…”</p>

<p>The girl crossed her arms, seemingly satisfied with her own conclusion.</p>
<p>I’m relieved that it was this little girl and not an adult who was in the restroom cubicle.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t tell anyone about this.”</p>

<p>Even I find this excuse quite embarrassing.</p>
<p>However, the girl smiled and said,</p>
<p>‘Got it. It’s a secret between you and me, big sister,’ and placed her index finger over her lips.</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>I thanked the girl and, after confirming that no one else was around, left the cubicle.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the restroom only had this little girl in it.</p>
<p>Trusting my husband’s idea and time-traveling in the restroom turned out to be a big failure.</p>

<p>“Guess my husband is still quite the Pitiful Prince…”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b12.png" alt="" />

<p>Muttering such complaints, I left the hotel and hailed a taxi.</p>
<p>I quickly caught a taxi and got inside. The driver seemed quite surprised by my appearance.</p>
<p>Well, if a bride in a wedding dress came out of a wedding venue, I think anyone would be surprised.</p>

<p>For now, I need to think about where to go.</p>
<p>While thinking, I somewhat regretted coming here without a plan.</p>
<p>Should I go back to my parents’ house? …Undoubtedly, that would create quite a commotion for the high school student me.</p>
<p>And I can easily imagine the chaos that would ensue inside the house.</p>

<p>In that case, should I rely on Kanako? No, considering it’s six years ago, Kanako and I weren’t that close, so it would be difficult to ask her for help.</p>
<p>In a situation like this, the only people who would help me with a smile are my family members, right?</p>
<p>——Within me, one family emerged.</p>

<p>If it’s the Ouji family, they would likely warmly welcome me even if we’ve just met.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I gave the address of the Ouji family to the taxi driver and requested to be taken there.</p>
<p>The taxi driver started the car with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>During the ride, the taxi driver bombarded me with various questions.</p>
<p>It seems like he mistakenly assumed that I was an unruly person fleeing from a wedding.</p>
<p>Letting out a deep sigh, I checked the time on my smartphone which I took out from my bag.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the displayed time on my smartphone remained the same as the year before I leaped back in time. And eventually, I reached the destination.</p>
<p>Taking out my wallet from my bag, I handed a 10,000 yen bill to the taxi driver.</p>
<p>Receiving the bill, the driver wore a similarly puzzled expression.</p>

<p>“Miss, I can’t accept play money…”</p>
<p>“Huh? Play money?”</p>

<p>—Oh right! Six years ago, the ten-thousand yen bill had Yukichi on it!</p>

<p>“Uh, miss, you don’t have any money?”</p>
<p>“…If it’s money, I think the people in this house will… pay for it…”</p>

<p>With trembling hands, I pointed to the white Ouji family house.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but I’ll have my father-in-law cover the taxi fare.</p>
<p>Afterward, feeling guilty, I had my father-in-law cover the taxi fare.</p>

<p>And then, to the two who were still coming to terms with the situation, I told them the truth.</p>
<p>While my father-in-law and mother-in-law were initially puzzled, just as I expected, they both wholeheartedly accepted everything when I showed them the video that my sister Harune recorded at the wedding.</p>
<p>After that, the two of them welcomed me with smiles.</p>

<p>I never would have thought that even in this timeline, my marriage would be celebrated.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, when we first met, they also ordered delivery sushi, and just like now, they accepted me with open-hearted smiles.</p>

<p>I truly feel proud from the bottom of my heart to be part of this wonderful family.</p>
<p>With a bit of relief, I was incredibly excited and couldn’t wait to see my husband from six years ago.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“——Touka-san… Wake up, Touka-san.”</p>

<p>My body was gently shaken.</p>

<p>“——Touka-san…Touka-san…”</p>

<p>Even I was sleeping so comfortably… who dares wake me up!</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, my beloved husband was looking at me with an exasperated expression.</p>

<p>“Huh? Ha-kun, did you get younger?”</p>
<p>“Thank you for the classic joke.”</p>

<p>It seems I was still a bit groggy.</p>

<p>“We’re about to arrive, so please get ready.”</p>

<p>I nodded sleepily in response to him.</p>
<p>I thought returning to six years ago would make me feel nostalgic, but surprisingly, the feeling of freshness was stronger.</p>
<p>It’s strange. Even though I already know them, many familiar events feel like I’m experiencing them for the first time.</p>

<p>I felt at ease, and honestly, I thought it would never get boring, even if I stayed here for a long time.</p>
<p>However, amidst those thoughts, I still knew that this world wasn’t my own.</p>
<p>I strongly felt that.</p>

<p>I understood that I was an outsider in this world and that I couldn’t stay for long.</p>
<p>Next week, I’ll go see him. I’ll meet him and talk about everything that has happened so far——The reason why I came to this timeline.</p>

<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“—Huh?”</p>
<p>“You looked troubled, like you were worried about something.”</p>
<p>“…Maybe so. But don’t worry, I’m okay.”</p>

<p>In response to my words, Ouji-kun gave me reassuring words, ‘You can always talk to me if you want to.’</p>

<p>“Oh, right. There’s something I forgot to tell you, Touka-san.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, what is it?”</p>
<p>“——Welcome to the world of six years ago.”</p>

<p>There it is, it was my favorite smile.</p>
<p>Seeing this smile, there’s nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>Let’s put an end to what was lost that day.</p>

<p>——In the unseen future, I believe there will be a version of me who smiles just as much as he does right now</p>
