<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>I’m Conscious of Your Presence – Part 1</strong></p>



<p>It couldn’t be helped──</p>



<p>After returning to Himawari’s room, Kamome explained to Himawari about his past with Tsuyu.</p>



<p>About that she is Kamome’s close childhood friend who had lived in the neighborhood when he was a child.</p>



<p>However, Tsuyu moved to another house due to family reasons, and since then, they have lost contact or even saw each other at all.</p>



<p>And when he met her again today and actually talked to her, it turned out that she was the same person as that childhood friend.</p>



<p>「T-Thas was it…」</p>



<p>Kamome’s desperate explanation convinced Himawari for the time being.</p>



<p>She must have been perplexed to see the scene where her boyfriend and her sister were meeting secretly without telling her.</p>



<p>Moreover, her sister was half-naked at that time.</p>



<p>But at any rate, the explanation of the details of the incident was successfully completed, and it seemed that the situation would not lead to any strange misunderstandings──</p>



<p>That’s right, Kamome was optimistic.</p>



<p>To tell the truth honestly is an act of sincerity, and as long as you do it with integrity, the other party will understand you.</p>



<p>Above all, Himawari is a child who can consider other people’s circumstances.</p>



<p>That’s what he thought.</p>



<p>「But… The atmosphere was kind of strange.」</p>


<p>Then, Himawari addressed him fearfully.</p>



<p>「It wasn’t like you were happy to meet again after a long time, Kamome-kun seemed angry…」</p>



<p>「T-That’s….」</p>



<p>With her having such suspicions, Kamome involuntarily clammed up.</p>



<p>──I was kissed by Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Honestly stating the truth is an act of sincerity, he believes so, but he’s at a loss as to whether or not he should tell her how it happened.</p>



<p>In order not to make Himawari uneasy, he doesn’t want to hide his guilt.</p>



<p>Or rather, he’s not capable of such skillful mannerism, Kamome is aware of that.</p>



<p>There, he remembered what Kensuke had said the other day, “A kind lie is also necessary in a relationship”.</p>



<p>What kind of girl would feel good to hear that her boyfriend was kissing another woman without her knowledge?</p>



<p>He thinks that Himawari is gentle and pure, but not strong-willed.</p>



<p>Will he foolishly and honestly tell the truth when he knows it might hurt the other person?</p>



<p>「Actually, Tsuyu-san, how should I put it, well… teased me.」</p>



<p>I don’t want to lie, but I also don’t want to make her feel bad──</p>



<p>Kamome, who thought so, chose a compromise at that moment.</p>



<p>It was a method of deceiving with slightly vague words.</p>



<p>Hearing Kamome’s declaration, Himawari’s face turned into a blank expression for a moment.</p>


<p>「S-She teased you…」</p>



<p>「I think you saw how she looked at that time… In other words, that’s what I mean…」</p>



<p>Kamome speaks in a faltering voice while thinking about how to choose his words.</p>



<p>Himawari, on the other hand, immediately afterward hearing what he said, her face flushed bright red.</p>



<p>He didn’t say what exactly was done to him… But perhaps as a result of imagining the situation in which “Kamome was provoked by Tsuyu”, her imagination flew.</p>



<p>「And because she did that to me out of the blue, I was so upset that I unintentionally pushed her away. I mean, such a thing was a first time for me. In the first place, I had a wonderful girlfriend named Himawari, and to think that she would do such a thing to me…」</p>



<p>After saying that much, Kamome drops his eyebrows.</p>



<p>「…I may have done something terrible.」</p>



<p>「…S-So that was it.」</p>



<p>Himawari puts both hands on her face and tries to lower her heightened body temperature.</p>



<p>After finishing listening to Kamome’s story, she nodded a few times.</p>



<p>「But it can’t be helped. Rather, Kamome-kun is the victim. I’m sorry… I’m sorry… Tsuyu-san caused you trouble.」</p>



<p>「Ah, no, Himawari shouldn’t apologize…」</p>



<p>At that moment, the sound of a room door opening was heard.</p>



<p>Looking there, Tsuyu was standing behind Himawari’s door in the hallway.</p>



<p>「Ah, Tsuyu-san…」</p>



<p>「I’m going out for a while.」</p>

<p>After saying that, Tsuyu turned her gaze to Kamome, who was sitting next to Himawari.</p>



<p>Kamome was shaken by the gaze that was fixed at him.</p>



<p>I wonder… Could it be that she is in a bad mood?</p>



<p>Kamome thought so, remembering their previous exchange.</p>



<p>「See you later, virgin.」</p>



<p>「…What!?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu said that and closed the door.</p>



<p>Next to Kamome, Himawari stiffens like a stone statue.</p>



<p>Kamome immediately stood up and opened the door that had just been closed with a bang! Then shout at the back of Tsuyu, who was on her way down the stairs, “What are you saying in front of Himawari!”.</p>



<p>Tsuyu looked startled at the loud voice that hit her from behind, but immediately turned forward and left at a quick pace.</p>



<p>「Haa…」</p>



<p>Seeing such Tsuyu go, Kamome let out a sigh.</p>



<p>By how she acted, did Tsuyu’s pride get hurt after all?</p>



<p>Although it’s strange that Tsuyu did such a thing in the first place, I might has said too much because I was too excited.</p>



<p>Should I apologize to her if I have another opportunity?</p>



<p>There, Kamome turns to Himawari, who is looking down.</p>



<p>「Sorry, Himawari. I don’t want you to worry about what Tsuyu-san just said…」</p>



<p>「…Kamome-kun, you said you were teased by Tsuyu-san.」</p>



<p>There, Himawari nervously opens her mouth.</p>



<p>「…Did she do… something to you?」</p>



<p>「Eh.」</p>



<p>It was the point that he misled earlier.</p>



<p>After all, she was concerned about that too.</p>



<p>「T-That is…」</p>



<p>Himawari looks up at the hesitant Kamome.</p>



<p>Anxiety and confusion mixed together, a very painful expression.</p>



<p>Kamome, who was watching her, also felt her heart tighten.</p>



<p>What should I do? I should be honest after all…</p>



<p>No, then, why did I mislead her earlier…?</p>



<p>It’s the first time I was invited to her house. On such an important day, I can’t make her feel bad anymore.</p>



<p>『If you value your relationship, sometimes you need to lie. There is such a thing as a kind lie, right?』</p>



<p>「…She just pressed against me; we didn’t do anything.」</p>



<p>Again, Kensuke’s words passed through his mind.</p>



<p>Kamome decided to take those words seriously this time.</p>

<p>「Himawari also, you must have heard my loud voice, right? I rejected her when she came at me, and Himawari came shortly thereafter. So, we didn’t do anything special.」</p>



<p>This time he isn’t misleading her.</p>



<p>“We didn’t do anything”, he said clearly.</p>



<p>He lied.</p>



<p>His heartbeat increases.</p>



<p>Somehow, the back of his neck hurts as if it were tightening, and Kamome press his hand there.</p>



<p>Lying to someone important to you… Maybe this is a feeling of disgust toward himself.</p>



<p>「So, Kamome-kun was pressed by Tsuyu-san, but you rejected her, thinking about me…」</p>



<p>「Y-Yeah.」</p>



<p>「Okay, I understand.」</p>



<p>At Kamome’s words, Himawari showed a relieved expression.</p>



<p>It could be seen that her anxiety-filled atmosphere has softened.</p>



<p>「Thank God… I’m sorry. I know I said earlier that it couldn’t be helped and don’t worry about it, but the truth is, I was a little bothered…」</p>



<p>「…I’m sorry, too. Somehow, I’ve been troubling you with various things. I really feel bad for Himawari.」</p>



<p>「Eh… No, it’s not like that! It’s not Kamome-kun’s fault. Because Tsuyu-san suddenly, well… f-forced on you.」</p>



<p>Himawari blushes and tries to cheer Kamome up hurriedly.</p>



<p>Witnessing that lovely figure, Kamome was also able to get rid of the venom at once.</p>


<p>At the same time, he reaffirms the situation he is currently in.</p>



<p>That’s it, today, he’s in Himawari’s… his girlfriend’s house.</p>



<p>He will apologize to Tsuyu eventually, but that’s a story for another time.</p>



<p>The reunion with her was unexpected, but it doesn’t matter now.</p>



<p>Today, he was invited by his girlfriend, Himawari, to spend time with her in her room.</p>



<p>He should concentrate on that and put everything else out of his mind.</p>



<p>「Ah, you’ve run out of coffee. I’ll get you some.」</p>



<p>There, Himawari says, looking at the empty mug.</p>



<p>「Ah, then, I’ll go with you.」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>At Kamome’s comment, Himawari’s question mark appears on her face.</p>



<p>「It’s okay, Kamome-kun. This is my house.」</p>



<p>「Eh? Ah, right, it’s not a family restaurant or anything, is it?」</p>



<p>Apparently, the turmoil hasn’t disappeared yet.</p>



<p>He said such a stupid thing.</p>



<p>Kamome becomes embarrassed at once and holds his head.</p>



<p>Seeing Kamome like that, Himawari “Fufufu” laughs.</p>


<p>「Kamome-kun, take it easy until you calm down.」</p>



<p>With a gentle whisper, Himawari grabbed an empty mug and left the room.</p>



<p>Kamome smiles as he sees her back.</p>



<p>The tense atmosphere from earlier disappeared and returned to a calm one at once.</p>



<p>(I guess this is what it’s like to be with the person you love.)</p>



<p>While feeling so warm, Kamome thought.</p>



<p>「Ah, that’s right.」</p>



<p>Himawari returned after brewing a pot of coffee on the first floor.</p>



<p>After putting the coffee on the table, she heads to the bookshelf there.</p>



<p>「I found an interesting manga the other day.」</p>



<p>Himawari has many hobbies that are more of an indoor hobby, such as reading manga and watching video sites on the Internet.</p>



<p>There, what she brought from her bookshelf was a paperback copy of a manga published on the web.</p>



<p>The content is a so-called slice of life four-panel gag manga.</p>



<p>「I like it so much that I read it many times before going to bed.」</p>



<p>「Heh.」</p>



<p>After receiving the manga, Kamome flips through the pages.</p>



<p>It was a four-panel story about the daily life of a high school couple.</p>



<p>In the manga, a couple in the beginning of their relationship is portrayed in a comical, yet friendly manner.</p>



<p>There are no major incidents or heavy developments, just a story that makes you appreciate the exciting days of an innocent couple.</p>



<p>「Ah, it is indeed healing.」</p>



<p>「Yes, it is very healing.」</p>



<p>Because of the stress-free content, when you read it, you will have a relaxed expression.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Kamome takes his eyes off the manga and looks at Himawari’s face next to him.</p>



<p>She seems to be feeling the same way as Kamome, and she looks like a puppy in the sun.</p>



<p>「Really, she looks like a puppy…」</p>



<p>Without thinking, he said so out loud.</p>



<p>「…Ehe!?」</p>



<p>When Kamome said that, Himawari immediately put her hands on both cheeks.</p>



<p>“Awawa, I’m so embarrassed”, Himawari’s face turns bright red.</p>



<p>「I-I’m sorry, I sweat easily and my face gets hot as soon as I’m embarrassed…」</p>



<p>Himawari wipes the sweat from her cheeks, neck, and chest while turning bright red.</p>



<p>She has blushing disorder and has always been concerned about the fact that when she gets emotional, it shows immediately in her face.</p>



<p>Holding her cheeks between both hands, it’s a habit that has become ingrained in her body too.</p>



<p>That habit is also cute.</p>



<p>(I want to pet her head.)</p>



<p>He thought so impulsively.</p>



<p>Before he knew it, Kamome was reaching out his hand towards Himawari to pet her head in a natural way.</p>



<p>There.</p>



<p>「…Eh?」</p>



<p>「Ah…」</p>



<p>His eyes met Himawari’s.</p>



<p>His body stiffens involuntary and he stops his hand.</p>



<p>Time stops.</p>



<p>A subtle mood flows.</p>



<p>Ah, it has stopped.</p>



<p>This kind of gesture should be done naturally, but it’s lame!</p>



<p>Kamome agonizes inwardly, but then he realizes.</p>



<p>That Himawari is waiting for him.</p>



<p>She is waiting for Kamome to make a move, she lowered her head and timidly looked up.</p>



<p>As if asking.</p>



<p>As if waiting for him to pat her head.</p>

<p>That gesture was lovable, Kamome touched her head without hesitation.</p>



<p>He gently strokes her smooth and silky hair.</p>



<p>He stroked her head and tickled her.</p>



<p>「E-Ehehe…」</p>



<p>Himawari laughs as her head is stroked and tickled.</p>


<div><img src="https://sinkuredtranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/knav1ilus1.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div><p></p>


<p>「E-Ehehe…」</p>



<p>Himawari laughs as her head is stroked and tickled.</p>



<p>「Did it tickle you?」</p>



<p>「Yeah, but more than that, I’m happy.」</p>



<p>Himawari smiles, in a good mood.</p>



<p>「Because I can feel that Kamome-kun is really my boyfriend.」</p>



<p>…Aaahhh! So cute!</p>



<p>The inside of Kamome’s heart is screaming and thumping.</p>



<p>What would happen if he said, “I’m glad Himawari is my girlfriend, too”.</p>



<p>Quite naturally, such snobbish lines almost came out of his throat.</p>



<p>But if he said such a thing to her, whose face was bright red in her current state, her head might boil over and she might collapse.</p>


<p>Thinking so, he stopped just before he said it.</p>



<p>Just like that, forgetting completely about the incident with Tsuyu, Kamome and Himawari spent their time alone in a good mood.</p>



<p>Eventually, it was time to go home in the evening.</p>



<p>「See you later.」</p>



<p>「Yeah.」</p>



<p>The two parted at the door.</p>



<p>「I’ll send you a message when I get home.」</p>



<p>「Yeah, sure.」</p>



<p>After saying goodbye, Kamome headed home.</p>



<p>Today was a good day, he thought, feeling a sense of satisfaction filling his chest.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>But then, Kamome’s mind recalled Tsuyu, who he should have forgotten.</p>



<p>She is now Himawari’s sister-in-law.</p>



<p>After not seeing her for a while, her appearance and atmosphere has completely changed.</p>



<p>What’s more, all of a sudden, she acted like that… Either in a frenzy or confused he said the words just as they were in his head.</p>



<p>However, when he thought about it carefully, it was not his place to say anything about it.</p>



<p>Next time he sees her, he’ll apologize for what happened today.</p>


<p>And that would be the end of it.</p>



<p>…I should have come to that conclusion, but why?</p>



<p>He can’t help but feel a vague feeling that he can’t express.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>「Good morning, Kamome-kun.」</p>



<p>Kamome’s recent school life begins with meeting Himawari in front of the nearest station to high school in the morning.</p>



<p>Since for the two of them the station near their homes is in opposite directions, here is the first point where they paths converge when going to school.</p>



<p>Hence, they decided to match the time and walk the short route from the station to the school together.</p>



<p>「Good morning.」</p>



<p>On the way to school, a voice called out to Kamome and Himawari walking side by side.</p>



<p>She has short black hair, long eyelashes, and her face is filled with an energetic smile.</p>



<p>She is wearing a skirt that is relatively short above the knee, wrapped around her waist on her summer shirt.</p>



<p>Bright and lively, just like a high school girl of today, her name is Tachibana Risa, Himawari’s classmate and friend.</p>



<p>「Ohh, you’re flirting since morning.」</p>



<p>Himawari, “Mou! Risa-chan!”, warned Risa who teased her with such words.</p>



<p>「Sorry.」</p>



<p>「No, not at all.」</p>


<p>Himawari apologizes in embarrassment as she sees Risa off running ahead of her.</p>



<p>The two of them went to school like that and part ways at the entrance.</p>



<p>Kamome is in First Year Class B and Himawari is in First Year Class A.</p>



<p>Since they are in different classes, they rarely see each other during the day.</p>



<p>Even at lunchtime… They are embarrassed to go out of their way to meet together, so they continue to spend their time separately as before.</p>



<p>After school, Himawari stays at school on club days, so Kamome goes home first.</p>



<p>When they get home, they talk together via a messaging app.</p>



<p>Such days have continued since they became lovers.</p>



<p>They spend their days together in harmony──</p>



<p>「So far, things seem to be going well.」</p>



<p>One day during lunch break.</p>



<p>While having lunch, Kamome was talking with classmates Kurose Misaki and Ojiya Kensuke.</p>



<p>「Well, what we’re doing is pretty much the same as before.」</p>



<p>「What the heck, that’s boring. Isn’t there some kind of shuraba or something?」</p>



<p>「You yourself are a fully automatic shuraba maker, so be satisfied with yourself.」</p>



<p>Misaki slaps Kensuke’s head, who was complaining for some reason.</p>



<p>「Unfortunately, the incident you’re expecting won’t happen. There aren’t many ideal couples like them.」</p>


<p>「……Yeah.」</p>



<p>However, when Misaki said so, Kamome made a bitter expression.</p>



<p>An incident won’t happen, now that he says it, it’s not so.</p>



<p>「…Uwaa, you clearly have a look on your face that something happened.」</p>



<p>「Oh, what is it, did some problem happen?」</p>



<p>「Actually…」</p>



<p>To Misaki, who looks at him suspiciously, and Kensuke, who looks at him expectantly, Kamome tells them about the incident the other day.</p>



<p>About that Himawari’s older sister is Tsuyu, his childhood friend.</p>



<p>「Seriously?」</p>



<p>「Such coincidences happen…」</p>



<p>Hearing that episode, both Misaki and Kensuke’s eyes widen in surprise.</p>



<p>But then, Kensuke smiled as if he had realized something.</p>



<p>「Mmn, I get it, Kamome. You used to have a crush on that person, didn’t you? So, your heart was shaken by your first love whom you met again after a long time.」</p>



<p>「Eh…」</p>



<p>「Oi, idiot. Don’t say things like that lightly. Besides, even if he liked her back then, it was only in elementary school, right? Those feelings have long since disappeared, Isn’t that right Kamome?」</p>



<p>Misaki says that and looks at Kamome’s face.</p>



<p>Then, Kamome looks back at Misaki with a slightly tense expression.</p>


<p>「…No, this is pretty obvious. Don’t tell…」</p>



<p>「Eh, it showed on my face?」</p>



<p>「Completely. Your distress is in full view.」</p>



<p>「No… No, that’s not true!」</p>



<p>There, Kamome states.</p>



<p>「There is absolutely no way my heart is moved by Tsuyu! If you see me in distress, it’s for another reason!」</p>



<p>「Okay, okay, I get it, calm down. We’re in the classroom.」</p>



<p>「What other reason?」</p>



<p>While Misaki is trying to calm him down, Kensuke asks Kamome.</p>



<p>In response to that question, Kamome says, “I’m more than a little in turmoil that she’s changed so much in personality and appearance that she doesn’t look anything like she used to”.</p>



<p>「Ahh, I kind of understand that. It’s shocking, isn’t it? That person used to be boyish or lively, but in any case, it felt like she was a sporty, cheerful female friend who pulled Kamome around. But now, she has become a decadent, fun-loving, slightly gyaru-like person. I get it, I get it.」</p>



<p>「What do you know? Well, but, on the contrary, it was good, wasn’t it? For Kamome.」</p>



<p>At Misaki’s words, Kamome raises his face with a “Eh?”.</p>



<p>「If that person is the same as before… In other words, Kamome’s ideal, you can’t say for sure that you wouldn’t be attracted to that person, can you? You are a clumsy and serious person, so if that happens, your relationship with Shishido will probably be strained, and you may end up breaking up with her, saying that you were unfaithful.」</p>



<p>「…….」</p>



<p>「Well, for now, you just have to take care of your current girlfriend as you declared. That’s all there is to it, right?」</p>



<p>Misaki states plainly.</p>


<p>「…Yeah, that’s right.」</p>



<p>Nodding, Kamome makes up his mind once again.</p>



<p>Let’s get rid of the hazy feeling of my heart.</p>



<p>Next time we meet, let’s apologize profusely for the other day’s disrespect and let’s end it with that.</p>



<p>I ended up saying things like, “I admired the old Tsuyu”, but it’s rude to impose my own ideals on her now.</p>



<p>Tsuyu has changed.</p>



<p>She has grown up.</p>



<p>And she’s living her life now.</p>



<p>So, that’s fine, isn’t it?</p>



<p>It’s not my place to interfere. For Himawari’s sake and my own sake, Kamome concluded.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>──A certain day.</p>



<p>Today, Kamomke went out to a town about seven stations away from the living area where my house is located.</p>



<p>It’s the most prosperous place in the neighborhood, and many of the young people who live in the area pass time here.</p>



<p>Once out of the station, a shopping area spreads out in front of the station.</p>



<p>It is, so to speak, a center of activity.</p>



<p>The purpose of visiting this town today is to buy a manga that Himawari recommended to him.</p>



<p>Also, to buy new clothes.</p>



<p>Actually, he’s planning to go on a date with Himawari soon.</p>



<p>So, in order to be a little fashionable, he came to buy clothes.</p>



<p>It’s their first date after all.</p>



<p>Of course, he wants to have fun from the bottom of his heart, but he also wants to dress in a way that he wouldn’t be embarrassed to be with Himawari.</p>



<p>So, Kamome put all his knowledge to use and went shopping while thinking about what clothes would be suitable for going on a date.</p>



<p>…However, after long hours of deliberation, he couldn’t find the right outfit.</p>



<p>No, it was probably my own fault that I couldn’t choose the right one, Kamome thought dejectedly.</p>



<p>To confess, he has been careless about his appearance until now, so he doesn’t have such know-how.</p>

<p>「If this is the case, I should have asked Kensuke or Misaki to come with me…」</p>



<p>He thinks those two are stylish people compared to him.</p>



<p>Kensuke probably knows how to dress for girls, and Misaki has a unique sense of style.</p>



<p>In the end, he wasn’t able to find any clothes that he could clearly say “This is it”, thinking that it would be better than buying nothing, he ended up buying clothes that were acceptable.</p>



<p>Kamome is walking home after shopping while thinking “It was a mistake”.</p>



<p>「…Hmn?」</p>



<p>Then, by chance, he happened to see a familiar face.</p>



<p>It’s Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Standing at the end of the sidewalk, near a lottery ticket booth.</p>



<p>Upon closer inspection, it seems that she’s accompanied by a man.</p>



<p>Tall, with dyed hair standing up.</p>



<p>Slightly tan skin.</p>



<p>He wears clothes that fit snugly against his skin as a whole, and you can see his muscular body underneath.</p>



<p>Accessories are scattered around his neck and arms, and he has piercings on both ears and around the corners of his eyebrows.</p>



<p>The so-called flirtatious or aggressive, that kind of feeling?</p>



<p>Tsuyu was with a man who gave such an impression.</p>



<p>In addition, Tsuyu appears to be arguing with the man.</p>

<p>Even from a distance, you can tell that she is talking on and on with an expression full of anger, the man has a similar atmosphere.</p>



<p>A quarrel, perhaps?</p>



<p>Passers-by who were walking nearby also sensed their atmosphere and passed by while avoiding them with a dubious look on their faces.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>What is her relationship with that man?</p>



<p>…What are they talking about?</p>



<p>Even though it’s none of his business, even though he knows it’s rude to do such a thing…</p>



<p>For some reason, he couldn’t ignore it, and before he realized, Kamome was getting very close to them.</p>



<p>「I had enough!」</p>



<p>But before he could catch a part of the concrete conversation, Tsuyu shouted vigorously and tried to leave the place.</p>



<p>「Oi, wait!」</p>



<p>The man grabs Tsuyu’s arm.</p>



<p>「I haven’t finished talking to you yet!」</p>



<p>「No, let go of me!」</p>



<p>The man seems to be forcibly restraining Tsuyu, who expresses reluctance.</p>



<p>「It hurts!」</p>



<p>At that, Tsuyu screams.</p>


<p>The man is holding her wrist.</p>



<p>The man’s fingers are deeply embedded.</p>



<p>Probably an intense pain is running through her.</p>



<p>Tears welled up in her eyes, which were distorted by pain.</p>



<p>「tsu!」</p>



<p>It was almost impulsive.</p>



<p>Kamome stood in front of them.</p>



<p>「Ah?」</p>



<p>The man glared at Kamome, who suddenly appeared.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Tsuyu was also looking at Kamome with a surprised face.</p>



<p>「What is it?」</p>



<p>「Umn, please let her go.」</p>



<p>Kamome says to the intimidating man.</p>



<p>「I have a feeling she doesn’t like it.」</p>



<p>「Who the hell are you? It’s none of your business.」</p>



<p>The man clicks his tongue and hisses at Kamome.</p>



<p>「Sure, it’s none of my business, but──」</p>




<p>Kamome tried to talk back to him.</p>



<p>At that moment, Tsuyu shakes off the man’s weakened hand and rushes to Kamome.</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Then, Tsuyu entangled her own arm in Kamome’s arm.</p>



<p>「Ah… Eh?」</p>



<p>For Kamome, Tsuyu’s action came out of nowhere.</p>



<p>He was surprised and at a loss for words.</p>



<p>「Oi, Tsuyu… Who the hell is that guy?」</p>



<p>The man asks with a murderous intent spread all over his face.</p>



<p>「…My new boyfriend.」</p>



<p>「Haa?」</p>



<p>The man is stunned by Tsuyu’s declaration.</p>



<p>Kamome is also taken aback by Tsuyu’s sudden words.</p>



<p>On the other side of the two, Tsuyu continued her words as if she was to keep on talking without pause.</p>



<p>「That’s why, this is the end with you. I──」</p>



<p>「I-I’m not your boyfriend!」</p>



<p>Although he was stunned for a moment, Kamome immediately interrupted Tsuyu’s words and shouted loudly.</p>



<p>「I have a lover who I’m dating properly, not this woman!」</p>



<p>Hearing that statement, the man’s face became even more confused.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Tsuyu also rolled her eyes.</p>



<p>「Wait… What are you saying! You just had to obediently go along with the flow here!」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Kamome grasped the situation.</p>



<p>The man in front of him is Tsuyu’s lover.</p>



<p>And he himself seems to have run into the middle of a lover’s quarrel.</p>



<p>So, Tsuyu, on the spur of the moment, hugs Kamome and lies that he is her new boyfriend.</p>



<p>She probably planned to break up with him saying that and run away.</p>



<p>Certainly, in order to save her from the crisis, at least just for this moment he should have read the atmosphere and played along with her lie.</p>



<p>「That’s not good!」</p>



<p>However, Kamome was not the type to accept such lies.</p>



<p>「How can I call someone I’m not dating a girlfriend!」</p>



<p>「What are you saying, are you a stone head!?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu and Kamome get into an argument.</p>



<p>In the face of this situation, Tsuyu’s boyfriend can only do nothing but look dumbfounded.</p>



<p>He’s been completely taken aback… Or rather, he doesn’t seem to understand.</p>



<p>Kamome senses his state of mind.</p>



<p>He can get away with it now without having to lie about being Tsuyu’s new boyfriend.</p>



<p>「Now!」</p>



<p>Kamome grabs Tsuyu’s hand and starts running.</p>



<p>「Eh!? W-Wait──」</p>



<p>「…O-Oi!」</p>



<p>Kamome suddenly grabbed her hand and started to run, leaving Tsuyu puzzled, and the man, a beat late, tried to reach out his hand.</p>



<p>However, Kamome’s judgment and action were quicker.</p>



<p>With his strong legs, he succeeds in disappearing from the man’s sight in no time.</p>



<p>Then, Tsuyu, who was being forcibly pulled along by Kamome, runs with him for a while──</p>



<p>Eventually, they came to some back alley.</p>



<p>「Haa… Haa…」</p>



<p>They ran at full speed.</p>



<p>Probably that man has already lost sight of themselves.</p>



<p>Kamome takes refuge in a back alley and wipes the sweat from his forehead while catching his breath.</p>



<p>「I wonder if we’ll be alright if we come this far.」</p>


<p>「…That’s enough.」</p>



<p>At that point, Tsuyu, who has been on her knees with the same heavy breathing, stood up and stared at Kamome.</p>



<p>「Ah, sorry.」</p>



<p>Kamome lets go of Tsuyu’s hand.</p>



<p>In the dark and quiet back alley, only the sound of their breaths echoes for a while.</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu, is that guy Tsuyu’s boyfriend?」</p>



<p>After a few moments of regulating his breathing, Kamome asked Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Tsuyu turns her gaze diagonally down to the ground.</p>



<p>She’s making an uncomfortable expression.</p>



<p>「It didn’t look like a good atmosphere, and you two seemed to be arguing, so I made a judgment on my own, but… I wonder if it was the right decision to run away.」</p>



<p>「…It’s okay, thanks for helping me escape from him.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu replies to the agitated Kamome.</p>



<p>It’s a blunt way of saying it, but you could see her gratitude.</p>



<p>While fixing her hair, Tsuyu sits down on a suitable plastic bucket that was nearby.</p>



<p>While her expression is cool and mended, her breathing doesn’t seem to have subsided, and her shoulders are moving up and down.</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu.」</p>


<p>…What could it be?</p>



<p>Seeing Tsuyu like that, Kamome feels a sense of discomfort.</p>



<p>Tsuyu used to do track and field.</p>



<p>As an aspiring sprinter, she won many competitions, was featured in newspapers, and attracted a lot of attention.</p>



<p>Kamome admired that figure so much that he also started doing track and field when he was in junior high school.</p>



<p>But after a certain day, he never heard her name again.</p>



<p>And this figure of her now is far from what she used to be.</p>



<p>…I wonder if she no longer participates in track and field events.</p>



<p>「…What?」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu notices that Kamome is staring at her.</p>



<p>「Do you still need something? …Ahh, did I need to thank you with something?」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu smiles cynically.</p>



<p>「If so, we can continue where we left off.」</p>



<p>Saying that, Tsuyu put on a frivolous smile.</p>



<p>Her chest rises and falls as she breathes eerily.</p>



<p>Sweaty tan skin.</p>



<p>Her blushing face and the provocative look in her eyes gave Kamome a tingling sensation.</p>


<p>…I won’t deny that feeling.</p>



<p>I don’t deny it, but…</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu.」</p>



<p>Kamome opens his mouth with the same serious expression.</p>



<p>Now, more than that, there is something he wants to know.</p>



<p>The words that come out from her heart.</p>



<p>Her true feelings.</p>



<p>The other day, he couldn’t do anything about it because of the sudden reunion and her unexpected behavior, but looking at her now, he couldn’t suppress those feelings.</p>



<p>Kamome speaks honestly about it.</p>



<p>「I… used to admire Tsuyu.」</p>



<p>「───」</p>



<p>「I’m sorry for the harsh words I said the other day.」</p>



<p>『I don’t think the current Tsuyu is good at all!』</p>



<p>The words he said back then that lacked consideration.</p>



<p>Kamome apologizes for that.</p>



<p>「But that was undeniably my true feelings. I didn’t want Tsuyu to do or say something like that. Tsuyu was the person I admired… I want you to remain the Tsuyu of those days…」</p>



<p>Kamome honestly tells her how he feels.</p>


<p>…Did she understand my feelings?</p>



<p>Kamome didn’t realize that he was making such an exaggerated statement.</p>



<p>He just wanted to say that, at least, he wishes she would stop such words and behavior, like she did to herself before and even now, suddenly seducing men and allowing them to easily get physical with her.</p>



<p>「…What the hell, is that?」</p>



<p>But──</p>



<p>In response to Kamome’s straight-too-straight words, Tsuyu’s expression distorted.</p>



<p>「Don’t say selfish things. In the first place, why do I have to return to the way I used to be for you?」</p>



<p>「…Yeah, you’re right. Sorry, I said something selfish.」</p>



<p>Pressed by Tsuyu’s pressure, Kamome speaks out in remorse.</p>



<p>In contrast, Tsuyu seems to be unable to suppress her agitated emotions.</p>



<p>「…Don’t be silly.」</p>



<p>She raised her fist and slammed it into the concrete wall right behind her.</p>



<p>The skin on her fingers is torn and bleeding.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu…」</p>



<p>He certainly may have said something rude and insensitive.</p>



<p>However, the way she gets angry is not normal.</p>



<p>Now she has her hands over her face, her head drooping, and looking somewhat in pain.</p>


<p>Did his words hurt her that much?</p>



<p>「Tsuyu, I…」</p>



<p>Unable to watch, Kamome takes a step toward Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「…Ugh.」</p>



<p>At that moment, he heard her moan.</p>



<p>Looking down, he notices that Tsuyu’s right leg, around her ankle, is red and swollen.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu, you’re leg…」</p>



<p>「…Don’t look.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu hastily hid her foot there.</p>



<p>「It twisted while running up here. Because you suddenly started to run. Come on, it’s enough, isn’t it? Get out of here. If you’re too persistent, this time I’ll make a fuss about that you hurt me.」</p>



<p>「…Sorry.」</p>



<p>Seeing her glaring at him with hostility, he couldn’t say anything more.</p>


<div><img src="../Images/0005_knav1ilus2.jpg" alt="" /><!--  https://sinkuredtranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/knav1ilus2.jpg  --></div><p></p>


<p>Kamome turns his back on Tsuyu and runs away.</p>



<p>「…Haa.」</p>



<p>When Kamome was gone, Tsuyu let out a sigh and leaned her weight against the wall behind her.</p>



<p>Then, she just stares silently into the void──</p>


<p>──A few minutes later.</p>



<p>「Sorry to keep you waiting, Tsuyu.」</p>



<p>「…Ha?」</p>



<p>Tsuyu turns around at the sound of Kamome’s voice.</p>



<p>It seems that she couldn’t hide her surprise when Kamome, who should have left just a few minutes ago, reappeared.</p>



<p>「No, why are you back…?」</p>



<p>「I bought a compress and water at the pharmacy.」</p>



<p>Kamome offers the plastic bag in his hand to Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Just as he said, there was a compress and a plastic bottle of natural water inside.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry I hurt you. I’ll stay with you until you can walk again.」</p>



<p>In front of such Kamome, for a moment, Tsuyu’s eyebrows drooped, and made a face that looked like she was about to cry.</p>



<p>「Go home…」</p>



<p>Then, she immediately turns her face away and says without looking directly at Kamome.</p>



<p>「Go home, please…」</p>



<p>「…Understood.」</p>



<p>Since she was injured, he had no choice but to withdraw obediently as he was told.</p>



<p>Thinking so, Kamome leaves the place this time.</p>


<p>「…When the time comes for us to talk properly again. At that time, I want to make up with you again.」</p>



<p>That’s all he said.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Only the miscellaneous sounds of the main street flow in without hesitation.</p>



<p>Left alone in the back alley, Tsuyu lowered her gaze.</p>



<p>『I used to admire the old Tsuyu.』</p>



<p>『I want you to remain the Tsuyu of those days.』</p>



<p>The words Kamome said stuck in his head, circling around and not disappearing.</p>



<p>「Don’t say selfish things…」</p>



<p>She clenched her teeth so hard that it could be heard the sound of them snapping.</p>



<p>In those eyes, there is anger at the pure feelings of a younger childhood friend who knows nothing.</p>



<p>…And a bit of sadness.</p>



<p>「…Kamome.」</p>



<p>There was chaotic light, different from anger, mixed with intense feelings.</p>
