<h2>Chapter 2</h2>


<p>“Hey, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“After I went home last night, did anything happen?”</p>



<p>“…What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“Like, did Kanzaki-san try to seduce you or anything?”</p>



<p>“Not at all.”</p>



<p>What is my lovely girlfriend suddenly saying? Sure, Kanzaki-san stayed over at my place last night, but there wasn’t the slightest hint of any misunderstandings or inappropriate situations. If anything, what happened was quite the opposite of that sort of thing.</p>



<p>“……….”</p>




<p>I still remember everything clearly, not just the dream, but also my interaction with Kanzaki-san. Whether it’s true or not is something I’ll never really know, but it might be that Kanzaki-san was the one who helped Ayana with her revenge. Given her connections to the underworld, she probably assisted Ayana through means and contacts that weren’t publicly available.</p>



<p>“Hey, Ayana──”</p>



<p>As I was about to ask her, I stopped myself. I wanted to ask if she would have accepted Kanzaki-san’s help if she had been offered it. Geez, I already know Ayana wouldn’t do something like that anymore, so there’s no point in bringing it up.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, the fact that you even almost said something means there’s probably something to it, right?”</p>



<p>“…Yeah.”</p>



<p>Well, considering how well she understands me, it’s no surprise she picked up on my slip. Resigned, I decided to just lay it all out.</p>



<p>“Actually──”</p>



<p>I explained who Kanzaki-san is, her likely background, and how she seemed ready to act for my mother and me.</p>



<p>“I see, so that’s what you talked about. I’d heard that Kanzaki-san is one of Akemi-san’s underling, but…”</p>




<p>“Ahaha…”</p>



<p>My mother’s closeness with Kanzaki-san is clear, but as expected, Mom doesn’t like talking about her old delinquent days, let alone about the darker aspects of Kanzaki-san’s life. I ended up asking Kanzaki-san about it myself, albeit indirectly.</p>



<p>“…So.”</p>



<p>Then I brought up what I was almost going to ask Ayana.</p>



<p>“Kanzaki-san is someone with a lot of influence. That much is clear from our talk and her aura. So, Ayana──if someone like her offered to help you with your old… already abandoned revenge, what would you have done?”</p>



<p>Ayana seemed to understand instantly and answered after a moment of thought.</p>



<p>“As a premise, let’s say this is if I were still my old self, back in those times──I probably would have taken her help. Almost certainly. There are limits to what you can do alone… Even if I somehow felt I could manage, I definitely wanted to crush them thoroughly.”</p>



<p>I knew it… Ayana would have chosen to accept Kanzaki-san’s help in that future. That future won’t come now, but this confirms it almost certainly. Kanzaki-san was indeed Ayana’s collaborator.</p>



<p>“But that future won’t happen anymore.”</p>




<p>“Of course not. I’ve said goodbye to revenge and the dark past version of myself!”</p>



<p>Ayana said this as she hugged my arm tightly. She had a broad smile on her face… Thinking about it, she hardly ever smiled so freely until recently.</p>



<p>Even when she smiled before, it was always a perfectly beautiful smile… It’s hard to put into words what makes this different, but smiles like this one were just not something we saw from her before.</p>



<p>“I’m really happy you’re clinging to me, but…”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“You know, it’s pretty hot right now, so if you could let go…”</p>



<p>Honestly, it’s just so hot. It’s not unbearable yet, but under the direct sunlight, it gets pretty rough. Ayana seemed to feel the same way, so we made a promise to cuddle in a cool room after school, and she let go of me for now.</p>



<p>“This heat… it really is a menace. I think this every year, but it’s a shame we can’t snuggle when there’s no one else around.”</p>



<p>“We could, but yeah, it’s tough to deal with.”</p>




<p>“Still, how about during gym class? Isn’t that a good chance? Think about it: gym clothes all sweaty and clingy… Doesn’t that get you going?”</p>



<p>That’s a great idea! Ayana seemed to be saying that, but I just wanted to say one thing.</p>



<p>“Ayana… you’ve really become quite bold lately, haven’t you?”</p>



<p>“It’s all thanks to Towa-kun♪”</p>



<p>Ahh… she has such a cute smile.</p>



<p>This morning, Ayana had been talking about some pretty stimulating things, but as more students began to show up, the conversation naturally ended.</p>



<p>“It’s so hot!”</p>



<p>“How about going to the pool in a couple of weeks?”</p>



<p>“Sounds great! Gotta get my swimsuit ready!”</p>




<p>I overheard the girls walking ahead of us talking about it. Summer means the beach and pools, right? It’s a classic. And it’s not just for them. Ayana and I already have plans to go out as well… I even promised to help her choose a swimsuit.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“You mean the swimsuit? Don’t worry, I haven’t forgotten… and honestly, I’d like to see it too.”</p>



<p>“Ah… Fufu♪”.”</p>



<p>Of course, Ayana remembered our promise. I’m looking forward to it, whenever it happens, and I sighed quietly at the familiar sensation of being watched.</p>



<p>(…I can understand why, but still.)</p>



<p>It’s the attention Ayana gets from others. I’ve mentioned this before, but Ayana is extraordinarily beautiful and incredibly popular.</p>



<p>Even before we started dating, she was often confessed to. Now, her happiness makes her even more attractive, and despite me being right next to her, she draws so many gazes… not to mention the extra attention she gets from the freedom of summer uniforms.</p>



<p>“Really, why is Ayana so cute and beautiful… and so perfectly my type in every way?”</p>




<p>“Ara, are you trying to flatter me? But are you sure you want to keep going? I might have to return the favor twice over.”</p>



<p>“…At home, please.”</p>



<p>“Y~es♪”</p>



<p>With a cute smile, she nodded and gave me a playful bump with her shoulder. It was like something you’d do with a close friend, reminiscent of the Ayana from before. In this moment, I sensed what Ayana was trying to convey.</p>



<p>Instead of bumping her back, I gently patted her head.</p>



<p>“I think it’s important to show affection regularly.”</p>



<p>“Of course!”</p>



<p>Ayana wanted to show our bond to everyone, and that’s what she was hinting at. It’s tough to balance showing affection without overdoing it in public, especially with someone as cute as Ayana. When she’s right next to me, wanting to be close, I naturally want to respond in kind.</p>



<p>“Honestly… this reminds me of something that happened before.”</p>




<p>“I’m having a bit of a deja vu feeling too…”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“Ara?”</p>



<p>I didn’t need to turn around to know who was speaking behind us. I could tell just from the voice. It felt strangely familiar, like this had happened before.</p>



<p>“It’s Iori-senpai and Mari-chan.”</p>



<p>Ayana called out their names, and sure enough, when I turned around, there they were: Iori Honjo Senpai, and our underclassman, Mari Uchida . We’ve known them both for quite a while now, and like Ayana, they haven’t lost any of their charm.</p>



<p>“You two, huh… Well, I won’t be too nosy.” </p>



<p>“Haha! But it’s really nice to see you two looking so happy. It’s lovely!”</p>



<p>“That’s true. But seeing a couple like Yukishiro-kun and Ayana-san when you’re in high school… it might make someone’s heart stop” </p>




<p>“Isn’t that a bit of an exaggeration?”</p>



<p>It really is an exaggeration.</p>



<p>After a bit of conversation with the four of us, Iori and Mari decided to give us some space and walked away, leaving Ayana and me to ourselves.</p>



<p>“They don’t need to be so considerate.”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>As I watched their backs, I couldn’t help but notice how things have changed. These days, we rarely see Shu hanging around them anymore. </p>



<p>Although Iori and Mari both still care about Shu, he spends a lot more time alone now compared to before. I often see Iori keeping an eye on him, and Mari, too, though lately, she seems to be having fun with Aisaka instead.</p>


<img src="https://i0.wp.com/soafp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.jpg?w=565&ssl=1" alt="" />


<p>“Fufu, when Mari-chan and I talk on the phone, she’s always bringing up Aisaka-kun lately. It’s cute how she talks about him so excitedly but then gets all sad because he won’t look at her when he blushes.”</p>



<p>“Oh… yeah, he’s been like that for a while. Still not used to it, huh?”</p>




<p>“It’s adorable. It’s so obvious to us, yet Aisaka-kun is desperately trying to hide his embarrassment. And Mari-chan, thinking he’s avoiding her because he might dislike her, gets all worried.”</p>



<p>It’s actually pretty entertaining to watch from the sidelines. I’ve always wondered how things between Aisaka and Mari will turn out.</p>



<p>“I probably shouldn’t say this, but I’m glad to see Iori-senpai and Mari-chan heading in a good direction.”</p>



<p>“Yeah… absolutely.”</p>



<p>Iori remains true to her feelings, and Mari is enjoying her time with someone she finds fun to be around, even if she hasn’t fully realized it yet. Compared to the paths they might have taken, I’m sure this current direction is much better.</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>Everything is falling into place so perfectly that it’s almost scary. We’re moving towards the best possible future, but sometimes I worry that this happiness might slip through my fingers… It’s a pointless fear, yet I can’t help but feel it.</p>



<p>Ayana is right here beside me, my precious girlfriend. I want to be with her forever, but the thought of losing this happiness terrifies me.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun? Is something wrong?”</p>




<p>“Eh? No, sorry, it’s nothing.”</p>



<p>Thankfully, this time Ayana didn’t seem to notice my brief moment of unease… Jeez, it’s almost too indulgent to worry about being too happy.</p>



<p>“Well then, let’s head off.”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>Pushing aside the fleeting worry, I chatted happily with Ayana as we made our way to the classroom.</p>



<p>“Good morning, Ayana.”</p>



<p>“Good morning, Setsuna.”</p>



<p>Ayana quickly went to join her friend, Todo-san. Meanwhile, Aisaka, who’s been quite the topic of conversation, approached me.</p>



<p>“Osu, Yukishiro.”</p>




<p>“Osu, Aisaka.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t resist reaching out and rubbing his perfectly shaved head. The prickly texture was oddly satisfying, and I continued rubbing it.</p>



<p>“Oi, why am I letting another guy rub my head?”</p>



<p>“It’s got a really nice feel, you know? Keep it up.”</p>



<p>“You’re not saying that just because you’re hoping I’ll go bald, are you?”</p>



<p>“Of course not. Besides, a shaved head isn’t the same as being bald.”</p>



<p>“…True enough.”</p>



<p>I have to admit, “keep it up” and “go bald” sound pretty similar in Japanese. After enjoying the feel of Aisaka’s head for a bit, we both got up and headed for the hallway.</p>



<p>We both needed to use the restroom, and Aisaka followed me. Since it was just the two of us, naturally, the topic of conversation had to be this.</p>




<p>“So, how are things with Mari lately?”</p>



<p>“W-w-w-what do you mean?”</p>



<p>“…You’re really easy to read.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at Aisaka’s bright red face. Even though Ayana and I both know how Aisaka feels about Mari, I don’t bring it up directly to him very often.</p>



<p>“Well, good luck.”</p>



<p>“…Thanks.”</p>



<p>I have no idea what kind of relationship they’ll end up having, but that’s up to them. As friends, I just hope they find a good place together.</p>



<p>After finishing up in the restroom, we headed back to the classroom.</p>



<p>“Oh, Yukishiro-kun!”</p>




<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>The voice calling out belonged to a senior student… perhaps from the year above us?</p>



<p>“Sorry to interrupt out of the blue. I’m Bundou. I belong to the newspaper club…”</p>



<p>Newspaper club… Uh-oh, something completely unfamiliar to me just came up. Even thinking back on it, I don’t recall ever hearing about it.</p>



<p>Is it because my presence is so negligible, or is it simply because it hasn’t been prominent? However, Aisaka suddenly exclaimed, continuing the conversation.</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, before summer and winter breaks, I’ve seen the newspaper you guys publish. Didn’t you make rankings like ‘Best Couples in this High School’ and stuff like that?”</p>



<p>“Exactly! That’s it!”</p>



<p>At Aisaka’s words, Bundou-Senpai’s glasses glinted brightly.</p>




<p>Contrary to the atmosphere just moments ago, he began speaking forcefully, dragging us into his domain.</p>



<p>“We’ve been active since last year, and like he said, we feature things like Best Couples and various other special topics. You don’t see this kind of thing elsewhere, right? So, it’s been quite popular! Of course, we don’t write anything disrespectful, and we have permission to publish articles like this!”</p>



<p>“You are too close!”</p>



<p>This senior’s enthusiasm is overwhelming!</p>



<p>Coughing lightly to compose himself, Senpai continued.</p>



<p>“So, I want to write an article about you, Yukishiro-kun, and Otonashi-san! What do you think?”</p>



<p>“C-calm down, Senpai!”</p>



<p>This Senpai, even after calming down, is still not calm at all!</p>



<p>While soothing the excited Senpai, I calmly considered his proposal.</p>




<p>Best Couples… Well, it’s an honor to be seen that way with Ayana, but is it because we only recently started dating?</p>



<p>“Asking around other students, including our analysis, we’ll conduct a strict evaluation and announce the rankings! But you two are my top recommendation! I feel a strong connection between you two that could knock other ranked couples out!”</p>



<p>Senpai is really close… Ha, enough already.</p>



<p>“If we’re going to publish it without permission, that’s one thing, but if we’re going to do proper interviews and stuff, I think it could be good, right? It sounds interesting.”</p>



<p>“You…!”</p>



<p>“And so, what do you say, Yukishiro-kun?”</p>



<p>Aisaka seemed interested in joining, and Bundou-Senpai seemed eager for our participation.</p>



<p>Looking between the two of them, I pondered… I should probably hear Ayana’s opinion as well. Just as I thought that, a voice came from behind.</p>



<p>“It’s fine. I agree.”</p>




<p>With that voice, a hand was placed on my shoulder, and I turned around.</p>



<p>I don’t know where she heard from, but Ayana, with a broad smile, stood there with Todo-san.</p>



<p>“Ayana… Is it really okay?”</p>



<p>“Of course. Let’s just show off our relationship to everyone. Show them that no one can come between us!”</p>



<p>“Oh… Otonashi-san is enthusiastic!”</p>



<p>“Please feature our lovey-dovey moments as much as possible.”</p>



<p>“Leave it to me!”</p>



<p>…Um, I guess my opinion doesn’t matter here.</p>



<p>Well, if Ayana is fine with it, then I don’t mind either. So, I turned to Bundou-Senpai and said </p>




<p>“Okay, please go ahead with that.”</p>



<p>“Since I want to publish the article before summer break, would it be alright to conduct a brief interview tomorrow after school? It’s fine if you’re separate, but I think it’d be better if you’re together. I also want to take some photos!”</p>



<p>Bundou-Senpai’s glasses have been sparkling since earlier. Though there’s no way such a function exists, and it’s not like it’s okay in reality, why does it look that way… maybe I’m just tired.</p>



<p>“I understand for now. Where shall we do it?”</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t dream of making you come all the way to me. I was thinking of visiting your classroom… since it’ll be empty after school.”</p>



<p>That certainly makes sense… and so the plan for tomorrow after school was set.</p>



<p>Bundou-Senpai left with an excited spring in his step, and we hurried back to the classroom as morning assembly was about to start.</p>



<p>…?</p>



<p>After entering the classroom, I immediately felt someone’s gaze as Ayana and the others moved away. It was from Shu, and as soon as our eyes met, he quickly looked away as usual, but I felt relieved that lately, there hasn’t been the negative feeling in his gaze that I used to see.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Towa-kun is too kind, or maybe he just cares too much.)</p>



<p>As the morning assembly began, I found myself thinking about Towa-kun while listening to the teacher’s words. Even when he’s not sitting next to me, he doesn’t take his seat; instead, he looks towards Shuu-kun, so I notice it immediately.</p>



<p>I don’t harbor any hatred towards Shu-kun or his family anymore, but if Shu-kun monopolizes Towa-kun’s attention more than I do, well… that’s a different story. I can’t help but smile wryly at that thought.</p>



<p>(It’s not like I’m obsessing over it or anything… It’s just that we’ve been close since we were young.)</p>



<p>We parted ways like that… but there were many enjoyable times because Towa-kun was there. It wasn’t just that we got along because we had to; there were moments when I genuinely enjoyed our time together as three.</p>



<p>(Well, regardless, I think time will sort things out. From what I’ve heard, Towa-kun seems to be smiling more these days compared to before.)</p>



<p>Thinking like that, I suddenly realize something. Could it be that I’m also concerned about Shu-kun, after all?</p>




<p>(I guess it’s just a sign of having a clear mind. And above all, because I get to spend every day with Towa-kun… because he loves me. Being showered with his feelings, there’s no way I couldn’t be happy.)</p>



<p>Just how deeply am I in love with Towa-kun, I wonder… Just a moment ago, I was thinking about Shu-kun, but even if I think a little about Towa-kun, my mind becomes completely filled with thoughts of him.</p>



<p>“… Ehehe.”</p>



<p>Oops, a smile of happiness escaped me unintentionally. </p>



<p>Fortunately, neither the teacher nor the other classmates seemed to notice my state, but I can’t help but feel a fleeting gaze that seems to include a mix of astonishment and bewilderment. I’ll just chalk it up to my imagination!</p>



<p>(But… could it really be a passing glance?)</p>



<p>In my mind, it’s basically filled with thoughts of Towa-kun and the important people who treat me well… Naturally, my friends are included in that circle.</p>



<p>Among them, Setsuna is the closest friend in our class… If it were her, I think she wouldn’t just walk away even if I confided my darker thoughts. On the contrary, I can foresee her scolding me for not telling her sooner.</p>



<p>(Towa-kun and I, Aisaka-kun, Mari-chan, Setsuna-chan, and Somiya-kun… Besides Towa-kun and me, there are many people whose futures I’m concerned about.)</p>




<p>Of course, I’m also concerned about Iori-senpai, who cares about Shu-kun and him…</p>



<p>“Well, it’s about time we saw the summer vacation approaching… Can I say this every day from now on? Don’t go too far, keep your behavior as a student within the limits of common sense!”</p>



<p>“I’ll burst with excitement!”</p>



<p>“You’re the type who causes the most trouble! Please, take better care of the teacher’s stomach, okay!?”</p>



<p>Laughter filled the classroom with the teacher’s banter and the classmates’ responses.</p>



<p>I relaxed my mouth a bit and glanced at Towa-kun, who was also smiling. With that beloved smile of his, the smile I always want to see… Right, Towa-kun?</p>



<p>You said you want to keep smiling at me forever, and you also said you want me to be happy… It’s not about one or the other being happy, but both of us being happy together.</p>



<p>“… Ufufu, I really need to be careful. When I think about that, my cheeks naturally loosen up and it becomes quite difficult.”</p>



<p>I’m sure that smile is beyond what it was just now.</p>




<p>(Ehehe, that cute smile that I’ve been holding on to will surely change into an awkward “Fuhehe” kind of smile. No, rather, it might have already turned into that… Ah, so that’s why I felt a fleeting gaze that seemed to include astonishment?)</p>



<p>(…Fue, I mustn’t let myself be laughed at as Towa-kun’s girlfriend!)</p>



<p>With renewed determination, I focused once again on the teacher’s words. After the morning assembly, during break time, Setsuna-chan didn’t bring it up, so I felt relieved. However, during lunch break while eating with Setsuna-chan, she bluntly pointed it out.</p>



<p>“Hey, Ayana? I couldn’t see your face directly, but you had quite a serious expression during the teacher’s talk, didn’t you?”</p>



<p>“… What are you talking about?”</p>



<p>“During the teacher’s talk, you were thinking about Yukishiro, right?”</p>



<p>“How did you know!?”</p>



<p>I was utterly astonished! This is shocking, absolutely shocking! It can be explained that I understand what Towa-kun is thinking… But for Setsuna-chan to know that much? That’s just unbelievable… Uhm, how could this be?</p>



<p>“Just how much do you think I know about Ayana’s friends? Sure, even I’m scared of how I know, but that’s just because we’re always together.”</p>




<p>“… Is that so?”</p>



<p>“That’s how it is.”</p>



<p>Hmm… But while I can understand Setsuna-chan’s back and her expressions to some extent, I certainly can’t read her mind. Of course, I won’t say this aloud because it might upset Setsuna-chan.</p>



<p>“Surely even Yukishiro wouldn’t understand this?”</p>



<p>“… Towa-kun would surely understand.”</p>



<p>With a slightly pointed lip, I said that.</p>



<p>Setsuna-chan chuckled lightly, “I see, I see…” Wait, actually, there’s something I’ve been curious about since earlier—Setsuna-chan seems fidgety or like she wants to ask something?</p>



<p>“Setsuna-chan, is there something you want to ask me?”</p>



<p>“H-how…”</p>




<p>“Oya, now the tables have turned… Let’s sniff out more.”</p>



<p>“… Hey, Ayana? Since you started dating Yukishiro, have your words and actions changed?”</p>



<p>Right now, I don’t care about that at all, so let me ask you.</p>



<p>“There’s no need for deception. What about it?”</p>



<p>“… Ayana, you really notice everything about me.”</p>



<p>“Well, I can tell just by looking at your expressions.”</p>



<p>Since she keeps glancing nervously, anyone close to her, not just me, would notice.</p>



<p>Setsuna-chan sighed with resignation and said to come to the hallway. I stood up to follow Setsuna-chan, and just then, Towa-kun appeared right in front of us.</p>



<p>“Ah…”</p>




<p>“Oops.”</p>



<p>With a soft sound, I was pulled into Towa-kun’s chest. Unlike me, a woman, his chest was firm and robust… Conversely, Towa-kun loves my very soft ch*st, so I guess we complement each other after all!</p>



<p>“Towa-kun…”</p>



<p>“Sorry. If it were someone else, I wouldn’t have done this, but I recognized you immediately, Ayana.”</p>



<p>“No, it’s okay♪”</p>



<p>Ahh… Towa-kun truly is my prince charming. Even though there are so many eyes at school, especially in the classroom, I feel his love completely… Oh, right, I was talking about Setsuna-chan!</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, Towa-kun. I want to stay like this with you for a long time, but I have an important conversation with Setsuna-chan.”</p>



<p>“With Todo-san? Understood, have a good talk.”</p>



<p>“Thank you, I’ll be back♪”</p>




<p>With an air of deep reluctance to part ways, I head towards Setsuna-chan, who continues to send exasperated glances at our recent exchange.</p>



<p>“You’re really something… Well, whatever.”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, Setsuna-chan. So, what did you want to talk about?”</p>



<p>Though the hallway outside the classroom is bustling with students coming and going, there are very few who bother to look this way, and no one seems to care about our conversation’s contents.</p>



<p>Glancing around discreetly, Setsuna-chan cautiously broaches her question.</p>



<p>“Well… it’s still way too early for me, but…”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“I was wondering… how do you become like Ayana and Yukishiro, where you can trust each other completely?”</p>



<p>“I see… I understand.”</p>




<p>“I hope I am not prying too deeply into this… Oh, and if we were to start dating, I’d like some advice on what to watch out for…”</p>



<p>Ah, I see… I’m not so clueless as to not understand what this means, and I can tell exactly who she’s blushing and asking about.</p>



<p>After catching a glimpse of Somiya-kun chatting away with friends in the classroom, I began speaking almost as if to remind myself.</p>



<p>“Between Towa-kun and me, there’s a deep trust. If I start talking about this, it won’t stop for an hour. So, I’ll leave that for later. Besides, even if the lunch break time is extended significantly, I’m confident I won’t stop, even if the teacher stops me.”</p>



<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>



<p>I nodded naturally and continued, with Towa-kun in my mind.</p>



<p>“Setsuna-chan mentioned something like that, so I’ll put it into words. I trust Towa-kun deeply… and he trusts me.”</p>



<p>“Trust…”</p>



<p>Well, this is something not just for us, but for many couples… and ultimately, even for married couples, I think it’s a commonality—to build a long-lasting relationship, trust is necessary to understand and love each other more.</p>




<p>“We both strive to have a relationship where we trust each other firmly. If you’re wondering what you should do, I’d say, first and foremost, never engage in actions that could lead to misunderstandings.”</p>



<p>“Misunderstandings?”</p>



<p>“Yes. Small misunderstandings and suspicions can often lead to major rifts in relationships. So I absolutely avoid such actions… For example, not getting too close with other men besides your boyfriend, or not going out alone together… things like that, you know?”</p>



<p>“I see…”</p>



<p>“Well, how close you should be with others depends, but… I really don’t want misunderstandings to linger and cool off our relationship.”</p>



<p>“… I don’t have a boyfriend yet, so I don’t understand, but I definitely don’t want to do things that could lead to misunderstandings.”</p>



<p>Right… Beyond the relationship of friends, men and women evolve into romantic relationships because they want to become closer. Although such relationships are deeper than friendships, they are also fragile and can easily shatter due to trivial misunderstandings… I once tried to break that connection.</p>



<p>“There’s no way… he… would do such a thing… It’s natural to imagine the worst-case ‘what if’ scenarios when you think like that. That’s why I don’t want Towa-kun to feel that way… just thinking about it changes a lot of things.”</p>



<p>“… I see.”</p>




<p>Since this is specifically about Towa-kun and me, I can’t guarantee how others would think about it, but personally, I think it’s a very good mindset.</p>



<p>“And of course! Towa-kun also…”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it about both thinking of each other first? I don’t need you to tell me that. Just watching Yukishiro normally makes me understand.”</p>



<p>“Muu… I wanted say that!”</p>



<p>Damn you, Setsuna-chan… I was so ready to say it all boldly!</p>



<p>“A boyfriend… huh. It’s not like I admire it, but there’s someone I enjoy being with… well, maybe eventually.”</p>



<p>“Good luck. If there’s anything, I’ll support you.”</p>



<p>“Thanks.”</p>



<p>Setsuna-chan blushes and feels embarrassed, and I smile at her and continue speaking.</p>




<p>“Well… even though this is a ‘yeah, yeah, I get it’ situation, it doesn’t hurt to say it. Setsuna-chan…”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>Feeling my serious tone, she also tightens her expression a bit.</p>



<p>“This isn’t something that happens all the time, but there are people out there who try to ruin others’ happiness. They intervene just because they like that girl or that guy. So even if you see something unbelievable, first talk to the person and confirm. Then judge the situation and act… I think that’s important.”</p>



<p>“Ayana… yeah, you’re right. In the end, it’s our own relationship, so I don’t want it influenced by others… If I were to have a boyfriend, I’d trust him completely.”</p>



<p>“Fufu, that’s the spirit.”</p>



<p>Who could she be referring to? I’ll refrain from teasing her to find out.</p>



<p>(However… yes.)</p>



<p>There are plenty of dangerous people like I described in the world. In fact, I once did something similar… I tried to shatter the bonds that Shu-kun had with other girls. I don’t mean to make light of it, but I’m already moving forward, with Towa-kun.</p>




<p>“Lunch break… It’s fifteen minutes left. Feels like we’ve talked a lot already.”</p>



<p>“Indeed… Oh, I have a little more I wanted to ask…”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“Uh… well, um… that… you know…”</p>



<p>“??”</p>



<p>Oya? This shyness is new… or rather, maybe I’ve never seen this side of her in our interactions. What on earth does Setsuna-chan want to ask me?</p>



<p>She’s an important friend to me, and I’m glad she trusts me enough to consult with me… so I want to answer her as best as I can.</p>



<p>“…You can ask me anything, okay?”</p>



<p>“Okay…”</p>




<p>With more nervous glances than before, Setsuna-chan finally opens her mouth.</p>



<p>The question she asks is indeed something that would make anyone feel embarrassed to hear.</p>



<p>“…What does it feel like to be physically intimate…?”</p>



<p>The moment Setsuna-chan voiced her question, I almost burst out laughing, but I composed myself and decided to answer responsibly.</p>



<p>“S*x, you mean?”</p>



<p>“Are you going to answer so straightforwardly!?”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s not necessarily a shameful word… although it might be for some people. Anyway, it’s just a technical term, right?”</p>



<p>“I get it… I get it, you idiot! Seriously, Ayana, ever since you started dating Yukishiro, you’ve become too bold!”</p>



<p>What is this girl saying… It’s not like I just started being bold now.</p>




<p>But this is quite a curious scene.</p>



<p>I may not have a flashy appearance like Setsuna-chan, but considering this topic is about intimate matters, Setsuna-chan, who seems more accustomed to such discussions than me, is surprisingly embarrassed.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry for being so straightforward. But this is something I shouldn’t comment on. It’s a delicate issue and it also involves Towa-kun!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right. I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>“But…”</p>



<p>I decided to convey a bit about what it feels like in such situations, albeit discreetly, whispering in her ear since it’s not something I can discuss openly in public. Setsuna-chan’s face turned as red as a boiled octopus and she quickly pulled away.</p>



<p>“… Ayana, you look so pure and elegant, yet you’re like that?”</p>



<p>“I don’t think of myself as pure and elegant, but it’s nice when the person you love desires you. Of course, I desire him too.♪”</p>



<p>“Oh…”</p>




<p>I winked as I said this, and Setsuna-chan clapped her hands in response.</p>



<p>Since we had already talked quite a bit and lunch break was almost over, I was about to head back to class with Setsuna-chan when she suddenly asked one last question.</p>



<p>“By the way, following up on what we talked about earlier, what would you do if another girl tried to steal Yukishiro away from you?”</p>



<p>“I’ll kill her.”</p>



<p>…Oops, that just slipped out reflexively. I need to reflect on that.</p>



<p>“Are you kidding?”</p>



<p>“Of course it’s a joke.”</p>



<p>“R-right… It’s a joke, I’m glad.”</p>



<p>Hey Setsuna-chan, why are you so relieved?</p>




<p>Even though I once harbored hatred in the past, it’s absurd to think I would actually do something like that.</p>



<p>“…But your eyes looked serious.”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“Never mind!!”</p>



<p>That was rude of me; please don’t look at me like that.</p>



<p>After our extensive conversation, we barely made it back to class on time.</p>



<p>“…Thank you, Ayana.”</p>



<p>“I’m honored if I could help.”</p>



<p>Starting with serious talk, then a bit of a risqué topic in the middle, and ending with another serious discussion, I hope it was helpful for Setsuna-chan.</p>




<p>And so, Setsuna-chan’s little consultation session came to an end.</p>



<p>And the next day after school, the moment arrived when I, along with Towa-kun, would be interviewed by Bundou-senpai from the newspaper club.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>[Towa-PoV]</p>



<p>“Well, the time has finally come!”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>“Hey Towa-kun, aren’t you being a bit too loud?”</p>



<p>Come on, Ayana, you didn’t have to say it so bluntly.</p>



<p>(Well, but… she’s right. It is quite noisy. I vaguely remember suggesting earlier that it might be better if there weren’t so many people around?)</p>



<p>I thought that, and I’m pretty sure I wasn’t wrong.</p>




<p>However… as I faced Bundou-senpai, I felt an incredible journalistic spirit emanating from him.</p>



<p>“I apologize for being noisy, but that’s just how it is. Well then, let’s get started with the interview right away!”</p>



<p>And so, the interview with Bundou-senpai began.</p>



<p>While I was nervous about what kind of interview it would be, Ayana seemed incredibly excited since the morning, and now it was fully on display.</p>



<p>“First off, how do you feel about Yukishiro-kun, Otonashi-san?”</p>



<p>“He’s my beloved. My prince. The person I absolutely never want to be apart from. If possible, I’d want to marry him right away. Since Towa-kun is so cool, I want to keep him away from other women’s eyes, locked up where they can’t see him.”</p>



<p>“L-lock him up…?”</p>



<p>“I’m just kidding~”</p>



<p>Bundou-senpai diligently wrote down all of Ayana’s passionate responses in his notepad.</p>




<p>As for the phrase “lock him up,” it was a bit concerning, but I decided to let it pass. Both Ayana, who was speaking passionately without taking a breath, and Bundou-senpai, who was writing so quickly that you couldn’t even see his face… Wait, aren’t these two kind of scary?</p>



<p>“In other words, you really love Yukishiro-kun that much. I’ve heard couples say they love each other several times during interviews before. But Otonashi-san’s words make me feel that more deeply than any couple I’ve interviewed before.”</p>



<p>“Of course. Because it’s me and Towa-kun!”</p>



<p>“Haha! I was right to watch you two when you started dating! It might seem like I’m praising you too much, but I guess it’s just because I want to see this!”</p>



<p>Geez, they’ve just been talking non-stop since earlier.</p>



<p>Well, even though Ayana is showing off about how much she’s affectionate for me, it’s nice just to see her having so much fun. That alone makes me happy.</p>



<p>“We’d love to have a photo taken of you, Yukishiro-kun gently watching over Otonashi-san as she talks with such enthusiasm… How about it?”</p>



<p>“I’m fine with it.”</p>



<p>“Me too, it’s fine.”</p>




<p>But still, being in this situation is somehow stimulating memories from my past life.</p>



<p>At the very least, she wasn’t around in my past life, and even if she had been, we probably wouldn’t have had this kind of interaction… Besides, I don’t think I would have come across someone like Bundou-senpai, either.</p>



<p>(…What’s going on?)</p>



<p>I tilted my head, lost in thought for a moment.</p>



<p>Thinking about what my past life was like like this, I wonder why I’m so concerned about it now, even though Ayana is right next to me and we’re being interviewed by Bundou-senpai.</p>



<p>(…I’ve already decided to live as Towa. I’ve come up with my own answers, fallen in love with Ayana on my own… and I’m living for what I want. So why is my past life suddenly flashing back?)</p>



<p>Though I say “flashing back,” it’s not like various scenes are rushing through my mind… I wonder what it is, I can’t quite put it into words.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, smile a bit more!”</p>



<p>“Oh, sorry!”</p>




<p>Seems like I got too lost in thought.</p>



<p>Since we’re taking photos to be featured in the newspaper with Ayana, I can’t afford to have a gloomy face. A photo like that would be beyond unacceptable.</p>



<p>“You two look great… Wonderful!”</p>



<p><em>Click, click,</em> the sound of the camera shutter went off repeatedly as they took several photos.</p>



<p>It’s like Bundou-senpai is so good at lifting the mood that he made us feel like we were models, and both Ayana and I couldn’t stop smiling.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, could you put your arm around me?”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>In response to Ayana’s request, I put my arm around her shoulders. It seemed to be a decisive moment that struck a chord with Bundou-senpai’s heart, and thus the photo shoot concluded with this final shot.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun…”</p>




<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry… I’ve been holding it in for so long.”</p>



<p>“…Ah, I see. Go ahead.”</p>



<p>Ayana immediately said she would be right back and left the classroom.</p>



<p>“What’s going on?”</p>



<p>“You should figure it out, Senpai.”</p>



<p>He still didn’t seem to understand, so when I told him she went to the restroom, he bowed deeply in apology. He asked me not to ask the person directly, with a wry smile.</p>



<p>“…I guess I’m bad at figuring things out in situations like this.”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s not something you should worry too much about.”</p>




<p>“Do you eventually learn to understand these things when you have a girlfriend?”</p>



<p>“It depends on the person, I guess? In my case, it might also be because I’ve been with Ayana for a long time.”</p>



<p>Sometimes you might need to explicitly say you need to use the restroom, and it depends on whether you can understand the other person’s intentions.</p>



<p>“Anyway, today was really meaningful. Otonashi-san’s energy was so high, I couldn’t help but focus on her.”</p>



<p>“I’m glad Ayana seemed to have fun too.”</p>



<p>“I see, I see! Well then, let me ask you one more thing… How do you usually feel about Otonashi-san, Yukishiro-kun?”</p>



<p>“She’s someone precious to me, someone I want to be with.”</p>



<p>“Umu! I’ll use those exact words!”</p>



<p>…Well, it might still be a bit embarrassing after all.</p>




<p>After Ayana came back and we parted ways with Bundou-senpai, we had no more business here, so we started heading home… However, on the way, Ayana said she had somewhere she wanted to go and took my hand.</p>



<p>We headed to the park… It’s a place familiar and full of memories for both Ayana and me.</p>



<p>“Why here?”</p>



<p>“Well… I don’t know, really. I just felt like being here with Towa-kun, being lovey-dovey.”</p>



<p>“Let’s go to that shaded spot.”</p>



<p>Ayana suggested.</p>



<p>Two people, a couple, under the shade of a tree…? It’s not like nothing is going to happen… Why am I thinking about this? Maybe I’m a little tired.</p>



<p>Or maybe it’s because of the interaction with Bundou-senpai earlier, or the unfamiliar photo shoot, that I’m tired is to be expected.</p>



<p>“Ei!”</p>




<p>“Oops.”</p>



<p>With a cute shout, Ayana hugged me tightly.</p>



<p>Ayana not only buried her face in my chest but also entwined her legs and pressed her body against mine.</p>



<p>It’s like a scene you often see in a slightly risqué manga, but it does make my heart race. I do want to touch Ayana more, but more than that, being like this provides such healing that it blows away all the fatigue of the day.</p>



<p>“It’s not too late yet, and you can hear the children’s voices, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah… we’re bad high school students.”</p>



<p>“That’s right. Both I and Towa-kun are bad high school students♪”</p>



<p>It’s still before five o’clock, so there are children playing in the park. There are also mothers accompanying them, and even elderly couples taking a stroll… Amidst all this, we’re here under the shade of a tree.</p>



<p>“Today’s interview was really refreshing. It’s the first time I’ve heard someone who just met talk so openly about our love for Towa-kun.”</p>




<p>“That just shows how much Bundou-senpai can be trusted, right?”</p>



<p>“Because he interviewed with pure intentions. Besides, those loud types aren’t bad people… Look, they’re the kind who’d get caught immediately if they tried anything wrong.”</p>



<p>“Ah… I can totally imagine that scene.”</p>



<p>Easily picturing it, I burst out laughing. Ayana chuckled and leaned in closer, as if reaching out to touch me. I responded by bringing my face closer… It was a cute kiss, just touching.</p>



<p>Touching and pulling away, touching and pulling away several times… Ayana pressed against me, radiating warmth and softness, and said,</p>



<p>“Cuddling in the shade of the trees is really exciting♪”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Ayana’s smiling face… No, not just a smile, but a face that seeks me deeply.</p>



<p>The sounds around us seemed to fade into the distance… I couldn’t see anyone but Ayana, wanting to love her with all my heart—it felt like I was under the charm of a succubus from a manga or something.</p>




<p>…Well, not that I’ve ever been under any charm.</p>



<p>(Come to think of it… Ah, I see.)</p>



<p>Now that I think about it, this spot in the park is where Shu caught Towa and Ayana in the act in the game.</p>



<p>In a sense, it’s a place swirling with various memories and fate.</p>



<p>After continuing to kiss until Ayana was satisfied… I couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed in myself—enjoying the thrill of being seen, even though we couldn’t afford to be seen.</p>



<p>“Fufu♪ I was so nervous about being seen. At first, it was just a kiss, but by the end, it was a deep one♪”</p>



<p>Wiping the saliva that dripped from my chin with my fingers, licking it off, Ayana said.</p>



<p>To be honest, I thought we did well to hold back at that spot, but that’s also our perseverance… just saying.</p>



<p>“Well then, Ayana, I’ll walk you home—”</p>




<p>Rather than hiding anymore… no, even if it’s not hiding, I felt like I couldn’t resist being with Ayana any longer.</p>



<p>“Ayana…?”</p>



<p>However, Ayana hugged me tightly without replying.</p>



<p>Whether she was reluctant to part, or she wanted to draw out those words to continue… Seeing Ayana like this, it seemed like her feelings were different.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun… I don’t know why.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“…I’m anxious.”</p>



<p>“Anxious?”</p>



<p>Ayana nodded, telling me why she felt that way.</p>




<p>“I’m not sure… but suddenly, I just started thinking. That Towa-kun might go far away… That kind of anxiety overwhelmed me.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>Being asked this by Ayana isn’t the first time.</p>



<p>Because she herself has been carrying a burden for so long, she might be thinking this way now, when her daily life is so happy and overflowing.</p>



<p>With the earnest desire to reassure Ayana, I hugged her tighter, brought my face close to her ear, and whispered.</p>



<p>“Look, no matter what happens, I won’t leave you—I understand feeling anxious because there’s no reason to feel anxious, right? You’re afraid that a grim reaper who brings misfortune is lurking behind you, making you scared to wash your hair in the bath.”</p>



<p>“………… Fufu, what’s with that?”</p>



<p>Well, if I actually saw something supernatural, that’s how it would be, right?</p>



<p>But Ayana chuckled, so maybe this joke wasn’t so bad… But honestly, mirrors in the bathroom after seeing something scary are really scary.</p>




<p>“I’ll never leave you. Actually, I don’t want to leave… So, yeah… If Ayana ever feels anxious, just call my name. If you do that, I’ll definitely respond.”</p>



<p>“…Yes!”</p>



<p>Ayana’s adorable smile dispels my anxieties… and it gives me courage that I can do anything for her sake.<br />In other words, no matter what happens, I can rush to her side… that’s what I believe.</p>



<p>“Well, but…”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“I think both of us, including you, Ayana, should show a little more restraint in public.”</p>



<p>“But… we’re at an age where we can’t help it!”</p>



<p>It was obvious from my wry smile that I was suggesting we should try to restrain ourselves.</p>



<p>“Ayana, and Towa-kun too. Please maintain some decorum when you’re outside, okay?”</p>




<p>“……Yes.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>When I escorted Ayana home, Seina-san, who came out to greet us, said a few words. Ayana and I both blushed, wondering how she knew, and we resolved to be more careful outside.</p>



<p>As I was about to leave the scene, Ayana began arguing with Seina-san.</p>



<p>“Mom, you shouldn’t be pointing these things out at a time like this!”</p>



<p>“Well, as an adult, there are things that should be pointed out.”</p>



<p>“Come on, Mom, show some consideration!”</p>



<p>“That’s impossible. Because it’s funny… oh, the truth is out!”</p>



<p>“Ughhh!!”</p>




<p>Knowing them from before, I couldn’t help but be curious about the expressions they were making as they argued, but I couldn’t afford to be any later… although I really wanted to see it!</p>



<p>Afterward, without any further detours, I returned home, where Mom had arrived before me.</p>



<p>“Welcome back, Towa.”</p>



<p>“I’m home.”</p>



<p>I heard that she had come back about ten minutes earlier and was waiting while cleaning in front of the entrance, thinking I might come back soon with Ayana.</p>



<p>“You were with Ayana, so I thought you might be home later, right?”</p>



<p>“Fufun! Don’t underestimate my intuition. I see through everything!”</p>



<p>“……I see.”</p>



<p>Well, Mom’s intuition is quite sharp… no, I shouldn’t go there.</p>




<p>“Towa.”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Thank you for coming home with a smile today too. Just seeing you like that makes all my fatigue disappear.”</p>



<p>“……Mom.”</p>



<p>“And it also makes me want to drink a lot!”</p>



<p>That’s clearly not the real reason, right…?</p>



<p>After a touching story, this… but it’s Mom, so I can’t say anything bad or think badly of it.</p>



<p>Wait a minute?</p>



<p>Is it okay to occasionally stir up Mom, who disrupts the situation like this?</p>




<p>“……Alright.”</p>



<p>“Towa? What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>I tilt my head, wrap my arms around Mom’s back, and whisper as I hug her tightly.</p>



<p>“Mom… Thank you so much always. I really love you, Mom.”</p>



<p>Even though I said I would stir things up, it was also gentle in this direction.</p>



<p>Words of gratitude for the family are never a loss, and there was also such a word from the usual gratitude to Mom.</p>



<p>“T…..Towa!”</p>



<p>“Ah”</p>



<p>T-That’s right!</p>




<p>Mom is very lively and cool, and she’s a reliable, but she’s a lot of my fragile tears</p>



<p>Without realizing my intentions, Mom was deeply moved… to the point where she clung to me, tears streaming down her face.</p>



<p>“…Mom, can you stop crying soon?”</p>



<p>“Noooo! I want to stay like this with Towa more!”</p>



<p>“Are you a child…?”</p>



<p>“Bapuuu!”</p>



<p>“You’re just like a baby now.”</p>



<p>I can’t let the neighbors see this…</p>



<p>In the end, I stayed like that until Mom stopped crying, but it made me think again about feeling the warmth of a mother.</p>




<p>(It’s not just Ayana… There are important things in this world, people who shouldn’t be made anxious.)</p>



<p>It’s not just a lover… It’s the same for a mother.</p>



<p>There are many people who should be protected, who I want to be close to, who I don’t want to make anxious. That’s not a bad thing, right?</p>



<p>That’s why I think that living where I am now is so important to me.</p>



<p>“Towa, I’m happy to be your mother.”</p>



<p>“…Yeah.”</p>



<p>Haa… What should I do if Mom keeps touching me like this?</p>



<p>After this kind of exchange, during dinner and the time we spent together, Mom kept smiling happily.</p>



<p>I guess… I have to keep protecting this, right?</p>




<p>That’s what I vowed to myself, asking myself this question.</p>
