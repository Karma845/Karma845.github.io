<h2>Chapter 2: I Hope You Understand</h2>

<p>“Hot…”</p>
<p>To think it would be this hot from the morning.</p>
<p>The fierce heat from the blazing sun made me grimace. For it to be this hot at the beginning of June, this year the signs of summer are showing up unusually early.</p>
<p>But, well, I’m just a spectator, so I’ve got it easy. I shouldn’t be too luxurious to complain.</p>
<p>Beyond the fence, girls clad in their school’s uniform tennis attire are energetically exchanging volleys on the court.</p>
<p>This place is a large comprehensive park on the outskirts of the city. With its abundance of tennis courts, it’s often used for tournaments.</p>
<p>In fact, today, tennis clubs from high schools around this area have gathered for an inter-school competition.</p>
<p>…It feels like I’m getting glanced at from all around. Is it just me, or is it not?</p>
<p>Both boys and girls are playing matches, but the area I’m standing in is designated for the girls’ courts. Since most of the spectators here are girls too, I definitely stand out.</p>
<p>Someone’s boyfriend? I hear that phrase. It would be a nuisance for them if they thought that, making me feel a bit guilty.</p>
<p>I guess I’ll have to apologize later.</p>
<p>Thinking of the person in question, I let out a sigh.</p>
<p>Then, as if on cue, she appeared on the court.</p>
<p>“Suika, sorry, but I need your help! It’s terrible to ask you at a time like this,”</p>
<p>“It really turned out that way…”</p>
<p>“We would have been fine if we could win… Sorry!”</p>
<p>“No worries, I came here to fight! I’m fired up, leave it to me!”</p>
<p>The girls around her spoke with apologetic voices, but Suika—gave them a brisk thumbs-up. Despite being my childhood friend, I can’t help but think she’s incredibly cool.</p>
<p>Today, I came to support Suika, who apparently was asked to be a reinforcement for the tennis club.</p>
<p>But she’s really been thrown into an incredible situation.</p>
<p>This tournament pits schools against each other in three singles matches and two doubles matches to decide the winner, and currently, each side has won two matches each.</p>
<p>What remains is a showdown between the aces of each school in singles. The school of the winning player will be declared the victor.</p>
<p>“Hey, is the ace from Itozumi High School usually that person?”</p>
<p>“No, that person is a temporary member. The real ace seems to have been injured.”</p>
<p>The girls spectating next to me on my left are having such a conversation.</p>
<p>“Eh! A temporary member…? That’s just for making up numbers, right? Then it’s already a lost game!”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I came to watch thinking it would be exciting since it’s a rivalry match, but maybe we’ll just take a look and leave.”</p>
<p>Probably, you girls will end up watching till the end—I thought, but of course, I didn’t say it out loud.</p>
<p>Hang in there, Suika.</p>
<p>Sending her a silent cheer, I watched as Suika then turned around and noticed me. Her eyes widened as much as possible upon spotting me.</p>
<p>“Kuuya!? Eeeeeh, what are you doing here!? Why are you here!?”</p>
<p>Surprised, Suika rushed toward the fence.</p>
<p>“Why? I’m here to support you. You mentioned you had a match today, right?”</p>
<p>“I did say that! But I didn’t hear that Kuuya would come to watch! Geez!”</p>
<p>She comically expressed her annoyance, as if to say, ‘You should have told me!’</p>
<p>“…Ah! But, wait!”</p>
<p>However, she suddenly looked up at the sky, checked the harshness of the sunlight, and immediately switched to a serious expression.</p>
<p>“Kuuya, are you okay…!? It’s really hot today…”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, I’m fine, thanks for worrying.”</p>
<p>“Really…? But, the sun is strong, and…”</p>
<p>“Suika, it’s your match, I’ll get energy from watching it.”</p>
<p>Cutting her off, I somewhat forcefully conveyed that. Actually, I’ve been really looking forward to it. I hadn’t had a chance to watch Suika’s matches recently because of bad timing.</p>
<p>“Kind of refreshing, you know. Watching Suika do well, I feel proud, somehow. It’s my enjoyment.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Suika stared at me intently for a few seconds, then leaned closer. Though she was on the other side of the fence and slightly lower, her neat face came close.</p>
<p>Then, in a voice so quiet that no one else could hear, she stated clearly.</p>
<p>“…Thank you, I’m happy. I will win.”</p>
<p>It was a tone so startling, somewhat different from usual. A mix of whispering secrecy and submissive vow seemed to sweetly blend together.</p>
<p>“──Su ”</p>
<p>“All right! Then make sure you watch closely~~!!”</p>
<p>Before I could say anything, Suika quickly distanced herself. With her usual, big smile visible from a hundred meters away, she waved her hand vigorously before running off to her opponent.</p>
<p>The usual Suika.</p>
<p>“They really are a couple, huh…!”</p>
<p>“Right…!”</p>
<p>I heard such voices from next to me. It seems I’ve caused a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Anyway, it looks like the match is about to start.</p>
<p>…Though I told Suika I was fine, it really is hot.</p>
<p>Despite it being early June, I hadn’t expected it to be this hot. Perhaps it’s one of the anomalies of climate change.</p>
<p>I tried looking up “heatstroke prevention” and “how to cure heatstroke” on my smartphone, but couldn’t really find any knowledge that would be immediately useful here.</p>
<p>As I was doing so, the match began.</p>
<p>Suika’s opponent was a tall player who serves high-speed balls with a smash-like motion from a high hitting point.</p>
<p>“Nice serve!”</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s keep this up!”</p>
<p>“Senior, fight!”</p>
<p>The opponent’s supporters are getting excited, and understandably so, as the initial development is quite one-sided.</p>
<p>Unable to even swing her racket, Suika merely watches the ball go by.</p>
<p>In no time, three consecutive points were taken.</p>
<p>“Is she a beginner?”</p>
<p>“Poor thing.”</p>
<p>“Who would call someone just to fill numbers?”</p>
<p>The surrounding gallery had already sensed the outcome of the match early on.</p>
<p>“Uh-huh, I see.”</p>
<p>But such an atmosphere didn’t bother her at all.</p>
<p>Suika muttered softly, holding her racket and waiting for the next serve from her opponent.</p>
<p>“Ha… Hmph!”</p>
<p>The opposing player, with incredible consistency, launched an almost invisible serve with a shout.</p>
<p>But she,</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>The next moment, she let out a surprised voice, staring in disbelief.</p>
<p>Gashaan, the fence behind her shook and screamed. Following that, the sound of the ball hitting and bouncing. In the silent venue, it echoed well.</p>
<p>After a beat, Itozumi High School—Suika’s side—exploded.</p>
<p>“Yesss, Suika, nice return!!”</p>
<p>“Good job, nice!”</p>
<p>“Go for it, show them what you’ve got!!”</p>
<p>Having brilliantly returned the high-speed serve, Suika, amidst her teammates’ cheers, moved to her next return position with a vigilant expression.</p>
<p>From that point on, it was Suika’s time.</p>
<p>“Can’t be!”</p>
<p>“Who is she!?”</p>
<p>“Itozumi’s secret weapon!?”</p>
<p>The opposing high school’s members and players from other schools watching the match began to express their astonishment in succession.</p>


<p>With a sharp exhale, Suika returns every high-speed serve that comes her way.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if her opponent manages to barely return the ball, Suika mercilessly delivers the finishing blow in the next move.</p>
<p>Despite being on the supposedly disadvantageous return side, she ended up winning the first game.</p>
<p>Now it was Suika’s turn to serve.</p>
<p>Given her petite stature, serving should have been difficult for Suika…</p>
<p>“…Hah!”</p>
<p>“Nice serve!”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay!”</p>
<p>“Let’s score another one!”</p>
<p>Suika compensates for her height with an unusually high jump and precise racket handling, delivering strong and fast serves.</p>
<p>“Wow, such a high jump…”</p>
<p>“Whoa, nice shot!”</p>
<p>“And she’s fast too! Like, she’s so cool!”</p>
<p>The murmur in the venue gradually turns into cheering.</p>
<p>…She’s really amazing.</p>
<p>Though it might be presumptuous, the praise for her felt as if it were for me as well.</p>
<p>The reason Suika, who isn’t a part of the tennis club, is so strong, is not only due to her basic physical abilities but also because she is exceptionally skilled at “moving her body exactly how she wants.” This ability is the fruit of her efforts, honed from being drilled in various martial arts from a young age as the successor of the Ado family tradition.</p>
<p>Having closely watched her efforts as a childhood friend, seeing her bloom in the sunlight is always a joy.</p>
<p>“Damn!”</p>
<p>The opponent player lets out a pained voice.</p>
<p>However, as expected from an ace of her team, she plays her cards of experience, utilizing a wide variety of shots and clever tactics, seeing that she’s at a physical disadvantage. Suika, despite her efforts, couldn’t match up to that.</p>
<p>As a result, the situation became evenly matched. A clash of power and technique, the back-and-forth battle hinted at a drawn-out match.</p>
<p>I want to keep watching.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>…Damn, am I feeling dizzy?</p>
<p>“Ugh, damn, seriously…”</p>
<p>As noon approaches, the scorching sun only intensifies. I wore a hat, but it’s not just the sunlight; the temperature is also harsh.</p>
<p>I don’t want to say that I’m feeling sick from the heat while Suika and the others are fighting on the court, but sadly, that’s the reality.</p>
<p>It’s not like I’m sleep-deprived, but this condition is just embarrassing.</p>
<p>However, I’m determined to see this match through. Afterwards, I’ll try to move without causing Suika worry and somehow make my way home, even if I have to rest intermittently.</p>
<p>That’s when I decided in my heart…</p>
<p>“Overheating should be avoided, whether you’re a mass of semiconductors or a lump of proteins.”</p>
<p>“Eh? Whoa!”</p>
<p>Something cold touches my neck. It’s a sports drink.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, standing next to me and offering it is…</p>
<p>“…Kujo-san!? Why are you here…”</p>
<p>“Is it a problem? Just take this, it’s a thank you for yesterday. You can drink it, but first, it’s good to cool down your neck. There are thick blood vessels there, so it’s effective.”</p>
<p>“Ah, thanks, I mean, it really helps…wow, that feels good…”</p>
<p>The drink must have been bought recently; it’s very cold. I was surprised at first, but following her advice and applying it to my neck again, it feels incredibly comforting.</p>
<p>“And here, salt tablets. Eat these. This is oral rehydration solution, better than sports drinks, perhaps. Chugging is not recommended.”</p>
<p>“Ah, um, then I’ll take that… no, wait, why?”</p>
<p>“…By the way, I also have a handheld fan, one I made myself a while ago. I wound the coil and built it from a motor myself. I don’t know how effective it is against heatstroke.”</p>
<p>“Wow, the wind is strong…”</p>
<p>With a woosh~, the wind from the handheld fan she’s holding is sent my way. The volume of air it produces is incomparably greater than that of commercially available ones, and it feels so good.</p>
<p>“Really, thank you so much, this is a lifesaver… Are you an angel…? …………Would you tell me why Kujo-san is here? It’s totally fine if you don’t want to say.”</p>
<p>“It’s obvious I just happened to pass by, I just happened to pass by. I’m not interested in sports and don’t have anyone to support, so I have nothing to do with what’s happening in this park. It’s just a coincidence.”</p>
<p>Her rapid-fire response was delivered with her usual cool expression.</p>
<p>Taking a beat, she continues in a calmer tone than before.</p>
<p>“These heatstroke prevention goods are, of course, for my own use. In this day and age, you can get heatstroke even at home, so it’s best to take precautions. I’m just doing the best I can. Do you understand, or do you have any questions?”</p>
<p>If she states it so crisply and clearly, I guess that’s how it is. It’s true that it’s probably a good idea to stock up on heatstroke prevention goods at home.</p>
<p>To have just happened across a tennis court in a comprehensive park on the outskirts of town, and moreover, to have come all the way inside, is a bit hard to imagine, but if she says so, then it must be true.</p>
<p>“No, I understand. I feel like I’m feeling a bit better now. Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>“It’s thanks for yesterday.”</p>
<p>“It’s just because we had fun playing games, it’s kind of embarrassing. But, this is a record. To think I would be talking with Kujo-san like this two days in a row.”</p>
<p>Until now, our interactions were limited to talking maybe once every ten days in class.</p>
<p>“It’s a coincidence, things just overlap. Miyashiro-kun, you came to see Ado-san, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you got it right. Wait, you know about Suika?”</p>
<p>It would be nearly impossible for a student at Izutsu Mina High School not to know Suika, but if there were any exceptions, I would have thought Kujo-san would be one of them.</p>
<p>“She comes to our classroom occasionally, to see you. You’re close, aren’t you? Even now, she keeps glancing over here.”</p>
<p>“Eh, really? Why would she do that during a match? Well, anyway, watch her. Suika is amazing. She’s going head to head with the incredibly skilled ace player of the opposing team, and… huh?”</p>
<p>There was a loud sound, and I saw Suika’s ball hit the net. It was a miss shot.</p>
<p>Hearing the score called by the referee, I realized that the match I thought was closely contested had gradually started to tilt in favor of the other side.</p>
<p>“Are we being pushed back? Seriously, why… No, no, no, no, it’s not ‘why’!”</p>
<p>I figure out the reason and instinctively press both hands to my head.</p>
<p>Earlier, Kujo-san mentioned that Suika keeps glancing over here. Then, there’s only one answer.</p>
<p>“It’s me…! She noticed I’m not feeling well…! Wow, I’m really sorry!”</p>
<p>Given Suika’s keen eye and observational skills, she could definitely notice from my paleness and the PET bottle I pressed against my neck. She must have become so worried about me that she couldn’t focus on the match.</p>
<p>It’s a self-conceited, idiotic idea, but considering how much care Suika shows me, it’s plausible.</p>
<p>“Suika, I’m feeling better now! Can you hear me?”</p>


<p>During a tennis match, the sides of the court on which players stand switch several times. Currently, Suika is not on our side but on the opposite. Amidst the cheers from both teams, it’s hard to get my voice to reach her.</p>
<p>“…Uh, there.”</p>
<p>Perhaps because I raised my voice, I felt dizzy again. I ended up leaning slightly toward Kujo-san, and she supported me by placing her hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Sorry, my bad…”</p>
<p>“…No. Miyashiro-kun, you shouldn’t overdo it. You’re not in your usual condition.”</p>
<p>“I know, but…ah.”</p>
<p>With a “pang,” Suika’s ball hits the net again. It was a shot from a not-so-difficult position. The usual Suika wouldn’t make such a mistake.</p>
<p>“Ah, Suika… really sorry… What should I do…? Should I go somewhere out of sight…?”</p>
<p>“Miyashiro-kun, if that’s the case, why don’t we… Kyaa!!”</p>
<p>“Kyaa?”</p>
<p>A sudden scream came from Kujo Kurenai, the cool beauty next to me. The cuteness of the scream, though it might be rude to say, was unexpected.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter? Oh, a bee?”</p>
<p>There was a bee in front of her.</p>
<p>“Kujo-san, be careful, because…”</p>
<p>“Wa, wawawawa… bee! Bee…!”</p>
<p>“Seriously?”</p>
<p>Kujo-san’s retreat, taking two, three steps back, lacked any trace of her usual mysterious composure.</p>
<p>“Bee, scary, scary… ah, kyaa!”</p>
<p>“Careful!”</p>
<p>Stepping on a small stone, she slipped and nearly fell backward.</p>
<p>In haste, I caught her just in time. I supported her body by wrapping my arms around her waist from behind.</p>
<p>Thin, warm, soft. And she smelled nice. I was close enough to notice all these things.</p>
<p>“…Sorry.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m glad I caught you in time.”</p>
<p>In my arms, her eyes widened, and her face flushed red from her neck to the tips of her ears.</p>
<p>Was it because she panicked seeing the bee, or because she nearly fell and got flustered?</p>
<p>Or maybe.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>I inadvertently focused and “saw” it. The mist that emanated from her body at this close distance was indeed the same color as her name.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Although we haven’t spoken much, as classmates, as friends sitting next to each other, I find Kujo-san appealing.</p>
<p>To be honest, the beauty of her that struck me on the day we first met is something I believe will remain unmatched for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Even so.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/00011.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

<p>…Ah.</p>
<p>My entire body cooled down at once. Sensation faded from my fingertips, and even my sense of reality became slightly distant.</p>
<p>The color before my eyes signifies love and affection. To me, it’s the most terrifying monster in this world.</p>
<p>“…? Um, …Miyashiro-kun?”</p>
<p>She calls out to me from within my arms, her voice tinged with confusion.</p>
<p>But, I can’t respond properly anymore. My stiffened body won’t move as I wish…</p>
<p>“Kyaa!”</p>
<p>“What’s that!?”</p>
<p>Gashaan! At that moment, the loudest noise of the day sounded nearby.</p>
<p>Startled, my body jumped, breaking free from the paralysis.</p>
<p>Turning to the source of the sound with Kujo-san, we saw a ball stuck in the fence right in front of us.</p>
<p>Not metaphorically. The ball was wedged into the wire mesh, hanging there without falling.</p>
<p>If there hadn’t been a fence, it would have passed right between Kujo-san and me.</p>
<p>“Sa, Service Ace… definitely the fastest serve of this match…”</p>
<p>“Or maybe, the fastest of the tournament…? With her small stature…?”</p>
<p>The girls next to us murmured in awe. Even I could tell from the collision’s sound and how the mesh was dented how fast that ball was flying.</p>
<p>“…Suika?”</p>
<p>It seems my childhood friend was the one who served that unbelievably fast ball. She didn’t strike a victory pose; instead, she remained motionless, her head down.</p>
<p>Eventually, she exhaled deeply and moved to the next service position, her gaze never meeting mine.</p>
<p>“Um, Miyashiro-kun…”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, …oh, sorry…!”</p>
<p>I had been holding onto Kujo-san, who almost fell, the entire time.</p>
<p>Thanks to the noise from Suika’s serve hitting the fence, my concentration broke, and now, I couldn’t “see” Kujo-san’s color.</p>
<p>After she stood up on her own, I finally let go. I felt like her touch lingered on my palms.</p>
<p>“Sorry for holding onto you for so long.”</p>
<p>“…No, thank you.”</p>
<p>“…The bee is gone now. It got scared off by the noise.”</p>
<p>“Good. I’m just a little scared of them. Just a little.”</p>
<p>“Just a little, huh?”</p>
<p>“…You’re mean.”</p>
<p>Kujo-san glared at me with a sulky look.</p>
<p>The sophisticated beauty who exuded an adult charm seemed, like a magic trick, to transform into a cute girl.</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry. Anyway, Suika is… wow.”</p>
<p>Inside the court, Suika’s play had drastically changed from earlier. Her steps were quicker, and each shot was more forceful.</p>
<p>She seemed determined to finish quickly. It was as if her drive was visible in her aggressive play.</p>
<p>Unable to withstand Suika’s fierce attacks, her opponent sent a weak lob. Suika, leaping so high it almost seemed like she was flying, smashed it down mercilessly.</p>
<p>The ball looked like it might burst…</p>
<p>This was going to be a win for her. Somehow, I just knew.</p>
<p>“Nice shot!”</p>
<p>“Go, Suika!”</p>
<p>“Finish it with the next point!”</p>
<p>Suika’s teammates cheered her on.</p>
<p>“She really is amazing, Ado-san.”</p>
<p>“Right? She’s incredibly hardworking.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Her family used to be a renowned warrior family, and Suika has been trained in various martial arts as the heir. Now, she’s called upon as a helper in various places, excelling in everything because of her efforts from the past.”</p>
<p>“The first thing you praise is her hard work.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s Suika’s best trait. I’ve always thought so, despite our long association.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>Kujo-san nodded, and then a strange silence fell between us.</p>
<p>She was the one to break it.</p>
<p>“By the way, how are you feeling?”</p>
<p>“Thanks to you, I’m feeling much better… Embarrassingly, you saw me at my worst.”</p>
<p>“…At school, there are days when you seem to be struggling. Like when we first met.”</p>
<p>“Was I? Maybe so.”</p>
<p>I don’t remember which days were bad since it’s almost a daily occurrence for me to feel under the weather.</p>
<p>“I won’t ask for details, but do you have any specific conditions that make your days good or bad?”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say what conditions make me feel worse. The doctors say it’s a complicated illness with a lot of individual variation.”</p>
<p>My condition, inherited from my father, affects my immune and autonomic nervous systems.</p>
<p>Physical or emotional stress can unpredictably trigger my condition, affecting various aspects of my life.</p>
<p>Living calmly is the best treatment, my doctor said, but that was impossible for my father, and it’s the same for me.</p>
<p>To create and to express is akin to living; to be still is like being dead.</p>
<p>So, as long as I live, I need to manage this troublesome condition, even if it means giving up on some things.</p>
<p>“I guess it’s more like a constitution now, and I just have to accept it.”</p>
<p>“Right. …But maybe technology could solve some parts of it.”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“Nowadays, with wearable devices… like smartwatches. With those, you can collect a lot of personal data, so maybe we can find some trends. Not just those, but generally, they’re recommended for health management.”</p>
<p>“Huh, smartwatches, huh?”</p>
<p>I hadn’t thought of that. But it might be worth trying.</p>
<p>As we talked, Suika’s match came to an end.</p>
<p>As expected, Suika won. The court filled with applause, praising the efforts of both players.</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll be going.”</p>
<p>“Leaving? I see. Thanks for everything; you really helped me out.”</p>
<p>“I just happened to pass by.”</p>
<p>Despite having seen various sides of her, in the end, Kujo-san left with her usual cool demeanor.</p>
<p>I realized today that she might be more pleasant than I thought.</p>
<p>On the court, Suika and the Itozumi High School members lined up across the net from the opposing team’s members, exchanging handshakes.</p>
<p>The ace player from the opposing high school, with a wry smile, lightly tapped Suika on the shoulder a few times.</p>
<p>They seemed to be saying things like, “I won’t lose next time,” or “Let’s do it again,” creating a refreshing atmosphere.</p>
<p>After watching them for a while, I too started going home.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>

<p>After resting in my room’s bed until the evening, my physical condition has recovered. This quick recovery is all thanks to Kujo-san.</p>
<p>Feeling grateful, I get up a bit early to start preparing dinner.</p>
<p>Since I had no appetite and skipped lunch, I’m quite hungry now.</p>
<p>What should I eat? I check up what’s left in the fridge as I walk to the kitchen when my phone rings.</p>
<p>──Could it be Kujo-san again? Ah, no.</p>
<p>The caller is the person who contacts me the most in this world and today’s hero of the match.</p>
<p>“Hello, Suika?”</p>
<p>“Kuuya! I’m glad you picked up. I just finished the tournament and can finally contact you! How are you feeling? I was worried you might be bedridden…”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I should’ve known you’d notice. I worried you… Now, I’m totally fine, all okay.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear! As long as you’re okay…that’s a relief.”</p>
<p>I can almost picture her smiling through the phone with the way she speaks.</p>
<p>“Really, I’m sorry. But I’m seriously fine now. I even have an appetite and am about to make dinner.”</p>
<p>“Is that so, great timing then! Kuuya, why don’t you come over and eat with us?”</p>
<p>“Eh? No, I feel bad bother you too often…”</p>
<p>“It’s not bothering at all! My dad, mom, and grandma say you’re welcome to come over every day.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s…”</p>
<p>I’ve always been indebted to Suika’s family, but there’s a reason I can’t just take advantage of their kindness.</p>
<p>“…So, what are you planning to make for dinner?”</p>
<p>“Something chopped and grilled, and something…put in water and heated? That kind of thing?”</p>
<p>“I’m only feeling anxious now…”</p>
<p>I do live on my own, but cooking isn’t my strong suit.</p>
<p>“If you cook it, it’ll just end up burnt again, which is worse than unhealthy!”</p>
<p>“Uh…it’s just, I end up looking at it, you know, watching the colors change.”</p>
<p>When cooking, ingredients usually change color. Somehow, I always end up staring intently or absentmindedly at that process, inevitably burning the food in the end.</p>
<p>“Self-catering is commendable, but please, for your health, come eat at the Ado residence. Ideally every day, but at least for today.”</p>
<p>“Uhm…”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll come to pick you up, so wait for me!”</p>
<p>“The conversation is progressing without my answer…”</p>
<p>It seems difficult to refuse.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright, I’ll come over for today. But you don’t need to pick me up.”</p>
<p>“Yay! Then… come over around seven o’clock, in about an hour! That’s when the food will be ready.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Ado family’s cooking is incredibly delicious. Being invited to dine with them is a stroke of luck. If I were to think with my stomach and taste buds, I’d want to go every day.</p>
<p>That’s exactly why I need to exercise restraint.</p>
<p>With that thought, I spend the time until then doing homework from school, then head to the Ado residence, which is just a short ten-minute walk away.</p>
<p>“…It’s huge, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>No matter how many times I see it, that’s always my impression.</p>
<p>The massive estate is surrounded by a long fence. Passing through the gate reveals a large, purely Japanese-style mansion. It’s said that truly wealthy and land-rich families opt for a single-story house instead of building up, and the Ado residence embodies that philosophy perfectly.</p>
<p>“Kuuya! We’ve been waiting for you!”</p>
<p>“Hey, Suika.”</p>
<p>Before I could ring the bell, the door opens, and Suika appears. Her hair is slightly damp, and her cheeks are flushed. She probably took a shower after the tournament, which makes sense.</p>
<p>“Sorry for intruding.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Kuuya-kun, there’s no need for such formal greetings.”</p>
<p>As I take off my shoes and step into the house, a refined voice comes from down the hall.</p>
<p>“Ran-san, good evening.”</p>
<p>“Good evening. And you know, when you enter our house, you can just say ‘I’m home.’  also Dinner’s ready.”</p>
<p>Leaving those words, Suika’s mother, Ran-san, retreats back to the kitchen. Her smile has a somewhat enchanting quality, and her youthful beauty makes it hard to believe she’s a mother.</p>
<p>“See, even Mom says so.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate it. …Oh, the painting has changed.”</p>
<p>Speaking of appreciation, this comes to mind as well. The Ado family always decorates their grand entrance with season-appropriate paintings, all of which are my works, going back many years.</p>
<p>In this area, there’s hardly anyone who doesn’t know about the Ado family, and they even have visitors from afar coming to see them.</p>
<p>I occasionally wonder if it’s really okay for my paintings to be on display in the entrance of such a renowned family.</p>
<p>“Everyone who comes here praises Kuuya’s paintings. They’re our pride!”</p>
<p>As if reading my thoughts, Suika says this to me.</p>
<p>Entering the living room, I see the dishes already laid out on the table.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Kuuya-kun.”</p>
<p>“Daisuke-san, thank you for having me. I’m sorry for always imposing.”</p>
<p>As I sit next to Suika, her father, Daisuke-san, seated across from me, waves his hand with a gentle smile.</p>
<p>“Not at all, you’re welcome anytime. I’m the only man in this house, so it gets lonely.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear, it’s true that Kuuya-kun is always welcome, but to say you’re lonely, Daisuke-san, that’s too much.”</p>
<p>Ran-san comes over and places chopsticks in front of everyone as she speaks.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not that I have any complaints about Ran-san. By the way, if there’s anything else to bring out, I can help too.”</p>
<p>“Daisuke-san.”</p>
<p>Ran-san firmly stops Daisuke-san from standing up. Her movement is precise and elegant, yet unmistakably firm.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, there’s nothing left to bring out. And I’ve told you many times, Daisuke-san, I’ll take care of all the household chores related to you.”</p>
<p>“But you know, Ran-san also has duties with the Ado family business.”</p>
<p>“Managing both the family business and household chores is what Ado women do. Daisuke-san, I appreciate your sentiment, but this is something I cannot compromise on.”</p>
<p>Behind Ran-san’s gentle gaze, a strong light indicates her unyielding stance.</p>
<p>“Once, I mistakenly tried to prepare Dad’s meal, and she told me, ‘Over my dead body.'”</p>
<p>Suika whispers to me. It’s not a line you commonly hear in a family kitchen.</p>
<p>“But, Ran-san…”</p>
<p>“No buts, Daisuke-san. Besides, if it’s about the family business, Grandma is still active. She even went to a dinner party with the governor today.”</p>
<p>The Ado family consists of daughter Suika, her parents, and her grandmother, making it a four-person household. Currently, one person is missing.</p>
<p>“Kinuesan isn’t here, so she’s dining with the governor?”</p>
<p>“Seems so. The current governor was apparently quite indebted to my grandparents in the past and occasionally invites them.”</p>
<p>As always, being in this house feels surreal.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Ado family is run by women, generation after generation.</p>
<p>This is because the Ado family consistently produces daughters, making them a quintessential matrilineal clan.</p>
<p>Daisuke-san is a son-in-law adopted into the family.</p>
<p>Back when they were a warrior family, they would marry skilled men while the women, true to the spirit of Tomoe Gozen, would also take to the battlefield and earn military honors.</p>
<p>It’s less a family of strong women and more a family of strong women. That’s the Ado family for you.</p>


<p>“I really respect Ran-san for sticking to her beliefs. But as a married couple, I think we should support each other.”</p>
<p>“We are supporting each other. Let me be clear. I relieve the stress accumulated from work by taking care of Daisuke-san. This is a perfect example of mutual support; we are like a perpetual motion machine…”</p>
<p>“Ran-san, let me also be clear. Ever since I became Ado’s son-in-law, I’ve been desperate not to become a useless man.”</p>
<p>“Come on, everyone, let’s eat. Make sure to have plenty of seconds.”</p>
<p>“Ran-san, listen to me.”</p>
<p>Ignoring her husband’s words, Ran-san joins her hands in prayer and quickly starts eating…before serving the dishes from the large platter onto Daisuke-san’s side plate.</p>
<p>It seems she has no intention of responding to her husband’s requests.</p>
<p>“Kuuya, please eat a lot! This and this are seasoned to your liking; I made them! I’ll serve you, so just wait.”</p>
<p>“Suika’s good at cooking. I’m looking forward to it. But I can serve myself, it’s okay—”</p>
<p>“How much would you like? Is this much okay? Would you like a bit more?”</p>
<p>“Suika, listen to me.”</p>
<p>The Ado’s mother and daughter alike have a slightly troubling habit of ignoring conversations.</p>
<p>“By the way, Kuuya-kun, are you planning to participate in the competition this year as well?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I plan to…well, I intend to, but actually, I haven’t started yet.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. You’re prioritizing commissions, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Daisuke-san smiles wryly as I nod in agreement.</p>
<p>“In that regard, you’re just like your father.”</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Talking to you reminds me of him when he was in high school.”</p>
<p>…Daisuke-san is the only one who talks to me about my father in such a casual, everyday conversation tone.</p>
<p>I can’t help but feel grateful for that.</p>
<p>“I hope so.”</p>
<p>To my response, Daisuke-san offers his assurance.</p>
<p>The things that can no longer be confirmed, thus receiving such assurance, feels incredibly precious.</p>
<p>“Ah, the student days, nostalgic. Ran-san and I, we had our times when we were Kuuya and Suika’s age.”</p>
<p>“From that time, Daisuke-san was wonderful. Ah, nostalgic, indeed. There were foolish people who caused trouble for such a kind and dignified Daisuke-san, and I had to go ZAP! or WHOOSH! to them… Ah, yes, that happened.”</p>
<p>“The episode Ran-san is probably thinking of right now wasn’t a beautiful page of youth that could be described with such a calm face and cute sound effects; that was an incident.”</p>
<p>“Yes, an incident. An incident of love…”</p>
<p>“A battery incident.”</p>
<p>Daisuke-san’s retort doesn’t negate Ran-san’s cheerful demeanor.</p>
<p>“What was it again? Your father was attacked by some bad guys…”</p>
<p>“Yes, Suika, that story. The very kind and dignified Daisuke-san couldn’t stand to see a classmate being extorted, so he helped the classmate escape, and in return, he was beaten and kicked by a group, leading to hospitalization… I was so sad, angry, and hurt when I found out later…”</p>
<p>With a pained expression, Ran-san continues.</p>
<p>“So, I stormed into their hangout, beat them all until their original faces were unrecognizable, and since they fainted, I tied them up, dragged them into a deserted tunnel, hung them upside down, and dunked their heads in a bucket filled with water, in and out, in and out.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, the punchline was about eight times more dangerous than I expected…”</p>
<p>My hand stops moving during the meal.</p>
<p>“But Kuuya-kun! They wouldn’t apologize easily!”</p>
<p>“You’re really committed… even in the face of a life-threatening situation…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they just kept bubbling and gurgling.”</p>
<p>“That’s because their heads were in a bucket of water, right?”</p>
<p>It’s impossible for them to reply in that situation.</p>
<p>“It’s a joke, a joke, Ado-joke. Hehe, vee!”</p>
<p>Ran-san’s mysterious V-sign is dizzyingly cute, but it feels like that’s not the issue here.</p>
<p>“By the way, Kuuya, during this story… my mom and dad weren’t dating yet. In fact, my dad didn’t even know my mom.”</p>
<p>“Ah I see…”</p>
<p>I shiver. It’s slightly too early for summer ghost stories. Though, calling it a ghost story might be rude.</p>
<p>The Ado family is amazing.</p>
<p>What’s incredible is that there’s no doubt about the story of her taking down a group of men all by herself.</p>
<p>“I appreciate that you got angry for me, but retaliation that resembles interrogation techniques of intelligence agencies, Ran-san.”</p>
<p>“Oh, does that mean I have the self-control of a professional? Hehe, Daisuke-san, you flatter me!”</p>
<p>“I’m not praising you at all, mmm.”</p>
<p>As Ran-san feeds him a piece of fish, Daisuke-san comments, “Delicious.”</p>
<p>“…But my usually calm father was furious only that time. The only time he ever slapped my cheek was that day.”</p>
<p>Well, as a parent, that makes sense. I nod in agreement with Ran-san’s words.</p>
<p>“In return, my mom, who always nagged me, praised me to death that day. ‘What is the common sense of the world? For love, ethics are unnecessary. That’s what makes an Ado woman!’ she said.”</p>
<p>“The Ado family is amazing.”</p>
<p>Truly, this is no ordinary household.</p>
<p>“…So, Suika, what do you think about this story?”</p>
<p>Asking my childhood friend, who’s been quietly eating, she ponders before answering.</p>
<p>“Well, um… uh… I’m not sure! Maybe I’ll understand if I have someone I like, but as of now, there’s no sign of that.”</p>
<p>With a soft, shy smile, Suika responds.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>That’s reasonable, I suppose.</p>
<p>“More importantly, Kuuya, how was the stir-fry and the fried dish? I’m wondering if they turned out well…”</p>
<p>“They’re super delicious. Addictive, are you sprinkling drugs on them?”</p>
<p>“I only use ingredients that don’t break the law! But I’m glad you liked it. After the tournament, I rushed to take a shower and started cooking, so I could only make quick dishes, which is regrettable, mmm.”</p>
<p>Suika murmurs half to herself, seemingly dissatisfied.</p>
<p>“No, being able to make this quickly is amazing. If it were me, I’d quickly burn everything.”</p>
<p>“That’s, well… Kuuya, maybe you should stop cooking. Eating burnt food is bad for you, and you shouldn’t get injured with a knife either!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I get mesmerized by knives sometimes too, but I’m very careful.”</p>
<p>“That way of speaking is already very worrying…”</p>
<p>Suika’s expression darkens in response to my reply.</p>
<p>“Alright, as I’ve said before, I’ll come over every day!”</p>
<p>“I appreciate it, but that’s not possible. I intend to become an adult man who can cook.”</p>
<p>“Eh! Let’s save that for your old age, okay?”</p>
<p>I can’t keep relying on Suika and the Ado family’s kindness forever.</p>
<p>The reason boils down to one thing.</p>
<p>──It would get in Suika’s way.</p>
<p>Someday, when Suika finds someone she likes, it would cause trouble.</p>
<p>Having a close male friend who frequently visits each other’s houses and even has her cooking for him every day would undoubtedly be problematic.</p>
<p>It would be fine if Suika said, “I’ve found someone I like, so I can’t cook for you anymore…” but I have a feeling she wouldn’t say that. That’s the Suika I know.</p>
<p>She takes too good care of me, a mere childhood friend with absolutely no romantic feelings.</p>
<p>Just as she cherishes me, I sincerely wish for her happiness.</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s necessary to maintain the proper distance.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>


<p>“Alright…”</p>
<p>After returning from the Ado residence (with a large amount of food container filled with food as souvenirs), I found myself in front of a canvas at home.</p>
<p>The Miyashiro household is a typical two-story building, but there’s one thing that sets it apart: it has a private workshop on the first floor.</p>
<p>When my parents and I used to use it together, the room felt a bit cramped.</p>
<p>Now, it feels quite spacious, yet the stark emptiness hasn’t changed over the years, nor has my ability to get used to it.</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Still, the feel of the paintbrush in my hand and the smell of paint and oil transform me into a painter. I have no choice but to channel my loneliness and sadness into my work, turning them into materials for my art.</p>
<p>“Let’s do this.”</p>
<p>I start applying colors to the canvas, pulling the complete image from my imagination into reality. The unique sensation eventually makes me lose awareness, blurring the lines between myself, the paintbrush, and the canvas.</p>
<p>“────”</p>
<p>The scenery from within me seems to flow directly onto the canvas’s surface, a sensation so strong it feels undeniable, and slowly, the painting comes to life.</p>
<p>My concentration intensifies, stealing away my sense of time. It always happens when I paint.</p>
<p>“────”</p>
<p>Without knowing how much time has passed, I continue to express the world inside me through layers of paint, feeling as one with the canvas through the medium of my brush.</p>
<p>There’s no deceiving here, which is why I love painting but also find it terrifying.</p>
<p>One’s skill in painting is like a mirror. The more polished it becomes, the clearer it reflects oneself.</p>
<p>Was that something my father said?</p>
<p>──No.</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>I startle, and my brush stops.</p>
<p>Right, it wasn’t my father’s words. Just now, it was──</p>
<p>“…Mom.”</p>
<p>I murmur, realizing I can still feel the paintbrush in my hand.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Feeling this means my concentration has broken.</p>
<p>I sigh and stand up from my chair. …Time for a break.</p>
<p>I’ve worked up a sweat without realizing it. I need to get something to drink from the kitchen to avoid heatstroke.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, today was really a lifesaver.</p>
<p>…Kujo-san, huh?</p>
<p>The person who sits closest to me yet feels so far away. I used to think of her that way, but my impression of her has been changing little by little.</p>
<p>Although she remains cool and somewhat languid in conversation, I’ve found talking with her enjoyable.</p>
<p>…Except for the colors and emotions I sometimes “see” from her, which are still terrifying to me.</p>
<p>But that must be some mistake. Because how could it be?</p>
<p>Yes, just like that──</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>My gaze drifts to the tubes of paint near my palette, specifically to several that are clearly unused.</p>
<p>Specifically, the names on the tubes I touch, Cadmium Red, Vermilion, and Crimson Lake, all belong to the red spectrum, the same as the haze I “see” from Kujo-san.</p>
<p>The tubes are untouched, their content undiminished, never even opened once.</p>
<p>It’s not because they are brand new. I bought these years ago.</p>
<p>…Someday.</p>
<p>Yes, someday I’ll definitely use them. That’s what I thought when I placed them there.</p>
<p>But that someday never arrives.</p>
<p>I…</p>
<p>Cannot use red hues at all.</p>
<p>Red, for me, symbolizes love and affection. That’s why I just can’t.</p>
<p>This reality, stemming from trauma related to my parents, is an incredibly heavy shackle for me as an artist.</p>
<p>The expressions that could be made if red were available, and the ones that can’t be drawn without it, are countless in this world.</p>
<p>It’s not just about missing a whole range of colors. The adjacent and complementary colors to red, and their combinations, their appeal is significantly limited.</p>
<p>Without being able to use red paint, the range of colors I can mix is also limited. Red is one of the primary colors, so the impact is tremendously significant.</p>
<p>Enough is enough, I can’t stay like this forever.</p>
<p>How many times have I thought, “If only I could use red”?</p>
<p>With red, I could create better paintings—ones that offer more certain comfort and warmth.</p>
<p>Paintings that make viewers feel relieved, even if just for a moment, where loneliness fades, sadness diminishes, and anxieties are forgotten.</p>
<p>There are people out there feeling lonely due to their family situations or illnesses, things beyond their control, just like me right now.</p>
<p>I know the bitterness of those experiences firsthand, with the rawness of life.</p>
<p>And if I may say so myself, I know that my paintings have helped such people, that’s a fact.</p>
<p>Ah, damn.</p>
<p>If only I had red. Then, I could do so much more.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Frustrated by my inability, I grab the tube of paint.</p>
<p>Today, for sure, this time.</p>
<p>Contrary to my resolve, I can feel my fingertips growing colder as they clutch the tube, as if turning to ice.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Still, trying to maintain my resolve, I shakily attempt to twist off the cap.</p>
<p>“Ah, …uh, …uuuuuh…!”</p>
<p>My fingers stiffen, and I can’t open the cap.</p>
<p>It should be easy, just a twist, but I can’t manage it.</p>
<p>Eventually, my fingers drop the tube. As it rolls across the floor, I exhale a breath I didn’t realize I had been holding.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>I flop onto the bed.</p>
<p>After painting for about three hours, taking a shower, and now with the clock past midnight. Tomorrow is a day off, but it’s about time to sleep.</p>
<p>I really want to paint all night. It’s frustrating that my body can’t keep up.</p>
<p>It’s not just my body that can’t keep up, but my heart too. In the end, I couldn’t use red today either.</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>I shake my head to change my sinking mood.</p>
<p>Dwelling on what I can’t do won’t improve anything. I need to focus on what I can do.</p>
<p>That’s right, what I can do is…</p>
<p>…search for it. Kujo-san suggested it, after all.</p>
<p>I pick up my smartphone and launch the browser. The search keyword is “smartwatch.” I remember Kujo-san mentioning it might help with health management.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>There are more models available than I expected.</p>
<p>Some are designed for sports or dieting, recording how much you exercise, while others track your heart rate, ECG, body temperature, ambient temperature, and even noise levels, helping you understand what causes changes in your condition.</p>
<p>The latter seems more beneficial for me.</p>
<p>“…Oh wow, as expected, the price.”</p>
<p>The model I’m interested in has a price tag that’s intimidating for a student.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>Though I’m not as professionally active as Kujo-san appears to be, I do earn some money. I get paid for the paintings I’m commissioned to do.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought of accepting them for free or just for the cost of materials, but Daisuke-san advised me to set a proper price.</p>
<p>I don’t have extravagant spending habits, so I’ve saved a fair amount. However, that money is intended for future tuition fees.</p>


<p>My current living expenses are covered by drawing from the assets left by my parents. I can’t afford to be careless or extravagant.</p>
<p>Buying expensive items that aren’t absolutely necessary for living makes me hesitant.</p>
<p>──But, if it helps with health management, it’d be useful for painting…</p>
<p>With that thought, it felt regrettable to give up.</p>
<p>What about second-hand options? I searched on a flea market app, but the prices hadn’t dropped much.</p>
<p>I guess I have no choice but to give up. As I thought this, I refreshed the listing page on the app before closing it, and then…</p>
<p>“…Oh, there’s one more listing… eh!?”</p>
<p>A bargain.</p>
<p>There was one listing at an incredibly low price at the very top of the page.</p>
<p>…It’s suspiciously cheap, …or maybe not? It’s really cheap, but not suspiciously so… What’s the deal with this…?</p>
<p>Ah! What should I do!</p>
<p>If I hesitate, someone else will definitely buy it.</p>
<p>Looking at the seller’s description, it said, “I need money urgently, so I’m offering it at a low price.”</p>
<p>“…Here goes!”</p>
<p>I exclaimed as I tapped the purchase button, and with that momentum, tapped several more times to complete the purchase.</p>
<p>This is all about momentum.</p>
<p>The perfect timing of the listing must be some sort of fate. If I end up buying something strange, I’ll just consider it as part of that fate.</p>
<p>…Fate, huh? I wonder if Kujo-san would say it’s unscientific.</p>
<p>Imagining how she would say it, I closed the app.</p>
<p>According to a notification I received shortly after, the smartwatch will arrive tomorrow night. The seller must live nearby and is quick with their work.</p>
<p>I’ll wear it to school on Monday since I got it. With that plan in mind, I turned off the lights in my room and closed my eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">◇◆◇</p>
<p>“Ah, Kuuya, did you buy that?”</p>
<p>Monday morning.</p>
<p>On the way to school, Suika immediately noticed it.</p>
<p>Nodding to her, I tapped the smartwatch wrapped around my wrist as I answered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it just arrived last night.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t it collect various data for you?”</p>
<p>“It seems so. I plan to keep wearing it for now. The battery seems to last quite a while too.”</p>
<p>It seems I only need to take it off and charge it when I’m in the bath, and it can be used all day long. I’m impressed by how far technology has come.</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s rare for you to buy such… gadgets?”</p>
<p>“I thought about managing my health. It seems useful for understanding patterns in my physical condition.”</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s great! It’s really good!”</p>
<p>Suika always has a bright smile that could be seen from a hundred meters away. Just seeing her smile makes me feel healthier.</p>
<p>“Please, take good care of Kuuya’s health…! Please watch over him carefully…!”</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect you to start sending prayers.”</p>
<p>“If it could also tell you to take breaks while painting… And scold you if you haven’t eaten properly, and when you go to sleep at night, make sure you’re not cold by covering you with a blanket…”</p>
<p>“That’s asking for too much. Plus, I don’t sleep that badly.”</p>
<p>Even if I did, a smartwatch couldn’t help. Maybe a few generations down the line.</p>
<p>“Ah, but, it does seem to warn you if you’ve been sitting for too long.”</p>
<p>“Oh! …It really feels like it’s always with you, watching over you.”</p>
<p>“Technology has really advanced, hasn’t it?”</p>
<p>The model was expensive, but I got it for much cheaper second-hand. The exterior is pristine, almost like new.</p>
<p>“…Suika?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She was staring intently at my smartwatch. No, her gaze was a bit…</p>
<p>“Suika? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Eh? Oh, sorry, …I was just thinking I want one too!”</p>
<p>“Do you also need a machine to put a blanket on you?”</p>
<p>“I always sleep properly, so I don’t need one!”</p>
<p>“Really…?”</p>
<p>“Eh, when you put it that way… I, I might not know…?”</p>
<p>As we chatted, the school came into view.</p>
<p>Since Suika enrolled in the same high school in April, we’ve been commuting together every morning. My house is on the way from the Ado residence to the school.</p>
<p>“Are you going to draw at school today too, Kuuya?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s the plan.”</p>
<p>“I’ll probably be late because of student council work, so let’s go home together!”</p>
<p>“…Hey, Suika.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Looking into her large eyes, I said,</p>
<p>“Is it really okay for you to be with me all the time during our high school life?”</p>
<p>“…..eh~, what are you talking about? That’s an exaggeration!”</p>
<p>After a brief silence, she laughed and said that.</p>
<p>“We’re only together for the commute, and when our schedules match for going home. We’re in different grades, different clubs, and we don’t even eat lunch together or anything.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, but… You know, when we commute together often, there could be rumors, right? I don’t mind, but it might be tough for you to get a boyfriend or something.”</p>
<p>For me, romance is more terrifying than desirable. Suika knows all about my past, that I can “see” colors, and my fear of red and love.</p>
<p>“But you’re different, Suika.”</p>
<p>“Different…?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have the same reasons as me for not being able to find someone. Plus, you’re really popular.”</p>
<p>“Super cute new student!” …Such talk was quite the topic in my class and others in April, just after the school year started.</p>
<p>Since then, with her natural sociability and star quality, she’s become a well-known figure in the school.</p>
<p>“No, I’m not that popular. I just show up in many places, so I have a lot of acquaintances.”</p>
<p>“No way. I hear quite a bit.”</p>
<p>“What do you hear?”</p>
<p>“Talks like someone confessed to Suika.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Though it always ends with them being shot down. …Ah, but that’s just what I’ve heard…”</p>
<p>There might be guys who weren’t shot down.</p>
<p>“Hey, Suika, if you’re already seeing someone…”</p>
<p>“Kuuya.”</p>
<p>Her voice, cutting me off, was calm.</p>
<p>Calm, polite, yet somehow filled with a certain force.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in that sort of thing right now. And of course, I don’t have anyone.”</p>
<p>Suika continued to smile gently.</p>
<p>“It’s okay for me to be with you, no matter what anyone thinks.”</p>
<p>“…Really? If that’s the case, then it’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>


<p>We walked on in silence for a while, then passed through the school gates.</p>
<p>Then, Suika started talking.</p>
<p>“Do you know? Kuuya, you’re occasionally the talk of the school too.”</p>
<p>“Me? Ah, about my paintings? I did win a big award, even if it was a fluke.”</p>
<p>“Not just about the paintings. …’He has a good vibe, doesn’t he?’ that kind of talk.”</p>
<p>“A good vibe? What’s that about?”</p>
<p>“Some people seem to wear a special aura over their clothes, don’t they? I can’t quite put it into words.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>It’s a somewhat understandable, yet not quite clear explanation.</p>
<p>“Girls tend to be a bit weak for that kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“If you say so, I guess so. …But do I have that kind of vibe?”</p>
<p>“Who knows, from my perspective.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>To someone who’s been together since as long as one can remember, vibe or anything of the sort wouldn’t likely be apparent.</p>
<p>“So, I’ve been wanting to ask… Have you been approached by anyone?”</p>
<p>“You worry too much. …Thanks, though.”</p>
<p>Knowing my situation, she must be concerned.</p>
<p>“From my perspective, there’s nothing. Just hanging out with the guys, a peaceful school life.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Really. No such eccentric exists. Sure, I talk to girls, but if it comes down to it, I can “see” to check. So,”</p>
<p>It’s okay. I was about to say that when the image of a girl came to mind.</p>
<p>When I checked, she always returned a result of red.</p>
<p>“Kuuya?”</p>
<p>That’s… But it’s Kujo-san?</p>
<p>A beauty on almost a mistaken level, and above all, a hardcore misanthrope, …she wouldn’t bother with someone like me.</p>
<p>“Kuuya…? What’s wrong, Kuuya?”</p>
<p>But… it’s definitely red. Seen through my eyes that have never been wrong before, and it’s red… How should I interpret that──</p>
<p>“Kuuya!”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry, sorry.”</p>
<p>Pulled back to reality by Suika tugging on my sleeve.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? You made a strange face and went silent. …I feel like something similar happened recently…”</p>
<p>“Ah, no. …Just recently, I’ve started talking a bit with someone. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“…Is there anything troubling you?”</p>
<p>I know what she’s worried about.</p>
<p>Just the other day, I “saw” Kujo-san’s red up close and my whole body chilled.</p>
<p>I managed to snap out of it quickly, but if not, I might have slightly lost my mental or physical balance.</p>
<p>But saying that now would make it sound like Kujo-san’s presence is a bother. So, I shook my head.</p>
<p>“No, not at all. She’s a good person, a bit quirky, but talking to her is really fun.”</p>
<p>I knew that wasn’t what Suika was getting at.</p>
<p>She looked at me intently and said,</p>
<p>“If you’re happy and having fun, that’s all that matters. I don’t think you should keep it to yourself or anything like that.”</p>
<p>Her voice reached me directly, clear and strong, as Suika continued,</p>
<p>“But, …if you ever run into any trouble, please make sure to tell me. This is my selfish request.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, always.”</p>
<p>“No, …it’s just my selfishness.”</p>
<p>Taking it as Suika’s way of being shy, I decided not to say anything.</p>
<p>I really do feel lucky. Just being childhood friends, yet she treats me so kindly. I’m always grateful for Suika’s deep friendship.</p>
<p>While we were talking, we reached the entrance. Since the shoe lockers are separated by grade, this is where Suika and I always part ways.</p>
<p>“See you, Suika.”</p>
<p>“…Wait, Kuuya.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Your tie is a bit crooked.”</p>
<p>“Is it? Oh, …sorry.”</p>
<p>Suika smoothly approached me in one breath, reaching for my neck. With gentle yet firm hands, she readjusted my tie.</p>
<p>Tightly.</p>
<p>“…There, fixed. Perfect.”</p>

<p>As she moved away, Suika’s fingers lightly grazed my chest. I strangely felt the warmth of her fingertips distinctly.</p>
<p>“Thanks, that helps. I’ll make sure to do it properly next time.”</p>
<p>“No problem. …See you after school!”</p>
<p>Leaving behind her usual radiant smile, Suika headed towards her grade’s shoe lockers.</p>
<p>I changed my shoes and headed up the stairs to my classroom. I’ve always liked this mix of calmness and languor in the school’s morning air.</p>
<p>──But, I wonder if Suika really has no interest in getting a boyfriend.</p>
<p>Even without my biased view as a childhood friend, Suika is an exceptional girl.</p>
<p>Overflowing with thoughtfulness and kindness, warmth and brightness like sunshine. Her looks alone could turn heads, male or female, while walking down the street.</p>
<p>She could have her pick of partners.</p>
<p>No, but maybe there’s no one good enough for Suika. Perhaps thinking this way makes me a biased childhood friend.</p>
<p>“Hey, Miyashiro, good morning~”</p>
<p>“Morning~”</p>
<p>I opened the classroom door with a swing, greeted my classmates, and proceeded to my seat. Only about a third of the seats around were filled.</p>
<p>However, the seat next to mine was already taken.</p>
<p>Kujo-san, always early.</p>
<p>She rested her elbows on the desk, chin on her hands, gazing out the window.</p>
<p>Since becoming classmates in April, there hasn’t been a day when Kujo-san arrived at school after me. Whenever I enter the class, she’s already there.</p>
<p>She must be a morning person.</p>
<p>Contrary to my assumption of her, a person skilled in programming, being a night owl, it was a surprise.</p>
<p>Even as I hung my bag on the desk and sat down, Kujo-san kept looking outside, without directing a single glance my way.</p>
<p>Although we’ve had several opportunities to talk lately, this is her usual demeanor. Uninterested in those around her, lost in her thoughts while gazing outside.</p>
<p>That’s the standard image I have of Kujo Kurenai.</p>
<p>And often, she sighs deeply, troubled. I’ve also seen her biting her lips, her face set in a harsh expression.</p>
<p>With her brilliant mind, she’s probably pondering over things far beyond my comprehension.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t disturb her. I swallowed the “good morning” I was about to say.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll talk again in ten days.</p>
<p>Such thoughts crossed my mind as Yuuji entered the classroom.</p>
<p>“Hey, Yuuji, morning~”</p>
<p>“Morning! Hey, Kuuya, listen, …I gotta tell you this!”</p>
<p>Just another ordinary day begins.</p>
