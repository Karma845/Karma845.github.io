<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>On the day before the entrance exam, I set foot in the Royal Capital.</p>
<p>“So this is the Royal Capital…”</p>
<p>As expected of the Royal Capital that is said to be the most prosperous in this country.</p>
<p>In terms of activity, it seems to be pretty much the same from a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>It is overflowing with people, and the buildings stand close together.</p>
<p>But even in this city, I didn’t see any kind of magic tools.</p>
<p>“Does this mean that the magic civilization has declined even in the Royal Capital?”</p>
<p>After the magic revolution in my previous life, one would use Quick Move to increase their walking speed.</p>
<p>People who were involved in doing hard labor also use Rise Power, a Body Strengthening Magic.</p>
<p>But no one seemed to be using magic here.</p>
<p>Well, that was mostly within my expectations.</p>
<p>As I was walking around the Royal Capital searching for an inn to stay for the day,</p>
<p>“S-stop!”</p>
<p>I heard a feminine shrill voice.</p>
<p>It seems that the voice is coming from a nearby alley.</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>I used detection magic to grasp the situation in the alley.</p>
<p>There’s a girl surrounded by three men.</p>
<p>Perhaps from fear, the girl just screams.</p>
<p>Should I intervene?</p>
<p>“Hey!!!”</p>
<p>I went into the alley and called out to them.</p>
<p>“What is it, you bastard?”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to challenge us?”</p>
<p>“We are the feared Alan Trio, you know?!”</p>
<p>The Alan Trio who were surrounding the girl showed a sharp glance at me.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem like you guys are just picking-up girls. Even then, weren’t you guys being too pushy? That girl doesn’t seem to like it though?”</p>
<p>While saying all of that, I observed the three of them.</p>
<p>…First of all, the tallest guy seems to work out frequently. Compared to the other two, he is much more muscular.</p>
<p>But such an inefficient training regime wouldn’t even let you break boulders.</p>
<p>Even so, I think the one I need to watch out for is that little guy.</p>
<p>He may look weak, but there’s a dagger hidden in his pocket. Well, “So what?”.</p>
<p>“Hmph&#8230;! The girl over there picked a fight with us. She bumped into us but didn’t even apologize afterwards”</p>
<p>Those men smirked.</p>
<p>“T-that’s a lie! They were the one who stopped me and brought me to a place like this!”</p>
<p>The girl leans forward and appeals.</p>
<p>Looking closer, I wonder if she’s about my age?</p>
<p>A lovely girl with long hair. She looks bright and lively.</p>
<p>I wonder if they were just seducing her or trying to commit violence.</p>
<p>But it was obvious that the lovely looking girl disliked it.</p>
<p>“You bastard…! How dare you!”</p>
<p>The man moved his right hand.</p>
<p>He clenched his fist and was about to take a swing at the girl.</p>
<p>&#8212;It’s unacceptable to hit a girl.</p>
<p>I activated the Quick Move Magic and closed the distance towards the guy in an instant.</p>
<p>“Hey. Thought I told you to stop it”</p>
<p>I grab his wrist and warn him.</p>
<p>“What the…? When did you get here?”</p>
<p>It seemed that he couldn’t catch my movement.</p>
<p>Forget it.</p>
<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>
<p>As it is, I twisted the confused man’s wrist and slammed him to the ground.</p>
<p>“You bastard! What the fuck are you doing!”</p>
<p>“You’ve got some nerves to be picking a fight with the Alan Trio!”</p>
<p>and the two other men attacked together.</p>
<p>Their movement were too stiff. That Cyril would have been much better than these two.</p>
<p>Let’s not use any offensive magic. Else I might end up killing them if I’m careless.</p>
<p>I think Quick Move, a magic that increases the speed of the caster, would be more than enough to deal with them.</p>
<p>“Waaaaaahhhhhh! Eat this!!! &#8212;Whoa!”</p>
<p>I tripped the leg of the guy who had raised his fist.</p>
<p>He slammed his head hard onto the ground and subsequently the guy lost consciousness.</p>
<p>“You bastard!! I’ll avenge my brothers!!!!!!!”</p>
<p>The other guy swings his right fist to attack me.</p>
<p>But his actual aim was to use the hidden dagger he had in his pocket with his left hand.</p>
<p>He intends to slit my throat with it.</p>
<p>“So slow”</p>
<p>I muttered.</p>
<p>It took him two seconds to swing his right fist.</p>
<p>And another half second to take out the dagger to slit my throat.</p>
<p>I had already yawned once by then, and then got behind him with plenty of time to spare.</p>
<p>“I got you!!!!!! …Wha-?”</p>
<p>“Were you looking at my afterimage?”</p>
<p>Then I snatched his dagger and playfully tap his cheeks with it.</p>
<p>“You should do more training. I can teach you if you want, but that will cost you a fortune”</p>
<p>“Y-you bastarddddd!”</p>
<p>The guy turned around and tried foolishly to tackle me.</p>
<p>As I shifted my position slightly, the man who tried to tackle me ran straight into the wall of the building.</p>
<p>“Don’t you mess with her again”</p>
<p>“Whoa!! W-what the hell is this?!”</p>
<p>I approached the injured guy from behind and activated Aerial Remove.</p>
<p>With the force of the wind, his body was lifted into the air&#8212;</p>
<p>“Gahh!!”</p>
<p>He was then slammed to the ground and passed out.</p>
<p>“Is this the extent of the people in the Royal Capital?”</p>
<p>Well, they didn’t seem to be mages.</p>
<p>They’re just thugs.</p>
<p>I bet I’d see someone who are better than them when I attend the magic academy.</p>
<p>“U-um!”</p>
<p>As I was thinking about that, the girl from earlier called out to me.</p>
<p>“Thank you!! Thanks to you, I was saved!”</p>
<p>The girl approached me and held my hands tightly as she looked up at me.</p>
<p>There I was unwittingly attracted to something.</p>
<p>A cleavage as big as twin mountain peaks.</p>
<p>Moreover, every time the girl moved, those two big bulges would jiggle around.</p>
<p>Huge!!!</p>
<p>Even a thousand years ago, this kind of situation rarely ever happen to me, so I was at a loss.</p>
<p>This is too much of a stimulus.</p>
<p>To think that someone like me could blank out, even if only for a moment.</p>
<p>“Um…your face…is…kind of…close”</p>
<p>“Whoa! I’m sorry!”</p>
<p>Immediately the girl pulled herself away.</p>
<p>Did I scare her?</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to tell her off.</p>
<p>It’s just that I’ve hardly spoke with a girl even in my past life, so I was just embarrassed.</p>
<p>Besides&#8212;if this girl’s breasts were to get any closer to me, I would be at a loss.</p>
<p>As I was wondering what to do,</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, I haven’t introduced myself yet. I’m Lara Ascanoss! 15 years old!”</p>
<p>said the girl&#8212;Lara energetically.</p>

<img title="TRM_Vol1_04" alt="TRM_Vol1_04" src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/trm_vol1/cache/TRM_Vol1_04.jpg-nggid019-ngg0dyn-800x800x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg" width="563" height="800" style="max-width:100%;" >
<p>“And you are?”</p>
<p>“I’m Kurt. Kurt Lepracta. 15 years old, too”</p>
<p>“Kurt-san!”</p>
<p>“Just Kurt would do”</p>
<p>We’re the same age.</p>
<p>I think there’s no need to be fixated on that.</p>
<p>“Then&#8230;Kurt it is! That was an amazing move earlier. Is Kurt a swordsman by chance?”</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>“I’m not a swordsman. I’m a mage”</p>
<p>“…Eh?”</p>
<p>Lara looked puzzled.</p>
<p>After all, the Body Strengthening Magic doesn’t seem to be common in this era.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s not surprising that she reacted like that.</p>
<p>After clearing my throat.</p>
<p>“Well anyway…that move earlier can only be done with magic”</p>
<p>“Oh. I’m not very knowledgeable on magic. Even so…what a coincidence!”</p>
<p>Lara suddenly smiled.</p>
<p>“I’m a mage too! I came here to take the entrance exam for the magic academy…but then I got involved with those people back there”</p>
<p>Lara turned her gaze to the fallen men.</p>
<p>The men show no sign of waking up.</p>
<p>“I think a cute girl like Lara could attract shady men…so you should be more careful when walking around”</p>
<p>“Eh? I am cute?”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah&#8230;did you feel uncomfortable being told this out of the blue? If that’s the case, I apologize”</p>
<p>I was thrown into panic.</p>
<p>&#8230;I didn’t really know how to converse with a girl.</p>
<p>Even in my past life, I was so focused on mastering magic that I didn’t even make any friends, let alone a girlfriend.</p>
<p>“Hehe, I’m cute&#8230;cute…”</p>
<p>Lara hums with her hands behind her back.</p>
<p>By the looks of it, she didn’t seem to be in a bad mood.</p>
<p>“But if you’re a mage, why didn’t you use magic to take out those men earlier?”</p>
<p>“Because I was too scared to take action…that’s why I’m so grateful that Kurt came to help me. Truly, thank you!!”</p>
<p>I wonder if she just isn’t used to fighting?</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the quantity and quality of Lara’s magic power are quite impressive.</p>
<p>It’s a rough calculation&#8230;but I think it’s better than Cyril from the village.</p>
<p>I wonder if it’s normal for a fifteen years old to be not used to confrontation?</p>
<p>At any rate.</p>
<p>“Just now you were saying that you’ll be taking the magic academy’s entrance exam, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>“Well, the same goes for me. Let’s give our best shots”</p>
<p>“Eh? Kurt also came for the magic academy?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Is there anything strange with that?”</p>
<p>“I-it’s strange! After all, from the way you moved earlier, I thought you were already actively working as an adventurer!”</p>
<p>“I-is that so”</p>
<p>Even though I’ve gotten most of my power back, but that just now wasn’t even a proper fight.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what Lara thinks, but it’s true. Tomorrow, I’m going to take the entrance exam to enroll into the magic academy”</p>
<p>“Fuee…I wonder if I’m going to be accepted, if someone like Kurt is taking it&#8230;”</p>
<p>Lara looked dispirited.</p>
<p>Looks like she had lost her confidence.</p>
<p>“B-but! I have this!”</p>
<p>Immediately, Lara looked up and held out her hand as if to say, “What do you think?”.</p>
<p>There seems to be a ring on her index finger.</p>
<p>“That is?”</p>
<p>“It is the ‘Mizorato’s Ring’ which I had bought at the famous magic equipment store in the Royal Capital. It seems to provide magical support if I wear it…with this, I should be able to pass too! Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p>I see….</p>
<p>Even in my past life, there were also such equipment that were enchanted with magic.</p>
<p>I remembered that I also wore something called the ‘Dark Dragon’s Ring’, which is said to have been made from the tears of an evil dragon.</p>
<p>However&#8212;since I was reincarnated in this world, this is the first time I’ve seen such a thing.</p>
<p>“Do you mind if I take a look at it?”</p>
<p>“Sure, go ahead!”</p>
<p>Feeling nostalgic, I received the ring from Lara.</p>
<p>And then I analyzed it&#8212;but it was a shocking result.</p>
<p>&#8212;What is this trash equipment?</p>
<p>It’s probably a piece of equipment made to efficiently channel one’s magic power.</p>
<p>However, its structure is too crude.</p>
<p>The circuit inside is a messy dead end.</p>
<p>At this rate, the conversion method will be inefficient rather than being efficient.</p>
<p>“What do you think? Isn’t it beautiful!”</p>
<p>Lara gazed on to my face.</p>
<p>“How much did you pay for this?”</p>
<p>“Umm, it was pretty expensive…but when I told my father that I wanted to attend the magic academy, he saved up some money for me. He told me to buy some good equipment with it and to do my best in the entrance exam”</p>
<p>When I heard the price from Lara, I became speechless.</p>
<p>It was quite expensive.</p>
<p>That is the price that a family of four could spend for at least three months if they live modestly.</p>
<p>“…………”</p>
<p>“Eh? Kurt? Why are you staring at me like that all of a sudden? It’s kind of embarrassing&#8230;”</p>
<p>Unable to stay still, Lara blushed.</p>
<p>I felt bad for her….</p>
<p>She got ripped off.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect such a defective product to have that kind of a price tag.</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped…”</p>
<p>I looked at Lara’s ring again.</p>
<p>This is a good opportunity.</p>
<p>After all, I had not used Enchantment Magic yet since I came to this world.</p>
<p>I felt sorry for her, maybe I should alter it a little into something more decent.</p>
<p>“Lara, can you leave your mouth open a little bit?”</p>
<p>“Eh? Like this?”</p>
<p>Lara opens her mouth.</p>
<p>And without hesitation, I shoved my index fingers into her mouth.</p>
<p>“Ohmigosh! Kurt!?”</p>
<p>Without paying attention to Lara’s puzzled expression, I just moved my fingers back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>*SFX of Lara mouth drools*</strong></p>
<p>I heard an obscene sound and Lara’s eyes were charmed and all teary.</p>
<p>“F-furt. Fwaarrf arr yuu duin?”</p>
<p>“I need you to trust me”</p>
<p>I’m not doing anything strange.</p>
<p>The closer I get to the inside of the human body, the easier it is to feel their magic power. It’s even easier to get a feel of it when there are bodily fluids.</p>
<p>So I put my fingers in her mouth to analyze Lara’s magic power in more detail.</p>
<p>&#8212;Even so, what is this magic power of Lara’s?</p>
<p>Hmm, this is not a familiar magic power. I think I saw a similar magic power a thousand years ago, but I can’t seem to recall it now.</p>
<p>Maybe it is because of this that both the quantity and quality of her magic power are excellent.</p>
<p>“Hmm! Mmm!”</p>
<p>Saliva was dripping out from Lara’s mouth.</p>
<p>Her chin gradually rose, and she seemed to be feeling the touch of my fingers in her mouth.</p>
<p>If I were to do this for the first time, it would feel like I’m doing something strange.</p>
<p>Lara’s tongue curled around my index fingers, and I felt a pleasant warmth.</p>

<p>“I’m almost done”</p>
<p>I vigorously moved my fingers around.</p>
<p>At the same time, I fed the ring with magic power and improve on its messy magic circuit.</p>
<p>I tried to match it with Lara’s magic power and reconstruct the ring’s magic circuit.</p>
<p>…Yeah. I think it should be a little more decent now.</p>
<p>While I was at it, I also enchant it with [Magic Power Output + 200%].</p>
<p>“It’s done”</p>
<p>“&#8212;Haa. Kurt, what were you doing? And what was it for?”</p>
<p>When I pulled my fingers out of her mouth, drool dripped onto the ground like a thread.</p>
<p>Then Lara plopped down on the ground as if she had lost all her strength.</p>
<p>Her cheeks were a pale pink, and she was breathing heavily, seemingly unaware of what had happened.</p>
<p>Oh no!</p>
<p>It was common in my previous life to stick a finger in someone else’s mouth to analyze their magic power in order to tune their equipment.</p>
<p>However, apparently, this was not the case in this era.</p>
<p>I had inadvertently neglected to explain to Lara.</p>
<p>“I’m terribly sorry. I thought I’d tune the ring to match it with Lara’s. That’s why I had to do that”</p>
<p>“Tuning&#8230;? You can do that just by putting your fingers in my mouth?”</p>
<p>“Yeah”</p>
<p>I put the ring that I was holding on to Lara’s finger.</p>
<p>“How is it? Do you feel anything?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure…but if Kurt says so, I believe in you”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you said that”</p>
<p>“Besides, it felt kinda good&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>Mumbled Lara, but that last part was not heard.</p>
<p>I could still further alter the ring, but that would be too much. I don’t think it would do any good for this girl.</p>
<p>“Well&#8230;I guess all that’s left would be these guys”</p>
<p>I shifted my gaze to the unconscious men on the ground. I’m certain they were called the Alan Trio.</p>
<p>“There must be a militia in this city too. Shall we leave these guys to them?”</p>
<p>I created a translucent rope with magic. Due to it being filled with magic power, it won’t break so easily.</p>
<p>I gathered the Alan Trio in one place with Aerial Remove and tied them together with the rope.</p>
<p>“This is a pain in the ass, but from what I saw earlier, they seem to be only habitual criminals”</p>
<p>If I were to let them go, there would be more victims. This will just leave a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>“Lara, do you happen to know where the militia are?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I just came to this city, but I saw them on the way here”</p>
<p>“I see. Then can you show me around?”</p>
<p>“I’d love to! &#8230;Just being with Kurt makes me happy&#8230;”</p>
<p>Lara sounded lively and she also had a joyful look on her face.</p>
<p>After that, these guys were taken in by the militia, and we then parted ways.</p>
<p>And at last.</p>
<p>It’s the day for the magic academy’s entrance exam.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The magic academy is located in the ‘Central District’ which is said to be the most prosperous district in the Royal Capital.</p>
<p>When I arrived there, the luxurious and splendid school building was the first thing that I saw.</p>
<p>“Your examinee’s number is 99. Good luck!”</p>
<p>I was given a name tag with ‘99’ written on it at the reception desk, so I stick it on my chest.</p>
<p>Now…it’s time for the exam.</p>
<p>I can’t afford to fail the exam and return to the village where Harold and Cyril are.</p>
<p>And so I re-motivated myself and walked into the school building.</p>
<p>It seems that the Rosanlila Magic Academy entrance examination is divided into a written exam and a practical exam.</p>
<p>The written exam came first, so I headed for the designated classroom.</p>
<p>“The time limit for this exam is 90 minutes. Everyone, please do your best!”</p>
<p>At the order of the examiner, everyone in unison started to look at their papers.</p>
<p>The practical exam should be fine, but I’m somewhat worried about the written exam.</p>
<p>After all, this is a world where a thousand years had passed after my previous life, so it wouldn’t be surprising even if the common sense I had inside me were obsolete.</p>
<p>For every common sense I have had in my mind has been entirely betrayed at every turn since my reincarnation.</p>
<p>I steeled myself, grabbed the pen and read through the questions.</p>
<p>…Hmm, I think I can manage this one.</p>
<p>The history field could be a little difficult for me, but I’ve done some light research beforehand, so I should be able to manage it.</p>
<p>The questions were centered on the history of the past two hundred years or so.</p>
<p>I wonder how was the world I lived in a thousand years ago being portrayed?</p>
<p>I read through the literature in the village and found nothing about the magic revolution that took place a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Was it because it occurred so long ago? Or was that village so rural that there weren’t enough books on the matter?</p>
<p>While thinking about such things, I answered the questions smoothly.</p>
<p>Now comes the magic field of the written exam.</p>
<p>So it seems the questions in this section here are meant for students in a world where magic is already on the decline. That’s why, there simply isn’t anything to worry about in this section.</p>
<p>In fact, when I looked it over, as one might expect, there were questions that are way too simple for me.</p>
<p>‘Question・Please state one wrong part of this magic formula’</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>One wrong part&#8230;? That would be difficult.</p>
<p>Because&#8212;the magic formula was almost entirely wrong. It is hard to narrow it down to just one.</p>
<p>I wonder how one can form proper magic with this kind of magic formula?</p>
<p>A cursory count showed that there were twenty-eight mistakes.</p>
<p>Rather, it’s easier to just rewrite the magic formula from scratch, and so I did just that.</p>
<p>This way, the person who set this question up would realize their own stupidity as well.</p>
<p>And so I ended up solving the question that way.</p>
<p>But when I got to the last question, I had to stop my pen for a moment.</p>
<p>As to why, that’s because the difficulty is clearly different from any of the questions so far.</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but blurt out.</p>
<p>After all, the magic theory I formulated a thousand years ago was written there.</p>
<p>But the contents are wrong.</p>
<p>Does that mean it was misrepresented over the course of a thousand years?</p>
<p>However, among the magic theories I formulated, even the children could easily manage this one.</p>
<p>After all, it’s not even that difficult.</p>
<p>It may be slightly more difficult than the other questions, but it’s safe to say that this falls within the levels of students as well.</p>
<p>&#8230;Okay! I guess that’s all of them.</p>
<p>And there’s still&#8230;sixty minutes left?!</p>
<p>So it has only been thirty minutes?</p>
<p>When I looked around, I saw everyone is still writing silently.</p>
<p>I guess they intend to review it until the end.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to think that one could make careless mistakes on such low standard questions.</p>
<p>So I plopped down on my desk and decided to sleep for the remaining sixty minutes.</p>
<p>“The exam is over&#8230;! Please stop writing!”</p>
<p>I was awakened by the examiner’s voice.</p>
<p>After the answer sheets were collected.</p>
<p>“Everyone is to gather in the schoolyard for the practical exam”</p>
<p>said the examiner before leaving the classroom.</p>
<p>While heading to the schoolyard where everyone else is heading too, I listened to the voices around me.</p>
<p>“As expected of the prestigious Rosanlila Magic Academy entrance examination”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was difficult…I might not have gotten through even one fourth of it”</p>
<p>“Especially the last question, what was that? I’ve never seen anything like it before”</p>
<p>It seems that everyone has no confidence.</p>
<p>But this is a trap. They are probably deliberately underestimating themselves in order to put everyone off guard.</p>
<p>Because it’s hard to imagine that those who take the magic academy entrance examination can’t solve questions of that level.</p>
<p>After all, it’s fundamental in a fight to put your opponent off guard.</p>
<p>“Hmm. They are a force to be reckoned with”</p>
<p>Anyway, the next practical exam should be more pleasant.</p>
<p>I followed the others to a spacious schoolyard.</p>
<p>“Here, you are going to hit the Mud Doll with magic. It’s a ‘Targeting’ exam, so to speak”</p>
<p>The examiner told us as we were gathered in the schoolyard.</p>
<p>A short distance away from us, multiple Mud Dolls can be seen wandering around.</p>
<p>They seemed to be controlled by magic.</p>
<p>But based on the analysis of the built-in magic formula, it doesn’t seem to be of good quality.</p>
<p>It’s like a doll that simply goes back and forth to the same spot.</p>
<p>“Mud Dolls&#8230;! As one would expect of the Royal Capital’s magic academy”</p>
<p>“Aren’t those expensive?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Just one of it would cost dozens of gold coins”</p>
<p>The examinees were chatting with each other when they saw the moving Mud Dolls.</p>
<p>“Now, let’s move on to the exam’s contents. I need everyone to stand on this line”</p>
<p>When I looked down, there’s a visible white line near my feet.</p>
<p>“Cast the fundamental magic, Fire Spear, without crossing this line, and aim it at the Mud Doll”</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>An exam where one has to shoot at a moving target with magic.</p>
<p>It’s simple, but profound.</p>
<p>“At the Mud Dolls over there…?”</p>
<p>“Is it even possible to hit a target that’s moving around like that with magic&#8230;?”</p>
<p>The surrounding area suddenly buzzes with noise.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the examiner continues in a relaxed tone.</p>
<p>“Rest assured. Even if you can’t hit the Mud Doll with magic, the grade for this exam will be determined through the speed and power of your Fire Spear. In other words, even if you can’t hit it, you won’t get a zero, so please do your best”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the examinees around me let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>So it will be fine even if we can’t hit it, huh.</p>
<p>But with a target of this level, I can’t think of anything other than to ‘Hit’ it from the start.</p>
<p>“Then let’s start with examinee number one&#8212;”</p>
<p>Thus began the practical exam.</p>
<p>In turn, the examinees stood in front of the white line and cast their magic.</p>
<p>“Gather yourselves together in these hands, O flame. Be a spear, pierce the enemy and burn them”</p>
<p>I think Cyril was blurting out something similar as well, but what are those embarrassing phrases?</p>
<p>Could it be&#8230;chanting?</p>
<p>Well, that’s all I can think of.</p>
<p>It is a method used before the magic revolution, and is so outdated that I had forgotten it existed.</p>
<p>The feeble Fire Spear released from the examinee, was heading for the Mud Doll.</p>
<p>“Shit&#8230;! I was so close to hitting it!”</p>
<p>But it didn’t even scrape the Mud Doll and landed on the nearby ground.</p>
<p>“That is to be expected. If you’re using the chanting magic, you wouldn’t have much control over it”</p>
<p>After all, the chanting magic is basically a pre-built magic formula.</p>
<p>It’s less applicable than constructing a magic formula from scratch.</p>
<p>So it wouldn’t be surprising to have missed the target with chanting magic even if the Mud Dolls are just simply going back and forth in a pattern.</p>
<p>“Next!”</p>
<p>One after another, the examinees casted their magic.</p>
<p>“Gather yourselves together in these hands, O flame. Be a spear, pierce the enemy and burn them!”</p>
<p>“Gather yourselves together in these hands, O flame. Be a spear, pierce the enemy and burn them!”</p>
<p>The magic is released one after another.</p>
<p>But…none of them seems to be particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>Most of the Fire Spear casted by the examinees didn’t even manage to hit the Mud Doll.</p>
<p>“Next! Examinee number 50”</p>
<p>“Yes!!”</p>
<p>A lovely voice was heard, and a girl stepped out of the crowd.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Isn’t that…Lara?</p>
<p>The girl who I helped yesterday.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see what she is capable of.</p>
<p>“……Gather yourselves together in these hands, O flame. Be a spear, pierce the enemy and burn them!”</p>
<p>Just like everyone else, Lara used the chanting magic.</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;I analyzed her magic power yesterday, and it seemed that Lara has Red Magic.</p>
<p>Red Magic excels in offensive magic.</p>
<p>As Lara was using the chanting magic, her magic power reacted with the ring that she wore on her finger.</p>
<p>Then, flames gathered in Lara’s hand, and soon a Fire Spear that was much larger than the other examinees’ was formed.</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>The person in question, Lara, looks surprised.</p>
<p>The large Fire Spear went flying forwards with a roar.</p>
<p>It didn’t hit the Mud Doll, but it landed on the ground nearby, causing a loud explosion, and a lukewarm blast reached here.</p>
<p>Everyone who saw it seemed surprised.</p>
<p>“W-What the hell was that magic!”</p>
<p>“Was it really a Fire Spear? It didn’t hit the Mud Doll but if it’s that strong…I bet it can annihilate the enemy”</p>
<p>“She did well despite having the Unfortunate Magic Power”</p>
<p>They said, while looking at each other.</p>
<p>Since it was a chanting magic, it probably couldn’t be equipped with a tracking function, but its power was very different from the other examinees’ Fire Spear.</p>
<p>“E-Eh? What just happened? I’ve never casted such powerful magic in my entire life…could it be the effect of this ring? But&#8230;it wasn’t like this when I tried it out at the magic equipment store&#8230;”</p>
<p>Lara looked puzzled and stared at the ring on the finger of her right hand.</p>
<p>Witnessing that, I muttered to myself.</p>
<p>“I knew Lara would make a fine mage”</p>
<p>Her magic quality is good.</p>
<p>The magic that I had enchanted on her ring is a mere [Magic Power Output + 200%]. It’s not much of an effect.</p>
<p>Right now, she is still using the inefficient chanting magic, so it’s inevitable for her to miss the target&#8230;but if she trains from scratch, I think she will be a fine mage.</p>
<p>“Then&#8230;next! Examinee number 99!”</p>
<p>It’s my turn.</p>
<p>I take a step forward and look at the Mud Doll.</p>
<p>“Good luck, Kurt!”</p>
<p>Looking back, I saw Lara waving to me and cheering me on.</p>
<p>As she did so, everyone was looking at Lara and me alternately.</p>
<p>“This is quite embarrassing”, I said while scratching my head.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn’t feel so bad.</p>
<p>Okay. I can’t show them my lame side.</p>
<p>While analyzing the Mud Doll, I formed a magic formula.</p>
<p>There were a few examinees who were able to hit the Mud Doll, but none of them went so far as to break them.</p>
<p>So it’s hard to grasp how robust it is&#8230;but let’s go with [Strength + 1000%].</p>
<p>There are ten moving Mud Dolls in sight.</p>
<p>&#8230;Analysis complete.</p>
<p>“This should do the trick”</p>
<p>I formed ten Fire Spear.</p>
<p>Naturally, I’ve also granted a tracking function to the Fire Spear so that they won’t miss their targets.</p>
<p>As soon as the preparations were completed, I fired all of them at once, and the ten Fire Spear flew straight towards the Mud Doll.</p>
<p>Zudōōōon!</p>
<p>All of them managed to hit the targets.</p>
<p>A chain of explosions occurred, and a deafening blast can be heard.</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>“What just happened!?”</p>
<p>The screams of the examinees echoed throughout the schoolyard.</p>
<p>And when the smoke had dissipated&#8230;.</p>
<p>“H-Hey! All the Mud Dolls…are broken!”</p>
<p>“Moreover, those Fire Spear seemed to have flown towards the Mud Dolls as if they had their own will…?”</p>
<p>“And that Gold Magic…isn’t that a Defective Magic Power? No, I must have imagined it. I’ve never heard that the Defective Magic Power could perform such a feat!”</p>
<p>Still, it looks like the Mud Doll was made of a more brittle material than I had imagined.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect it to be completely destroyed by this level of magic.</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve ever seen a Mud Doll break!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I second that. According to one theory, from what I heard, it’s supposed to be as durable as the armor made in Orichalcum&#8230;”</p>
<p>Orichalcum?</p>
<p>Oh, do they mean that brittle metal?</p>
<p>“Kurt, that was amazing!”</p>
<p>Lara ran up to me and grasped my hands tightly.</p>
<p>“A-Ahaha…all the Mud Dolls are broken. What am I going to do about the exam&#8230;?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the examiner, whose glasses were out of alignment, was at a loss when he saw the broken Mud Dolls.</p>
<p>I felt sorry for the examiner, so I later restored the Mud Dolls with my magic for him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Next, we headed to what looks like a large hall in the school grounds.</p>
<p>It seems that students who have finished their exams in other locations are also gathering here one after another.</p>
<p>“Hey, that guy&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I heard that he destroyed ten Mud Dolls in one fell swoop during the target exam”</p>
<p>“Ten of them in one fell swoop? It’s already amazing if one can even hit it, so breaking it should be impossible!”</p>
<p>“What’s more, he seems to have defective magic power”</p>
<p>“That’s unbelievable&#8230;”</p>
<p>When I reached the hall, there were people staring at me and that made me feel rather irritated, but I decided to put up with it.</p>
<p>Until the exam starts, I lean back against the wall.</p>
<p>“Oh, Kurt!”</p>
<p>Lara came running up from the entrance.</p>
<p>“That magic earlier was amazing! As expected of Kurt!”</p>
<p>“No, they’re not”</p>
<p>I shrug my shoulders.</p>
<p>In fact, I wasn’t being serious at all, so being praised for something like that is making me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>While we are having a conversation, the other examinees are staring at us.</p>
<p>Lara is a beautiful girl.</p>
<p>A girl as beautiful as Lara is talking to me…and that might have made them quite jealous.</p>
<p>“At any rate, I have to thank Kurt for that”</p>
<p>“Thank me? If it is about the incident from yesterday, there’s no need for that”</p>
<p>“It isn’t about the incident from yesterday…but today!”</p>
<p>said Lara, holding up her hand with the ring on it.</p>
<p>“This ring, Kurt tuned this ring yesterday, right? Because I’m pretty sure you said something about doing that”</p>
<p>“Yeah”</p>
<p>“Then that should be the reason why I did so well on the target exam today! Thank you!”</p>
<p>said Lara, grasping my hands in hers.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>It is the same as yesterday, but in this position, I could clearly see Lara’s chest. I felt like I could lose my head in this situation.</p>
<p>“……What makes you think so? Maybe the ring was that good to begin with”</p>
<p>“Hmm, it’s a hunch!”</p>
<p>said Lara cheerfully.</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>“Eh! Why are you looking at me like that! My instincts are often correct at times like this! Besides&#8230;there’s a basis for it as well, right?”</p>
<p>Lara flapped her hands.</p>
<p>Every single action of hers is big and amusing.</p>
<p>“Because this ring…it is amazing, but it wasn’t that good when I bought it, you know? At best, it might have been easier to use magic more than usual? That’s what it should have been!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that what Lara is capable of?”</p>
<p>“No! That’s not it. I used to be the best in magic in my hometown…but here, I’m just as good as everyone else. So I owe it all to Kurt, right? So&#8230;thank you!”, said Lara as she lowers her head.</p>
<p>Lara might have misinterpreted the look I gave her just now, but intuition is important.</p>
<p>That is because it’s backed up by accumulated experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>There are times when I leave it to my intuition as well after having thought things thoroughly to the end and still couldn’t find the answer.</p>
<p>And since Lara’s intuition is actually correct, I can’t complain here.</p>
<p>“But! But! Kurt is a thousand times…or rather, billions of times more amazing! I can’t believe you’d break the Mud Dolls instead of just hitting them with magic”</p>
<p>“If one can’t do that, you won’t be able to defeat a dragon, you know?”</p>
<p>“I never thought of defeating a dragon though! Or rather, there’s no way a human could defeat it!”</p>
<p>Huh? What is she talking about?</p>
<p>I have defeated more than hundreds of dragons in my previous life.</p>
<p>Though, not a single one of them has ever been able to satisfy me.</p>
<p>Besides….</p>
<p>“There are Dragon Hunters, aren’t there? What are they doing?”</p>
<p>“Dragon&#8230;Hunter&#8230;?”</p>
<p>Lara tilts her head.</p>
<p>“T-There’s no such terrifying people! Aren’t dragons just a myth?”</p>
<p>“Eeehhh……”</p>
<p>Apparently, the profession of ‘Dragon Hunter’ is not common in this world.</p>
<p>In my previous life, Dragon Hunters were always competitively hunting for dragons.</p>
<p>Once, they even over-hunted the dragons and incurred their wrath.</p>
<p>At that time, I went as a mediator and negotiated a peace treaty between the people and the dragons.</p>
<p>But then, I also came across a Dragon God that lived for a hundred thousand years, just that it wasn’t able to satisfy me&#8230;but, it’s still a good memory to this very day.</p>
<p>Now, let’s change the subject.</p>
<p>“You seem to praise me all the time, but I think Lara is amazing, too. You have Red Magic, and it will continue to grow as you train and hone in your magic”</p>
<p>I thought I complimented her, but Lara slumped down her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Thank you…but I’m still a long way off. After all, I have the Unfortunate Magic Power”</p>
<p>“Unfortunate Magic Power?”</p>
<p>“Kurt must have known as well, but Red Magic isn’t suited for offensive magic. Because of that, it will also be difficult for those with this magic power to become an adventurer…that’s why it’s called ‘Unfortunate’ for that very reason”</p>
<p>Red Magic isn’t cut out for offensive magic?</p>
<p>Isn’t that contrary to my perception?</p>
<p>Besides, even if Red Magic isn’t suitable for offensive magic, one with Red Magic can still train in Support and Body Strengthening Magic and still be a part of an adventurer’s party.</p>
<p>“That’s odd……”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“That perception is wrong. Red Magic is definitely suitable for offensive magic. I don’t know where you got that from, but you ought to have more confidence in yourself”</p>
<p>At this point, I would even believe that the nobles who were jealous of me a thousand years ago, spread that lie….</p>
<p>&#8230;No, it’s possible because it’s them we are talking about.</p>
<p>“You’re right! Thank you for comforting me. I like it when Kurt says that!”</p>
<p>I was just telling the truth, but Lara seems to have misinterpreted my compliment.</p>
<p>Good grief.</p>
<p>“&#8212;The final exam is about to begin”</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>It looks like the exam is finally about to start.</p>
<p>And it seems that they are using an amplification magic to have their voices echo throughout the hall.</p>
<p>“The final exam is a 1 versus 1 battle. After this, we will announce the matchups and the assigned stage number. Examinees must quickly move to the stage to which they have been assigned to and start the exam”</p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>“Before the battle exam starts, we will place a magic barrier on each of you here. When the magic barrier is broken, or, one of you gives up, or, the time is up, then the exam ends. Also, we, the examiners, will be watching your fight as referees. Please note that if the referee stops the fight, the exam will also end”</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Long story short, the point is to demonstrate that you’re stronger than your opponent within the allotted time, right?</p>
<p>I got excited when I heard that, because up until now, it had been boring exams like the written exam and the target exam.</p>
<p>“Whoa…a 1 versus 1 battle…. I’m not very good at fighting against other people&#8230;”</p>
<p>said Lara, trembling as she hugs herself.</p>
<p>Then the examinees’ numbers were called out.</p>
<p>“Examinee number 99&#8212;Examinee number 200, the exam will be held at Stage 1, so please proceed to the mentioned stage”</p>
<p>Oh, that’s my number.</p>
<p>“Kurt, good luck!”</p>
<p>“Yeah”</p>
<p>“You are definitely going to win!”</p>
<p>“That’s a given”</p>
<p>“I pray that you won’t face a strong opponent!”</p>
<p>What is she talking about?</p>
<p>It’s obvious that the stronger the better, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Turning my back on Lara, I headed for the circular stage.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>On the stage stood a lovely girl with silver hair.</p>
<p>With her hair in a ponytail, she seems to be more elegant compared to the other examinees.</p>
<p>But for some reason, the girl also seems to be in a bad mood. With her arms crossed, she is giving me a sharp look.</p>
<p>“Examinee number 99&#8230;so it’s you. The genius who managed to hit all ten Mud Dolls with magic”</p>
<p>The girl started talking before I could.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s right. You got a problem with that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do. In fact&#8230;I was planning to be at the top of this magic academy entrance examination and graduate with me being the valedictorian of the class. But then you showed up and became a potential obstacle to that goal of mine. If that obstacle is right in front of me, wouldn’t I want to complain about a thing or two as well?”</p>


<img title="TRM_Vol1_06" alt="TRM_Vol1_06" src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/trm_vol1/cache/TRM_Vol1_06.jpg-nggid0231-ngg0dyn-800x800x100-00f0w010c010r110f110r010t010.jpg" width="563" height="800" style="max-width:100%;" >
<p>Looks like she has a grudge against me.</p>
<p>While I was dumbfounded, I could hear faint whispers from the surroundings of the stage.</p>
<p>“Hey, isn’t that Marise Sizenosna?”</p>
<p>“Did you know? I heard that she hit a Mud Doll with a single shot of magic, and even manage to deal damage to it”</p>
<p>“The Sizenosna is a distinguished family known for their magic, so I think that it’s only natural for her to achieve such a feat”</p>
<p>“She really lives up to her family name, huh?”</p>
<p>Apparently the girl in front of me is called Marise.</p>
<p>Moreover, she seems to be quite famous.</p>
<p>“You, I heard about you. You have a Defective Magic Power, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Ahh, that conversation again.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t Gold Magic be the supreme magic power? So why is it being referred to as such?</p>
<p>“Are you also going to look down on me for my Defective Magic Power, and not see things for what they really are?”</p>
<p>“Please don’t group me with the others. I wouldn’t stoop down to their level. After all&#8212;I have the Inferior Magic Power as well. Determining superiority or inferiority based on the type of magic power alone is foolish”</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I have no idea what Inferior Magic Power is, but it seems that this girl has a good head on her shoulders.</p>
<p>The problem lies with her abilities….</p>
<p>Will she be able to entertain me?</p>
<p>“Then allow me to place barrier magic on you”</p>
<p>As the both of us were having our conversation, the examiner deployed a magic barrier on my body.</p>
<p>The barrier is so heavy and yet fragile too. It is so fragile to the point that I just wanted to break it.</p>
<p>But I’ve heard that if the barrier breaks, then it will be my loss.</p>
<p>Patience Kurt, you just need to be patient.</p>
<p>“Then&#8212;let the battle exam begin!”</p>
<p>The examiner announces.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“It’s Kurt”</p>
<p>“Kurt. I won&#8217;t go easy on you&#8212;Gather yourselves together in these hands, O flame. Be a spear&#8212;”</p>
<p>As she is chanting, three Fire Spears appear around Marise.</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>Looking back, during the target exam, nobody was able to deploy multiple Fire Spears at the same time.</p>
<p>This girl has quite the spirit.</p>
<p>“Pierce the enemy and burn them!!”</p>
<p>Three Fire Spears were fired simultaneously.</p>
<p>By the looks of it, Inferior Magic Power is apparently Purple Magic.</p>
<p>Purple Magic excels in long distance type magic.</p>
<p>In that case&#8230;this should do the trick.</p>
<p>After they were fired at me, I took my time to form a magic formula and created something equally powerful as the incoming Fire Spears.</p>
<p>They then clashed and cancelled each other out.</p>
<p>“Eeehhh……”, Marise was at a loss for words when she saw her Fire Spears got cancelled out.</p>
<p>“How is this possible&#8230;are you saying that you can cast magic that is as powerful as my Fire Spear?”</p>
<p>Truth be told, I just made mine equal on purpose.</p>
<p>I could have put an end to this battle in an instant as well, but that would be boring.</p>
<p>“Maybe that rumour about having destroyed all the Mud Dolls isn’t entirely a lie after all. However, this is not over yet!!”</p>
<p>Not a moment later.</p>
<p>“Gather yourselves together in these hands, O flame&#8212;”</p>
<p>She is trying to cast Fire Spear again.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“Too slow”</p>
<p>This girl is certainly better than the other examinees, but if she continues to rely on the current chanting method, she won’t be able to reach the top.</p>
<p>Without chanting, I fired off a Fire Spear faster than Marise could.</p>
<p>“KYAAA!!!”</p>
<p>As the Fire Spear landed near Marise’s feet, she let out a squeal and fell on her bottom.</p>
<p>“W-What was that!? Casting magic without chanting&#8230;? Is that even possible? Moreover, that speed…isn’t that too fast?”</p>
<p>Seeing my magic, Marise looks confused.</p>
<p>I guess this is her current limit. She’s talented, but it wasn’t enough to keep me entertained.</p>
<p>Still&#8212;it looks like her magic barrier has yet to break. Also, Marise didn’t say the magic words “Give Up” yet, either.</p>
<p>Shall I put an end to this?</p>
<p>And so I started to approach her.</p>
<p>“Kuh, I wanted to keep my trump card hidden&#8230;but it can’t be helped!”</p>
<p>The color of Marise’s eyes began to change.</p>
<p>A moment later, she stood up, closed her eyes and began to chant her magic.</p>
<p>“O God. Bestow me the power of the sacred sword. A sacred sword that thunder from the heavens and annihilate the enemy. I am Marise. The one who will wield this divine power”</p>
<p>A magic formula is slowly formed.</p>
<p>Ohh, could this girl be planning to use the ‘Holy Sword’?</p>
<p>It was an intermediate level magic in my previous life.</p>
<p>“Oh? You’re doing pretty well, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>I blurted out when I saw the shining sword that appeared above me.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you can afford to be so composed? This will be your loss! Holy Sword!!”</p>
<p>As Marise swung her hand down, the ‘Holy Sword’ followed suit.</p>
<p>“But&#8212;you’re still too slow”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>I activate the Dispel Magic.</p>
<p>The sound of broken glass can be heard, and the ‘Holy Sword’ disappeared without a trace as well.</p>
<p>“W-W-W-What just happened? Where did my Holy Sword disappear to…?”</p>
<p>“It’s a Dispel Magic. Since you can use intermediate level magic, so you should know about it, right?”</p>
<p>“T-The highest-ranking magic, Holy Sword, is just an intermediate level magic? Moreover…Dispel Magic? A magic that stops the activation of magic during the formation process, does it even exist!?”</p>
<p>Marise is trembling all over as she saw the scene unfolded in front of her.</p>
<p>Dispel Magic is a magic that analyzes the opponent’s magic and betrays their expectations.</p>
<p>To put it simply, it’s a technique that erases the opponent’s magic.</p>
<p>However, to use it, one will need to fully analyze and understand the opponent’s magic. Therefore, the Dispel Magic can only be used when there’s a significant difference in ability.</p>
<p>“I was able to carry out the analysis because you used that tedious chanting”</p>
<p>“Tedious chanting? What are you suggesting then? Or are you suggesting that I should use chantless magic like you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I think it’s easy”</p>
<p>“You are the only one who thinks so!”</p>
<p>As I thought, this world is based on the standards of chanting magic before the magic revolution that I started.</p>
<p>In that case.</p>
<p>“Allow me to show you the true Holy Sword”</p>
<p>“Wha-!”</p>
<p>I activate the magic formula that I had set up in advance.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it’s a chantless magic.</p>
<p>A ‘Holy Sword’ similar to the one before started to appear above Marise’s head.</p>
<p>Well, they’re not entirely the same.</p>
<p>“S-Such an enormous Holy Sword!!”</p>
<p>Marise looks up and retreats fearfully.</p>
<p>“This is the true Holy Sword”</p>
<p>The one she conjured was about the size of an ordinary sword, whereas my Holy Sword is so big that even if about a hundred of them were to be gathered, it still wouldn’t be enough to compare with mine.</p>
<p>The hall is then enveloped in a dazzling light, and the examinees around us seem to be making a stir as well.</p>
<p>“Since you have the magic barrier on you, I’m sure you can handle this much, right? So here I go. Holy Sword!”</p>
<p>As I was about to drop the ‘Holy Sword’ upon Marise&#8212;</p>
<p>“W-Wait a minute! The exam is over! It’s over!! There’s no way the barrier magic can withstand that!!”</p>
<p>The examiner looked flustered as he interrupted between us.</p>
<p>Marise seems to be paralyzed with fear at the sight of my magic.</p>
<p>The belligerent mood that she had earlier is completely gone now, and she lost her will to fight.</p>
<p>I wanted to continue using the magic as it is&#8230;but it seems like the match has been concluded.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess this is it”</p>
<p>The ‘Holy Sword’ vanished as soon I stopped the invocation of my magic.</p>
<p>Despite having ended the battle with me being the victor, I was left unsatisfied.</p>
<p>While having such a thought.</p>
<p>“You were doing something rather interesting there, weren’t you. Allow me to join you as well”</p>
<p>I thought I heard a voice, and a man gallantly came up onto the stage.</p>
<p>“D-Desmond-sama! That would be problematic! You’re only here to observe, right?”</p>
<p>Seeing that, the examiner who was acting as a referee panicked.</p>
<p>The man called Desmond is an old man who looked to be about 60～70 years old.</p>
<p>He has white hair and a fine beard.</p>
<p>At first glance, he looked like a decrepit old man.</p>
<p>But&#8212;I had something else in my mind.</p>
<p>Is he…strong?</p>
<p>I can see it.</p>
<p>Underneath his clothes is a body of steel.</p>
<p>From those sharp eyes staring right at me, he might even be able to avoid any surprise attack from me.</p>
<p>“Why not, it should be fine, right? I’ve been bored for a while now. Let me join in as well”</p>
<p>Desmond snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>“If you defeat me, which seems unlikely, I’ll let you pass, even if you get a zero on the other exams”</p>
<p>“I refuse your offer”</p>
<p>“Huh? Perhaps, are you trying to run away from me out of fear?”</p>
<p>“I will still pass the exams without you giving me any favors”</p>
<p>I was planning to say it with a little provocation, but Desmond ended up smiling broadly.</p>
<p>“Gahaha! You’re one interesting brat, aren’t you!”, and laughed heartily.</p>
<p>“Y-You! Could it be that you are planning to fight against Desmond-sama?”</p>
<p>In response to the examiner’s question.</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>Hearing my immediate response, the examiner became even more flustered.</p>
<p>“Y-You, do you have any idea who Desmond-sama is? I know you are strong but it’s better if you get out of here now before you get hurt!”</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine”</p>
<p>I brushed past the examiner and got in front of Desmond.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I have no idea who this guy is.</p>
<p>But it is enough to know that he is strong.</p>
<p>“Kukuku. You’re really an interesting brat. I’ll use a wooden sword, and you can use a real sword. Or do you prefer to use magic?”</p>
<p>Desmond assumed a stance with his wooden sword.</p>
<p>“No, I won’t. Because if I use a real sword, I might accidentally kill you”</p>
<p>“Oh? You just said something very interesting, didn’t you”</p>
<p>I gave him that provocation on purpose, after all, I do not plan to go easy on him.</p>
<p>My blood is boiling.</p>
<p>Since this is such a rare opportunity, I want to fight to my heart’s content.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s fight fair and square then? It would be boring to add an unnecessary handicap. Hey, get me another wooden sword! And&#8230;get off the stage, young lady. You’re quite strong too, but you’re not strong enough yet”</p>
<p>“……Yes”</p>
<p>Marise hurriedly left the stage, grinding her teeth in frustration.</p>
<p>Desmond requested for another wooden sword, and out of nowhere, an examiner brought over one to me.</p>
<p>“You may come at me anytime now. I can’t use magic, but feel free to use magic yourself”</p>
<p>said Desmond, patting his own shoulder with the wooden sword in a calm and collected manner.</p>
<p>At first glance, the stance appears to be nothing more than an opening.</p>
<p>However, it is obvious that I would severely be hard countered if I carelessly rushed in.</p>
<p>Interesting. Let’s purposely fight him within his effective combat range.</p>
<p>“Well then, be my guest!”</p>
<p>After taking a step forward, I closed the distance between me and Desmond within the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>And, without a moment’s delay, I swung my sword down on Desmond’s head.</p>
<p>“Hmph&#8230;you’re still too inexperienced”</p>
<p>For a moment, Desmond grinned.</p>
<p>Desmond flings my wooden sword to the side.</p>
<p>Looks like his aim is to avoid my attack and then counter it.</p>
<p>At this rate, if I receive his attack without deploying any defensive magic, I might break a bone or two.</p>
<p>So I activated Quick Move here.</p>
<p>“Wha-!”</p>
<p>As if in response to my sudden increase in movement speed, Desmond turned his wooden sword to receive my attack.</p>
<p>The two swords clashed with each other.</p>
<p>“What was that? You seemed to be faster all of a sudden”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I used a basic level magic”</p>
<p>“That’s a magic spell? Such a magic spell exist? As I thought, you are not an ordinary person huh?”</p>
<p>“You’re pretty good, too”</p>
<p>After all, I thought it would be settled with a Quick Move attack.</p>
<p>But he managed to defend against it.</p>
<p>As I thought, this guy can provide me with some amusement.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you my alias (in my previous life)”</p>
<p>I broke away from the sword clash and while still wielding the sword, I revealed my alias.</p>
<p>“Magic Swordsman”</p>
<p>Combining both physical ability and magic in battle was my main area of expertise.</p>
<p>That way, it would’ve been convenient for me to fight alone.</p>
<p>I tried to make friends, but there wasn’t a single person who even came close to my level.</p>
<p>Before I was called a heretic, I was often called by that alias.</p>
<p>Besides Quick Move and Rise Power. I also used another magic, Eyesight, that makes it easier to perceive the opponent’s movements which adds up to three layers of basic body strengthening magic being in play as I engage Desmond.</p>
<p>“I-Incredible&#8230;I can’t see his movement”</p>
<p>“What the hell is happening on the stage?”</p>
<p>said the examinees in bewildered voices.</p>
<p>To them, it must have looked like I have the upper hand.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I was surprised by Desmond’s movement.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! Interesting, interesting!! To think that there’s someone in this country who can fight me one-on-one!”</p>
<p>Desmond continues to receive my series of onslaught with that one sword.</p>
<p>No matter how nonchalant he is about it, to think that this old man can contest me without using any body strengthening magic…what a monster!</p>
<p>“Don’t laugh in the middle of a fight. Old man”</p>
<p>“It seems to me that you’re laughing as well”</p>
<p>Indeed, I, too, might be laughing right now.</p>
<p>If this goes on, I’ll be the one to push through due to the difference in stamina.</p>
<p>But that’s unglamorous for a fight.</p>
<p>In that case.</p>
<p>“I saw an opening, brat!”</p>
<p>Desmond’s eyes became even sharper.</p>
<p>A complete change from defense. Desmond swings his sword.</p>
<p>It was a direct hit to my head.</p>
<p>However&#8212;it was to the other me.</p>
<p>“Wha-! What just happened?!”</p>
<p>Desmond, who finished swinging his sword, is astonished to see me disappear in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>It’s a magic called&#8212;Create Avatar.</p>
<p>A magic that uses magic power to create a humanoid mass, thus creating an alter ego.</p>
<p>Since it doesn’t have a solid body, the alter ego cannot attack, but it can be used to deceive the opponent in this way.</p>
<p>“I guess this is the end of it, huh”</p>
<p>While he is still in shock with what just happened, I went behind Desmond and placed my wooden sword against the back of his neck.</p>
<p>“If this were a battlefield, you’d be done in. Do you still want to continue the fight?”</p>
<p>“……It’s my loss”</p>
<p>Desmond slumped his shoulders and released his grip on the sword as well.</p>
<p>At that moment&#8212;an explosive cheer erupted in the hall.</p>
<p>“Who the hell is that guy! He defeated Desmond-sama!”</p>
<p>“Desmond-sama is a legendary former S-rank adventurer, right? To have defeated such a person…who is that guy!”</p>
<p>“The demon, Desmond, who is rumored to have slain hundreds of enemy soldiers single handedly when he was sent off to war&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“I heard that even though he had retired, he still mostly have his strength!”</p>
<p>Former S-rank adventurer?</p>
<p>“You were an adventurer?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, but I have already retired. Without knowing that, you still fought against me, you’re really making a fool out of me, brat!”</p>
<p>Kakaka, laughed Desmond cheerfully.</p>
<p>“However, there’s a mistake with their statement”</p>
<p>“A mistake?”</p>
<p>“Rumor has it that I killed hundreds of enemy soldiers&#8230;that’s wrong. The numbers are actually in the thousands! Gahaha!”</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;He seems to be quite a maverick.</p>
<p>No wonder he is a little tough.</p>
<p>Still, I have only used the basics of magic, and I have yet to give it my all in that fight.</p>
<p>“Who on earth are you&#8230;?”</p>
<p>Marise asked in a shaky tone as I stepped off the stage.</p>
<p>I still haven’t found anyone stronger than me.</p>
<p>However, the royal capital and the magic academy seems to be a much more interesting place than I have previously thought.</p>
<p>While feeling my heart still throbbing from the fight, I left the exam venue.</p>
