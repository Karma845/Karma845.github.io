<h2>Chapter 8: Even So, I Want to Steal You</h2>


<p>「Kamome-kun?」</p>



<p>「…Eh?」</p>



<p>On the way home from school.</p>



<p>Kamome, called suddenly by Himawari walking next to him, looked up.</p>



<p>「Ah… What’s up, Himawari?」</p>



<p>「Eeto, I was asking you what kind of side dishes you like in your bento…」</p>



<p>This day was the first time in a long time that they could go home together, as there were no club activities for Himawari.</p>



<p>However, Kamome was not paying attention to Himawari’s question.</p>



<p>「I-I’m sorry, Himawari!」</p>



<p>In an instant, Kamome slapped his own cheek.</p>



<p>「Kamome-kun!?」</p>



<p>「I was kind of spacing out and didn’t listen at all! Even though it’s a special day when I can go home with Himawari!」</p>



<p>「N-No, it’s okay! Don’t worry about it! It wasn’t that important a conversation…」</p>



<p>Himawari says that, but Kamome feels pathetic for making her worry.</p>



<p>(…What’s wrong with me?)</p>

<p>Why is my thinking so shaky?</p>



<p>Why is he spacing out?</p>



<p>The reason is clear.</p>



<p>It’s about Tsuyu.</p>



<p>He can’t get her out of his head.</p>



<p>Even now, when he’s with Himawari, he’s thinking about her.</p>



<p>It’s truly pathetic.</p>



<p>Wasn’t he supposed to cherish Himawari?</p>



<p>Wasn’t he supposed to prioritize his time with her over everything else?</p>



<p>He begins to think that everything he’s said up until now might have been lies.</p>



<p>「Kamome-kun, are you worried about something?」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>Himawari looks into Kamome’s face with concern.</p>



<p>「I might have said this before, but if there’s something bothering you, you can talk to me about it. I want to be there for Kamome-kun.」</p>



<p>「…Himawari.」</p>



<p>What should he do?</p>



<p>Should he be honest?</p>

<p>About the day he brought Tsuyu to his house.</p>



<p>About what happened there.</p>



<p>…Surely, if he honestly tells her that he’s worried about Tsuyu, but that it’s strictly about her personal life and behavior.</p>



<p>And that it’s not because he has feelings for Tsuyu, that Himawari is more important to him, then she should believe him.</p>



<p>…And then, this uneasiness in his heart… should be cleared.</p>



<p>「…No, it’s nothing. I’m really fine.」</p>



<p>But, he couldn’t say it.</p>



<p>Why, he wonders.</p>



<p>Even though I know it will provoke me feelings of guilt──</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>That night, Kamome came home with such unease.</p>



<p>「…Mmn?」</p>



<p>After taking a bath, Kamome, wiping his hair with a bath towel, returned to his room.</p>



<p>There, he notices a notification on the screen of his smartphone placed on the table.</p>



<p>「…Eh?」</p>



<p>A message from Tsuyu had arrived.</p>



<p>『Sorry for the sudden message.』</p>

<p>『Could we meet for a bit next time?』</p>



<p>『There’s something I want to discuss with you.』</p>



<p>『It’s okay if you can’t.』</p>



<p>About four succinct sentences were lined up.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>He can’t betray Himawari any more than he already has.</p>



<p>But it’s also true that Tsuyu has some worries and is relying on Kamome.</p>



<p>Above all, he felt that the dark cloud hanging over his heart would never clear unless he made progress in his story with Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Kamome sends a message back.</p>



<p>He decided to meet with Tsuyu on his day off tomorrow.</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>The next day──</p>



<p>Kamome is heading to meet Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Thinking that an easy-to-find place would be best for the meeting place, he designated the café they had visited together before.</p>



<p>To maintain a sense of normalcy, he visited Kedogawa Sports for the first time in a while and chatted with the manager and Amane.</p>



<p>Then, timing it right, Kamome heads to the café.</p>

<p>「…Mmn?」</p>



<p>When he arrived at the café, he spotted Tsuyu standing in front of the entrance.</p>



<p>Apparently, she had arrived before Kamome.</p>



<p>However, upon closer inspection, she seemed to be involved in some kind of trouble.</p>



<p>「Come on, it’s okay.」</p>



<p>「Just a little bit.」</p>



<p>「…I’m busy. Look elsewhere.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu seemed to be being hit on.</p>



<p>A muscular duo with dyed hair and beards.</p>



<p>Even though she’s being pressed by the pushy men, she is trying to smoothly deflect them.</p>



<p>However, the duo persistently clings to Tsuyu.</p>



<p>She looks annoyed, but the pressure from the duo is slightly pushing her, and she seems unable to escape.</p>



<p>「Hey! I have an important rendezvous! Really, enough is enough!」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu, clearly showing her irritation, turns around forcefully.</p>



<p>At that moment, the bag she was holding hit the back of one of the men’s hands.</p>



<p>「Ouch.」</p>



<p>「Oi, are you okay?」</p>

<p>The man exaggeratedly expressed pain, and his partner exaggeratedly expressed surprise.</p>



<p>「I-It only bumped you slight.」</p>



<p>「No, it’s the metal fitting. The metal fitting hit me and tore my skin.」</p>



<p>「For real? That’s terrible.」</p>



<p>The men’s gaze became sharp.</p>



<p>Sensing the change in the atmosphere, Tsuyu hurriedly tried to escape, but.</p>



<p>「Oi, wait.」</p>



<p>One of the men grabbed her shoulder.</p>



<p>「You’re not going to run away after hurting me, are you?」</p>



<p>「Excuse me.」</p>



<p>He couldn’t stand to watch any longer.</p>



<p>So, Kamome stepped in between them.</p>



<p>Tsuyu seemed surprised at Kamome’s sudden appearance.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the two guys glare at Kamome.</p>



<p>「What’s up with you?」</p>



<p>「Are you her boyfriend?」</p>



<p>「Yes, I’m her boyfriend.」</p>

<p>In response to the men’s inquisitive questions, Kamome clearly asserted.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry, she seems to have caused you trouble. Did you get hurt? If it’s okay with you, I’ll go to the hospital with you.」</p>



<p>As Kamome rattled on, the men were at a loss for words.</p>



<p>On top of not being injured, they probably thought it was a waste of time to get further involved with a woman who was with a man.</p>



<p>「It seems you’re okay, then. Excuse us.」</p>



<p>Speaking quickly, Kamome escapes with Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「…Wasn’t it that you couldn’t lie? And you said before that you didn’t want to call another girl your girlfriend, even if it was a lie, because you have Himawari.」</p>



<p>After they got away from the guys, Tsuyu whispered that as they walked.</p>



<p>「It’s not that I can’t lie.」</p>



<p>Kamome answered, still looking forward, to Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「Besides, if telling a lie can settle the situation and help Tsuyu, then I don’t mind.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Hearing that, Tsuyu blushes silently.</p>



<p>「So, Tsuyu. What did you want to talk about?」</p>



<p>When Kamome asks, Tsuyu says, “Well…” and hesitates.</p>



<p>But the only problem she could bring up to Kamome right now… is only one.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu, let’s go somewhere else for now.」</p>

<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>There, looks back at Tsuyu and says.</p>



<p>「The guys from earlier might be near, and it’s hard to go into that café. Let’s go to a quiet place where we can talk.」</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>A pedestrian path along the river, devoid of human presence.</p>



<p>Tsuyu is sitting on a bench installed there.</p>



<p>「Here.」</p>



<p>「…Thank you.」</p>



<p>After handing Tsuyu a carbonated drink he bought from a nearby vending machine, Kamome sat down next to her.</p>



<p>「The consultation… is it about your boyfriend after all?」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>「I’m sorry if I’m wrong. But… I can’t help but worry about it. About Tsuyu and you’re current boyfriend.」</p>



<p>Kamome tells his true feelings to Tsuyu, who is looking down.</p>



<p>「It might not be a problem where I can casually interfere or give advice. Still, I can’t ignore it.」</p>



<p>「Why do you care so much…」</p>



<p>「I’m worried about you, Tsuyu. If all of Tsuyu’s out of behavior up to now is due to him making your mind unstable, I can’t forgive him.」</p>



<p>Kamome declares in a serious tone.</p>



<p>In response to him, Tsuyu falls silent for a moment and then──</p>



<p>「…I told you before, didn’t I?」</p>

<p>Eventually, she slowly opens her mouth.</p>



<p>「It’s true that I was saved by him, and I’ve already gotten used to him.」</p>



<p>「…Yeah.」</p>



<p>「…But lately, I don’t know anymore. I’ve started to lose trust in him.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu looks down sadly.</p>



<p>「It might be out of line to consult with Kamome about this, but…」</p>



<p>「It’s okay, I want to listen. I want you to talk to me.」</p>



<p>If I can be of help to Tsuyu──</p>



<p>Receiving Kamome’s gaze, Tsuyu seems to have made up her mind and starts talking after taking a deep breath.</p>



<p>「I think it started a while ago. He started doing various suspicious things just because he could make money.」</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>「At first, it was cooperation in threatening people, setting traps… in other words, I think he was doing things like a jack-of-all-trades or a blackmailer, getting money from acquaintances. He even asked me to cooperate, but I didn’t feel like it and refused.」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu frowns deeply.</p>



<p>「But lately, he’s been taking on more and more obviously strange jobs as if they were part-time jobs…」</p>



<p>「Like what?」</p>



<p>「…Carrying certain things from a certain person to another certain person. I can’t tell you what he’s carrying.」</p>



<p>…A drug courier.</p>

<p>Kamome’s parents are police officers.</p>



<p>So, he has learned such knowledge from his parents on a daily basis.</p>



<p>What Tsuyu is talking about is the job of hiring a courier to sell drugs to customers.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu, don’t tell me…」</p>



<p>「I’m not doing it. It’s obviously suspicious, and I can’t get on board with it.」</p>



<p>In the end, Tsuyu didn’t cooperate, and her boyfriend didn’t seem to have the guts to actually do it.</p>



<p>「I think… he never got around to doing that.」</p>



<p>Hearing that story, Kamome thought.</p>



<p>Maybe Tsuyu hasn’t changed at the core…</p>



<p>Kamome lost his mother to illness when he was young.</p>



<p>His mother was a former police officer, a colleague of his father’s, and a bright and energetic woman.</p>



<p>A person like the sun.</p>



<p>He might have fallen in love with Tsuyu because he felt her resemblance to his mother.</p>



<p>On her deathbed, his mother told Kamome.</p>



<p>『I’m sure you’ll be fine.』</p>



<p>Even if she were to disappear, Kamome would be able to live strongly.</p>



<p>As she said, the sadness of losing his mother has faded over time.</p>


<p>Now, he’s able to come to terms with it.</p>



<p>The “you’ll be fine” she was talking about probably meant this.</p>



<p>However, on a different note, he was attracted to Tsuyu, who reminded him of her.</p>



<p>It’s also true that he admired Tsuyu herself.</p>



<p>「…Kamome, you said it before.」</p>



<p>There, Tsuyu murmurs.</p>



<p>「That you want me to go back to the old me.」</p>



<p>「Ah, yeah.」</p>



<p>「I can’t go back anymore.」</p>



<p>Suddenly, she turns her sorrowful gaze to Kamome.</p>



<p>「I can’t go back to the old me that Kamome said he admired.」</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu?」</p>



<p>「Kamome, the other day you told me about yourself before we met again, right?.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu looks straight into Kamome’s eyes.</p>



<p>「Now it’s my turn to talk. Listen, Kamome. What happened to me from the time I disappeared from Kamome until we met again.」</p>



<p>With that, Tsuyu began to speak.</p>



<p>As if to spit out something she had been holding inside her.</p>

<p>「I used to… as Kamome said, I was passionate about track and field, I was able to achieve some good results, and I felt a sense of accomplishment. I was able to devote myself wholeheartedly, and everyone around me was happy for my success as if it were their own. Every day was fun and fulfilling…」</p>


<div><img src="https://sinkuredtranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/knav1ilus8.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div><p></p>


<p>“But” ── she lifts her right leg.</p>



<p>「When I was in my second year of high school, I injured my right foot.」</p>



<p>「Eh…」</p>



<p>「I still remember it. I tripped over a hurdle on the track and fell. At that time, a horrible sound that only I could hear pierced my body from my ankle.」</p>



<p>That injury was enough to end her athletic career.</p>



<p>She continued treatment and rehabilitation, but eventually had no choice but to give up being an athlete.</p>



<p>In this way, Tsuyu lost her dreams, hopes, and all the efforts she had built up.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Hearing her story, Kamome was shocked.</p>



<p>In other words, the sprain from the other day.</p>



<p>When he forced Tsuyu to run, her foot malfunctioned not because she had twisted it by chance, but because the injury had caused inflammation.</p>



<p>If she runs at full speed, her foot will immediately scream in pain.</p>



<p>Tsuyu can no longer run as a competitor.</p>



<p>「…Furthermore, during that time, my parents’ divorce overlapped…」</p>



<p>The shock of the collapse of the relationships she trusted was immeasurable.</p>

<p>「Before I knew it, there was a remarriage… I lost both the things I could immerse myself in and the people I could believe in, and I went on to university like an empty shell… At that university, I met him ── Kashiro Akito.」</p>



<p>Kashiro was originally a member of the same high school track and field club.</p>



<p>He had a falling out with the club coach during high school and was expelled from the club, and since then, they hadn’t seen each other, but it seemed that they had coincidentally gone to the same university.</p>



<p>Kashiro reached out to Tsuyu, who was at the bottom of despair.</p>



<p>Days began where she would compensate for her frustration and stress with aimless, momentary pleasures, but at least that became a support for Tsuyu’s heart.</p>



<p>Through such circumstances, she changed.</p>



<p>That was ── until today, all of Tsuyu that Kamome didn’t know.</p>



<p>「I, who had become empty, was happy to be wanted, happy to be needed, so I was easily satisfied.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu, hugging her raised right leg, wraps her arms around it.</p>



<p>Tightly ── while biting her lips.</p>



<p>「When I couldn’t run because of my injury, all that was left was my scarred leg. Even this leg, which I was proud of as a symbol of my hard work on the hurdle walk, I now hate to even look at.」</p>



<p>「Tsuyu…」</p>



<p>──I admired the old Tsuyu.</p>



<p>──I want her to go back to how she used to be.</p>



<p>…Looking back, how cruel it was to say such things to her ── Kamome deeply understood that there.</p>



<p>「…That’s why, I can’t go back to my old self anymore. The confidence and personality that formed the me you admired, the things that backed them up, are no longer left in me.」</p>



<p>Those words seemed more like she was telling herself than telling Kamome.</p>
<p>「No matter how desperately you call out, it’s impossible. The me you admired is as good as dead. For you, Kamome… it’s meaningless for you to be with me anymore.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu says with a face that looks like she’s about to cry.</p>



<p>She feels that her existence is giving Kamome a hope that cannot be fulfilled.</p>



<p>Perhaps she confessed out of guilt for that.</p>



<p>You should get involved unnecessarily with me anymore, she was conveying.</p>



<p>But──</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu, which do you prefer more, old self or your current self?」</p>



<p>To her, Kamome says.</p>



<p>Tsuyu looked up at Kamome in surprise.</p>



<p>「The reason I started track and field was indeed because I admired Tsuyu. There’s no mistake about that. But, I didn’t admire Tsuyu because you were an amazing track and field athlete. I liked the old Tsuyu who was resolute, positive, and shining like the sun. That’s the part of you that’s not completely gone, the part that could tell your boyfriend Kashiro that he was wrong, and cares about me and Himawari.」</p>



<p>「Stop…」</p>



<p>「Most of Tsuyu may have changed. But the part that I wanted to stay the same is still the same as before.」</p>



<p>「Enough…」</p>



<p>At Kamome’s words, which were too straightforward, and at the dazzling purity.</p>



<p>Tsuyu held her chest and hunched her back.</p>



<p>As if looking directly at Kamome itself was painful.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu. I──」</p>

<p>「Forget it already!」</p>



<p>And then, unable to bear it, she let out a painful scream.</p>



<p>「The me you want is no longer here! It’s someone who exists only in your imagination! Stop projecting that ideal onto my current self!」</p>



<p>Even as she says this, Tsuyu sheds tears.</p>



<p>「…Even though there’s no point in thinking about this.」</p>



<p>Choking in tears, she pours out her feelings.</p>



<p>「If Kamome had been the first one I had met when I was at my lowest point, when I was broken… I’m sure that I would have been saved by Kamome… I would have depended on Kamome.」</p>



<p>She probably feels that she has become a shallow person, far from his ideal, to the point where she can imagine such a thing on her own.</p>



<p>She didn’t want to change.</p>



<p>If possible, she wanted to stay the same as before.</p>



<p>「It’s frustrating…」</p>



<p>Before she knew it, Tsuyu was saying it out loud.</p>



<p>With a painful smile at the reality that couldn’t be helped.</p>



<p>Her true feelings.</p>



<p>Her true heart.</p>



<p>「I wanted to remain as the me who was loved by you.」</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>

<p>After crying for a while, she must have calmed down.</p>



<p>「…Himawari, she’s cute, isn’t she.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu, wiping her eyes, slowly lifted her face.</p>



<p>「…She’s innocent, shy, kind, and pure. A girl who works hard for the person she loves. She’s a much more attractive and wonderful girl than I am now. She’s the perfect match for Kamome.」</p>



<p>As if to tell herself, she said.</p>



<p>Tsuyu gave Kamome a gentle smile.</p>



<p>「So, make her happy.」</p>



<p>「Tsuyu…」</p>



<p>At that moment, in her bag, Tsuyu’s smartphone rings.</p>



<p>When she took out her smartphone and looked at the screen, Kamome could see that the light had gone out of her eyes.</p>



<p>「…Sorry, it’s from an acquaintance. They’re asking if I can meet them now. I’m going.」</p>



<p>「…It is that person?」</p>



<p>The person Kamome was referring to was Tsuyu’s boyfriend, Kashiro.</p>



<p>Tsuyu doesn’t say anything.</p>



<p>She just seemed to be unable to bear being here now, and she might have wanted any excuse to run away.</p>



<p>「See you.」</p>



<p>Saying that, Tsuyu stands up from the bench, turns her back on Kamome, and leaves.</p>

<p>「Tsuyu!」</p>



<p>Kamome was shouting at Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「There’s no need for Tsuyu to force herself to change for the sake of those who torment you! You just need to stick to what you have resolved to be! That’s what I think!」</p>



<p>Kamome said, watching Tsuyu’s back as she left.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>After parting with Kamome, Tsuyu walked through the city and arrived at the meeting place.</p>



<p>She couldn’t forget Kamome’s appearance and words from earlier.</p>



<p>Your physical appearance and personality have changed, but the part of you that I admired remained the same, he said.</p>



<p>But Tsuyu is afraid.</p>



<p>She fears that such a thing could easily change with a slight trigger.</p>



<p>Her life and values had easily changed due to injuries and relationships.</p>



<p>When that happens ── with what kind of eyes Kamome Kamome will look at her?</p>



<p>That was what scared her.</p>



<p>(…I can’t cause him any trouble, and I shouldn’t be with him.)</p>



<p>Even though she thought that, Kamome’s face and voice wouldn’t disappear.</p>



<p>Tsuyu was simply anguishing.</p>



<p>「Hey, Tsuyu.」</p>



<p>There, a voice calls out to her from behind.</p>



<p>Standing in front of Tsuyu, who turned around, was Kashiro Akito, the one who had called her.</p>



<p>…Not only him, but his friends were also there.</p>

<p>Kashiro was dressed as usual, and his friends were dressed similarly.</p>



<p>「Akito…」</p>



<p>「You’re really early, did you want to see me that much?」</p>



<p>His face, grinning, looks somewhat reddish.</p>



<p>Was he drinking?</p>



<p>He seems to be in high spirits.</p>



<p>「Hey, listen. You have a younger sister, right? You know, I saw her in the picture you showed me before.」</p>



<p>「…When you looked at my phone data without permission.」</p>



<p>「Don’t sweat the small stuff. So, that photo, I sent it to my phone.」</p>



<p>Saying that, Kashiro shows the screen of his phone.</p>



<p>When her parents remarried, they took a photo with the whole family once.</p>



<p>Tsuyu had saved the photo that Himawari had sent in her phone data.</p>



<p>「You, what a selfish thing are you──」</p>



<p>「Listen. So, your sister, Himawari? This guy likes her.」</p>



<p>Kashiro points to one of his friends with his chin.</p>



<p>A man with dyed hair and a flirtatious air.</p>



<p>「She’s cute, isn’t she, Himawari-chan? I’d like to get closer to her if possible.」</p>

<p>「…You want me to introduce her?」</p>



<p>To the man with a frivolous smile, Tsuyu responds emotionlessly and succinctly.</p>



<p>「Impossible. Because that girl──」</p>



<p>「She has a boyfriend, right? That fucking cheeky brat.」</p>



<p>Remembering the time he met Kamome, Kashiro says as if spitting.</p>



<p>「I wonder if we can make them break up.」</p>



<p>「…Ha?」</p>



<p>At Kashiro’s incredibly nasty remark, Tsuyu felt as if her heart had dropped to the pit of her stomach.</p>



<p>「Well, this guy said he’d give me money if I helped him. So, I thought, how about you lure that brat and create a situation where he’s cheating? We’ll make it look like he came onto you. Then, we’ll catch him in the act and blackmail him into confessing. And then, this guy can approach her when she’s heartbroken, doesn’t that sound good?」</p>



<p>「…Are you an idiot?」</p>



<p>To Kashiro, who was drunkenly grinning and talking about his shallow plan, Tsuyu found herself saying that.</p>



<p>Tsuyu understood that when she truly felt anger from the bottom of her heart, she couldn’t come up with any fancy words.</p>



<p>「Huh? What did you say?」</p>



<p>「I’m saying I’ve had enough of you, you scum!」</p>



<p>She couldn’t feel any feelings other than contempt for the man in front of her.</p>



<p>Tsuyu emotionally lashes out.</p>



<p>「There’s no way I’d do such a thing! Don’t ever show your face in front of me again!」</p>

<p>「…Oi.」</p>



<p>In an instant.</p>



<p>Kashiro, who lost his expression, reaches out to Tsuyu.</p>



<p>His arm, with its bulging veins, roughly grabs Tsuyu’s long blonde hair.</p>



<p>「Tsk!」</p>



<p>「Don’t get cocky, you!」</p>



<p>「O-Oi, Akito, stop it. You’re going too far…」</p>



<p>His friends were taken aback by his rage.</p>



<p>But even hearing their protests, Kashiro didn’t stop.</p>



<p>「You’ve been looking down on me for a long time, haven’t you? You’ve been bossing me around with a pretentious air, telling me what to do and say.」</p>



<p>「What do you mean, bossing you around… It’s just common sense.」</p>



<p>Even while being pulled up by her hair, Tsuyu retorts to Kashiro without adverting her defiant gaze.</p>



<p>「…You know, I’ve never liked you. Even in high school, you were fawned over by everyone and got carried away. You must have made fun of a dropout like me who couldn’t grow or produce results, didn’t you, heeh?」</p>



<p>Almost like a false accusation.</p>



<p>Kashiro rant as if to vent his accumulated resentment.</p>



<p>「When you got injured and couldn’t run, you fell to the same place, and when I was nice to you, you easily opened your heart to me! It was great back then! Now, you’ve become a woman who’s just a pain in the ass! Even so, I keep you around just in case, and this is how things turn out, Haaah!?」</p>



<p>Being violently pulled by her hair and swung around, a sharp pain ran through her scalp.</p>

<p>Even so, Tsuyu continued to glare at Kashiro.</p>



<p>「You should just listen obediently to what I say. It’s not like you can go back to your old self, so don’t act so high and mighty!」</p>



<p>A pain like burning heat is born.</p>



<p>In her body and in her heart.</p>



<p>Tears well up in Tsuyu’s eyes.</p>



<p>Even so, she glares at Kashiro with a determined expression, saying that she absolutely must not give in, that she must not submit.</p>



<p>Then, someone grabbed Kashiro’s arm.</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>「You…」</p>



<p>「Kamome…」</p>



<p>It was Kamome who grabbed his arm.</p>



<p>Tsuyu is also surprised by his sudden appearance.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu, after all, my opinion hasn’t changed.」</p>



<p>While gripping Kashiro’s arm, Kamome asserts.</p>



<p>「You should end our relationship with these people here.」</p>



<p>「…What the hell, you.」</p>



<p>Kashiro releases the hand that was holding Tsuyu’s hair.</p>


<p>「You have nothing to do with this, stay out of it.」</p>



<p>「I do. She is someone important to me.」</p>



<p>Kamome stands between Tsuyu and Kashiro.</p>



<p>He turns his back on Tsuyu as if to protect her, facing Kashiro head-on.</p>



<p>「Please break up with her. Please don’t wish for anything that would trouble her.」</p>



<p>「…What the hell is this guy talking about… Hey, Tsuyu, did you hire him to break up with me?」</p>



<p>Kashiro signals to his friends standing behind him.</p>



<p>They immediately position themselves to surround Kamome.</p>



<p>「Tsuyu does not wish to continue her relationship with you. If you make excessive demands on her or follow her around despite her dislike, that is clear stalking. My parents are police officers, so I hear about these things in detail.」</p>



<p>Upon hearing Kamome’s statement about his parents being police officers there, a wave of unrest spreads among Kashiro’s friends.</p>



<p>「…Oi, Akito… This guy seems like a bit of a hassle…」</p>



<p>「…Shut up!」</p>



<p>Kashiro is nothing more than a small fry who only intimidates the weak.</p>



<p>Having heard Tsuyu’s anecdote from earlier, Kamome is convinced of this.</p>



<p>Perhaps enraged, he shouts at Kamome as if to encourage himself.</p>



<p>「So what! Do you think we’ll be scared if you say your parents are cops!? Aren’t you ashamed!?」</p>



<p>「Yes, I think so. And no, I’m not ashamed.」</p>

<p>Kamome doesn’t think of Kashiro, who has lost his composure, and his friends as frightening.</p>



<p>Even if he didn’t, Kamome has no intention of backing down now.</p>



<p>He responds to Kashiro resolutely.</p>



<p>「If you back off with this, then there’s nothing more to it.」</p>



<p>At Kamome’s attitude, Kashiro’s anger finally reached boiling point.</p>



<p>「Don’t you dare look down on me!」</p>



<p>Kashiro lunges at Kamome.</p>



<p>A full-force punch was slammed into Kamome’s face.</p>



<p>「Kamome!」</p>



<p>Tsuyu cries out in anguish.</p>



<p>However, Kamome withstood the blow.</p>



<p>He steadies himself without falling back, and without any dismay at all, he tells Kashiro.</p>



<p>「…This is my final warning. Don’t touch Tsuyu anymore. Please don’t appear in front of her again.」</p>



<p>「Wh…at…」</p>



<p>Perhaps completely overwhelmed by such Kamome, Kashiro was left wide-eyed and panting, unable to speak.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>But this is as far as Kamome can go.</p>

<p>Of course, he can’t beat up everyone here, and he also doesn’t want to create unnecessary trouble that he can’t control if they break up into rage.</p>



<p>The only thing Kamome can do is to protect Tsuyu.</p>



<p>「…Tsuyu, I’m sorry.」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>A whispering voice.</p>



<p>Immediately after, Kamome grabs Tsuyu’s hand.</p>



<p>「Let’s run!」</p>



<p>And they started running together.</p>



<p>「…Ah, oi, wait, koraa!」</p>



<p>Kashiro and the others were taken aback by the sudden action, but immediately began to chase after Kamome and Tsuyu.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Kamome and Tsuyu run with all their might.</p>



<p>Ahead of them, they see a no-entry barricade.</p>



<p>「Let’s jump!」</p>



<p>「Eh!?」</p>



<p>Communication is instantaneous.</p>



<p>Kamome pulled Tsuyu, and Tsuyu naturally followed that motion.</p>



<p>The two jumped over the barricade as if they were running hurdles in track and field.</p>

<p>「Wait, ugh, gu, bue!」</p>



<p>On the other hand, Kashiro, who was chasing after Kamome and Tsuyu, tried to jump over the barricade in the same way, but his jump fell short, and his foot caught on the barricade, falling flashy.</p>



<p>Without looking back to see what happened to him, Kamome and Tsuyu simply ran away with all their might.</p>



<p>◇◆◇◆◇◆</p>



<p>「Haa… Haa…」</p>



<p>「Haa… Haa…」</p>



<p>At the end of their all-out sprint.</p>



<p>The two, who had arrived at a riverbank somewhere, lay down on the grassy slope, panting.</p>



<p>Their chests were heaving up and down, exposing their feverish bodies to the night wind.</p>



<p>They’re drenched in sweat.</p>



<p>「Haa… Haa… Tsuyu, are you okay──」</p>



<p>After a while, when his breathing had stabilized, Kamome sat up to check on Tsuyu.</p>



<p>But of course──</p>



<p>「ugh…」</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s right foot ── her ankle, is bright red.</p>



<p>It’s completely inflamed.</p>



<p>It’s an even more painful-looking tone than before.</p>

<p>「Tsuyu!」</p>



<p>「I’m fine… Well, I think the pain will subside after a while, but I can’t even walk a step right now.」</p>



<p>「…Sorry, I forced you to run again.」</p>



<p>Kamome can only apologize, but Tsuyu smiles at him.</p>



<p>「No, it’s okay. It hurts, but it doesn’t hurt at all.」</p>



<p>Like that, she says contradictory words.</p>



<p>「But we can’t go home like this… what should we do… maybe a taxi…」</p>



<p>「Nee, Kamome.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu makes a suggestion to the pondering Kamome.</p>



<p>「Can you carry me on your back?」</p>



<p>「Eh?」</p>



<p>「Otherwise, we won’t be able to go home, right?」</p>



<p>「Well… yeah.」</p>



<p>Kamome obediently complies with Tsuyu, who says that with a somewhat refreshing expression.</p>



<p>He ends up carrying her on his back on the way home.</p>



<p>「Fufu… Kamome, your back is big.」</p>



<p>Tsuyu rests her face on the Kamome’s back… on his nape.</p>

<p>「Tsuyu… I’m sweating… so.」</p>



<p>「…Don’t mind it. Your body is warm, Kamome.」</p>



<p>As if seeking physical contact, as if yearning, Tsuyu says.</p>



<p>「……」</p>



<p>Tsuyu’s face is touching his back.</p>



<p>As if in relief, she entrusts everything to Kamome.</p>



<p>Gradually, his heart warms.</p>



<p>Earlier, when he was running with Tsuyu and jumped over the barricade ── he remembered.</p>



<p>The memory of running around the city with Tsuyu when they were children.</p>



<p>The memory of jumping over the barricade in the same way with her, who loved to run.</p>



<p>Back then, he was still weak.</p>



<p>What if I couldn’t jump it, caught my foot, and get seriously injured──</p>



<p>He overcame such fear and jumped with all his might with Tsuyu.</p>



<p>『You did it! Kamome!』</p>



<p>The surprised smile on her face when she looked back at him after jumping over the guard hurdle.</p>



<p>Her dazzling face.</p>



<p>And Tsuyu’s face now.</p>

<p>The two overlap, warming his heart.</p>



<p>Unconsciously, a smile appeared on his face.</p>



<p>That’s right, he can’t deny it anymore.</p>



<p>He is, about Tsuyu.</p>



<p>He is still in love with Tsuyu.</p>
