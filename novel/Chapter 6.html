<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Growth Limit</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Boohiiiiiiiiii!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
scream of an Orc living deep in the first level of the dungeon echoed out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
Orc screamed and swung down the club in his hands.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
young man avoided it just in time and went around to the Orc's back.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
slashes at the Orc's back with his broad two-handed sword.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Bohii!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Orcs
have thick skin, strong muscles, and hard bones.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Normally,
it would be very difficult to cut through them with a sword.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nevertheless,
the two-handed sword in the young man's hand sliced through the Orc like paper.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
Orc screamed in shock. He was slashed from his right shoulder to his left hip
and dies.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Unable
to follow his movement, the hood he's wearing came off, exposing the young
man's face.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">His
honey color blond hair is tied back, he has jewel-like green eyes and pointed
ears.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">His
face was so well-defined that it could be mistaken for a woman's.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
is a typical young man from the elf race.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"So
this is finally the tenth one. ......</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Without
paying attention to his hood that fell off or the Orc, who is still bleeding
and twitching, the young man checked his status screen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
ignores the smell from the ten Orcs' blood, wipes off his sweat, and opens his
status screen with frustration and hope in his eyes.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Damn
it!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
I thought, I can't raise my level with this level of opponent?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
status screen showed "Kaito, 200 years old, elf race, male, level
1500".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
young man named Kaito clenches his teeth when he sees the number.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Level
1500.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Is
this level so low that Kaito is clenching his teeth in deep regret?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">No.
In this world, this number is definitely "extraordinary".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Generally,
the maximum level of an elf, dragon, or demon race is 1000.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">In
other words, Kaito's level of 1,500 is unbelievable, considering his young age
(for an elf) of 200 years old.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But
he is not satisfied; he stabs the two-handed sword in his hand into the ground madly.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'm
a hero with the blood of ......the "Master". It's impossible for me
to reach my growth limit at only level 1500. This is definitely not
right!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">What
is the growth limit?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
is said that once someone reaches a certain number, his or her level will not
increase any further. This is generally referred to as the "growth
limit".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Generally,
level 100 for humans, 200-300 for the beastmen, 500 for the dwarves, 300-1000
for demons, and 1000 for elf and dragonmen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But
that is the common standard only, not absolute limitation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
couldn't accept the reality that he has reached his "growth limit",
so he leaves the Elf Kingdom and explores the dungeon to raise his level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
scratches his head with his right hand.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"That's
right; I'm a descendant of the brave and heroic Master. One day I'll be revered
as the hero. "Growth Limit"? No, this must be a test given to me by
the Goddess! If I level up! If I can break through level 1500, I'll be a hero!
I'll be blessed by the Goddess as a hero!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
stopped scratching his head with his right hand. He was scratching his head so
hard that it bled. Then he looked up at the blue sky of the dungeon with a
bright expression.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"If
the Goddess acknowledges me as the brave man, as the hero, I'll kill all those
idiots in my home country first! I'll kill all those bug humans who dare to
warn me this morning. That gold armour guy party, I'll kill them all!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
remembers what happened this morning and starts to shout loudly as if his anger
has been reignited.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"What
do you mean "Don't cut in"? Who do you think I am! </span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" lang="X-NONE" class="calibre2">In the future, the
Goddess will recognize this Kaito-sama as the brave man, as the hero!</span></span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" lang="X-NONE" class="calibre2">
</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">You
all are just worms who live as stepping stones for us, the elves. How dare you talk
down to me! If it weren't for the problem with the holy sword Grandius, I could
have slashed them all right there! If I am serious, I could have killed them
all in less than a few seconds!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito's
movement stops.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
it would be a waste to kill that silver-haired woman. For a human being, she
had a beauty that I've never seen even in my home country. I'll make her my
servant. </span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" lang="X-NONE" class="calibre2">When
I get bored, or she became ugly, I'll dump her away.</span></span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"> In
the meantime, that woman will be so happy with tears in her eyes to serve me.
Because I am an elf and the future hero."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
truly believed that the silver-haired woman, Nemumu would cry with joy and hug
him when she heard his offer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
is not because there's something wrong with his head.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
men and women of the elf race have beautiful faces.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Therefore,
people generally believed that humans will easily be seduced by the elf's good
looks and obey them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">No human
is not seduced by an elf who whispers his or her love to them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
anger in his chest was suppressed by the fantasy of being embraced and loved by
Nemumu, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
regained his composure and picked up his two-handed sword.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yareyare.......
even though I am going to become the hero in the future, the Goddess still gave
a troublesome test. At any rate, I don't think I can level up no matter how
many weak monsters I deal with on the first level of this dungeon. I'll have to
go deeper to defeat more monsters."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
is so proud of himself that he didn't even take any Orc meat or magic stones as
he walked deeper into the dungeon with his handbag.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
is determined to go deep into the dungeon to overcome the impossible
"Goddess Trials".</span></p>
