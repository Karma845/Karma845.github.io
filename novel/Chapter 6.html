<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Get Stronger quickly with Cheat Skills! ~VS Goblin~ ②</h3>

<p>For an exchange of a greeting, I approached a goblin and slashed it.</p>

<p>Slashing its stomach as if using a knife to cut a cheese cake, its internal organs popped out. (Wooo, guts)</p>

<p>–Kimonhou power increase…… !</p>

<p>A vermilion miasma seeped out from my body.</p>

<p>And, accelerate.</p>
<p>The scenery moved as if it was in slow motion.</p>

<p>A swing of a sword.</p>
<p>The internal organs of the goblin flew out.</p>

<p>Accelerate more– a swing of the sword.</p>
<p>As if a ragged dust cloth, I turned the goblins into skulls.</p>

<p>Slash. (tl: Or ’kill’ if you want, the word is 斬る but for some reason I like to stick with 切る, both is read the same way)</p>

<p>Evade the attack. And then lacerate the goblin’s meat.</p>

<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>
<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>

<p>— I chose the most appropriate options within the countless ways of defeating them.</p>

<p>If I had made a mistake somewhere, I would surely be pushed back by their numbers.</p>
<p>And, I saw from the corner of my eye that Cordelia was being ambushed.</p>

<p>Hastily, I ran towards Cordelia.</p>
<p>Idle thoughts and impatience will lead to mistakes.</p>
<p>I took an arrow to my shoulder. And at the same time, there’s a goblin from behind me pointing a spear at my head.</p>

<p>Without turning my head back to look, I evaded it by tilting my head a little.</p>
<p>A line of blood formed on my cheek from the graze– and, I faced back and slashed.</p>

<p><em>Tsk</em>, I clicked my tongue while I pulled out the arrow.</p>

<p>–To protect a person while fighting is really difficult. No…… Cordelia also did protect me while……</p>

<p>Accelerate. Accelerate. Further accelerate– at full power.</p>

<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>
<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>

<p>–At some point, I’d completely stopped thinking.</p>

<p>The total number of goblins is not more than 400.</p>
<p>Even if I had the advantage, it really doesn’t feel like it to face this much.</p>
<p>My thoughts could not catch up with his body movement.</p>

<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>Not moving after <em>thoughts</em>— but <em>reflexively</em> moving.</p>

<p>In these few years, while I had Bernard-san became my master…… we have crossed swords more than ten thousand times training me to be able to move reflexively.</p>

<p>The spurt of blood had splashed onto my whole body, my eyes refused to open….. I couldn’t even attempt to wipe the blood off.</p>

<p>Cordelia’s now tattered sword does not only has countless of chips in it, there is also a mixture of blood and oil on it.</p>
<p>At that moment, I decided that this blade cannot do its job anymore, I got myself a spear from the dead body of a goblin lying around.</p>

<p>Accelerate. Accelerate. Pushing over the limit — Accelerate.</p>
<p>Both thoughts…… and the body…… accelerate them all.</p>

<p>The lactic acid in my body was building up.</p>
<p>My wrist became heavier and heavier whereas my legs couldn’t move as I wished.</p>
<p>My knees started trembling, and I let out a sigh when my legs fully came to a halt.</p>

<p>This was not caused by the depletion of Magic Point used by the body strengthening techniques.</p>

<p>–Just purely out of stamina.</p>

<p><em>This is a real battle.</em>….. She swallowed her sigh. Cordelia could not let out a smile being the one depleted of MP.</p>

<p>The overly used body (tl: sounds so so wrong) raised a scream, Budum, Budum, Budum– my heart was beating fast. (ドクっ x 3: dokun)</p>

<p>A heavy, heavy, deep breath.</p>
<p>The phrase 火事場の馬鹿力 really defines this situation …… It seems like, my body can still move.(火事場の馬鹿力[kajiba no bakachikara]: when people are in a desperate situation, they let out more power than they have when their power is released. direct translation: fire place の stupid power)</p>
<p><em>Legs…… Move</em>.</p>
<p>Even so, if I I took a vehicle for an example, the gasoline meter in the dashboard would be in the red.</p>

<p>–Of course, I will not last long.</p>

<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>
<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>
<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>
<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>

<p>And at some point, I couldn’t even see the surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>
<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>
<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>
<p>Slash. Evade. Lacerate.</p>

<p>–And when I had noticed, all presences of evil magical type beings were lost.</p>

<p>Using a spear from the goblin as a support, I panted a little while looking up at the sky.</p>

<p>Then, I heard a voice from behind me.</p>

<p>「Lute……? You….. are you really Lute?」</p>

<p>With a shaky voice, Cordelia asked me.</p>

<p>「……Is there anyone else besides me」</p>

<p>「But, you are a villager……」</p>

<p>Her line of sight was directed towards the endless sea of dead bodies.</p>
<p>Half of the pile was done by Cordelia, and the other half was done by me.</p>

<p>「That’s why I had said…… Among the villagers…… I’m the closest to the strongest」</p>

<p>While I laughed bitterly at my own words, Cordelia pouted with a tone as if she could not accept it.</p>

<p>「…… Probably, you’ve hunted the last hundred goblins right?」</p>

<p>After thinking for a while, I nodded my head.</p>
<p>Even though my whole body was covered in cuts, my body screaming for rest…… I could still move.</p>

<p>My Magic Point has not even depleted by 10% yet.</p>

<p>「A villager stronger than a hero…… You…… what kind of trick……?」</p>

<p>A<em> trick.</em>….. I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>「Truly a trick. In actuality, there <em>are </em>tricks」 (tl: I just want to mention that people these days or only the people around me don’t get <strong>sarcasm</strong>. Sometimes, I really want to strangle them)</p>

<p>「……?」</p>

<p>When Cordelia tilted her head to the side, I felt a heavy pressure from behind me. (small spoiler for easy understanding: wind pressure)</p>
<p>Her face turned blue when she noticed the presence behind me.</p>

<p>It seems like my ride has arrived</p>

<p>「……Aa…… Aa…… a…… Awawaa……」 (tl: stuttering like <a href="http://www.starico-05.com/stamp/detail_12/a339274/024.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> and <a href="http://www.starico-03.com/stamp/detail_9/a249964/017.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> )</p>

<p>Her sight made her speechless.</p>
<p>I turned to the back.</p>

<p>「Hehe……Didn’t you arrive a bit too slow? I finished them…… all by myself?」</p>

<p>There was simply a huge red dragon.</p>
<p>Its length is more than 15 metres, as if time stops from the pressure released by the gigantic body.</p>

<p>「Fate brought me here…… I’ve gotten an oracle about a danger faced by a young one– by the looks of it……. what happened here……?」</p>

<p>The dragon looks at me with a quizzical look.</p>

<p>「Just read my thoughts. That will be faster.」</p>

<p>The dragon squinted his eyes and made a shocked expression (tl: really? the dragon-san did? how?)</p>

<p>「I gave a troublesome word…… With this, I must bring you to the Dragon’s Residence.」</p>

<p>Without thinking, I whistled.</p>

<p>「Really word for word?」</p>

<p>「Dragons…… do not lie」</p>

<p>「Then, I’ll have you take me there?」</p>

<p>The dragon and I nodded our heads, and I walked towards the dragon.</p>
<p>And, I heard Cordelia’s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>「……Lute? Where…… you…… Where are you trying to go to?」</p>

<p>「It’s the Dragon (Residence). I will not be back in a few years</p>

<p>「……………………In the…… Dragon (Residence)?」</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders and said.</p>

<p>「There are secrets to my power.In actuality, there are tricks…… that is the fruit of effort…… it is like that」</p>

<p>「…… Why…… into the Dragon (Residence)……?」</p>

<p>「You are a Hero. Now, I may be stronger than you. However, at this rate, you will overtake me in 1-2 years time…… That’s why I’m doing this」</p>

<p>Cordelia closed her eyes.</p>

<p>「…… The fact of you becoming a being out of the norm…… can be seen from the dead goblin bodies………… You will selfishly go to another place…… become stronger just like a monster…… saving a hero even though you are just a mere villager…… Selfishly disappear from the village for a few more years?」</p>

<p>「It is something that is needed. To be a normal person while being shoulder to shoulder….. this is needed」</p>

<p>「Of course! If you want to be stronger than a hero being a villager, you should have put tremendous effort using unthinkable ways to be that strong! At a place that I don’t know of…… selfishly…… unknowingly doing reckless things alone! I don’t like this…… I really don’t like to just keep quiet and see these things happening!」</p>

<p>「No…… Even though you say that you don’t like this……」</p>

<p>「In the first place, to be on shoulder to shoulder with me…… we don’t really need that right? You are a villager and I am a Hero…… Isn’t it good enough to let me protect you? You don’t have to put effort recklessly into something like that right?」</p>

<p>「No, but you……」</p>

<p>Then, she frustratedly stomped her feet.</p>

<p>「I hate this…… Are you expecting me to say it out?」</p>

<p>「Hate? What are you talking about?」</p>

<p>「I absolutely……. hate it……」</p>

<p>「Hate? That’s why I’m asking, what is it?」</p>

<p>With teary eyes, she shouted.</p>

<p>「About not being able to see Lute for a few years…… I’m saying that I hate it! I didn’t give you my consent! It’ll cause problem for me if you decide everything on your own!」</p>

<p>Really…… This child is so troublesome…… way from before…… really troublesome.</p>
<p>I mean, me going with the dragon should be my own will, I don’t need your permission for it.</p>

<p><em>Haa..</em>…. I let out a small sigh.</p>

<p>「…… I won’t say goodbye」</p>

<p>I walked towards Cordelia.</p>

<p>「–I will be back for sure」</p>

<p>And, I hugged her and kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>「……………………Hoe? </p>
 and she made a ふにゃあ[funya] expression.</p>
<p>And her muscle from her hips relaxed, she fell to the floor.</p>

<p><em>Yosh</em>, taking this opportunity, I walked to the dragon and activated Physical Strengthening.</p>
<p>I jumped onto the dragon’s back.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/s555VXS/default-8.jpg"></img>

<p>「As a goodbye…… Is this okay?」</p>
<p>The dragon said that with a half-smiley voice, I said with embarrassingly.</p>

<p>「I said I will definitely be back. That’s why this is enough」</p>

<p>「In actuality, You won’t be back in just a few years」</p>

<p>「I will be back…… surely. That’s why it’s okay like that.」</p>
<p>The crimson dragon stretched out its wings and took flight.</p>

<p>Flight.</p>
<p>It flapped its wings, and slowly raised its elevation.</p>
<p>And at that time, I heard Cordelia voice from below.</p>

<p>「Idiot! Lute is an idiot! You don’t decide everything by yourself….. you…… idiot!!! When you come back, I will not listen to you anymore!」</p>

<p><em>Really, you never changed from your childhood……</em></p>
<p>Then, stray tears made its ways down my cheeks.</p>

<p>And– the dragon didn’t ask about the silent tears streaming down my cheeks.</p>
