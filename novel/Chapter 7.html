<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Getting stronger quickly at the Dragon Village! â‘ </h3>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better come here when the day before yesterday.&#8221;<br />
Its feels like the shortcut&#8217;s distance is only a few shoulder length. [TN: can you call that shortcut?]
<p>And the one who said that is a woman with light blue coloured hair and wearing white robe.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why, I want to see the Dragon King&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, I am at the Dragon&#8217;s Great Library.</p>
<p>That woman with a light blue hair is sitting on the reception desk&#8230;. She is a librarian.</p>
<p>By the way, it seems her age is same as me, around 12 years old&#8230;&#8230; She looks young as a librarian. [TN: don&#8217;t judge woman by their appearance, that&#8217;s rude]
<p>The Dragon Village&#8217;s residents.</p>
<p>A secret place where in the deepest part of great forest, in the middle of the continent.</p>
<p>That city existed on the Kilra(Kirura/Kirra) plateau that passed through the rugged mountain. [TN: I&#8217;m not sure in this line]
<p>There are many building made from stone lining up on the mountain surface.</p>
<p>I wonder, this place image is closer to Machu Pichu, a highland city ruins of the ancient Incan empire in the &#8220;Earth&#8221;.(Machu Pichu is in Peru, andes mountain above &#8216;what is it name again?&#8217; valley, if I&#8217;m not wrong)</p>
<p>Because it is the place called the dragon village, I thought this place is extremely big at first, actually it is not like that.</p>
<p>The size of this village is no different than the human&#8217;s according to the humanization law. [TN: umm&#8230; why?]
<p>The reason is because that is unnecessary to build that big, and more economical, that is also including their body size. [TN : &#8230;.. well, i accept that reason]
<p>The library is exception, this place is insanely wide.</p>
<p>And&#8230; even i can&#8217;t see the edge of this place because how wide this place, something like that.</p>
<p>The bookshelf and the aisles are intermingled like a maze, and from the inside its structure is completely unknown.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can&#8217;t estimate its size just from the appearance alone.</p>
<p>You see, this place is part of the Dragon King&#8217;s castle, and i do not know where part is library and where part is the castle.</p>
<p>Its easier to say this place is very wide and big.</p>
<p>&#8220;Behold!&#8230;.Dragon King-sama&#8230;.entering the palace!&#8221; [TN: not sure in this line too]
<p>A scary face with a beautiful nice middle beard.</p>
<p>Unlike humans, from their limbs to fingertips are covered with red scales&#8230;. Well, it was this Oldman (Ossan) is the reason why I am here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ooh&#8230; that is &#8230;. the Dragon King-sama&#8221;</p>
<p>I nodded satisfiedly after I said that.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Give me your status plate quickly. I have another works to do&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to meet the Dragon King, this is the reception, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>The librarian silently nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Here is a Great Library, and this is your first time here&#8230;. also The Great Naga (? Raw : Naga Shin-zoku) is the current name of Dragon King relaying the requirements of the Royal Palace is very busy. And only the selected person can meet him there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to know&#8230;. what I want to do there&#8230; I am in a hurry&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; don&#8217;t call me &#8216;you'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I am Lilith. I have a name that my parents give me&#8221;</p>
<p>Lilith wrapped her eyebrows grumpy.(like &#8220;Hmmmph!&#8221; maybe?)</p>
<p>&#8220;Aa- I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8221; [TN: Hello &#8216;sorry&#8217;, I&#8217;m your dad]
<p>Somewhat, I become too pushy. I will reflect on this.</p>
<p>Nonethless, I can&#8217;t get dragon protection without meet the Dragon King first. If I can&#8217;t get it&#8230;.. I can&#8217;t level up for a while.</p>
<p>Even after I killed those lot of goblins, my level is still 1.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems my body refused to recieve experience value&#8230;.(in terms of RPG is EXP for experience point if you didn&#8217;t know)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.hmm&#8221;</p>
<p>Lilith hand out her palm toward me.</p>
<p>According to her action, I gave my status plate to her.</p>
<p>Then she nodded, she took out a crystal ball from under the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Resident registration start&#8230;. Permission to stay in Dragon city&#8230;. Request to meet The Great Naga&#8230;..Registered under the red dragon.&#8221; [TN: sorry, i&#8217;m bad at this line]
<p>In order to live in the dragon village, an underwriter&#8217;s identity is required.</p>
<p>Basically, the dragon tribe tends to disgust human beings (race?)&#8230;or disregard the existance of unafforded tribe/race.</p>
<p>They are proud of being a noble species, the weak species who crawl on the ground for them aren&#8217;t worth for them, that is their nature to not getting involved to other race as much as possible.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Dragons doesn&#8217;t like troublesome things like violence or slaughter, you can say their temper is close to word aloof.</p>
<p>That is a reason for their own ecology, like&#8230;.. We live solitary alone in closed zone so?, or are they actually making flock of strong personel at this village?</p>
<p>Well, naturally, this place is usually not a place where humans are allowed to live.</p>
<p>However, there are exceptions.</p>
<p>If you are human that can be recognized by dragon like &#8220;Your identity are worthy enough to be admitted by us and we guarantee it&#8221;, the dragon are only want to accept someone by their power alone as collateral, and that is why you are allowed to stay in this village as special case. [TN: I know what they mean but, i can&#8217;t describe it in this line]
<p>So, why I can stay in here is thanks to that Uncle from Red Dragon tribe as an intervention&#8230;. well, if every process is smooth without problem. (who? that Dragon King?)</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, why I can&#8217;t meet the Dragon King?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;what a persistent fellow. The Great Naga is a proud being and it is a miracle that someone from outside can stay in this village, including me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Lilith also a human?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you look closely, you cant see any scalp on her hands. [TN: this MC is rude.]
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.so&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;well, that aside, How can I supposed to meet with the Dragon King?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lilith sigh-ed at my answer and about to explain to me boldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;For what purpose do you think I keep your status plate, and are planning to register your number now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;*sigh&#8230;The Great Naga are the proud being. Even though your identity are accepted&#8230;.. There is still a restriction&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;. I will measure the extent of that restriction from now, and while you stay here, I will give you this bracelet.&#8221;</p>
<p>After she said that, Lilith pointed at the white bracelet on her wrist.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of bracelet is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The bracelet is a measurement tool according to rank as a result&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lilith pointed to the gold line around her bracelet.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The rank is divided into 1 to 5 gold lines. If its 5, its mean the status are equal to dragan complety. So&#8230; if it is only 1 line, your rights are hardly recognized.&#8221; (she mean &#8216;existance&#8217; maybe)</p>
<p>By the way, Lilith&#8217;s bracelet gold lines is 3.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;There is more restrictive for small fish&#8230;if your gold line is 1. Its also rude if you listen to other dragon&#8230;and sometimes you are killed just by that&#8230;you can&#8217;t complain. There are also restriction to enter some buildings and sometimes even you want to exit the building too.&#8221; [TN: whoaa&#8230;. just, whoaaa]
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.I see&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;And there is also condition to meet the Dragon King. If your power can reach the dragon&#8217;s rank standart&#8230;. well something like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fumu, I put my hand at my chin.</p>
<p>I understand now, it seems social standings is perfectly formed by force.</p>
<p>Whether it is proud being or you can say aloof&#8230;. Well, I heard this tribe/race is have a strange way of thinking&#8230;..</p>
<p>&#8220;So, how much status limit do I need to meet him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The condition limit is severe. There are 5 gold lines&#8230;. a condition either HP or MP exceed 10.000. If it is a human, its level is called A rank class adventurer&#8230;. Its quite difficult condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is that so, I nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not say that to me first&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, Lilith tilted her head a little and her sight to my status plate for the first time. And she opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What is this&#8230;. no&#8230;. but&#8230; this is&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Shaking her head to left and right like saw something unbelievable, she is trembling on the spot suddenly. [TN: Poor her]
<p>Then he operate the crystal ball and though something in her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;. I already have audience reservation with Dragon King, two hours from now&#8230;and it is fine to go during the audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haah!!?&#8221; [TN: fix. I love her more than Corde- *ahem, forget that]
<p>What make me surprised was that Uncle of Red Dragon.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? What are you doing Librarian-san? It is an audience reservation with the Dragon King&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lilith shake her head and back to reality, and presented the status plate to the uncle of red dragon.</p>
<p>And that uncle make a startle expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I can&#8217;t believe it&#8230;. you are&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>No no no no!<br />
The one who should surprised is me.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t have to be surprised that much, have you read my heart and memory?&#8221;</p>
<p>That uncle shrugged his shoulder and said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; I only read the mind and memories if I permitted. I brought you here because I knew your circumstances in general&#8230; what was done in your third life. Well&#8230; I do not know your current status now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;. Its because I have Magic Barrier in my heart, I thought it was strange.&#8221; (is he means MC heart or his own? idk)</p>
<p>&#8220;Magic Barrier?&#8221;</p>
<p>Haa&#8230; that uncle sighed, with a pale coloured and discomfort face along with his expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Magical power over 2000&#8230;. I can&#8217;t believe it, really. even Dragon King won&#8217;t be able to read your memory&#8221;</p>
<p>He~<br />
Somehow I aware of it, but it seems I&#8217;m growing too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, hallucinate, confuse, charm and petrify&#8230; it&#8217;s very hard to tell your spiritual condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>That relieved me.</p>
<p>I was planning to get various skills to counter the abnormal status effect&#8230;It seems that I could save the trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.audience with Dragon King&#8230;even though he is human&#8230;.audience&#8230;what is this, a rare event.&#8221; [TN: Mediiiic! she loses it!]
<p>There seems to be a lot of things to think about like what this uncle do.</p>
<p>Well, it is good enough&#8230; and I smiled.</p>
<p>-Apparently even at the dragon village&#8230;..it seems they strengthening the village at a fast pace.</p>
