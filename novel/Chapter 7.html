<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; The Young Adventurers</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Aren't
those the adventurers we saved this morning?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
was our first day in the dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
first day we entered the dungeon, we reached the third level with the power of
SSR, Presence Concealment and SR, Flight.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">We
are in the middle of flying back to the surface after defeating a group of
ogres on the second level and a group of trolls on the third level and only
bringing back the magic stones.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">By
the way, I planned to collect items other than Ogre and Troll's magic Stone,
but I thought it would be a problem if I let people know that I had an item
box. Item box is very rare in this world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
will be troublesome if I attract government's attention before I could raise my
adventurer rank.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
thought about taking it back to Naraku, but I'm already using a trick to keep
drawing out cards from Infinite Gacha.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">So I
have no worries about supplies.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Bringing
back low-grade preys such as ogres and trolls would only be a hassle.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">So
we are on the way to the Adventurer's Guild with only the Ogre and the Troll's Magic
Stone as proof that we had reached the second and third levels.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
we are flying to the first level entrance, three green shadows jump out of the
forest.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I point
at those shadows. The goblins, the boys and a girl, have started fighting.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They
are the young adventurers that we meet this morning.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gold
and Nemumu looked down at the battle from above.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"My
Lord, I'm surprised that you can notice them. Surely those are the same young
men we helped this morning."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......It's
a low-level battle, unworthy to be watched by Dark-sama."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As Nemumu
pointed out, they are fighting very hard and only paying attention to the three
goblins in front of them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
three of them are fighting one on one with the goblins, and the leader's sister
is behind them with her staff in her hand, ready to support them at any time.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
goblins are only about the size of a child, so they are unlikely to be defeated
if they fight one on one.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
not a bad idea to have a magician girl positioned behind them to support when
necessary, but......</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
focused too much on the fight in front of her. She didn't notice a Bush Snake
sneaking behind her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
bitten by a bush snake, one will be temporarily paralyzed and unable to move.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
poison won't kill the prey, but if there are other monsters around, the prey
may literally be killed because she won't be able to move and fight back.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Therefore,
when low or mid-level players are fighting in a party, it is standard practice
to have at least one person on the watch for back attacks.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"What
are we going to do, Lord?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
it goes badly, the girl behind may get bitten. If we shout, it may surprise
her, their vanguard may lose their concentration worried about her, and the
goblins may kill them."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
think it would be a bad idea to overlook this ... Let's give them a hand."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">With
the power of "SSR, Presence Concealment", I landed behind her without
any sound, sign or shadow, and took care of the bush snake with the staff in my
hand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu
and Gold followed behind me and landed on the grassland.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Okay,
we all defeated the goblins safely!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Let's
take out the magic stone before the other monsters arrive. You, the boy from
this morning?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"It's
a basic knowledge to pay attention to the enemy in front of you, but they don't
always come from the front. If you don't watch your back, you could lose your
life in the worst way. Look at this."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
youngster shouted in surprise when we appeared behind them without any sound or
sign.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
little sister was so surprised that she backed away.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
let out a slight chuckle under my mask and hold up the bush snake that I broke
its neck with my staff.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">From
my words and the bush snake corpse, they understood that they had been saved
from danger.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The leader
of the group hurriedly bows his head.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thank
you for saving my sister. Miya, you should thank them, too.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thank,
thank you so much!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
little sister, who was called Miya, bows her head.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"We
also wanted to thank you for saving Miya-chan. But, when did you guys come up
behind us?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
well-mannered boy asks, while expressing his gratitude.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
only place to hide is in the woods in front of where the goblins came out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
rest is grassland, so if we approached, they should have noticed us because of
the sound of grass being stepped on and the golden armour reflection.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">And
yet, we suddenly appeared like ghosts.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
is impossible not to be curious.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
there is no way I can honestly say that I used my "SSR, Presence
Concealment" to hide and "SR, Flight" to fly down from the sky.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I'll
just fool them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"We
walked here normally. It seems that everyone was so focused on the battle that
no one noticed. Are you sure you don't want to collect the magic stone?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"That's
right. Gimra, Wardy, let's quickly collect the magic stone. Miya, keep an eye
on the area."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Gold,
dismantle the bush snake and save the magic stone for me."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yes,
leave it to me."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Their
leader instructed them to start working.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
gave Gold the bush snake I had defeated and instructed him to take out the
magic stone.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Regardless
the goblin is inside, or outside of the dungeon, the only part of the goblin
that is redeemable for cash is the magic stone. The bush snake's flesh is very
cheap, but we can sell it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
it would be a burden and troublesome to bring it back, so I only collect the
magic stone.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Erio
Onii-chan, as our gratitude......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"We
haven't used it yet today, so I guess we can afford it. Miya, please."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
she looked like Miya, the red-haired sister is a magician, and when she focused
her mind, she began to cast spells.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Magic,
manifest, and form water. Water Ball!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
ball of water appears in the air.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
is basic water magic, but you won't have a water supply problem in the dungeon</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"><span>&nbsp;</span>if you can use it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
magician who can use it will be wanted by teams that dive dungeons for long
periods.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
older brother, Erio called out Gold.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Knight-sama,
we've brought out some water. Please wash your hands."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thank
you for the trouble."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
thank you for saving my sister. It's just a small token of our gratitude."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Miya,
please give some to us too!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
well-behaved Jack and the tall boy called Wardy stick their hands into a water
ball floating in the air.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">We
wash our hand from the Bush Snake and Goblin blood.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They
purposely let their magician use her limited magic power and offer the water to
wash our hands.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
felt their sincerity.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
an experienced dungeon explorer, I thanked him for this.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thank
you for using your precious magical power to create water."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
thank you very much for helping my sister. This morning and just now you've
helped us a lot....... I don't know what to say."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
morning, we're also going to suffer a loss, and this time, we accidentally saw
it and felt that we shouldn't overlook it. I should have said something, but
since everyone was so focused on the fight, I thought it would be dangerous, so
I did it without permission."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thank
you very much for your kindness."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Dark-sama,
it seems the enemies are coming."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">While
Erio and I were having a conversation between the leaders, Nemumu interrupted
us.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu,
a level 5,000 assassin, said that the "enemies" are coming.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
turned my attention from the conversation to searching for the enemy and
quickly spotted them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The enemies
with their four legs are coming from the depths of the forest.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Their
speed is much faster than the boys and girls in front of me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Grrrr!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Grea,
Great Bush Wolf!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
two meters tall grass-coloured wolf, the Great Bush Wolf, appears.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Several
bush wolves were also following him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Why
a Great Bush Wolf who should be in the middle or deepest part of the first
level show up in this area!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Erio,
who had been having a friendly conversation with me just now, shouted in panic.
</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"We're
no match for them!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Let's retreat for now!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Knight-sama,
please cooperate with us to retreat!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Retreat
means you all won't be fighting them? I'll deal with them you don't mind."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"That,
that's fine, but..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Gold,
Nemumu, it's a wolf hunt."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">At
my words, the two of them took out their weapons.</span></p>
