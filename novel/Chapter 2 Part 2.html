<b>Part 2</b></span>

</p><span style="font-size: medium;">That night, Asahi barely kept up with time and opened the window at 9 pm. Senpai chuckled at him&#8212;this must be because of Asahi's panic. Senpai knew why Asahi was so confused. Last night, Asahi told Senpai about Aki&#8212;even though she didn't say it in detail, Senpai knew that Aki was staying at Asahi's house for family reasons.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Aki is the type of person who will hug tightly the person she likes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai leaned her&nbsp;elbow on the armrest, pushed her&nbsp;body forward slightly, and asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did Aki refuse to take a shower today?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Yes. What to say... Even if she knew that I had something to do at 9, she refused to leave... After today's meal, she stayed there the whole time. In the living room. She had been chatting with me the whole time. Because she didn't want to go, so I sacrificed the heavens&#8212;&#8212; "Smells really bad..."."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This trick didn't work the first time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What did she say to you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"She said to me with a satisfied look&#8212;I showered yesterday, and there's no way it stinks."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though it didn't smell, the temperature had gone up a lot&#8212;he'd gone to college. I really don't know where her&nbsp;confidence comes from.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aki is so cute."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;When I really want to see it, I can't say such things. She's too selfish, how should I put it&#8230; She seems to treat me as her own. I couldn't go out since I was a kid. Although troublesome, she wasn't a bad person. She always felt that she wasn't very good at controlling her emotions&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I feel the same way about this. I'm not good at it either."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi couldn't help but wonder: Huh? Senpai too? ...Not good at controlling your feelings?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">How could this happen. Senpai is the &#8220;Everyone's Goddess&#8221; that everyone is ashamed of. Asahi was confused, Senpai started to fiddle with her hair with one hand. Hair slid between slender fingers, as if covering a sky full of stars.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi recalled the conversation with Tsubasa in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8230;&#8230;opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai. Can I ask you a question?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Just ask. You can ask the answer to your question."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai smiled - but Asahi wouldn't be satisfied just because he answered the question, and didn't want to know the answer to it. No, she still wants to know.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason Asahi proposed to start chatting at 9 o'clock every night was to understand what kind of person Senpai was, so as to find the answer to that question on her own. She didn't want to know the outermost things, but wanted to explore the deeper parts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;My first meeting with Senpai was here, on the first day I moved. Did the Senpais meet anything good the day or before that? &#8230;Why is Senpai laughing?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mmm, Hehe. It's fine. Are you talking about something that makes me happy enough to talk to other people?... If I insist, it's a cat."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Cat?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I picked up an abandoned cat during spring break. But my family is allergic to cat dander, and my family can't keep it. I left it with my friend, and I've been looking for its owner during that time - I found it that day. I'm in the mood that day.... Asahi-kun, can I ask you a question too?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is the problem?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Does Asahi-kun belong to Aki?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">-Just like that, the two of them talked for a while. During this time, Asahi was also thinking: &#8230; If this is the case, the reason why Senpai didn't open the curtain and go to the balcony on the first night was just because she was in a good mood? Is it just because you're in a good mood to make mischief?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Or, it's not Senpai's time&#8212;but Asahi's time?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa said that she was spoken to by her&nbsp;Senpai when she had no way of going on without her&nbsp;father.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At that time, Asahi had not forgotten his father. Every day I spent with Senpai very happily, even though the wound hadn't healed, Asahi no longer felt disappointed. Did Senpai feel something on Asahi's body that night?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is there something that Senpai can't let go of&#8212;&#8212;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this time, Asahi suddenly realized something.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He didn't think of anything.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Instead, I noticed that Senpai who was still happily talking about the cat pattern she liked just now, her facial expression suddenly changed&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8230;Senpai's expression was like a ghost.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Calm is lost. The senpai immediately covered her&nbsp;mouth, her&nbsp;face expressionless. She didn't say a word, and there was no more movement in her&nbsp;body. She looked straight behind Asahi&#8212;at the door of Asahi's room. There was a squeaking sound&#8212;before Asahi fully understood what was going on, the first thing Asahi thought of was the word "lock the door".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is the door... really locked?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi did not remember that he had locked the door. This was because Aki who refused to take a bath, clung to him and made him almost miss the time agreeing with his Senpai, who was too panicked. After Asahi confirmed that Aki had closed the locker room door, she went straight up the stairs&#8212;one might even say out of breath. She ran to the room, closed the door with his foot, and opened the curtain directly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's right&#8212;Asahi forgot to lock it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her voice was closer than he thought. Asahi didn't want to believe it&#8212; he turned her head shakily. Only then did he know that the clicking sound he had just heard was not the sound of a door opening. Instead, Aki quietly opened the door and entered the room, turning her back to the sound of locking the door with her hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A provocative smile appeared on the corner of Aki's mouth, she looked at Senpai through the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You guys really enjoy talking.... No wonder you care so much about yesterday. It would be a lie to let me take a shower. I came in earlier than Asahi's mother. I eavesdropped in the hallway and thought it was like that&#8212; So I turned the doorknob. Are you being too careless?... First time I met you. What's your name?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi called out "Aki Nee-san"&#8212;his voice was trembling and panicked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Aki walked to the window and was next to Asahi, she put one hand on the window sill and the other on Asahi's shoulder. Aki had a problem&#8212;after entering the battle state, her voice would seem very pleasant. The voice from Aki's mouth sounded very happy&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know everything about Asahi. I know a lot of things that you don't.... If possible, would you like me to tell you something about Asahi? ???"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Under Aki's gaze and Aki's words&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's hand gripped the balcony handle tightly. There was a strong feeling deep within her&nbsp;pupils, rising like flames. The senpai showed an expression that Asahi had never seen before.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi recalled the memories from the past.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;It was the only time in Asahi's life when he received a love letter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki, who was in the third grade of junior high school at the time, went to meet the girl who wrote the love letter without telling Asahi. She lay in ambush in front of the main entrance of the elementary school where she also attended three years ago, waiting for the girl who came home from school with her classmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl seemed to have only told one or two very close friends about her love letter, but she didn't tell anyone else. But Aki said nonchalantly in front of the girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;Do you know my stuff?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As for why she used an older sister tone, it remained a mystery until now. However, she did say it. At that moment, there was a huge commotion in front of the main entrance. After that, Asahi found out about this and got very angry at Aki-how could you do such a thing! Why are you doing this! Aki who was asked for anger answered with disgusting words</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">- because I don't have a boyfriend. I don't want to see Asahi have a girlfriend at all. Asahi can't have a girlfriend before I have a boyfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi received quite a shock-Aki, who was in the third grade of junior high school, was lying on the ground, placing the comic book she was reading on her chest, and she laughed twice&#8230;showing an expression that looked like a grown-up smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;Furthermore, I hope Asahi can have a strong love...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;No matter how you put it, you can't just say your own wish as soon as you appear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span>OKAY. Do not be angry. Come and play with me?</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At least, in Senpai's case, it wasn't a sentence that could be dropped once you weren't angry. Asahi had reached the first grade of high school, and would no longer ask him to do the same things he did in the fifth grade of elementary school. Asahi clenched his teeth and calmed down. He tightly grabbed Aki's wrist and pulled her--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aki Nee-san, let's talk about it later! You go out first&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai on the balcony who prevented Asahi from acting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No. Asahi, there's no need"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's voice was neither panicked nor scared. However, Asahi felt an unprecedented pressure in her&nbsp;voice. Just hearing her&nbsp;voice made his back sweat. &#8230;&#8230;What is wrong? &#8212;&#8212;Asahi looked at that Senpai again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm quite worried. I wonder what she can say to me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Undeniably, Asahi was taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai was very annoyed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As people often say - it is very scary for a beautiful woman to get angry. It's the same with this sentence&#8212;the faces of countries and cities are even more terrifying. No one had ever seen the angry expression of "Everyone's Goddess" - like fire raging from behind, and that enthusiasm made Asahi shudder even more.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi never thought about it himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That senpai was about to explode in anger like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Aki-san, good night. My name is Himi Kanako. Do you think I don't know about Asahi?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai said so, and slowly let go of her&nbsp;clasped hands. She rested her&nbsp;elbows on the armrests again, and protruded a little. If you're just talking about movement, Senpai only changes posture-but for some reason, this posture seems to be fighting. Tonight, the atmosphere is tense. Asahi called out to his senpai, but his senpai was still staring at Aki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki tilted her&nbsp;head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh? I want to ask, why do you think you know Asahi well? Amazing. Our relationship started from the day Asahi was born, no, since Asahi was still in his mother's womb, When did you start talking to Asahi? If you talk to Asahi here , that means that you only met Asahi after moving here, right? It hasn't even been three months."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you just look at the profile, Aki will be like chatting with friends happily-but the atmosphere around her&nbsp;is lively. Asahi called out to Aki again, but Aki didn't even look at Asahi, but looked straight at Senpai. Senpai replied,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How about this? I know a lot of things about Asahi-kun - only I know, but Aki doesn't. Just now Asahi-kun told me about you. However, Aki doesn't seem to be following. Did you hear anything about me from Asahi-kun?" kun? Obviously you stayed at Asahi-kun's house yesterday, and you're staying here today &#8212; I just wanted to say this. I want to ask, what is your "Asahi"?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh! It turned out like this, look at this little girl, was it my sentence that made your boyfriend angry? I understand your mood. However, since Asahi was very young, ever since he had a mole on his ass, Asahi is mine. I don't I'll let you take her away suddenly. I've seen Asahi's little dick a few times."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;... Little dick&#8212;!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Aki Nee-san!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi couldn't help but scream- But Aki grabbed Asahi's face tightly with one hand. Senpai was frozen on the spot- Aki smiled slightly. She seemed to have discovered his Senpai's weakness&#8212;this fellow was really bad.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki gestured about five centimeters long with her thumb and forefinger&#8212;this was too harsh, wasn't it? Is this belittling other people?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;This is Asahi's little dick. Understand little girl, do you understand?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Small dick. Repeat after me. Small dick&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Listen to me. Dick, look at dick. Come on, little girl, Asahi-kun's dick&#8212;&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;&#8212;What's with Asahi-kun's little dick!!!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Say the words out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai was blushing, she had been leaning her elbow on the armrest, but now she was holding it tightly with her hand. The metal armrests creaked and screamed, and the Senpai clenched her&nbsp;teeth tightly, and said angrily-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What happened to Asahi-kun's dick and his mole! I don't think he bathed with you when he was little to let you see what happened! After all, they are sibling! Even though I don't have a small dick, I also have a mole. on my ass like the Goto Islands at the time! All Japanese! Can you say something more psychological!?" (TLN: Goto Islands is a city in Nagasaki prefecture, Japan)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi's first love was me"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Asahi-kun!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai looked at Asahi. This line of sight questioned him. Even if she didn't say it, she still asked her what happened? Asahi panicked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No... then it can't be said that it was first love! I was still in kindergarten, and it can't be said that it was love&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"We also agreed to get married."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki continued to chase.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai fought back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You always talk about things when you were little, it's like saying that it might not happen now! Do you understand this!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But I kissed Asahi."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Didn't I tell you everything...! Then? It must have happened when Asahi was one and two years old! Can you not infect the promising baby with dental caries&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"When Asahi was in the third grade of elementary school, we kissed too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8212;Asahi-kun!?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Aki Nee-san! It was just an ordinary accident! It was just a scratch after the collision. Don't count this, and tell Senpai...!?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was different from telling Tsubasa. In a layered sense, telling Aki about the affair between Asahi and Senpai would only make the situation even more tangled. So Asahi didn't want to talk to Aki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Senpai didn't value this quiet world, she would have told someone else&#8212;she didn't want Aki to know either.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But the development was slightly different from what Asahi had expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's reaction was so fierce that Asahi's expectations were exceeded. Aki also pushed her nose up, and continued to fan the flames. This turns into a naked fight that will be defeated by shrinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Look little girl, do you understand now? Asahi is my most important toy...property."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">clack clack clack - Asahi heard Senpai's unbearable voice, the cracking of blood vessels, and the impossible in reality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Kissing!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a moonlit night. I don't know if the air is fresh or not. The night wind slowly passed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's expression was filled with anger and shame, and she shouted outrageously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If that kiss can prove who Asahi-kun is, I can kiss Asahi-kun too! Now Aki definitely doesn't dare to kiss Asahi-kun, but I dare...!!!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Asahi has reached his limit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi judged like this-now only he can thwart Aki's spirit. To do this, you can just use that trick.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi also had a more powerful trump card in his hands than "Smell". The card never expires. This trick can at least make Aki silent for a long time. Asahi had been hiding in his heart for three years.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki's hand held Asahi's face-Asahi held her&nbsp;hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">solemnly declare-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"--Love letter"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because Asahi suddenly said an unrelated word, both Senpai and Aki stopped: &#8230;Huh? Asahi continued to catch up at this point, repeating&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aki Nee-san. Love letter"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...A love letter? Was it the letter Asahi received from the girl in the class next door?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She said extra in front of his Senpai&#8212;but this matter would be settled later.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's not it.... It was when you were in high school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aren't you just a first year high school student now?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Not me, it was when Aki Nee-san was still in high school. I'll be reading a paragraph soon, you should know-but that's just In my memory, the details should be different, and in no order&#8230;. [I hope the summer breeze that passes my lips can blow into your heart].&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki instantly froze on the spot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai blinked&#8212;perhaps she didn't know the meaning of the text spoken from Asahi's mouth. It is of course. But Aki understands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi knew this, so he continued talking-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"[You shine like the sun, turning my love into a full moon]"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki's lips trembled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"[I saw you in your sleep -you ran away, but I feel like a spring dream]"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki looked away&#8212;when she turned her gaze back to Asahi again, a rare smile appeared on the corners of her mouth, trying to fool her. Cold sweat slowly ran down her&nbsp;cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"[I need to touch you with my hand. Words cannot express my happiness&nbsp;&#8212;that happiness is you]"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though I was able to continue talking, Asahi thought this was enough. Asahi stopped singing poetry. Aki didn't say a word, still with an ambiguous smile on her face&#8212;cold sweat. Aki's arm fell weakly. ......The effect is very good. Asahi explained to Aki and Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I saw this by chance at Aki Nee-san's house. Even though Aki Nee-san hid it in the bookshelf - but I really like reading, so this turned out to be an opportunity.... I was quite panicked at first and felt like this isn't something you can see, but I think it might work at a time like this, so I remember it. Aki Nee-san, the other party should be your classmate right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai didn't know what happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Is this a love letter written by Aki-san?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You might write it and not hand it in. Anyway, it's very well written. Two sticky notes full of this tone, written poetry almost kills people. After I say these few words, I feel my neck itch. Aki Nee-san should be in high spirits in the middle of the night. Writing on paper&#8212;after she regains consciousness, she may feel too embarrassed."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... ah, ...erh. Asahi, ...ah, I, ..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Aki Nee-san. If you don't want me to continue reading the love letters to Senpai and my mother as a joke, please swear-don't tell&#8230; don't say anything between me and Senpai to people and don't bother us to chat. From now on."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, Aki went straight down to be honest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She said: ...I went to take a shower, I smelled..., and then came out of Asahi's room. Because of that, Asahi and Senpai couldn't take it as nothing happened and started chatting again. From 9 o'clock until now, the time had exceeded the agreed upon fifteen minutes. Today, the curtain fell like this.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki goes in to take a shower after Asahi's mother. She showered for almost an hour. She took a long shower. After that, Asahi went to see how she was-Aki wasn't staying in the guest room, but was lying on the sofa in the living room. She didn't dry her still wet hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi took the hairdryer from the changing room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Hairdryer for you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;My hair is messy and hard. It doesn't matter if it's naturally dried."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Eh&#8230;sorry, I didn't mean to say this. I mean the couch will get wet and it'll ruin it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki obediently took the hairdryer and blew her hair for a bit. Asahi originally wanted to leave Aki alone and return to her&nbsp;room-but now Aki is very hurt because of things related to her&nbsp;parents. Because of that, Asahi cared a little for her, so he continued to stare at her&nbsp;from the side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki suddenly stopped the hairdryer and let out her voice and said&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi... about that love letter... Please don't tell anyone..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I apologize to you about this matter... As long as Aki abides by the contents of our transaction, I won't say it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Asahi finished speaking, he went to the kitchen to prepare herbal tea. After arriving in front of Aki, Aki took a sip and called out her name.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you dating that girl?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not dating him"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But, do you like the girl?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi didn't say anything. Aki sighed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is also normal. The girl looks like a flower, at least her appearance is perfect. After moving in, the neighbor can be such a person - I can really say that I was lucky. It's like winning the first prize in the lottery."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't judge Senpai by appearance alone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;No matter how beautiful you say, appearance is still important. Appearance is also a part of a person's personality. How to put it&#8230; It can even be invisible, don't know if genetics match. Although I don't know if it's true.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;By the way, what do you want to say after that?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;I won't tell you. Asahi, think for yourself!... Ah, really!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki put back her teacup and threw herself on the sofa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She raised her&nbsp;hands and feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't want to! I don't want Asahi to find a suitable person before me! I feel like I let my dog &#8203;&#8203;bite my hand..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Should I find a way to separate?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aki Nee-san... I learned the word love in elementary school, and only when I met you did I understand its meaning."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Uh"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki's voice is very attractive&#8212;she seems to be enjoying chatting with Asahi. But that can't be taken care of either&#8212;at least it's still fine for now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'll be home tomorrow to see what Aki said. Asahi lightly patted Aki's back.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">... Above is what happened yesterday.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki and Asahi went to school at about the same time. In the morning, Aki takes a bag with a change of clothes. &#8220;Aki will stay at home&#8221;&#8212;this sudden trouble has ended.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even so, you can't wait casually for the 9pm arrival.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi felt once again that Senpai was also an ordinary person. Asahi couldn't treat Tsubasa as a fool&#8212;perhaps somewhere in his heart, Asahi also treated Senpai as a goddess in the world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai with red cheeks is cute like a goddess.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since morning, as long as she is in a place where Asahi can see, Senpai will show a "I'm so angry" attitude.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After separating from Aki, Asahi walked to the bus stop - he saw Senpai waiting for the bus across the two-lane four-lane highway. That senpai also noticed him almost at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was for the same reason- "The other party might be here", the result of the two looking around. Their eyes met-Asahi wanted to raise his hand, but the Senpai puffed out her cheeks like a squirrel, snorted, and turned her face to the other side. At this time, the bus just stops there. When the bus left, that Senpai was no longer there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If she had changed into the usual Senpai at school, after seeing Asahi, she would have seen the bus leave and waited a bit longer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The same goes for lunch breaks. Asahi met up with his Senpai at the entrance of the cafeteria, who was also with some of her&nbsp;friends at the time. In order to prevent others from knowing the peaceful world they were in, usually, at this time, both of them pretended not to know each other, or they just took a loophole and saw. But today was different&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai deliberately took a slit, looked at Asahi in particular, then snorted, averting her gaze&#8212;by the way, her cheeks puffed out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...This is really bad&#8212; Asahi thought to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's rarely 9 p.m. For the first time, I don't need to care about Aki, and I can't make Senpai angry until the end of the chat. Even though it was funny that Senpai said &#8220;I'm so angry&#8221;, but this would only stop the plan from moving forward.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi was eating the udon set while observing Senpai's situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After some time, he got a golden opportunity. Senpai's friends were discussing a topic smoothly, but that Senpai didn't seem interested in the topic. There was a hint of boredom on her&nbsp;face. She took the teacup and stood up. Asahi drank the roasted tea he had never touched&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He stood up, and chased after Senpai who went to the tea machine. It just so happened that no one was near the tea machine, and Asahi spoke softly from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That senpai didn't show any sign of surprise. She must have noticed Asahi coming. At school, there were very few opportunities to talk to Senpai without being noticed. Asahi repeated another sentence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Pretending not to hear, and grabbing another cup of tea.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Asahi didn't give up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai&#8230; Yesterday, I was really sorry about Aki Nee-san.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230; Asahi-kun&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai finally answered. Senpai held the cup in one hand and turned her head, her face as if to say, "I can't care about it yet." Senpai's voice wasn't very good either&#8212;very different from when she was angry at Aki's sudden appearance the night before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Instead of anger overflowing, it was better to say that she controlled himself to be angry - in other words, she was patient that she couldn't help but smile at Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not angry with Aki-san now"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Eh"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aki did make me feel a little out of control, but what Aki said, her eyes... Everything made me feel great emotions that I couldn't believe and didn't want to lose. To be honest, I was really annoyed. But on the other hand, I can say that I have an attitude disrespectful towards Asahi-kun's relatives&#8230; and relatives older than me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But that's all Aki Nee-san didn't do wrong."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not mad about it anymore-I have a few questions to ask you, but that's about it. That's not what makes me angry. ...Is Amaharashi-kun coming over for a drink?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai suddenly changed the subject. The pronunciation also changed from first name to last name &#8212; Asahi couldn't react in the slightest. At this moment, a voice came from behind Asahi&#8212;his voice was low, soft, and with a long tail.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai, can you help me with a cup of tea?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi heard this voice. Even the handsome man's voice was beautiful&#8212;Asahi became jealous in his heart. Asahi heard this voice nearby as he confessed his failure to his Senpai. At that time, his voice was much more confused than it is now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai smiled as &#8220;Everyone's Goddess&#8221; and replied&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no. My refill service is only for unaccustomed first year students. Shimao-kun, it's hard to see you in the cafeteria.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shimao Tasogare--he confessed to his Senpai almost ten times, A famous second year student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He was extremely tall, and when he walked into Asahi's eyes, Asahi, who was less than 170 centimeters tall, even had to look up at him - it was a dignified appearance. Her body was slender, giving off a light and flexible feeling, and her hair was shaking&#8212;this had become her cuteness. There was still an incredible smell on his body. The look in his eyes towards Senpai was filled with affectionate enthusiasm&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is the glow that anyone in love will have, a mixture of gentle water and willful pleasure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Usually I prepare lunch myself. But I woke up late today and I don't have enough time. However, this is also a good thing. If I hadn't fallen asleep thinking about Senpai, I wouldn't have met Senpai here.... Him, does Senpai know him?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"He is a first year Amaharashi Asahi. I met him in the library a few days ago, so we sometimes talk a bit. Like Shimao-kun, he also likes to read books."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Likes to read people like to discuss topics related to books, but they rarely get this chance&#8230;&#8230; Senpai must be quite aware of this. Uh? Is it right? &#8212;&#8212;In the next second, Tasogare took the bait at an unexpected speed&#8212;&#8212; 'What book do you usually read? I read novels, especially mystery novels'.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi doesn't hate the topic of books about the latest mystery novel - Asahi. Among the several topics I couldn't discuss with Senpai, there was the topic of books. After Asahi said a few book titles, he noticed that Senpai smiled and left the tea-drinking machine with a cup in her&nbsp;hand. After a while, the night came to his senses. He looked at Senpai &#8212;Senpai had returned to where her friends were.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tasogare smiled bitterly beside Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;She will always be like this, running away without anyone noticing.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Haah&#8230;&#8230;uh, um, yeah.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But it's okay. I also talked to Senpai, and Senpai also smiled at me&#8212; Ah, may I call you Asahi-kun?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, um"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank You. You can relax and just call my name. Even though I spend a lot of time with my Senpai, she always refuses to call my name. This should be standard in her&nbsp;mind&#8212;she often calls out girls' names, but I've never seen her&nbsp;call out boys' names.... In short, I've finally found someone who can talk. Asahi-kun, if you are free, do we want to read the book recommended by the other party? Book exchange? "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi suddenly panicked, she answered and nodded at the same time. Tasogare laughed happily&#8212;perhaps this is what men and women call it all. ...Senpai would show an Asahi expression that she had never seen before at night. This incident left Asahi full of doubts, but also full of guilt. In addition, there is a trace of pride.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even Asahi didn't know why.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was no one else &#8212; Senpai would only be immersed in a quiet world with Asahi. It was known only to Asahi and Senpai, and belonged only to Asahi&#8230;&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;What.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this moment, Asahi noticed one thing. This is a good opportunity- thought Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With his back to Asahi while Tasogare, he took out a food stamp from his pocket and was about to leave. Asahi was a little confused&#8212;this was because he felt bad asking Tasogare this kind of thing. Finally, he spoke that night.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Tasogare-san is very popular with girls.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tasogare turned and smiled slightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;However, ever since I entered this high school and fell in love with Senpai, I don't have a boyfriend anymore.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But on the other hand, you can have multiple girlfriends. It was disgusting&#8212;Asahi was a little frustrated at once, but he held it in. Inferiority complex, go!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then did you have a boyfriend before&#8230;&#8230; the person you liked but didn't date? Did you fight with him? What method did you use when you made each other happy in it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tasogare tilted his head - he wasn't really worried about how to answer, more like he was surprised by Asahi's question. Asahi explained frantically.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's no big deal... It's a novel"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Novel?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So embarrassed to say, I was writing a novel out of interest... I thought there might be a time when I wrote a scene like this, so I just... wanted to find a reference..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Luckily I was able to quickly find a suitable excuse&#8212;but there's still half the facts in it. This made Asahi very embarrassed. This was the first time he had spoken to someone other than his Senpai that he was writing a novel. Tasogare sniffed and let out a very happy voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He seemed very interested.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see. Haha, quite interesting. Of course I'm willing to help you. I don't know if I can help you.... Speaking of pleasing others, of course there are many ways. If I want to recommend a method to Asahi, I think about it&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tasogare glanced at Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi followed and looked at his Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Perhaps that is the best that the greatest enemy in my life can receive&#8212;the invincible goddess. However, it's best not to take it home, but decorate it in class. It is a means of expressing love. the most basic things in it. No matter what era or country, it is closely related to love. It is-"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just as Tasogare raised his index finger and turned to Asahi, Senpai also glanced at Asahi. Maybe Asahi and Tasogare talked for so long, which made him a little worried. Their gazes fused&#8212;Senpai suddenly looked confused. After that, she spat out her&nbsp;tongue calmly and slightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She reveals that she is angry, but she is very cute.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tasogare's suggestions are very useful. Asahi originally thought of a general plan, in order to proceed with the implementation of this plan, several things were required.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, after school, Asahi went in the opposite direction as before buying chocolate. This is the busiest street in the city where Asahi is located. Asahi felt that preparing from here was more convenient than preparing near home. In larger shops, you should be able to collect all the necessary items. But the fact is self-defeating&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">when he walked out of the second shop, he met Tsubasa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh! Isn't this Amaharashi-kun?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa was alone. But this is not good at all. If she was walking with a friend, after seeing Asahi, she might ignore him. It was because she was alone that she would come - one hand holding a paper bag from a nearby natural-style bathroom supply store.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Tsubasa walked to Asahi's side, she hide the paper bag behind him&#8212;but the size of the paper bag was too big for her&nbsp;tiny body to cover.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why did Amaharashi-kun come out of the craft shop? This was quite a shock to me&#8230; I thought you'd immerse yourself in reading books, reading comics, and playing games when you got home&#8230;. What's your hand holding? Huh? Flowers? "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa looked-Asahi changed the topic:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did Tsubasa come here to shop alone"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I? Uh, uh, wasn't it Senpai who became happy a few days ago? I guess it's because I made a mistake&#8212;he looks different today. I always felt that she was a little displeased&#8230; for Senpai, that was quite strange.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though the school year was different, she watched Senpai observe very carefully.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So I was wondering-if something was upsetting him. I care if it's okay. In the 3rd lesson, I went to see Senpai and asked her. She smiled and didn't say anything to me. But ...I'm only hypothetical, just hypothetical. Assuming that Senpai recently had someone she cared about and had friction with that person, which made her feel displeased&#8212;I naturally welcomed this situation&#8230; Welcome! Even though I really- "I really want to delete that person, but I'm also very grateful to that person. It's like thanking that person while cutting off that person's head with a kitchen knife."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;It was terrible&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;But this is different from my welcome&#8212;it makes Senpai sad and unhappy, and I'm also very uncomfortable. I wanted to make her happy... So, I bought some bath lotion. I plan to give it to Senpai tomorrow or the day after. She should be happy.... By the way, Amaharashi-kun, why did you buy flowers?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The topic cannot be changed at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you doing? Bought so many."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8230;&#8230;What can we do about it? How to answer? Asahi didn't want her&nbsp;to make extraneous speculations, but replied that "It used to be to decorate the house, family birthdays", etc., so many flowers certainly couldn't be easily accepted by him. After all, Tsubasa's intuition was very sharp about things related to Senpai. This also meant that she was very worried about his Senpai. Asahi made up his mind - it was better not to mention the words of a Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know what I bought it for. My mother asked me to buy it. I also&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;Are you Tsubaki?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A high-pitched voice came from the side, interrupting Asahi's words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The speakers were a pair of middle-aged women. Asahi saw their confused expressions and immediately understood the situation. They...probably weren't Tsubasa's acquaintances. Tsubasa understood it earlier than Asahi, she was already making an innocent smile that she didn't show much at school. She has been involved in idol activities since elementary school, which may also be a conditioned reflex.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow, really! It's even funnier than on TV...! Amazing! That's, sorry, if you could, could I get an autograph&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just like a girl who has grown emotionally like an adult&#8212; Tsubasa answered innocently: Of course! Asahi thought to himself: This is really great. This way, there is no need to explain to him. Asahi also consciously showed a natural smile, waved to Tsubasa and left from there. On the way to the bus stop, Asahi breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...He didn't pay attention to Tsubasa who had signed her&nbsp;autograph and quietly touched the "Goddess body" in her&nbsp;pocket, and looked at her&nbsp;who was far away - and the paper bag she was holding in her&nbsp;hand.</span></p><pstyle= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By 9 p.m., we will succeed and reconcile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi knew that the moment he saw his Senpai, he would succeed.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if that Senpai was still angry, even if she still looked like 'I'm angry', Senpai would still appear from the window at 9 pm according to the agreement. Asahi was sure of this-Senpai is such a person. Even when dealing with Aki, Senpai didn't budge at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But the prerequisite is that you have to be really prepared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">First, I brought back from various flower shops</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The so-called most common items during Tasogare are flowers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After careful consideration, Asahi chose the most beautiful and vital white rose. While investigating with his cell phone, he did the manual work of cutting rose stems and placing them in water filled with medicine. In order for the flower to survive for a while, it must absorb enough water and nutrients.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">During this period, he began to decorate other flowers. He bought various vases of different sizes. He imagined how to place it in Senpai's room, changing the configuration while paying attention to balance. After that, he had to secure a passage in the middle of the window sill that would allow him to push his body out. In order to be able to put some small things on the windowsill, the windowsill was made very wide - this is a blessing. Therefore, the space on the windowsill is still limited.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not just on the windowsill&#8212;For Senpai to see from the room, Asahi placed vases everywhere. The best situation was that after Senpai saw Asahi, except for Asahi, there was only interest in his eyes. After Asahi finished eating dinner and showered, he continued his homework.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The same goes for handwork. When the petals are full of vitality and begin to bloom with sufficient water, use steel wire to tie the stems. Then bend the steel wire, adjust the angle, and wrap the cut flower stem with a cotton cloth moistened with water. Finally, roll it into a wreath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi placed the finished work in a position that Senpai could not see&#8212;behind the vase.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Next is the hair clip. This too was just bought today. If you asked your mother for it, you would definitely have as much as you needed, but if you were asked what for&#8212;it would only leave Asahi unable to answer. Because of that, he bought some.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Last point, don't forget to lock the room door from the inside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then Asahi opened the windows and curtains ten minutes early. He waited quietly by the window. It was not yet the rainy season, the house divided the night sky into parts, and the stars were shining and dazzling. Night, wind, stars, flowers. The most beautiful things in the world are gathered here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...No, that's not true.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The prettiest is Senpai. Or&#8212;the emotion in Asahi's heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi was ready and waiting - Asahi clearly saw the whole process from the shaking and opening of the curtains in Senpai's room to Senpai's appearance. He looked at Senpai at the beginning, just like that day, her mouth swelled up, as if to say "I'm so angry". But in the next second, her&nbsp;expression changed instantly&#8212;like a beautiful rose blooming with flowers; like a magic book that turns to the next page, it emits multicolored light.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai opened the window, her eyes glittered, and she said happily-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun...! That's amazing! What's wrong? Why are there so many flowers! This is a dream? When did you...!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I prepared it when Senpai was angry. This is my apologies. I want to quickly reconcile with Senpai....Yesterday was a very unfortunate thing. As Senpai said, it wasn't Aki Nee-san's fault, it was all because I forgot to lock the bedroom door.. .. That's why people notice that we're talking here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi put his hands on the windowsill and lowered his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I let others see this world only me and Senpai know&#8230;&#8230; in a world that only exists within me and Senpai's feelings and memories. Sorry, I will be more careful in the future&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"............ No need"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's voice was as soft as the air tonight.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Asahi lowered his head, the Senpai walked slowly to the balcony.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's enough. Thank you.... Asahi already knows why I'm angry. However, Asahi didn't mean that, I was being too childish. Sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it? "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No problem. Asahi used that love letter...to stop Aki-san. No matter what we do, what we say here will be known to the moon. Asahi, under the moon's gaze, will we shake hands and make peace?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai who was smiling was very happy. The moon would definitely witness Asahi's and Senpai's handshake. ...But Asahi felt that was not enough. The hand that was lying on the window sill moved to the side, and Asahi grabbed the thing he had made himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi showed courage&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course.... But before that, Senpai can you stick your head out?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh?... Like this?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Come here a little more"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai grabbed the handrails and stood forward. Asahi stretched out his hand. Senpai opened her eyes wide when she saw what Asahi was holding in his right hand. Asahi refused to be embarrassed and said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is my first time doing this. I didn't do well. I'm sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a hair accessory made of white roses&#8212;flowers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Asahi heard Tasogare's "Flower" answer, he thought about this in his heart. It must be a perfect match for Senpai&#8212;perhaps, Asahi would also like to see it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She tucked a flower decoration in Senpai's hair. If you leave it like this, the flower decorations will fall off immediately, so use bobby pins to secure them. ...Asahi originally wanted to do this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But when you think about it carefully, Asahi never used hairpins normally.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She doesn't use hairpins very much. ...He hesitated&#8212;if he could put a hairpin on his Senpai now, he would be very handsome. This was a rare opportunity to stimulate Senpai's heart, and if he kept dragging it on, this opportunity would be wasted for no reason. Anxiety made him even more awkward. Doing it through the windowsill would be too far, and it would be unstable&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After looking back, Senpai smiled and looked straight at Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While it's hard to get the bobby pins through the windowsill, they both stand out. Being stared straight at this distance would definitely make her nervous - Asahi stopped her movements involuntarily. Senpai's smile deepened&#8212;her smile was still so serene. There was joy and excitement on her&nbsp;face. What kind of expression was Asahi showing right now? A red rose bloomed on Senpai's cheeks, and her body trembled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai is getting happier--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun, what should I do? Can I take it well?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;... Senpai"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi herself was taken aback by her current actions&#8212;this was not what she had originally planned. He didn't make any predictions, he just started from scratch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's slightly trembling appearance made her feel suffocated&#8212;she was very happy to be able to reconcile with Senpai smoothly. However, he did not come to terms with failing to properly decorate his Senpai. Senpai's expression was very cute, as if flowers were blooming on her face. Asahi began to reflect on his negligence last night, and began to feel guilty towards his Senpai. On the other hand, Senpai would be very angry at Asahi, it made Asahi feel very refreshed. Today's hard work has yielded something, which makes him very satisfied. Aki asks him: Do you like that girl? &#8212;&#8212;However, this question made no sense. Because of that, Asahi struggles: because Senpai is so cute and lustful, Asahi is very competitive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The emotions deep inside Asahi's heart rolled into a whirlpool and started to escape.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi's heart started to burn&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, please move a bit."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Eh&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To keep the floral ornaments and hairpins from slipping off, Asahi gently tucked them into the pockets of the indoor clothes. When placing flowers on the windowsill, it is fortunate to be able to leave a path jutting out of the body. Asahi climbed onto the windowsill, grabbed the wall with his hands, and walked out through the window. The night wind slid across the body&#8212;&#8212;Asahi showed Senpai the biggest surprise of the day. Senpai's pretty face gave birth to doubts. A hint of doubt flashed across her&nbsp;eyes&#8212;it was rare, very, very rare. Senpai started to panic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi looked at her&nbsp;and jumped out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As long as there is no inexplicable fear, this distance will not fail. Asahi seemed to be walking in the night sky&#8212;he jumped onto his Senpai's balcony. He stepped on the armrest with his foot first, and then in order not to make a sound, he gently jumped down. Asahi stood&#8212;at this distance, he could even feel Senpai's breath. Asahi took out the flower ornament and hairpin, and in this position - Senpai didn't move, she immediately fixed the flower ornament with the hairpin.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How? I'll wear it for the Senpai"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Thank you...Thank you&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this moment, Asahi noticed--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai replied respectfully for some reason, her&nbsp;face had already lost its composure. She no longer had an expression on her&nbsp;face, her&nbsp;face was red, and she was still frozen. There was no one else on this balcony&#8212;in this confined space with only Asahi and Senpai, Asahi's hand touched Senpai's hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The night was very quiet&#8212;even Senpai's heartbeat could be heard.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The moon is watching.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, the Moon cannot stop people's desires, nor can it stop people's actions.</span>
