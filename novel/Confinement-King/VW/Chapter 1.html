<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Fukuda Rin's Plot</h3>

<p><strong>The First Day of Girl's Track and Field Confinement: The Birth of the Confinement King</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just because it&#8217;s a girl&#8217;s clubroom doesn&#8217;t mean it smells good&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When everyone was in sixth-period class, I had falsely claimed to be unwell and slipped out of the classroom, and had 『passed through』 to the girls&#8217; track club room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am currently crossing a dangerous bridge. I am aware of that. However, there are people in the girl&#8217;s track club who possess naked photos of Fujiwara-san and are threatening her safety and on top of that, there are even people who suspect me of being a kidnapper. They are the biggest danger to me at the moment. I&#8217;m not so soft-hearted that I can just ignore it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The clubroom I entered was hot,humid and dimly lit. There are no windows on the bare block walls and only one small ventilation fan near the ceiling. Wiping the sweat slowly rising from my forehead with the back of my hand, I put on a pair of military gloves and searched for the fluorescent light switch with a trembling hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room, illuminated by the blinking artificial light, was much larger than I had imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;d say it was about eight tatami mats. There are two blue benches, to name but a few things that catch my eye. One wall is lined with shoe boxes lined with athletic shoes and there is probably one for each member of the club. There is a row of narrow steel lockers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened them out of curiosity, I found that each one was overflowing with the individuality of the user.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some had rolled up their damp training clothes and thrown them in, while others had folded them neatly. In some places, there were rows of spray cans of deodorant and in the worst cases, mouldy bread was thrown in with other rubbish.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I guess it&#8217;s a man&#8217;s fantasy that all girls like to keep clean&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckled and memorised the general state of the room, and then went out the front again using the 『passed through』. Then I went around to the front of the club room once again and manifested the 『door』 to overlap the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was followed by  『Interior Construction』 to make the 『door』 look more like the cheap aluminium doors in the club building. If I look closely, I can see the difference, but people wouldn’t know the differences.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the 『door』 and entered the room and this time I started to change the interior to resemble the club room I had just seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bare block walls, concrete floor, long narrow steel lockers, shoe boxes, containers and two benches.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would not be necessary to recreate even the personal belongings of the club members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once inside, they cannot go outside without my permission, so by the time they realise it&#8217;s not the club room, it&#8217;s too late. It&#8217;s like a sweetfish at a fish weir, so to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I don&#8217;t think all the club members will come at once, so I&#8217;ll prepare three more identical rooms, and every time there is a break in the club members visiting the club room, I&#8217;ll reconnect them to another room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I decided to hide in the shadows of the clubhouse building and wait for the girl’s track and field club members to visit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the outcome first, the operation to capture the girls’ track and field team members went too smoothly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeh! Wait a minute, what&#8217;s this?  My locker is empty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first girl to step into the clubroom shouted in surprise. [Seriously?!] The girls who followed her also entered the door one after another, making noises such as [Are you kidding me?]</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Six people who just walked in, for a total of eighteen &#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first group had five people, the second had three, the third group had four and the fourth group had six.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This means that I have used up all of the four rooms I had prepared in advance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking down at the clock on my phone, it was already thirty minutes since the end of homeroom and looking outside, I see baseball club members in their uniforms drawing a line. It seems that other clubs are also starting their club activities.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is the last one, I suppose.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how many members there are in the girls’ track and field club apart from Teruya-san, who I asked Ryoko to stop her in her tracks. I think that&#8217;s probably all of them.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I should have checked the number of members properly&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s a bit sloppy, but I guess it&#8217;s okay.’</span></i></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked out from the shadows of the club building and made the 『door』 disappear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All four of the people surrounding Fujiwara have short haircuts, but among girls I’ve captured, there were twelve short haircuts people, including the narrow-eyed girl who had been sniffing around me. That&#8217;s a pretty high ratio, two thirds of the eighteen. To be honest, it is unlikely that I would be able to distinguish one individual from another at a quick glance.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘There are four of these girls who have naked pictures of Fujiwara-san and one girl who has figured out that I&#8217;m the culprit&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Relief at having successfully captured them, with a little guilt and the excitement of exposing myself to the thrill. With these mixed emotions in my mind, I slipped out the club building from behind and towards the woodland path behind the school with a nonchalant manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I arrived home and told Lili that I had locked up the entire girls&#8217; track and field team, she smashed off the comic book in her hand onto my head as hard as she could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really&#8230;&#8230;you’re an idiot,&#8230;&#8230; Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This reaction was quite surprising. The more I did evil, the more she would be pleased, or so I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do you sound angry&#8230;..you said I could do whatever I wanted.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Things have limits, Devi! Well,nevermind, Devi. So, how many in all, Devi?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s see&#8230;&#8230; eighteen girls.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eighteen?&#8230;..How did you plan to brainwash that many people,Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I honestly didn&#8217;t think too much about it, but you know how there are often 『human farms』 in erotic manga and the like? I thought if I did it like that, I could make it work&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili then let out a deep sigh, as if to say she suddenly became tired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;&#8230;for now, FumiFumi will get down on his knees and apologise to all the dairy farmers in the country, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeeeehhh!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You underestimate the farm business too much, Devi! Do you know how hard dairy farmers work to bring that delicious milk to your home?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, demon. What position are you preaching from, that&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be quiet Devi! In the first place, a human farm is a power play that requires a lot of manpower. Even in the Demon World, the shortage of goblin farm workers is becoming a social problem and it&#8217;s not something that can be done overnight by amateurs, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Goblin farmers are&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was muttering in a daze, Lili folded her arms and looked up at the ceiling. She then made a gesture as if she was pondering for a while, 『neither this nor that』and then nodded her head as if she had come up with something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah&#8230;&#8230;this will work, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili quickly raised her hand and eighteen panels appeared in the air. Reflected on them are the girls&#8217; faces, all of them looking anxious and frightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The current state of the girls captured by Fumifumi, Devi. From among these girls, you  can only choose four as your favourites.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Favourites? Eve, even if you suddenly say such a thing &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t have to think too deeply, Devi. Simply choose four girls you want to embrace, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that comment, I involuntarily looked twice at Lili.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may sound strange, but the reason I captured the members of the girls’ track and field team was to collect the naked photos of Fujiwara-san and to stop the club members who were suspicious of me from talking. So I never had the idea of 『embracing』the captured members of the club until this time.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Bu, but&#8230;&#8230;well, if I&#8217;m going to brainwash them anyway, why not make them my property at the same time, right?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Four&#8230;&#8230;does that mean we&#8217;re going to brainwash a smaller number of people at a time?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked this, Lili shook her head quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, Devi. Put the four you have chosen on the side of dominating and let the remaining fourteen to be dominated, Devi.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can it  be done?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can be done,Devi. For example, if a king exists, he usually will not be able to directly rule over all the people in the kingdom. Thus, an organisation is born for that purpose──a system to rule, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I can understand that, but I don&#8217;t think&#8230;&#8230;the four people I&#8217;ve chosen will follow me&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Lili stuck her finger right up to my nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not whether they will comply, it&#8217;s whether they have to. That&#8217;s the situation you have to put them in. There are many countries in the world, but are all the people under the rulers willing to obey Devi?　No, Devi. There is a reason why they have to obey, and a mechanism by which they have to obey.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel like you’re overreacting, but…what exactly do I have to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You will use the 『Paralyse』 for now,Devi.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeeehh? To those kids? I mean, girls?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you hesitating now, after you&#8217;ve locked them up,Devi?”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;.and then what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then FumiFumi&#8217;s turn is over, Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh? Ov, over? That’s abit….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t expect to be easily off the hook. To me who is still perplexed, Lili slowly explains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This time, FumiFumi will be the mastermind. I need you to appear in the final stages but if the mastermind shows up too quickly in the middle,you won&#8217;t have any dignity at all. The mastermind needs to be mysterious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can sort of understand that, but then who&#8217;s going to do the finishing touches?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Basically, the four people chosen by FumiFumi. And the role that comes into contact with those four people is played by Oppai-chan,Devi.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeee!!? Masaki-chan!? Is she gonna be alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry Devi. Oppai-chan is a real sadist. As a trainer, she is definitely better than FumiFumi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it&#8217;s better not to ask any more questions, Devi. Besides,I have my servants to back me up fully, so there&#8217;s nothing to worry about,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O,okay&#8230;..I won&#8217;t ask anymore about that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good mindset, Devi. Then, quickly choose four girls, Devi.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili urged me to choose four of the girls on the panel. I think it&#8217;s terrible that the only criterion for selection is appearance but I have no other choice. There is one girl who I absolutely want to have as mine, without a second thought. The other three I decided on based solely on facial preferences.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All you have to do now is put a 『Paralyse』 on them, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that means, for now I&#8217;m done, right?&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Lili holds up her index finger and waves it from side to side,「tchtchtchtch」. Yes, it&#8217;s very annoying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not that you don&#8217;t have things to do, Devi. It is true that the next time FumiFumi appears will be in front of the track and field team members at the finale. But the disappearance of this number of girls will definitely change the situation around FumiFumi, Devi. You need to do your best to deal with that, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The situation around me? What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The police stance will also change. The media will make a fuss, teachers and students will start looking for the culprit, and FumiFumi will surely be suspected too. The plan to pin the crime on the Teruya sisters will have to be revised, depending on the situation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I see, so&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s what it is.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt cold sweat pouring out of my body. The gravity of the matter I only realised when I was told about it. The disappearance of 18 people is a completely different level of incident from the disappearance of Kurosawa-san and Masaki-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In any case, we need to leave the eighteen girls for two days, Debi. Same as with Kurosawa-chan, Devi. We&#8217;ll start by exhausting them thoroughly, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I nodded, Lili put her hand on her chin and pretended to think a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now all that&#8217;s left is&#8230;..we&#8217;ll decide on a name for you as the mastermind, Devi”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A name?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right, Devi, if you are a ruler and demand to be worshipped, a more dignified and fearsome name is needed than a lame name like 『Fumio Kijima』, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m concerned about my name being called lame but I certainly understand that if I’m going to identify myself as an evil mastermind, the more exaggerated the name is, the better.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But I don&#8217;t have to think too much about it. Clarity is important. A ruler, a king&#8230;&#8230;yes, a king that’s lock people up’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I told Lili.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Then,how about&#8230;&#8230;The Confinement King.』”</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I designate the four rooms where the girls&#8217; track and field team members are locked up and activate the 『Paralyse』. When I&#8217;m done, Lili waves her hand with a [shhshh] as if she were chasing off a dog.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll let my servant do the rest, Devi. The confinement king should just rest and suck on Oppai-chan’s tits.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;&#8230;Lili, aren&#8217;t you being a little cruel towards me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lili is still very kind to her Confinement King, who has added so much unnecessary hassle to her life.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; I knew it! She is still angry about this’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt that if I continued to be around her, it would only get worse for me, so I decided to quickly move to the 『bedroom』 where Masaki-chan was waiting for me.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome back, Fumio-kun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I step into the 『bedroom』, Masaki, who was lying on the bed in a see-through negligee, greets me happily. But when she looked into my face, she looked a little worried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Somehow, you look a bit tired.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That might be true. Considering today was a rather tense day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually…──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I finished telling her about today&#8217;s events, Masaki-chan hugged me tightly and said, [You worked hard today, Fumio-kun. I&#8217;ll give you a massage after you warm up in the bath so that you can get rid of your fatigue].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it goes without saying what happens when I soak in the bathtub with her. It is an immediate sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how tired a man is, there is no man who can resist the allure of  such tits floating in the hot water.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the bathtub, in close contact,face-to-face sitting position, we engage in idle conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, do I have to call Fumio-kun 『Money King』 too?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s Confinement King. If you call me that, it sounds like I&#8217;m the king of money laundering&#8230;&#8230; Well, you must call me that in front of the girls in the track and field club. But when it&#8217;s just you and me, you can call me 『Fumio-kun』 as you always have.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good&#8230;&#8230;.Fumio-kun is better from the 『Attendance King.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Am I a serious student!? I mean, Masaki-chan, you must know what&#8230;&#8230; I mean, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe, did you find out?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Masaki-chan stuck her tongue out.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Unn, it&#8217;s cute! I forgive you!’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t hear the details of the training, so I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s treasonous or not&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s valid to say that locking someone up is not treasonous…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;you&#8217;re absolutely right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our foreheads meet and we giggle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you worried about that!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had already mastered the name 『King of Confinement』 as material for teasing me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahahaha then,I&#8217;ll move in place of the tired king, then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she starts to lightly shake her body, hot water spills out of the bathtub.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yann~, the hot water is spilling out. such waste.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s going to cost me anything for the water&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan smiles happily and begins to torture my object by moving her hips widely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The water splashed out and the folds of her vagina rubbed against my cock a beat after Masaki&#8217;s [ei], probably due to the resistance of the water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aahhh, Fuuh, Nnn, Ahhh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki grinds her hips while violently shaking the hot water. Her moaning voice gradually becomes more lustrous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan&#8217;s vagina has only ever accepted my cock since she lost her virginity. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve just inserted my cock into her vagina tonight but her completely familiar vaginal flesh was sucking my cock as if it had been custom-made for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnhh!? Don&#8217;t thrust upp!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thrust my hips up with all my might out of mischievousness, Masaki-chan writhed violently. She hugged me tightly and her big, firm tits were crushed on my chest and the softness of them made my crotch throb even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t sit still any longer. When I started to use my hips violently, Masaki-chan clung to me desperately like a drowning dog.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sweet sound of her breath in my ear was enough to make me cum. In addition, the warmth of the hot water, the breasts rubbing up against my chest, and the folds of the vagina rubbing up against my meat stick, makes it impossible for me to last that long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to cum, Masaki-chan”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Deep inside! I want it inside me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very moment when we were shouting at each other──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Pyu! Burururururu!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A zero-distance ejaculation into her womb.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;&#8230; haa&#8230;&#8230; Fumio-kun, that felt so good&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki begs for my lips while her dark-eyed eyes are prodigal with pleasure. She&#8217;s so cute. I can&#8217;t stop loving her. Even though we had just cum, we began to move our hips again, intertwining our tongues with each other&#8217;s as if we were devouring each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I drove FumiFumi away to the 『Bedroom』 where Oppai-chan was waiting, I went to Ryoko&#8217;s apartment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">FumiFumi seems to think it&#8217;s easy but locking up 18 people at once is out of the ordinary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since he has gone this far, the police will be compelled to investigate with bloodlust, and above all, attention from the public is inevitable. Devils don&#8217;t need to worry about the police or the public but FumiFumi is a human being. If he is caught, I have too much to lose. Besides, some of the people he caught are very dangerous.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, if the 『room』 is fully awakened, we can fight not just the police, but the whole world….but for now I&#8217;ll just have to find a way to make this works.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, the priority at this stage would be to take action against the police. It is extremely important to make the first move by accurately suppressing information on the investigation. Given this, Ryoko&#8217;s role as a detective is significant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“HAWA!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she broke the space and stepped into Ryoko&#8217;s apartment, she bounced around with a can of beer and a surume in her hand. She was wearing a jersey and no clothes and a towel with some construction company&#8217;s name on it around her neck. Apparently, she had just finished her bath and was in the middle of having a drink for the evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:Surume,a type squid dry food]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Li, Lili-sama! What&#8217;s wrong? If you are wondering about my sister, I have finished putting together her profile and was going to bring it to you later&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sister? Aaa&#8230;&#8230;there was also such a thing, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had forgotten all about it but the other day, Ryoko said she was going to offer her sister as FumiFumi sex slave, and had instructed her to submit a profile in order to discuss her brainwashing policy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Circumstances….?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoko&#8217;s eyes narrowed.  It was a sharp look, as if she was in her detective mode. What she is holding in her hand is not a gun, but a slice of meat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The police have not been informed yet, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;nothing, at least when I was leaving work. Did something happen after that&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Today, FumiFumi locked up eighteen members of the girls’ track and field team, Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Vueee!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my comment, Ryoko lets out a sound somewhere between an [ah] and an [eh] and stiffens with a look of astonishment on her face.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That would be a surprise, wouldn&#8217;t it? Even I, the devil, was taken aback.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eigh, eighteen people?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu, Eighteen people Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Expected of my master&#8230;&#8230;he is not the kind of person that can be estimated by common sense&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoko will not deny FumiFumi’s action. Or rather, she can&#8217;t. She&#8217;s already been tuned to that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked puzzled, yet somewhat proud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m ordering you, Ryoko, to disrupt the investigation and provide any information, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I,I understand Lili-sama. If it is a kidnapping case of this magnitude, an investigation headquarters will be set up on the initiative of the Agency and our jurisdiction will be placed under its command, so I don&#8217;t know how much freedom I’m allowed to move around&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><strong>The Second Day of Confinement of the Girls’ Track and Field Club Members ─ School Martial Law</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A night has passed after eighteen members of the girls’ athletics club were locked up.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I wonder if the club members are awake by now&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down on my seat in the classroom and quietly pondered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili had said that she would make them dress up in the most indecent way possible to reduce their energy to resist, so if they&#8217;ve woken up, they&#8217;re probably very confused right now. No, they might be crying and screaming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, there was no change in the classroom in the morning. Even when I strained my ears to listen to the conversations of my classmates, there is no indication that the girls&#8217; track team is currently the topic of conversation among the chatting students.</span></p>

<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I steal a glance at the remaining girls’ track and field team member &#8211; Teruya-san, she is resting her elbows on the desk and looking downcast. The atmosphere seems to be somewhat sombre, but from diagonally behind, I could hardly make out her expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Kurosawa-san came back, she no longer goes to talk to Kasuya-kun. I can guess that she has a bad relationship towards Kurosawa-san, but that is only my imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about this in a daze, I heard Fujiwara-san&#8217;s voice coming from the entrance of the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chorissu! Fuーmin, ohayo!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Wassup, Fuーmin, Mornin!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, as always, she is carefree about her surroundings. She throws her bag decorated with badges down on the seat, then clings to my arm and pulls my chair next to hers. Lightly struggling against it, I casually turn my attention to her seat and see that among the badges attached to her bag, there is one that reads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found something with 『I ♡ FUMIO』written on it and was taken aback.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hey! Let&#8217;s do SNS too, Fuーmin!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She says this without any context and thrusts her face towards me so close that our noses almost brush each other. She is still bugging me with her sense of distance, as I shake my head while looking up at her.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I refuse”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeeー!　Isn’t it good?　Misuzu also chats with Kasuya all night long. I want to fall asleep while exchanging &#8216;I love you&#8217; and &#8216;I love you too&#8217;!　I think I&#8217;d have really good dreams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can only see a future where the timeline is lined with comments from Fujiwara-san saying [reply me]”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you assuming you won&#8217;t reply!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The noisy atmosphere of the class changed to one of tension as soon as homeroom started and the homeroom teacher announced the disappearance of eighteen female track and field team members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amongst the students who are shouting, there is a boy who is repeatedly asking questions in a low, stifled voice. I haven&#8217;t spoken to him in particular, but he is usually taciturn and, as I recall, he is the head of the judo club&#8230;&#8230;his name, what was it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He is Hiratsuka-kun, I think he was dating Tashiro-san, the captain of the track and field club&#8230;&#8230; He must be worried…”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fujiwara-san whispered that in my ear.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ah, yes. Hiratsuka-kun. I&#8217;ve been so uninvolved that I forgot his name.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Teruya, did you notice anything strange about the other students at yesterday&#8217;s practice?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the homeroom teacher, Gorioka, asked this, everyone&#8217;s eyes focused on Teruya-san. Then she replied with a discouraged expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing strange. No one came to the club activities except me and Ninagawa from the second year. And together with Ninagawa, everyone boycotted practice. We were talking about how stupid it was before the tournament”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boycott?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The advisor is hated by the club members.&#8221;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, there was enough friction between the advisors and the club members that it was not surprising that a boycott occurred.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in fact, it was not a boycott. In the morning, the school received a string of enquiries from parents of track and field team members saying that their children had not returned home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Classes proceeded in an unsettled atmosphere, and by the time the afternoon arrived, I don&#8217;t know where they had gotten wind of it but outside the main gate there was a black crowd of press people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are several long gun microphones sticking out above the group, and some people are holding cameras on stepladders, while others appear to be reporters talking with microphones in their hands to TV cameras against the main gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The old man guard and some teachers seem to be appealing for the group to disband but I guess it&#8217;s useless. They are doing their job, too.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s going to be tough going back home through that press hordes&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, that&#8217;s all I can think about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I watched the scene from my window, a number of police vehicles arrived and the police officers dodged the media blocking the gates to the left and right. Every time a police car drove past them and into the school, I could see a large number of flashes being fired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Terashima&#8230;..isn&#8217;t it difficult to do? If you want, I can advise the head of the department to take you off the case.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem, don&#8217;t worry about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inomoto-senpai is a rather caring person despite having a gorilla&#8217;s physique.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason he said such a thing was because he was sent by the HQ to the investigation headquarters and my fiancée to be in charge of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Early this morning, the HQ led the establishment of a task force to investigate the 『mass disappearance of schoolgirls』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We, who were in charge of the earlier disappearances of Misuzu Kurosawa and Masaki Haneda, have a very narrow shoulder to lean on. We have not yet achieved any results other than the accidental return of Misuzu-sama.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this morning&#8217;s meeting, when Inomoto senpai mentioned the name of the Kamijima clan, he was laughed at, saying, 『How can a clan that can only sell runaway girls they hooked up with at a barbecue into the sex trade do something so public?』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, the investigators have started their investigation along the lines of the work of a large-scale overseas human trafficking ring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now, in the headmaster&#8217;s office, there were two detectives from the HQ, including Inspector Nakamura, who was the head of the headquarters, and Inomoto senior and myself, who had been in charge of the school for a long time. On the school side, the headmaster, vice principal and a balding teacher who claims to be the advisor of the girls&#8217; track and field team were all present.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So all the victims this time were in class until the sixth period?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Inspector Nakamura asks this, the headmaster replies, wiping the sweat from his forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, we have confirmed with each homeroom teacher. But we don&#8217;t know where they went from there. The guard seemed to remember the face of one of the victims, Hatsui Tashiro, the head of the club, as 『a polite girl who greeted the students properly』, but he did not see her among the students leaving the school, that&#8217;s what he said.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230;Did she participate in any club activities?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, one of the remaining club members, second-year student Rimi Ninagawa, told her homeroom teacher. When she visited the clubroom, it was locked, so she went to the staff room to get the key. But there was no key, and she said that the record book she had taken out had the name of first-year student Ota written on it. So she borrowed a spare key from her adviser and opened the clubroom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that true?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Inspector Nakamura asked this, the adviser simply replied in a disappearing voice: [Yes].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s the other student who was late and left behind, isn&#8217;t it? Hikari Teruya came to the clubroom and said that 『maybe they all boycotted practice』 since they have talked about it together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boycott&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Inspector Nakamura turned his attention to the adviser, he shook his head hurriedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, I had nothing to do with that! It&#8217;s just that I had a slight argument with the captain, Tashiro, over a difference in coaching policy&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, you shouldn&#8217;t say like it&#8217;s none of our business. We are teachers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the headmaster rebuked him with a face as if he was biting a bitter bug, the advisor sagged and nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would normally be an unprecedented and unusual incident. Even though it was after school, as many as 18 people disappeared like smoke from the school premises, where people were watching and running about. At the moment, I can&#8217;t help but come to the ridiculous conclusion that it&#8217;s either a supernatural phenomenon or a case of a mysterious disappearance. However, since I myself know that Master did it, I&#8217;m somewhat looking forward to seeing what kind of ridiculous theories will emerge in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After thinking for a moment, Inspector Nakamura looked at the headmaster and began.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Principal, I would like to mobilise a large number of investigators to search the school premises&#8230;..”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You want &#8230;&#8230; to search the school?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, according to what you&#8217;ve just told us, she was taken from inside the school. We might be able to find some kind of trace&#8230;&#8230;or it could be that there is a place in this school building that the teachers don&#8217;t know about, where they are being held captive.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s absurd!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The vice principal raises his voice and Inspector Nakamura smiles in an appeasing and soothing manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s only a possibility.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When will it start&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s already, right now.”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The headmaster gave a slight thoughtful gesture, then told the vice principal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Vice principal., please instruct the teachers to have the students leave the school promptly after sixth period. Also, the school will be temporarily closed tomorrow. In addition, please instruct the teachers to take proper action according to the emergency manual.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t say anything to the media. If they report something strange,it would cause rumour mongering, and that’s a big problem. And don&#8217;t stop if someone stops you!　Also, school is temporarily closed tomorrow and Friday. Don&#8217;t come to school by mistake!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The homeroom teacher, Gorioka, said bitterly in the homeroom after class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Swirling around in my head is a man I don&#8217;t remember. The man who imprisoned me. Since he had embraced me, he was probably a man. There&#8217;s no way that man had nothing to do with the incident with the girls’ track team this time. What in the world is he up to this time?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I left the classroom, someone stopped me from behind, saying [Kurosawa-san].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, there she was, detective Terashima-san. She was going to drive me home again today. To be honest, I was relieved. If I tried to break through the media in front of the main gate now, I would be an easy prey. It wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if my portrait was circulating amongst the press. After all, all they had to do was get it from any magazine.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the backseat of Terashima-san&#8217;s car, I lay down, covering her head with her jacket. The car starts to move, and from outside the window I hear angry voices of the press and police officers, who seem to be struggling with each other. After a while, Terashima-san opens her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s alright now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up and looked through the rear glass, and saw the press gathering in front of the school gate moving away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After letting out a sigh of relief, I asked Terashima-san, who looked at me through the rear-view mirror.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Terashima-san&#8230;&#8230;are you going to be okay?　Those&#8230;&#8230; detectives, everyone seemed busy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I had a hard time getting out, but at least I got out for now. The people at the main office are hard-headed, however I managed to talk the chief of staff out of risking putting you in front of the press media&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s part of my job.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as the car approached my house, I saw that the press were also swarming in front of my house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..seriously?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t dare to run into those presses. I guess Terashima-san couldn&#8217;t bear to see me like this. She spoke this as if she was concerned about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu-sama, if you don&#8217;t mind, would you like to stay at my house tonight?　Of course, with your parents&#8217; permission&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Thank you very much! I&#8217;ll call my mum right away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Terashima-san appears to be a saving grace. When I called my mum and explained the situation, she sounded relieved and said she would be grateful if I would let her do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She said she&#8217;d really appreciate it&#8230;&#8230;and that Mum wanted to thank you and asked me to lend  my phone to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m driving. Please tell her that her kindness is enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a 30-minute drive from there, Terashima-san drives into the underground car park of the apartment building. A splendid tower recently built in the neighbouring town. I&#8217;ve seen flyers in the newspaper, but it&#8217;s quite a luxurious condominium.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had an image that civil servants are not well paid but it seems that was a prejudice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her house is a four-bedroom apartment on the top floor, and although the room itself is magnificent, it seems she has just been moved in, with few things and a bleak appearance. However, it is not without the smell of life, and the number of empty beer cans left on the low table in the living room gives a glimpse of her disordered eating habits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: In the Raw, the author uses a japanese real estate term called LDK, which is Living,Dining and Kitchen Room together with the number of rooms. For Example, 1K is a one room apartment with a kitchen. 1DK is a one room apartment with a dining and kitchen area. 1LDK is a one room apartment with a living, dining and kitchen area. Ryoko Terashima’s house is 4LDK.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Terashima-san looks back at me as she hurriedly puts away the beer cans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu-sama, I must return to school at once. You may use this room freely. You may eat whatever is in the kitchen. It&#8217;s all instant food, though&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T,thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The sofa in the living room can be used as a sofa bed, I will prepare a set of bedding and change of clothes for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Terashima-san, please don&#8217;t be so self-conscious. I feel so nervous&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about it. Also, if the intercom rings, please ignore it. So, the media may not be able to get a whiff of you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s truly a very thorough service. I feel a bit intimidated when someone goes to such lengths with me. Terashima-san is neither a relative nor a friend. She is just a detective who happened to be in charge of a stranger. Just as I was about to thank her once again, I suddenly heard a 『ping-pong!』 rang out on the intercom, announcing the arrival of a visitor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-is it the press?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s too early for that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Terashima-san told me, who was in a panic, and looked into the intercom monitor. The next moment, she held her head up in a big way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve forgotten&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Nee-chan. You called me and now you told me to go home? Isn&#8217;t that a bit harsh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m after anymore. Didn&#8217;t you see the news during the day?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, the one about all the girls going missing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that one. Thanks to that, I have to go back to the scene now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if you say that, I can&#8217;t go back to the dormitory now. I&#8217;ll leave on my own tomorrow and let me stay here, it&#8217;s auto-locked, right? Here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait a minute! Kyoko-chan!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slamming, noisy footsteps could be heard coming from the front door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ban</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, she opened the door and a rather flamboyant woman entered the living room. Her red-dyed hair was bouncing carelessly, as if it had not been groomed very well, and on her ears was a string of ring earrings and ear cuffs. She has a well-defined face but no make-up, giving the impression that she is a little younger than Terashima-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wears a sleeveless black T-shirt and black skinny jeans. She wears a checked flannel shirt around her waist and carries a soft case on her shoulder that looks like an electric guitar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At a quick glance, she gives the impression of a punk rocker from a decade ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she saw me, she rolled her eyes and screamed out in a crazy voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uoo, a beautiful girl. My sister&#8217;s bringing in a beautiful girl in uniform!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t talk like that! I&#8217;m sorry, Kurosawa-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah&#8230;&#8230;I give up, This is Misuzu Kurosawa. I’m taking her into temporary custody because of the flood of press at her home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was surprised that such a thing was even on the news, a red-haired woman thrust her face in my face unkindly and I turned away with a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tajitaji </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">movement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine&#8230;good or not, I&#8217;m also on the side of being taken care of.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the content of their conversation, it seems that Terashima-san called Kyoko-san for some kind of business but was unable to do so because of the disappearance of the girls’ track team members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, Kyoko-chan. Onee-chan have to go now! You can use my bedroom but don&#8217;t bother Kurosawa-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“HeeiheiーIii”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kyoko-san fluttered and waved her hand in a troublesome manner, Terashima-san sighed heavily again and turned her head towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, Kurosawa-san, please take your time and rest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without saying so, she left in a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I haven&#8217;t known Terashima-san for a long time, but I feel like I&#8217;ve never seen her speak so emotionally. It&#8217;s like the words are full of blood&#8230;.. something like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I haven&#8217;t seen you for a long time, but you&#8217;re still as formal as ever, Nee-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko-san propped the guitar case against the wall, then went to the kitchen, opened the fridge and without any pretence of discretion, took out a beer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you want something to drink too, Kurosawa-chan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaーii.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sit down on the sofa bed that Terashima-san has arranged for me to sleep on and receive a plastic bottle of mineral water from Kyoko-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyoko-san, that&#8230;&#8230;news or something, has it been reported that much?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? Oh, you mean the case. Well, it&#8217;s a media treat when young girls are involved, so why don&#8217;t you have a look?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko-san picked up the remote control from the table and switched on the television. As she flicked through the channels, she found that it was probably because it was right around the time of the evening news. All the stations seemed to be talking about the disappearance of the female track and field team member.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko-san stops at the appropriate channel and we watchit  for a while, and when my and Masaki&#8217;s names come up in the explanation of how the incident happened, I involuntarily stiffen. At least, while I was watching, my portrait did not appear but I still felt depressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Kurosa-chan, really, where were you while you were missing?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehー!　Maybe you&#8217;ve been abducted by aliens!　Do you have a chip or something implanted somewhere in your body?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha&#8230;..that&#8217;s not a bad idea but the hospital did a full examination and everything was fine&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When talking to Kyoko-san, she was more personable and easier to talk to than Terashima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She spreads out crisps she has found in the kitchen and then we engage in chit-chat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is in charge of the guitar in a reasonably popular amateur girls&#8217; band and had practised at the studio today before coming here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmーno, it&#8217;s probably been about two years. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve been here. I&#8217;ve been looking at a map on my phone while searching this place. When we move away from our home, you don&#8217;t get a chance to see each other at all. Currently, I&#8217;m staying in a university dormitory.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh&#8230;&#8230;I see. I also wanted an older sister like Terashima-san. She&#8217;s kind and cool like a smart woman&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, it&#8217;s not that good. When your Nee-chan is too good, you know. It&#8217;s hard for me as  the younger sister. No matter what you do, you&#8217;re always compared.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that how it is?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s the way it is. So, in order not to be compared to Nee-chan, I tried to go in a different direction as much as possible, and I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko-san chuckles with her third beer in her hand. She is not at all pale, perhaps because she is a strong drinker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you know, I was surprised. I haven&#8217;t seen my sister for two years, and she suddenly called me. She said she&#8217;s going to introduce me to the best guy, so come to my place&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I can&#8217;t imagine it but maybe he wears silver-rimmed glasses or something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The answer was so unexpected that my brain refused to comprehend it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because, you know, we’re human beings and when we are together, there will always be things that piss us off or that we don&#8217;t like. It&#8217;s only in the first three months of a relationship that you can blindly say 『he&#8217;s so cool』 or 『I love him』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I do. But if the sex is good, the expiry date of 『I like you』 is renewed every time we have sex. Women are selfish creatures, so in the end they like a man who satisfies them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He…Heee……”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lately, I feel like I&#8217;ve been letting out these superficial [heh] more often than not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Kurosa-chan, do you have a boyfriend?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, yes. We only started going out at the end of last year.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, how is it? How&#8217;s the chemistry?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I,I don&#8217;t know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, you&#8217;re new at this. Then, next time you have sex with your boyfriend, you should try it while paying attention to the chemistry. A man with whom you have good sex seems to be the one you were meant to be with. It&#8217;s like God created them that way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it is. Well, I haven&#8217;t met a guy like that yet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Fumio!　I saw the news. Your school is in trouble!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I arrived home, my mother scurried out of the kitchen and into the foyer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that&#8217;s why they said the school will be temporarily closed tomorrow. I don&#8217;t know any of the missing students, so it&#8217;s a bit of a strange thing for me. I just feel lucky to have more holidays.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;m actually right in the middle of all the commotion.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is Mai-san okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The ones who went missing were girls from the girls’ track and field team. Fujiwara-san had nothing to do with it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t care about that&#8230;..but you made sure you took Mai home, didn&#8217;t you? I&#8217;m not worried about you, but I&#8217;m worried about Mai-san&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes but let&#8217;s worry about your own children, MaiMazaー. I just happened to drop her off at Fujiwara-san&#8217;s house today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: It’s [My mother] why I wrote like that is that Fumio called his mother in english, meaning in katakana:</span><span style="font-weight: 400">マイマザ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s fine then&#8230;&#8230;but don&#8217;t go out there and say you&#8217;re lucky. There are kids in the neighbourhood who got caught up in it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I roll my eyes involuntarily. I didn&#8217;t think that there were students from the same school so close by, let alone when I was in primary school or junior high school. Nor did I think that they would be among the students I had locked up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, Saori-chan from Moribe-san&#8217;s family, you used to go to school with her in elementary school. Don&#8217;t you remember her?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not at all, I don&#8217;t remember.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moー, she used to call you Onii-chan, Onii-chan but you&#8217;re such a heartless boy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Primary school students in this school district are supposed to go to school in groups in the morning with other children from the neighbourhood. However, just because they go to school together doesn&#8217;t mean they are friends, and they naturally drift apart once they reach junior high school. I have a vague recollection of walking to school with a girl&#8217;s hand in my hand, but I no longer remember her face or name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But still, it was tough with the&#8230;&#8230;press blocking the main gate. It would be unbearable if it was still like this at the beginning of the week.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chaos at the end of the school day was quite severe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t want to get caught up in the commotion and even though homeroom had long since finished, I was still gazing blankly out of the classroom window towards the chaos at the main gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, what a commotion. But from my point of view, I guess I&#8217;m lucky. I get to spend more time with Fumin than usual.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fujiwara-san leans on my shoulder as if to pamper me. However, as usual, I could hardly feel her breasts against my chest, so I didn&#8217;t have to pay any attention to her. It really is a safe washboard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were a few other students left in the classroom who seemed to be planning to leave after the chaos had settled down, but the teachers must have been told to send the students home as soon as possible. [Kuuoraa! Get out of school quickly!] Gorioka, the homeroom teacher, shouted at us, and we all left the classroom in a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But we still couldn&#8217;t bring ourselves to leave in the midst of all that press. Fujiwara-san and I had no choice but to head towards the back gate. The back gate is always closed, but the wall is not so high that we can just climb over it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu–min! Catch me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t. Get down yourself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehhh, no way!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I climbed over the fence and looked up at Fujiwara-san, who was standing on top of the fence, and I saw her really nasty leopard-print shorts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The back gate faces a forest road and there were no press present, probably because it is a place where no cars can enter. Some of the others had gone home through here and there were many footprints of athletic shoes on the damp soil outside the gate.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s a long way but it&#8217;s a lot better than being squeezed in by those people&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With schools temporarily closed tomorrow, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, will all this fuss be over by Monday?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t expect the news media to stick around for that long unless there are new developments, but if I have to take the long way home from the back gate every day, that&#8217;s quite a hassle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who&#8217;s to blame, well&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s my fault.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After dinner, I lay in bed in my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn&#8217;t going to visit the 『Bedroom』  today. Because today would be a day to embrace Ryoko, but she is investigating the abduction of the girls’ track and field team.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoko had messaged me to apologise for not being able to spend the evening with me, but of course it was nothing to apologise for. It was me who created this situation.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s not a bad idea to take a break once in a while&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about this, Lili suddenly appeared, spinning round and round right above me. Then, with an unusually serious look on her face, she asks me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“FumiFumi, there is one thing I want to confirm with you, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This time, FumiFumi did something reckless because of that black gal, right Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well. At least half of them do. Four people took images of Fujiwara-san. It&#8217;s not enough to identify her as a short-cut athlete and it&#8217;s also possible that stories about Fujiwara-san&#8217;s past may have been leaked to other girls. I really should have dealt with it when she was filmed but at that point I didn&#8217;t think anything of her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sympathy Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know how to say it&#8230;&#8230;.I just dislike it. I feel agitated with people messing with my stuff.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not accusing you of anything, Devi. I&#8217;m just wondering why, for someone who says&#8230;&#8230;she&#8217;s yours, but only her, the black gal doesn&#8217;t get locked up by you. Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah, it does seem a bit weird, doesn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn&#8217;t make sense, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know if I can explain it well, but Masaki-chan, Kurosawa-san and Fujiwara-san are special in my heart. It&#8217;s difficult to ask what&#8217;s special about them, but I&#8217;m attracted to them to the point where I can&#8217;t rank them higher or lower&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s no mystery, Devi. It&#8217;s just hatred turned upside down, Devi. If you are unable to choose between them, it is unreasonable for you to avoid touching the black gal, Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s the thing, but the difference between her and Kurosawa-san and Masaki-chan is that she&#8217;s been exposed to men&#8217;s desires all her life. It&#8217;s on a hypothetical level but I think I&#8217;m special to her because I can hold her at any time but I don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;.I feel like if I make a bad move, my value to her is going to plummet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this and turned my attention towards Lili, she had a look of great surprise on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“FumiFumi has grown up, Devi. You&#8217;re so cheeky!”</span></p>

<p><strong>The Third Day of Imprisonment for the Girls’ Track and Field. Trap</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Night has fallen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The field investigation, which had continued through the night, had so far yielded no positive results.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s no wonder, because without knowing about master&#8217;s 『Room』 , there&#8217;s no way they could have known how did the eighteen schoolgirls was kidnap. There is no way that a haphazard investigation will yield any results, but even so, many investigators, including myself, have continued to solemnly examine the scene of the crime after only a short nap. It was really painful to have to seriously tackle something that I knew was meaningless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was walking down the corridor towards the headmaster&#8217;s office with this in mind, I was stopped in my tracks by someone calling out to me from behind. I turn around and there he is, Inspector Nakamura &#8211; my fiancée.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it? Inspector.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I reply, he smiles bitterly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When it&#8217;s just the two of us, we don&#8217;t have to use our job title, Ryoko-san. It&#8217;s a bit private. Right now I&#8217;m staying at a hotel by the station, but&#8230;&#8230;this case seems like it&#8217;s going to drag on. I thought it would be better if I commuted from my apartment too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, the apartment I now live in was purchased by this man as my new home after marriage. Of course, the name also belongs to this man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I come over there tonight?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not long ago, I would have been delighted. I might have immediately thought of a menu in my head to serve a home-cooked meal to the man I love. But I don&#8217;t think so anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, Takehiko-san&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;m actually protecting the returned person in this case &#8211; Misuzu Kurosawa-san&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I explained the situation surrounding her house and told him that I had no choice but to protect her as an emergency evacuation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he chuckled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, I can&#8217;t just barge into an apartment with a high school girl, can I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He scratched his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;ve done something rash&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m rather proud that the person who is going to be my wife is such a kind person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he gently took my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pretend to be embarrassed, passing over the feeling of disgust that creeps up my spine. It&#8217;s annoying to be touched by a man who isn&#8217;t my master, but this is where I have to be patient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I force down the discomfort that is about to appear on my face and almost as soon as I smile, I see a uniformed policeman come running from across the corridor, flapping his slippers and clapping his hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Inspector! Inspector Nakamura!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inspector Nakamura hurriedly let go of my hand when he was called out. The uniformed police officer rushed to his side and as he caught his breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just now, a female student came forward to tell us that she witnessed something that may be related to the incident&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apart from the two girls from the girls&#8217; track team?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two remaining members of the track team &#8211; Teruya Hikari and Ninagawa Rimi are asked to come to the school for questioning but that was during the afternoon. It is now half past eight in the morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, She&#8217;s a first-year student at this school called Fukuda Rin.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll be right there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Inspector Nakamura, if it&#8217;s a female student, it would be better if I were present too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s true. There may be some things that are difficult to talk about unless it&#8217;s between women, could you do that for me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, of course.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a reason why I asked to be present. I knew the surname Fukuda.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember that the student who confessed her feelings to Master and was rejected by him had that name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a slightly bad premonition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fukuda-san. I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to come forward.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230;..I was scared, but I have a friend among the missing children,&#8230;&#8230; so I thought I could be of some help&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While waiting for the detective to come to the headmaster’s office, I was having such a conversation with the headmaster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is true that  I am worried about Mako, but it is not for her that I’m going to the trouble of trying to testify to the police.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, the content of the story is not very important and the only purpose is that I wanted to give a testimony to the police and make the police turn their heads at that disgusting man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[She means Fumio.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a knock on the headmaster&#8217;s door and three people enter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you very much for your patience.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man with slender silver-rimmed glasses and a woman with a wavy short-cut sat on the sofa opposite and the uniformed officer stood behind them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye, yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m nervous to be told that. I am the only student among the adults. And although the man is smiling kindly, the woman is staring at me with a stern, observant look in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, may I ask your name again?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I&#8217;m Fukuda Rin from Year 1, Class C.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what did you see?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, the day before yesterday, after the sixth period, I went to the club building with Mako&#8230;. I mean, Masako Inui-san from the track &amp; field club.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hou&#8230;&#8230;with the victim.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The male detective and the female detective look at each other and nod to each other. Perhaps they confirmed that 『Inui Masako』 was definitely one of the missing persons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. But I’m the manager of the boys’ football club, so we parted ways near the women’s club building and Inui-san joined her seniors who were walking in front of us. After that, they went into the girls’ track and field club room together”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You saw them enter the clubroom?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, so I think it was right after I parted with Inui-san. I saw a figure quickly hiding behind the women’s club building. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing, so I couldn’t tell for sure, but to my eyes, it looked like Kijima-senpai, a third-year student”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I felt as if the female detective was glaring at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiii!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is something wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry. I seem to have gotten carried away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman detective said so, and the man detective mended it with a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s a very serious person, so don’t worry about&#8230;&#8230; her. So, is that figure Kijima&#8230;&#8230;-kun? How did you know it was him if you couldn’t tell for sure?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, I&#8230;&#8230;love Kijima-senpai. It&#8217;s a senior I&#8217;m interested in, so I&#8217;ve always followed him with my eyes, but the body shape and movements of that hidden figure were definitely Kijima-senpai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230; that Kijima-kun, is he in the sports club?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, he’s not in any club activities. So I was wondering why he was in such a place”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman detective then opened her mouth as if she was biting the edge of my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Was it really Kijima? You wondered but you didn&#8217;t check properly?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it, she is a bit scary. Her temples seem to be twitching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;. it was close to the start of club activities.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman was about to say something more, but the man interrupted her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, thank you very much. Is there anything else?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, just this one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. Thank you for your cooperation. I&#8217;m sorry to trouble you, but I&#8217;d like to leave you a written statement of what you&#8217;ve just told us. Are you sure you have time for this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230;..I have no other plans today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, you take care of the rest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After giving instructions to the uniformed officer standing behind them, the two detectives left the headmaster&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think about what she just said&#8230;Ryoko?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inspector Nakamura asked me as soon as we left the headmaster&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The only positive thing that came out of it was that we were able to confirm that the victims had stopped by the clubroom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. That would be important. When Ninagawa-san went to the clubroom, it was 『locked』, that&#8217;s what he testified. In other words, assuming that there are no lies or factual errors in the story so far, it would be safe to assume that the members of the club who disappeared had once entered the clubroom and then deliberately locked the door before leaving.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t think they were forcibly removed?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least not at the point where the victims were leaving the clubroom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, it is not the clubroom that the track and field team members entered, but master&#8217;s disguised clubroom, so it is only natural that the clubroom remains locked. In the first place, they never did not enter the clubroom, let alone leave it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I should take advantage of this story. If this story goes on, I may be able to keep Inspector Nakamura&#8217;s eyes away from master.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, someone must have led them&#8230;&#8230;It makes sense to think that way, doesn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inspector Nakamura nodded broadly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And there are no signs of a struggle inside or outside the clubroom. The question is who led them where? Ryoko-san, are you acquainted with the boy named Kijima mentioned in the story?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, we have interviewed him before. but &#8230;&#8230; frankly, I don&#8217;t think he had anything to do with it. He is despised by other students who talk about him as a kimo-jima and he is below the average person in terms of both physical and mental fitness. Detective Inomoto described him as a typical bullied kid. I find it hard to believe that the schoolgirls would like him”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt as if I were coughing up blood as I sneered at Master. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it is to protect master, this must be reported to him and I must be punished. I must be thoroughly chastised for this&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ryoko-san&#8230;..your face looks very red, are you alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? No, no problem at all!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feign a little bit and open my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In any case, if they were led somewhere by someone, the person who led them there is someone they should follow”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s just an assumption at this point, but&#8230;&#8230; yes. Anyway, I would like to talk to the boy named Kijima”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? I don’t think he’s involved&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, of course he is. At the very least, it’s not something that the boy can do on his own, and if he can’t play a role in guiding the members of the club, he should be considered irrelevant to the matter”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But if he was near the club room, as Fukuda-said said, he might have witnessed something. Whether or not he was actually there is not something that can be hidden if we investigate on that premise”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His conclusion was perfectly legitimate. So, if I resist any longer, I might end up instilling distrust in him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. I’ll try to get in touch with him since I have his contact information from the previous interview”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He must be happy that there was progress in the investigation.[Please do]  He nodded his head in satisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear my mother&#8217;s voice coming from downstairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turn my sleepy eyes to the digital clock on my bedside table and see that it&#8217;s just past nine o&#8217;clock.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘When was the last time I woke up and no one was sleeping next to me?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this thought in mind, I crept out of bed and down the stairs, yawning as I walked to the dining room table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom peeks out from the counter kitchen and says in a disgruntled voice, [You should at least make your own coffee,]  but, well, that&#8217;s it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Two sugars, please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnmooー, then, do you want a fried egg?　One eye? Both eyes?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Both eyes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then both eyes, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, because of the temporary school closure, I&#8217;ve got a lot of free time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What shall I do&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m bored today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki is told that she will be receiving acting instruction from Lili all day today in preparation for her contact with the girls&#8217; track and field team. Ryoko, of course, has her hands full with the investigation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who&#8217;s fault is it that I don&#8217;t have anyone to play with, but of course it&#8217;s my fault.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Speaking of which, I wonder how Kurosawa-san is doing?　I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d be wandering around in this situation, but I wonder if she&#8217;s meeting with Kasuya-kun&#8230;..which makes me feel somewhat &#8230;&#8230; moyamoya’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:feeling depressed]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about this, toast, salad, fried eggs and coffee were laid out on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here you go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230;&#8230; thank yo, uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment when I looked up, I was startled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The very first thing I saw was Fujiwara-san there, in black-haired lady mode, smiling at me in her apron.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“AraAra,  Fumio, you&#8217;re speaking so loudly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what are you doing here, Fujiwara-san?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ufufu. It’s my day off, so I’ve come to take care of Fumio-sama as well as train myself as a bride”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, from the other side of the counter kitchen, my mother shouted with great joy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai-san, you’re amazing. You’re a better cook than Mom. Why would such a good girl go out with Fumio? She ranks among the Seven Wonders of the World.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Seven Wonders ain&#8217;t a ranking.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know that&#8217;s not the point. I regained my composure and turned my head towards Fujiwara-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, I&#8217;m busy today. I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t be together with you&#8230;&#8230; Go home!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“AreAreーAlthough, you’ve said [What should I do today? &#8230;&#8230;I’m bored] earlier. Also, you don’t have a friend too, Fumio-sama. But, it’s fine now. Let’s have a relaxing date in your room”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although her tone of voice is polite, she is still  Fujiwara-san. She was aggressive as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I heard a rattling ring from my room on the second floor.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Phone call? Who is it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t remember anyone calling me other than my family. But the timing is a blessing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My phone&#8217;s ringing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got out of my seat in a hurry and ran up the stairs to escape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I left Inspector Nakamura, I holed myself up in a private room in the women&#8217;s toilet and tapped the string 『MASTER』 .The reason why the registered name is not 『Goshujin-sama』 is so that, in case someone sees me, I can excuse that I am the master of my favourite bar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One or two calls ring in my ears, and after waiting for awhile, master answers the phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice timing. Ryoko. Wonderful.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Master answered the phone and suddenly praised me. I don&#8217;t know what it means, but I got wet anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh, what is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m sorry. I was just talking about this. What’s more, what’s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I reported to him about Rin Fukuda’s tip-off and told him that I would like him to come to the school in the afternoon, there was a distinctly unpleasant emotion in the Master&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure she’s watching me&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, it would be impossible for her to know that Master in that place just by guesswork. The question is, to what extent was Master being seen?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At the moment, the master is not under suspicion, but at the interview he will be asked two questions: 『Why was he there?』 and 『Did he witness anything?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about denying I was there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it would be a good idea&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, well done for letting us know. Keep me posted.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll leave it to you.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aaa, now I am at the service of Master&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After hanging up the phone, I stayed on and enjoyed the lingering sound of the Master&#8217;s voice for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, that&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s not like you don&#8217;t want to have sex with your boyfriend, right, Kurosa-chan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;well &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko-san looked over my shoulder and peeked at my phone and smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know the area, but there&#8217;s probably a love hotel close to where you&#8217;re meeting, right? He&#8217;s definitely going to do it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think there is a love hotel called La Vian Rose behind the station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ui-chan &#8230;&#8230; We&#8217;re thirsty!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re not the only one suffering, Shima.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s true, but&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;..I hear that people can live for a while without food but they can&#8217;t last long without water. Something must be done.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just saying…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I &#8211; Saori Moribe &#8211; looked up when I heard such an exchange between Captain Tashiro and Shima-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dimly lit room with green indirect lighting. How much time has already passed since we, the eighteen members of the girls’ track and field club, were locked in? In terms of physical time, I think it&#8217;s been about a day and a half, and right now it&#8217;s around Friday morning, but I don&#8217;t know how much I can rely on that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we woke up, we screamed and cried at our own indecent attire &#8211; naked and turtle-bound but that’s for the first hour at most. The rest of the time, we just lay there limply without anyone saying anything else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without any contact from the perpetrators, without knowing why, we were simply left without water or food.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is fair to say that Shima-senpai&#8217;s lamentable comment is felt by all members of the club. As I listened, expecting the Captain to have an idea, her statement was abruptly thrust obliquely upwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, Shima. Those who are lost at sea are supposed to quench their thirst by drinking a little water.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They must have heard their conversation. Some people jumped up and down in various places. That&#8217;s right. I don&#8217;t want to drink urine, no matter how much. I don&#8217;t like it either</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s only one question!　If you find yourself in a situation where you absolutely have to drink, whose would you drink?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s the problem?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know I shouldn&#8217;t, but I can&#8217;t help but raise my voice at the overly crazy remark. And because of that, the Captain&#8217;s eyes turned towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “Oh, Moribe. Hmm, I think I can drink yours”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe-chan is likely to provide water, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiiiiii!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily scrunched up my face and stuffed my voice down my throat. But their target quickly moved on to another child.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about…. Inui?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it&#8217;s more likely no”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I heard a gasping sound in the distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, a gasping sound was heard in the distance. It was probably Inui Masako──Mako, who had just gasped. Then, a first-year student in a very ladylike vertical roll, who was lying next to Shima-senpai, let out an exasperated sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Senpai, please &#8230;&#8230; enough. We are all frightened.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her name is Kayama Yui.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is said to be the daughter of a good family, but I don&#8217;t know the details. She is not good under pressure and is almost always confined to the toilet during competitions, hence her nickname 『Miss Bowel』.She is a gem of a girl who has earned the name of disappointingly beautiful girl in the athletics club.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll pass, too, Kayama&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why is that!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why is that? &#8230;&#8230;Well, I just think that a nice young lady like you might have a protein or sugar problem from overindulgence”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t that an adult disease!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it seems you eat a lot of meat. You look like an animal”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re so prejudiced!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m already at my limit with hunger and thirst&#8230;..It&#8217;s so hard for me. So I wondered why these people were so energetic and then I realised that all three of them were long-distance athletes. I was convinced&#8230;..</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Making statements is such a pain in the ass &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankly, I was fed up. The police officer would handwrite a record of what I had said in my statement. The police officer would check over and over again, saying in the first person, 『I, Rin Fukuda, am&#8230;』 in a polite way that I had never used before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to this, by the time I left the school, I was exhausted. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s customary or what, but I think it&#8217;s a miracle that such inefficient work survives in this age of Reiwa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:Reiwa is the current era of Japan&#8217;s official calendar. It began on 1 May 2019, the day on which Emperor Akihito&#8217;s elder son, Naruhito, ascended the throne as the 126th Emperor of Japan. The day before, Emperor Akihito abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne, marking the end of the Heisei era ]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaa Mou, it&#8217;s way past noon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it&#8217;s not all over. Rather, this is where it all starts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I walk with my shoulders drooped, I open the football club&#8217;s group chat on my phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;ve just reported it to the police, but on the day the track team disappeared, I saw a third-year student, KijimaーSenpai, hanging around the clubroom. I&#8217;ve been scared of that senior for a while now because he&#8217;s been following me around. I feel like, Suck on that. If I go missing, it might be his doing.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I typed that and my mouth relaxed involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that&#8217;s the end of that creep. Now, where shall I disappear too?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be a good idea to vacation in a tropical country for a week or so even though it would cut into my savings. And after I come back, I can just go through with the same comments as Misuzu-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I don&#8217;t remember anything. It&#8217;s been a week since I found out』”</span></p>
