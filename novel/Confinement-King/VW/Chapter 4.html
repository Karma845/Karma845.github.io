<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Cute Little Kyouko</h3>

<p><strong>Kyouko Terashima got Beaten by her Own Game.</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where&#8217;s Kurosawa-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, haha &#8230;&#8230; er, that&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Nee-chan came back to the apartment late at night, she looked around the room and then glared at me with all her might. She looked at me with a sworn look, as if she could have held a gun to my head if I had misled her, perhaps because of yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her that Kurosawa-chan had left in contemplation, Nee-chan collapsed from her knees with the most desperate look I had ever seen on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne,Nee-chan!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha,Wha,Wha,Wha…what should I do? What apology should I make?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know who Nee-chan was apologising to, but this response was too dramatic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about it,Kurosa-chan just had a friend to come and pick her up..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fr,friend? I hope it wasn&#8217;t that boyfriend of hers!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s different. This Fujiwara girl. Kurosawa-chan said she was her best friend&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told Nee-chan this, she let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that might have calmed her down a little, but the next moment, Sis suddenly twists up my chest and puts her pissed-off face right in front of my nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Kyoko, &#8230;&#8230; answer me honestly. What did you do to Kurosawa-san?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne,Nee-chan, your face scares me. &#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Silence!  Answer me, Gumai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[foolish/stupid younger sister, Gu is stupid mai is sister, combine=Gumai]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Calling your own sister gumai is cruel! It&#8217;s no big deal. I was just trying to cheer her up a bit. I was just joking when I asked her if she wanted to be my sex friend, but she took it seriously…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a stupid &#8230;&#8230; thing to do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nee-chan made a face like it was the end of the world and removed her hand from my chest and shoved me away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what she’s upset about, but if she reacts like that, I start to feel uneasy too.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Could it be that Kurosawa-chan is a very important person?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s an irreparable blunder&#8230;..how should I apologise&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nee-chan was mumbling with a thoughtful expression on her face, but then she suddenly turned her eyes towards me. Then, while staring at me with hollow, vacant eyes, she nodded her head in a small way, as if she had made up her mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyoko-chan, come here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what&#8217;s this all about? I don&#8217;t understand!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just come here! Come here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nee-chan held my wrist and forcibly pulled me into the bedroom. Then she put her hand on the wall of the bedroom and suddenly a door appeared there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh!? W-what&#8217;s this? What&#8217;s this, Nee-chan!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t mind it! Shut up and follow me.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side of the door that my sister forced me into. It was a gorgeous room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White plastered walls and marble floor. The expensive-looking furnishings were all blue.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oioi, was this apartment this big?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for me, I can only be puzzled. I slept in the bedroom yesterday but there was no door there and before that, on the other side of the wall where the door appeared was the living room. Structurally, there is no way there could be a room like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne, Nee-chan, w-what&#8217;s this? This place!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nee-chan just throws a cold stare at the confused me and grumpily dismisses it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be quiet, silence.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Qui,silence….??At least explain it to me! What&#8217;s wrong with you, Nee-chan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sibling fights have always been a daily occurrence but I&#8217;ve never seen Nee-chan&#8217;s eyes this cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nee-chan walked out of the room, leaving a perplexed me behind. I hurried after her. Outside the room was a stone corridor that looked like something out of a film. I had no idea what was going on.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is that apartment, isn&#8217;t it? How many bedrooms are there?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I followed my sister to the door at the end of the room and jumped in, I found a huge bed in the middle of the spacious room, with a bed on which ten people could easily lie down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there was a boy sitting on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A boy with a dark aura and a rather dull appearance. When he saw Nee-chan and me, he opened his mouth in a somewhat puzzled manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong? I thought you weren&#8217;t coming today. Besides, who&#8217;s that girl over there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Nee-chan suddenly knelt down at the guy&#8217;s feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am sorry, Master. My sister was very disrespectful to Misuzu-sama while she was with her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa, wait Ryoko. I can&#8217;t see what you&#8217;re talking about. &#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tells him that I ignited her desire to see her boyfriend. Then she told him that I had urged Kurosawa-chan to become a sex friend. But I can&#8217;t see why Nee-chan is telling the story at all.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Nee-chan, why are you apologising to this kid? Who is this guy?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to force myself to imagine it, the fact that Nee-chan is in his hands must mean that he is probably the son of a member in the parliament, or something like that. That means that this little shit, who has a crush on Kurosa-chan, probably had Nee-chan keep an eye on Kurosa-chan or something like that. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m disgusted by people who use their power as a cover and use people as their jaws. But it&#8217;s also true that because of me, I put Nee-chan in a situation where she had to get down on her knees to this little shit.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It can&#8217;t be helped&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, little shit. I&#8217;m sorry, Nee-chan has nothing to do with it, I&#8217;ll take the punishment or whatever.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at the little shit&#8217;s virginity-smelling hangnail and say. The guy then looks at Nee-chan with a wry smile on his face and asks her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hee&#8230;&#8230; Ryoko, your sister says this. Can I hold her?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That&#8217;s&#8230;..not much of a punishment is…’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘See, look, to hold or not to hold, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about, isn&#8217;t it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, little shit. I&#8217;ll take care of you. I don&#8217;t know what kind of drunkard son of a bitch you are, but you smell like a virgin. I&#8217;ll make you feel good, and then you can let bygones be bygones”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Smell like a virgin&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The little bastard looked miffed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right. A virgin. Moreover, you&#8217;re ugly and gloomy, and no woman will ever take you seriously. I&#8217;m not going to laugh at you if you have a short thing or if you come in a halfway rub”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh, heee&#8230;&#8230; then &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll take up your offer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy&#8217;s temples are twitching. It seems the boy has been angry for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, did I offend you? But, well, It can&#8217;t be helped. I&#8217;m giving a private lesson to a virgin little boy. But don&#8217;t complain if you cum before you insert. Just be a good boy and I&#8217;ll make you feel good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned my eyes towards Nee-chan, for some reason she was pale. She looked as if she had just seen a ridiculous idiot and stiffened up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“NHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko&#8217;s hands clenched the sheets frantically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Areare, did you come again? You&#8217;re so pathetic, even though you were saying great things like giving lessons to a virgin monk. Then, Ryoko. This time… I like you to write it on her cheeks. Let&#8217;s go with 『Small Fry』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Kyoko&#8217;s cheek, breathing on her shoulder, Ryoko writes in black ink marker on her cheek『Small Fry』.This is the third place. She has already had 『Loser Bitch』scribbled on her chest and 『Slutty Pussy』on her lower belly with a downward arrow.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/p163-697x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is still thirty minutes since the first insertion. Kyoko has already climaxed for the third time and is out of breath. In contrast, I have yet to come even once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Kyoko who got carried away in the first place and said things like 『I&#8217;m going to doodle on you every time you come』.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But then again&#8230;&#8230; it’s her sister, isn&#8217;t it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face is certainly similar to Ryoko&#8217;s, but the atmosphere is like Ryoko minus the sassiness and with a dash of cockiness. She looks masculine and I honestly didn&#8217;t expect her to be comfortable in my arms, but when I undressed her, I found she had a superb body just like Ryoko&#8217;s. Moreover, the parts that are easily felt are exactly the same as Ryoko&#8217;s body, which I knew every inch of, so there was no way I could not make her cum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pull out my penis and turn Kyoko&#8217;s body over, forcing her to get on all fours.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“a, wa, wait a minute, let &#8230;&#8230; me rest!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, no, after all, I&#8217;m a virgin and I&#8217;m ugly. So, I have to work harder than most people”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I say that, I stab her in the back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nhiii!? Don&#8217;t come in so fast! You idiot!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I don&#8217;t accept complaints.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As soon as I grabbed her ass and started to move my hips, she let out a cute little squeal and writhed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-ahh, Ah, Ah, Ah…”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Pan, pan, pan!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">　And a loud pumping sound. Kyoko&#8217;s ass, which had been thrust into me hard from the doggy position, and was now resting against my crotch, made a loud noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her crotch, which had already been made to come three times, was soaking wet, and every time I thrust my rod into her without mercy, the vagina that received it made an embarrassing</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Guchi,Gucyu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnghh, nnghh, nnghh, ahi! Aah,Iyaaa!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed to be quite competitive and seemed to have tried to hold back her voice many times since earlier. But every time she did, I would meanly penetrate her weak spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nhi&#8230; nn&#8230; nn&#8230; ah&#8230; aaaan”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within minutes, her eyes were drowning in pleasure and her moans were sweet and debauched. I stopped moving my hips and stuck my fingers in her mouth from behind, playing with the inside of her mouth and whispering in her ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Am I not enough for you? Oh, you&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re just such a big talker, aren&#8217;t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn&#8230;&#8230; Ahh&#8230;&#8230; Ahh&#8230;&#8230; Nnn&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko can&#8217;t even answer properly and just lets out a moan. She must be unconscious. Her tongue sneezes deliciously on my fingers and saliva drips from between her spread lips onto the sheets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, the virgin boy will do his best in the virgin boy&#8217;s own way&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huhh!? Aaahhhh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thrust my hips vigorously again in time with the words, Kyoko bends over greatly. I resumed my vigorous movement as it was, and a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Pan, Pan, Pan!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">　and an obscene sound of violent flesh beating rang out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nhii, Noo, Stopp, please stop it, Hiii, Noo, I&#8217;m dying, I&#8217;m dying”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She staggers and crawls away on the bed, as if to escape the pressure behind her or to ask for help. But I&#8217;m not going to let her escape. One chase after another. Fugitive soldiers are condemned to death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ah, ahhhhhh, afuu, ahh! I&#8217;m cumming, I&#8217;m cumming! Ahh, Ah, I have been coming for a while now, you know!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I pretended not to hear at all and kept moving my hips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kept thrusting my rod into her without rest and kept stirring her vaginal cavity. Of course, I also remember crushing the back of her vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mu, don&#8217;t ignore me, idiot! Gusuu, stop it already&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not crying! But I don&#8217;t want to, Hiii, cum anymore&#8230; It&#8217;s hard…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, if you&#8217;re not crying, there&#8217;s no reason to stop”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of stopping my movements, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> pan, pan, pan!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">　I hit her with my hips even harder. Then Kyoko suddenly stiffened her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Ah,it&#8217;s amazing,IYaaaaAA!! I&#8217;m cumming too much, noo, Ah, Ah, I&#8217;m cummmmmming!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned herself over as if she were a neighing horse, and then fell onto the bed, crumpled and crushed on all fours. My penis slipped out of her vagina which spurted out her love juices. It had accumulated alot deep inside her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ohh&#8230; You&#8217;re the only one who comes, huh. You&#8217;re really a selfish person&#8230;&#8230;Well, whatever. Ryoko, I think she probably came at least five times, so let&#8217;s see, 『bitch』, 『Fumio&#8217;s special masturbator』, 『lousy bitch』, 『loose pussy』. Then write anything else you like”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoko wrote the phrases as she was told with black ink on Kyoko&#8217;s back and ass as she groaned breathlessly, and finally wrote 『embarrassing sister』 on her shoulder.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That&#8217;s too genuine, isn&#8217;t it?&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pulling back slightly at the raw, genuine feelings that leaked out from Ryoko, I grabbed Kyoko&#8217;s body and flipped her over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes were vacant as she lay on the bed in a large position. Only her chest was rising and falling violently in search of oxygen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyoko-san? OooooIiii, are you still alive?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I waved my hand in front of her, she looked aghast and from under her ragged breath, she spun out these words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From to-today&#8230;. I will not let you&#8230;. off the hook…”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What kind of new comedian are you?!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help but be taken aback by this. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s stubbornness or aversion to defeat, but I think it&#8217;s amazing that she can be so stubborn here, even though she&#8217;s a small fry. But then again, I have no intention of forgiving her, so it&#8217;s perfect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, no, you haven&#8217;t made me come once yet. You said so yourself, Kyoko. You said that you could make me squeal with pleasure”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I put my heavy weight on top of her as she lay there on her back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s too heavy&#8230;&#8230; Oh, yeah, I&#8217;ll give you a hand job, I&#8217;m confident in hand job”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you stupid?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but let my true feelings leak out. A hand job at this point in the game is a way to underestimate people. These stupid females need to be taught a firm master-slave relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiiii!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time it was a missionary position. I put all my weight on her and penetrate her bitch hole at once in the so-called seed press position. Then I held her head in my arms and started slamming my hips down hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ihiiiii!? I just came! Even though I just came, afuuu, ah, hiii, ah, ah”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Zubu, Zubu, Zubu, Zubu! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">And, with her body close to me, I press hard on the deepest part of her vagina with the glans. Her sister Ryoko always cums instantly when I do this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gyaaa, Noooo, Ahhhhh, Ohhhhhhhhh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, Kyoko immediately started screaming like it was the end of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I glanced at her sister, I saw that she was rubbing her knees together in a fidgety manner. Underneath her pantsuit, she was probably already in flood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s not a bad idea to hold her with Ryoko’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking about this, I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my shoulder. I looked over and saw that Kyoko was biting me there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It hurts!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slammed my hips into her as hard as I could, as if I was punching her, and she screamed, [Nnnnghhhhhhaaa!] She let go of her mouth and turned herself over, screaming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing! Damn you! You can&#8217;t make me cum if you like this! Idiot! Idiot!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If she doesn&#8217;t get her way, she&#8217;ll bite you&#8230;&#8230;She&#8217;s really like a dog.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stop moving my hips and take her face between my hands and stare into her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what is it?&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, looking at her frightened face, I silently began to move my hips again. Slowly, but with a deep twisting motion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oooh, it&#8217;s so deeepp! Stop it! Oh, no!&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wrinkled her brow and writhed violently. The gaze that had looked down on me just a few moments ago, the mouth that mocked me so forcefully. Such a noble Kyoko was nowhere to be found.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to hide her expression, which is a mixture of fright and pleasure, she can only continue to accept my big, swollen rod inside her female body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now it was my turn to taunt her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re a little sloppy for someone who talks so much. You still have a long way to go”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t do it again&#8230; Ah, if you do it again, hii. I-I&#8217;ll go crazy&#8230; Ah&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s okay to go crazy. I&#8217;ll make sure you understand who you&#8217;re biting”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu….Hiii…ahnn…”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ZuchiZuchi </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">when I gave her more thrusts, she finally cried out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu, Uuuu, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry for being so cocky&#8230; I was wrong&#8230; Please forgive me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko finally surrendered in full. But I have not the slightest intention of forgiving her.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Now that we&#8217;re at it, let&#8217;s straighten things up a bit, just to my liking&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t like it when girls call themselves [Boku]. So, let&#8217;s try to call yourself 『Kyoko-chan』. And try apologising in a cute way one more time”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gusu…Uu,Uuuu…Kyoko-chan was wrong&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry. Isn&#8217;t Kyoko-chan cute? So, please forgive me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well done. But it&#8217;s too late now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rejected her apology without giving her any hope to cling to. I instantly raised myself up and slammed my hips down on her like she was on fire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahiiiii! You’re awful! I told you so!　I told you! No!!? I can&#8217;t cum!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only your mouth says it doesn&#8217;t like it, right? Because Kyoko&#8217;s cunt is completely engulfed in my cock and she doesn&#8217;t want to let go at all. But don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m about to cum too, just a little more”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Iyaaaaaaaaaa!!! Kyoko-chan is really at her limit! Kyoko-chan is going to break&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth is, I too, almost at my limit. The lust swirling deep in my loins screaming, [Get me out of here!] and it&#8217;s raging inside me feverishly. And just as I thrust my meat spear deep into her as a finishing blow, it burst at once.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Doku!! Byurururu! Byusu!! Byuruu!!!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko clings desperately to my body. I pour a large amount of semen into her innermost parts, enjoy the slight afterglow, and then slowly withdraw my penis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after I pull away, Kyoko remains lying dishevelled in the middle of the bed, unable to move a muscle. Occasionally, her sweaty naked body would twitch intermittently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..No sound of levelling up’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko seems to be more stubborn than I imagined. Even earlier, she just pretended to have surrendered. It might be like that now. This, after all, will have to be broken into pieces once again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lili, are you there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up into the air and called out, and Lili appeared, spinning around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but can I have that nutritional drink, the whole bottle?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The whole bottle? Uwaa&#8230;.you&#8217;re going to do it, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, Lili pretends to be shocked. But she immediately grimaces and her mouth twists into a grin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with reminding a stupid female of her place, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I accept the demon world&#8217;s nutritional drink from her and gulp it down in one gulp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry about my mom. She was so excited”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha,you have good mama”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai and I were laying out futons in a very large Japanese-style room, and we were both looking at the ceiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was already midnight. If I listen carefully, I can hear the sound of the Shishi Odoshi coming from the garden. [Shishi Odoshi:Japanese devices made to frighten away animals which pose a threat to agriculture]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, I left Terashima-san&#8217;s apartment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think Kyoko-san is not a bad person, but I can&#8217;t become friends with her. If she said that to me, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to stay in the same house with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook off Kyoko-san&#8217;s shining hands, holed myself up in Terashima-san&#8217;s bedroom, and message Mai, 『Will you let me stay over?』and she called me and came to pick me up immediately. In a very big foreign car with a driver.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the first time I came to Mai&#8217;s house. I had heard that she was rich, but in person she was even richer than I had imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the moment, we are in a remote house at the end of the mansion&#8217;s grounds. The whole place belongs to Mai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are three western-style rooms and two Japanese-style rooms. The five bedrooms, including the living and dining room, are Mai&#8217;s rooms. My concept of a room was suddenly re-evaluate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I was taken to the main house, where we were allowed to sit down for dinner. Mai&#8217;s father and mother were both very happy that their daughter had brought a friend, and we were given a tremendous welcome.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to describe the dinner as if a dedicated sushi chef were making sushi for us, would that give you an idea of how gorgeous it was?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai&#8217;s mother was a very talkative person. She asked me a lot of questions, especially about Mai&#8217;s boyfriend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for me, I had no choice but to laugh and cover it up. I wonder how her parents would have reacted if I had honestly told them about that creep. Well, I think they would normally oppose it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry for suddenly asking you to do something so unreasonable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this while looking at the ceiling from her bed, Mai laughed and laughed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, it&#8217;s fine. My father and mother are happy. Yesterday, I asked you to pretend that I stayed at Misuzu&#8217;s house too. So, it&#8217;s mutual”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, yesterday, on the way back to the apartment, I received a message from her asking me to pretend that she had stayed at my house. I didn&#8217;t reply because my mind was a mess and I didn&#8217;t have time for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so, yesterday was amazing. I never thought I&#8217;d see Misuzu in a place like that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s true..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of which, Mai. Wasn&#8217;t this your first time? I mean, your first-time doing it with Kimo-jima&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn? We haven&#8217;t had sex yet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh!? But yesterday&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Mai sat up and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you want to hear it? Are you gonna ask me that? Oh, you&#8217;re going to make fun of me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh, I don&#8217;t think I make fun of it”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh! Then, listen to me! No, I&#8217;m gonna talk!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re gonna talk?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s the thing. Yesterday, I had a very bad day. I got scared that even Fu–min would abandon me, so I forced him to take me to a love hotel.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You mean you asked him out?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes. But he wasn’t accepting it because Fu~min like it, but because he’s worried”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unn…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And when I tried to get naked, Fu–min said, 『I won&#8217;t hold you』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? You mean he couldn&#8217;t get it up?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it was different, his crotch was really swollen. It was just his patience. But Fu–min said, 『It&#8217;s not embrace that will heal Mai now』 and said, 『Let&#8217;s take the proper steps toward love』 and hugged me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“With that face?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel more and more grossed out by the thought of such a line coming from that face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why? Fu–min, he&#8217;s so handsome!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry&#8230;&#8230;but that&#8217;s a bit hard to agree with”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No other man could say such a thing in front of a naked girl at a love hotel. I was so happy because I knew I was really loved.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hee&#8230;&#8230; I think he just got scared when he was about to get laid. He seems like a virgin, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muー&#8230;&#8230; Misuzu, you&#8217;re kind of poking around, aren&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ve been thinking about it for a while, but Misuzu gets kind of pissed off when it comes to Fu–min.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? I&#8217;m not pissed off at all! Of course not!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“haha–, are you jealous?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai grins and turns her head towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa? Are you an idiot? I have a much nicer boyfriend, Jun-kun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“HeeeーSo how was sex with Kasuya?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it was&#8230;&#8230;wonderful”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, what was it like, what was it like?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t say. I don&#8217;t usually tell people that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh—&#8230;&#8230;that’s not nice”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a break in the conversation and a short pause. After a while, Mai opened her mouth again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Misuzu, what are you going to do tomorrow?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;.there will probably still be press tomorrow, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw Misuzu&#8217;s house on the news several times today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa&#8230;..they filmed it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least, while I was watching from Terashima-san&#8217;s apartment, my house was never shown on TV, but did they run out of material and finally start showing such things?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does Mai have any plans?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I&#8217;m going to go to Fu–min&#8217;s house.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A date, huh?&#8230;&#8230;What about me, then?&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Will you go with me, Misuzu?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaa?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, it&#8217;s not really a date. It&#8217;s not even a promise. I&#8217;m just going on my own. I&#8217;m also good friends with Fu–min&#8217;s mum. Ne,neee, let&#8217;s go together.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What on earth is this girl talking about?’ </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought so.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><strong>The Fifth Day of the Girls’ Track and Field Confinement.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last night, FumiFumi was unusually pissed off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, he even asked me to give him a whole bottle of the demon world&#8217;s nutritional drink. The assumption was that she would go completely berserk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that Ryoko’s younger sister was the one who stirred things up was just the beginning, perhaps the one thing that upset FumiFumi the most was the fact that she let Kurosawa meet her boyfriend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the night passed, and it is now 6am on Sunday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I split the space and stepped into the 『Bedroom』 .</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘By now, the berserking should be over and FumiFumi should have come to his senses, Devi’</span></i></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the situation in the 『Bedroom』  that met my eyes was beyond my imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is this, Devi&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mutter in dismay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had to describe it in one word, it would be catastrophic. The previous berserk attack against Kurosawa-chan was pale in comparison to this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not to mention sticky and soggy. The sofa is overturned, the closet is full of holes, and on top of that, the bed canopy and its pillars are broken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that FumiFumi still is still violently raping women. Well, that was the case last time, so let&#8217;s call it good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing that didn&#8217;t make the most sense to me was&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why is he raping Oppai-chan?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person FumiFumi is raping while holding her against the wall is not Ryoko&#8217;s sister, but for some reason was Oppai-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is already unconscious, her body twitching and her eyes white. On top of that, she was covered in a muddy white liquid that looked as if it had been sprayed over her head with a bucket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">FumiFumi has her between the wall and her own body, and continues to slam her hips into the wall with the force of an excavator, gutting her without any mercy at all. Moreover, Oppai-chan&#8217;s feet are not on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th,this is bad…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was looking on in amazement, I heard FumiFumi moan, [Uuuu!] and then, from the gap between the labia and the penis, I heard a plop!　Pssshhhh!　Then, those semen that had accumulated in her vagina spurted out, drawing new stains on the red carpet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aha…Ahaha….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to smile for the time being, but my cheeks involuntarily twitched.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Gah, you&#8217;re a real sex monster, DEVI!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But FumiFumi didn&#8217;t stop there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He began to slam his hips into Oppai-chan again in no time at all, not even to soak up the afterglow of his ejaculation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around again and saw Ryoko&#8217;s sister lying in the corner of the room, dressed like a squashed frog.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Covered in semen paint, of course. And that&#8217;s not all. I don&#8217;t know how much she had taken inside her vagina, but her lower stomach was swollen like a pregnant woman&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her status was 『Subjugated』. Checking FumiFumi&#8217;s status, the number of rooms and furniture installation levels have been increased, and new functions such as 『visual possession』 and 『likes and dislikes scale』are now available, in addition to 『large bathrooms installed』.There was no doubt that he had improved two levels during the night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So how did this happen &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mutters in dismay as I looks at Oppai-chan, which continue to be raped without consciousness. Then──</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will explain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“uuWaAa, I was so surprised!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I heard a voice behind me and turned around to find Ryoko with semen dripping from her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Master continued to fuck Kyoko until almost mid-morning, when she started foaming up and I thought, [Oh, this is not good, this is going to kill her], so I tries to stopped him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoko explains with her usual calm expression. However, she was wearing a trousers suit with her crotch and chest torn to shreds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a good thing I went in to stop him, but then he started violating me by force&#8230;&#8230;Well, it was a reward for me, so there was no problem, but about an hour after that, Masaki-sama, who knew nothing about it, came into the bedroom and said, 『Good morning!』, immediately Master target moved to her and that&#8217;s how it is now”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230;&#8230;I see, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I involuntarily twitched my cheeks, Ryoko spun more words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Master&#8217;s gaze is now following Lili-sama. It&#8217;s probably locked on”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hee?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the moment when I let out an unintentionally dumb voice, FumiFumi&#8217;s hand suddenly gripped my leg. Then, without any time to resist, I was forced down on the floor with unbelievable force.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/p180-697x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It hurts! Fu,FumiFumi! Wait a minute Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But he doesn&#8217;t react at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You idiot! You&#8217;re so ugly! Let go of me, Devi! You can&#8217;t do this to me, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pushing FumiFumi away with my hands, who tries to cover me, I struggle to raise herself up. But when I somehow got to his knees, he grabbed me by both arms and thrust his cock, which was so raging, right in front of my eyes.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hiiiiiiiii!! Not good,not good,Not good at all!!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A fishy smell poked my nostrils. When I desperately turn my face away, he grinds and presses the tip against my cheek. Slippery mucus drips down my cheek, and the sensation makes my skin crawl.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘B,bad! I have to get out of here,fast!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to disappear and escape but I couldn&#8217;t disappear if my mind was this disturbed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu,FumiFumi! c,come on&#8230;.. Fugoh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a mistake to open my mouth so carelessly. It was seriously a mistake. He had suddenly shoved his penis into my mouth and then he pushed it into the back of my throat with a relentless gurgle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugoa, gee, ugo, bogo, geeeee!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My eyes went black and white as he was suddenly thrust deep into my throat. It was so thick that my jaw felt like it was going to come off. The illusion that I was being forced to suck a burning iron rod. A bitter and slightly salty taste spread through my oral cavity. The next moment, he took his hands away, and without a pause, he grabbed my horns and began to violently move his hips back and forth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Goe! Bo, bohe! Go, gobo! Guge!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of the incapacitating voice that was so muddled that it was almost painful. My screams, which leaked out due to the sheer agony of the situation, were in unison with the obscene sound of the water, which rang out with a</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">  jubo, jubo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> sound.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tip of my nose is buried in pubic hair, a vicious mass of flesh that penetrates deeper and deeper with each thrust. I was treated like a complete tool. The back of my throat was forcibly fucked and the vomiting reaction caused me to feel the agony of my stomach being squeezed.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘H,He&#8217;s going to kill me!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears spill out as I struggle to breathe. I desperately clutched and clawed at FumiFumi&#8217;s arms. However, there was no sign of stopping the violent movement. On the contrary, the movements became more and more intense, as if he was becoming more and more aroused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bubo! Bobobo! Gobe! Boga!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While scratching for oxygen, I gradually became dazed from lack of it. At the same time as my consciousness began to fade away, FumiFumi’s penis swelled rapidly and significantly in my mouth. And the next moment──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byuru! Burururururu! Bururu!!!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“nNgoo!”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the base pushed into my mouth, FumiFumi suddenly unleashed his sperm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rod bursts in the back of my throat. The raw, thick sperm that poured down the back of my throat, which I opened my eyes to look at. I can&#8217;t breathe. I&#8217;m drowning. With my head held down, there is nothing I can do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnghhh! Gooohh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My fingertips scratched vainly in the air. The more I raised my voice, the more sperm flowed back. It overflowed from the edges of my mouth and even my nose, and a funny nose lantern swelled up as if to ridicule the algae-scratching me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Like those doujin you read when the cum was too much for the heroine, bubbles appear on the nose.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before long,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Biku! Biku!! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">The ejaculation comes to an end, pulsating and repeating. I desperately shook his hand off, taking advantage of the moment when FumiFumi relaxed slightly, perhaps due to the pleasure he felt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I escape behind him, his penis slips out easily and the semen splatters in a murky white arch between my lips and his penis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gobo! Gobo! Geeeee! Geeeeeee!”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A squeezing sensation in the stomach. A small shudder. Every time I vomit, a cloud of white liquid spills from the back of my throat onto the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, FumiFumi again attacked without mercy. He grabbed my writhing legs, then forcibly pulled me in and put his hand on the bondage crotch.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hi?!! I&#8217;m going to be raped!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A cold thing runs down my spine. This is a quintessential example of a woman who is afraid. I had thought that there might come a time when I would be held by FumiFumi, but this is just too much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“F,Freeesia!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I raised her voice frantically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, a sparkling silver light flashes in front of me, between me and FumiFumi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gaaaaaaaaa!!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a pause, the next moment, FumiFumi let out an animalistic shriek and jerked back. Blood splattered, dribbling down between his fingers as he writhed, covering his face with both hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to keep you waiting, Ohime-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Princess]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a voice whispering in my stunned ear. Turning slightly, I see Freesia holding my body from behind. In her hand is her favourite Damascus knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me, did slashed his eyes Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I only cut his eyelids. I can&#8217;t let FumiFumi see my face. There will be no problem if I have Torture treat him later”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she tells me this, Freesia stands up abruptly and takes a swipe at her arm, as if she were taking off her cloak. Her maid&#8217;s uniform instantly falls to the side, revealing a lewd naked body wearing only a headdress and a white lace garter belt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will subdue him.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a single word, she lays her body on FumiFumi and mounts him with frightening speed. As soon as the lewd sound of the water echoed, Freesia&#8217;s cold expression suddenly turned into one of pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahhh&#8230;&#8230;how robust. It is lovely. Se-Bon!　It&#8217;s Se-Bon–amazing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Freesia, with a cry of delight, slowly begins to move her hips, with FumiFumi&#8217;s male sex orgasm deep in her lewdly wet vaginal cavity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unh, anh, ah, mmmm&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gradually speeds up the movement of her hips, without caring about FumiFumi, who continues to moan with a nasal gasp and his hands covering his bloodstained eyes.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/p185-697x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haan, anh, anh, anh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah&#8230; &#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A glossy, pomegranate-coloured tongue dribbled lewdly out of her lips, her white breasts fluttered and bounced, and there was a burst of buttock flesh striking against FumiFumi’s hip bones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although, due to Freesia&#8217;s neat and tidy appearance, it is an indulgent scene that reminds the onlookers of a wayward maid&#8217;s secret, it is in fact a spine-chilling scene of lecherous predation. As proof, FumiFumi&#8217;s body trembles slightly every time she slams her hips down. He is climaxing. He is being sucked out of his sperm.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O,Ogoo,Goaaa,u,Uuu..UA! Oooo!! Gh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">FumiFumi wriggles and screams like an animal. But there is no escape. The sound of sperm being released echoes through the air without pause. There is no one who can escape from being mounted by an elder succubus. Even if it is the demon king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How lovely&#8230;&#8230;it’s overflowing even if I keep squeezing it. Oh, oh&#8230;.I&#8217;m going to drown…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at the moment she quivered her eyelashes in fascination, FumiFumi suddenly grabbed Freesia&#8217;s buttocks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This startled her, too. Despite the fact that she thought he no longer had the strength to resist, FumiFumi began to thrust her hips up violently, as if to intercept her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, no! Hi! Ah, An! So intense! Anh! Hiin! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of the water echoing violently and lewdly, the meringue-like bubbling semen dripping down from where they were connected, dripping in sloppy drops. Freesia&#8217;s expression showed that her composure was disappearing and she was gradually being driven over the edge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,you!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she also has the pride of the elder Succubus. Freesia wrinkled her brow and put her hands on FumiFumi&#8217;s breasts as if she was fighting against the pleasure. Then, with an impassioned expression on her face, she opens her legs into an M-shape and starts slamming her hips hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyaa!!Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Oo!Oooooo!!!Aaaaa!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A battle in which both sides attack each other. It has gone beyond the boundaries of sex and has become a battle of wits and pride between the lewd demon Succubus and the deadly warrior Berserker. I can only watch with bated breath. The sound of the violent pounding of flesh, far from being sex, even drowns out the sound of me clearing my throat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a fierce attack and defence, those two stroke with all their might, as if they are trying to finish each other off. The eardrum-piercing popping sound was overlaid by the tremendous sound of water, as if a geyser were erupting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Geyser: Water Ejected from the ground.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Freesia screams out again with her head towards the ceiling and collapses onto FumiFumi&#8217;s chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“F, Freesia!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At about the same time that I involuntarily shouted, FumiFumi&#8217;s hand, which had been gripping her buttocks so tightly, fell to the floor without any effort. The room suddenly quietened down, the silence suddenly descending, and I asked, puzzled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oo..is it finished, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Freesia, still collapsed on FumiFumi&#8217;s chest, let out a weak voice from under her rough breathing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m already &#8230;&#8230; full of &#8230;&#8230; stomach &#8230;&#8230;. I didn&#8217;t think that he could push this [Watashi] so far&#8230;&#8230; what a dangerous person he is,&#8230;.. just in time,thank you so much…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was, to be honest, an unbelievable sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Freesia, who now serves as my servant, is a whore who caused the previous demon king to die on his stomach. It is said that before I was born, around 1200 BC, she killed most of the men in the country of Hittite and destroyed it. The queen who presided over all other Succubus, the great Succubus mentioned in the Book of Revelation, Succubus among Succubus. She is a sexual monster with many aliases. That&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg. Moreover, FumiFumi himself is full of nonsense after raping a woman all night long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ohime-sama, it seems that your eyes were right after all. FumiFumi-sama is a real gem”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Freesia burped loudly when she said this and rubbed her belly in satisfaction.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After having Torture treat and clean FumiFumi, I pulls him out of his『room』 and makes him lie on the bed in his room as if nothing had happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, today was a close call. I myself was almost raped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, it would be better to ban berserkers. Perhaps it&#8217;s because he regularly consumes nutritional drinks from the demon world, but FumiFumi himself has become extremely adulterous. Perhaps this is also the reason why the effect duration of the berserk has been prolonged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really, you&#8217;re 20,000 years too young to be messing with me, FumiFumi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to Freesia, I somehow managed to escape from him, but since he only fainted after being hit by the full force sucking drain of the Demon Elder Succubus, it can only be described as terrifying. He will probably wake up by the end of the day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, Ryoko was sent back to her apartment, while I instructed Torture for Oppai-chan and Ryoko&#8217;s sister to be washed in turn and carry them to Oppai-chan room and Ryoko&#8217;s room respectively. After winning the fierce battle, Freesia returned to her own work, feeling dizzy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room was surprisingly tidy and proper. This is really surprising. I had thought that boys’ rooms were messier than this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bookshelves are full of manga, and I have even heard of some of the boys&#8217; manga. There are not many things. On the desk, there were reference books and textbooks, as well as a laptop.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, he is a student for the entrance examinations, so it is only natural&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Mai entered the room, she suddenly looked into the dustbin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;&#8230; it&#8217;s empty”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh&#8230;.. after all. The day before yesterday, he had been holding back so much. I thought for sure he would jerking off when he got home”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-w-w-what are you talking about!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shh, Misuzu, you&#8217;re talking too loud”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai put her finger to her lips again, this time squatting down to look under the bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s nothing here either&#8230;&#8230;. There must be a dirty book or something hidden in here somewhere&#8230;&#8230;.If I look inside the laptop, I can probably find something, but it seems to be password protected, so maybe it&#8217;s in the back of a desk drawer?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, wait a minute Mai! What are you really doing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can see it when you look at it. It&#8217;s research, research. If I know what kind of books he looks at while he is doing it alone. I can find out what Fu–min likes. Then I can cosplay in those kinds of costumes for him. &#8230;&#8230;Well, I&#8217;ll burn it if it&#8217;s big-breasted stuff”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken aback by this. Does this girl have no concept of privacy?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, KimoJima sleeps well. Normally, I would think that even a whispering voice would wake her up, but she shows no sign of waking up at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai looked into KimoJima&#8217;s face and made a face of enraptured debauchery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How come? He&#8217;s so ugly”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s as ugly as he used to be, probably because I&#8217;m used to seeing him a lot more, but even so, saying him as good-looking is still overrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whyー, he&#8217;s so cute!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai, I, I am seriously starting to doubt your aesthetic sense.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve been getting A&#8217;s in art since primary school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So it turns out&#8230;..you mean good-looking in the Picasso sense, that&#8217;s it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so, there&#8217;s no sign of him waking up at all, then I&#8217;m going to do this&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai grinned and suddenly rolled up the foot of the towelling blanket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh&#8230;&#8230;Fu–min, you wear sweatshirts as pyjamas? Maybe I&#8217;ll buy matching sweatshirts next time…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh,wait Mai! You&#8217;re not being nice&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s okay, it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s not every day I get a chance like this. I thought I&#8217;d show Misuzu just how great he is”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t want it! I don&#8217;t want to see it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, isn’t it good? If you see it, you won&#8217;t be able to make fun of Fu–min anymore”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, Mai pulled down his sweat pants in one fell swoop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unintentionally shouted [Kya!] and turned her face away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is just absurd. Mai completely lacks common sense and a sense of shame.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I mean! Why isn’t he waking up to this extent? KimoJima!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made an unreasonable complaint in my heart, and at about the same time, Mai let out a disappointed voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Areee?&#8230;..why? It&#8217;s morning and you don&#8217;t seem very energetic.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of that voice, I was unwillingly forced to take a serious look at it. The black sea cucumber-like thing lying there was completely different from Jun-kun&#8217;s thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ナマコNamako]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, wait a minute! Mai, what are you showing me? Put that thing away!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wah….!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai suddenly took it in her mouth with a [humph]. She then moved her head up and down and began to handle and rub it enthusiastically, while I stiffened in surprise.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Jyubo! Jyubo! Jyubo! Jyubo!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The watery, obscene sound echoed around the room, upsetting me but I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off what Mai was doing, even though I was worried that KimoJima’s parents might come up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing I know, my face is getting hot. Saliva floods my mouth. My tongue was sobbing in my mouth, imagining the feeling of a penis, even though I didn&#8217;t mean to do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nfu, fohifuhahehita”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I,I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Puha, I said it&#8217;s getting bigger. Look at it, it&#8217;s only half erect. Isn&#8217;t that amazing?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That thing is still in a semi-erection?　It&#8217;s too big, isn&#8217;t it? I can&#8217;t put it in like that! I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s so nice to feel a tiny thing getting bigger and bigger in the mouth. Don&#8217;t you think so, Misuzu?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don&#8217;t! I&#8217;ve never sucked such a dirty thing in my mouth!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a lie. I sucked Jun-kun&#8217;s the other day and I know very well that the feeling of it getting bigger is great.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu–min&#8217;s smells so good, you know. The smell of a male, it&#8217;s, aaaa—mouu, it&#8217;s irresistible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai rubs her cheeks against KimoJima&#8217;s penis, grinning as she shows it off to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. I can&#8217;t take my eyes off it. I can vaguely feel that I was the one rubbing it on my cheek. I feel like I&#8217;ve done the same thing before, even though I don&#8217;t remember anything like that. I know the feeling of a penis pulsing. That was definitely not Jun-kun&#8217;s feeling.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aaaa–mouu, what is it! This memory!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps I must look completely flustered. I&#8217;m struggling to regulate my breathing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I&#8217;ll make him cum for now, so please wait for a moment”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai, y-you&#8217;re making him cum!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without caring about how flustered I am, Mai put it in her mouth again and swallowed it as if she was slowly savouring it. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. The long, large cock was swallowed without any difficulty. It probably reached the back of Mai&#8217;s throat, close to her chest. I almost gagged as I watched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Mai seemed completely unconcerned and began to move her head up and down.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Jyubo! Jyubo! Jyubo! Jyubo!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The disgusting sound echoes again, and the sleeping KimoJima begins to raise its eyebrows in pain. His breathing is also becoming raspy. Looking at his face, I felt something dripping down deep in my stomach.　And then, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">suzuzuzuzu!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">　 when Mai makes a grand sipping sound, a moaning sound escapes from KimoJima&#8217;s mouth and his hips convulse with a jerk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, almost at the same time as Mai raises her eyebrows, a faint watering sound echoes in her mouth.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh&#8230;&#8230; he cummed’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nku, nkuu, nkuu, nkuu..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time Mai slurps, I recall the taste of semen and my tongue wriggles in my mouth flaccidly. A thick taste, so sticky that it was hard to swallow. I don&#8217;t know whose it was, but I remembered the taste.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I want to drink&#8230;&#8230; I want to drinkit &#8230;&#8230; I want to drink it so badly…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily sit down on the spot and at the same time Mai looks up with a [puhaa].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As usual, Fu–min&#8217;s is so thick it&#8217;s hard to swallow”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai smiles innocently. I couldn&#8217;t deny that I was envious of that, and I felt a helpless sense of despair.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Morning comes even if you don&#8217;t want it to. It will come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After breakfast, we headed to the breeding yard to feed the club members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is said to be a basic rule of discipline that pets eat after their masters, and I guess this is the same logic in this case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the second feeding, everyone knew what they were supposed to do and it went smoothly. There was even some sort of place-hunting, as if they were trying to avoid being next to Ota (big sister), a big eater.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, Oatmeal for breakfast. I hear a few voices here and there saying, [That thing again?&#8230;&#8230;], but no one openly complains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to starving, it&#8217;s better to be able to eat even if it&#8217;s not good. However, I wonder what people would look like if they knew that our meal this morning was all-you-can-eat eggs Benedict from a famous restaurant in New York, which cost 2,000 yen a plate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The job of feeding is to wait for the feed bins to empty and then collect them. After that, it&#8217;s time for the whipping. That&#8217;s what I thought, but when the empty feed bins were piled up in the corridor, the silver-haired maid told us to gather in the mess hall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the dining room, the silver-haired maid took us to a table and opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Burppp&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Un&#8230;..What should a person who suddenly hears a loud burp act like?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry about that. I had a little too much food this morning&#8230;..Let&#8217;s get back on track and start the 『interrogation』 today. The whipping is from the end of the morning feeding until the evening feeding. During this time, each of you will be required to give at least one hundred lashes&#8230;&#8230;Ugh, excuse me, burppp. However, there is no problem if you want to do a hundred whippings in the morning and have free time in the afternoon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid&#8217;s complexion was pale. Even her pale skin was a bit pale. On the way, her eyes were black and white, as if she was desperately trying to hold back a burp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of such an indescribably delicate atmosphere, Shima-senpai raised her hand in an indecisive manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I ask a question&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have two questions. First, what should I do if I find out the four people in question, and second, how do I report that I have struck a hundred times&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s a good question. There is a servant at the entrance of the menagerie. If you know who the deadly sinner is, please tell him or her. They will be immediately isolated in a separate room for a thorough interrogation. You may also inquire about the whip count with that person. The person will count it correctly”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid then looked at me and Yui-chan and opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe-sama must have thought 『Why don&#8217;t I do a thorough interrogation from the beginning?』 and Kayama-sama thought, 『Let&#8217;s name Amemiya for now』&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, I will hand out the whips”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid says this and holds out a ring-bound whip in front of us, where she has taken it from?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A single whip woven from leather. It is also quite heavy. It must hurt a lot if someone gets hit with one of these.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s a real thing, isn&#8217;t it? I thought it was the kind of thing they use in variety shows as a punishment game&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those rose whips are loud, but they don&#8217;t hurt much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid makes a face as if to say,『What&#8217;s the point if it doesn&#8217;t hurt?』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But if they get hit a hundred times like this, they&#8217;ll die…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have not overlooked that point. Every night  around midnight, the damage done by the whip will be completely recovered.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the silver-haired maid leaves the dining room and disappears from sight, we let out a collective sigh. The time has finally come. I thought I was prepared for this, but when I picked up the whip, I trembled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe-san. Do you still think you can be a beauty on all sides at this stage of your life? Always, always caring about other people&#8217;s opinions.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not what I meant&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it good? Masaki-sama never said anything about killing the four of them from the start, did she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ee?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you Remember. When Captain asked what would happen to the four, Masaki-sama said. 『They will be stripped down over the next few years to the bare minimum viable organs, and then sent home by courier』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed. I misunderstood it because of the severity of the content, but she never said anything about killing them. In fact, she even said 『at the very least, you&#8217;ll live』.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In other words, nothing has changed for the four of them. She didn&#8217;t say, 『I won&#8217;t cut them into pieces』.In other words&#8230;&#8230;Shima-senpai said something unnecessary, and we just have more restrictions”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. sorry about that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai nodded her head helplessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see&#8230; There&#8217;s no doubt that the four of them will be even more adamant if they hear that they&#8217;re going to be cut to pieces while the rest of us get better treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at me with a shrug of her shoulders, Yui-chan further strengthened her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe-san, you seem to be sympathising with the other members of the club, but how can you afford to do that? Our position is as similar as the others. In Particular, we have to hide the fact that we may be replaced. If I were in the position of a pig, I would try to switch places at all costs if I knew about such a thing”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it&#8217;s true. If the conditions under which the changeover occurs are known, they will set a trap&#8230;&#8230; Especially Shiratori, she is a devil of a bargainer and will try to kill you in one shot. Because both I and Hatsu-chan have never won a game against her&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiratori-senpai is a long-distance runner, but although she is not very fast, she is a good gambler and has always been a good runner. I have never once seen her lose a bet between club members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But if one of us falls into a pig&#8230;&#8230; The whole thing will be exposed”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, Shima-senpai tapped me on the shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right! That&#8217;s why we have to support each other”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few minutes later, all four of us were standing in front of the door of the menagerie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there was no need for all four of us to give the whipping at the same time, but none of us had the courage to go in here alone and give it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you ready?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid standing in front of the door asked, and we nodded nervously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she bowed and opened the door, we all stepped into the breeding area at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The meeting in the dining room settled on the conclusion that we should first get used to pounding today. What this means is that we should just start pounding with vigour before we lose our resolve, which is really wild talk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A noisy, dimly lit breeding ground. The members of the club are startled by the sight of us stepping in with a slam, and they all back away at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amemiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui, who stepped in at the head of the group, suddenly raised a strange cry and attacked straight at Amemiya-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, nah&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The whip is swung down without hesitation at Amemiya-senpai, whose face twitches in confusion. Following the sound of the wind cutting, there is a sharp strike against the flesh. Before Amemiya-senpai, who was lying on her side, could raise herself, Yui&#8217;s whip struck her on the shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uaaaahhhh! It hurts!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amemiya-senpai, who turned her back and twisted around to escape, was whipped by Yui, determined not to let her escape.As if she was doing twirling jumps, she swung her arms to the right and left and cracked the whip at her senpais.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noooo, stop it! You bowel! You idiot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the moment when Amemiya-senpai turned around and shouted at her, Yui&#8217;s whip struck Amemiya-senpai in the face, although she may not have been aiming for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gyan!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She writhed on the floor, moaning [Uu&#8230;&#8230;uuu&#8230;.] as she squirmed and screamed like an animal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is not a shred of lewdness, even though the girl is bound in tortoise-shell bondage and naked and the Mini〇uka Pol〇ce is whipping her. There is only gruesome violence.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You!　You!　Amemiya!　Bitch!　Because of you!　It&#8217;s your fault!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, no, don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t&#8230; &#8230;&#8230; ugh&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amemiya-senpai is left to do as she is made to do. If her hands were free, she would probably cover her head with her hands and curl up, but with her hands tied behind her back, this would not be the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Numerous red plaid patterns were already on her skin and blood was seeping from her torn skin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The four of us should have talked about how to start whipping, but Yui&#8217;s this vigour left us just standing there, stunned, with surprised faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a good spook! Look! You&#8217;d better whimper!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amemiya-senpai cried out, her face scrunched up, as she was exposed to the rain of whips that never stopped falling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop it!　It hurts, why only me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A blue streak instantly runs across Yui&#8217;s temples.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are so noisy! You ugly pigs!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at the moment when she swung the whip down extra hard, there was a figure dashed into Amemiya-senpai&#8217;s body as if to cover it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The figure is struck on the back and lets out a muffled exhale, as if to say [Gguh!] and a muffled exhalation, as if it were trying to hold back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Captain Tashiro.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kayama! Stop, if you do this any more, Amemiya will die!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Captain raised her voice like that while covering Amemiya-senpai, Yui shouted hysterically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t interrupt me!　How long are you going to pretend to be the boss, you cattle!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Completely thrilled, Yui-chan raised her whip and began to whip Captain&#8217;s back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as that happened, Shima-senpai hurriedly grabbed Yui-chan&#8217;s shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop it! It&#8217;s not necessary to whip Hatsu-chan because she&#8217;s not a potential the great sinner”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Yui-chan glared at Shima-senpai and shook off her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Would you please stop acting like a senpai? You and I are equal inquisitors here. In fact, you were chosen as the captain&#8217;s alternate and I am in a higher position than you, aren&#8217;t I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did you say!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring Shima-senpai, who raises her voice and grabs her by the chest, Yui asks the silver-haired maid around the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Freesia-sama, does whipping the inquisitor count?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it doesn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s something that the Confinement King-sama doesn&#8217;t want, so I will have to penalise you for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you hear what she said? If you don&#8217;t want to be punished by Confinement King-sama, let go of your hand”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Freesia-sama&#8230;.how much more do I have to hit?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Four more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, a hundred is a lot sooner than I think”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing that sentence, Yui-chan started to look around and stopped her gaze at Konparu-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you were the one who got along with the rotten Amemiya there, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, stop it &#8230;&#8230; kyaaaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After whipping Konparu-senpai, Yui-chan said, [This is a hundred,] and carried the whip on her shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amemiyaaaa&#8230;&#8230;you can look forward to tomorrow too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan looked down at the sobbing Amemiya-senpai and twisted her mouth into a grin, then told the silver-haired maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to take a bath. The smell of pigs is so unpleasant. Freesia-sama, is that alright with you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, of course.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Yui walked with her thick-soled boots and left the breeding ground, the club members&#8217; voiced cursing words on Yui-chan, pushing aside the tearful voice of the sobbing Amemiya-senpai and the voice of the Captain, who was concerned about her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although there were some who were abnormally jealous of her comment about taking a bath, the majority of them were criticising her for the act of hitting Amemiya-senpai and her irreverent attitude towards senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yu-chan&#8217;s attitude was certainly not praiseworthy, and her attitude towards the senpai was almost always taken out on them. The unreasonable violence against Amamiya-senpai must have seemed like an unforgivable outrage from the point of view of those who were struck down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as soon as the girls finish consuming the events that happened in front of them, they immediately go back to events that happened days, weeks or months ago and attach a tail and a fin to them, turning Yui-chan into a villainous person without a shred of good qualities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When girls get together, this is scary. The way the negative sympathy grew, piling up words like 『I understand』, could only be described as ugly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cower helplessly at the thought that from now on I myself will be whipping everyone and directing such stinging malice at them.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I can&#8217;t&#8230;..do this, I can&#8217;t do this.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I spill such a weakness in my heart, a black cord suddenly flutters through the air in the corner of my vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of the wind slashing. A crisp sound of a strike. In addition, a short scream echoed, [Kya!] A short scream rang out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned my head to look, I saw that Takasago-senpai was whipping the first-years who were crouched at her feet without changing her expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That lazy slothful person&#8230;.told me yesterday not to cut corners so much”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima Senpai gives a small cluck of her tongue diagonally behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, Takasago-senpai didn&#8217;t ask any questions, just silently finished beating the juniors in a matter of minutes, and turned sleepy eyes on the silver-haired maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The end of &#8230;&#8230; can I go home?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Takasago-senpai&#8217;s back as she leaves the room with languid steps, Shima-senpai clicks her tongue abominably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The people hit by Takasago,they&#8217;ll be fine later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W,well okay…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Shima-senpai looked at me, who smiled bitterly, and nodded, then shouted out to the club members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll tell you something so you don&#8217;t misunderstand. We had a bit of an argument earlier. I&#8217;m not saying that Miss Bowe&#8217;s way is wrong.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A small murmur escaped, mainly from the second-year students. Captain Tashiro stared intently at Shima-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Our aim is not to whip everyone up. Our aim is to find the four idiots who caused us to become like this. But, well, even if we honestly told them to come out, they wouldn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s right. I know they&#8217;re going to give us a hard time. That&#8217;s why&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai looked round at everyone and said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have to whip you all up. We have to whip you guys up so badly that those four might as well come forward.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then stops to look at a second-year student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Straight, shoulder-length hair, a bushy, glaring Buddha face that people frequently ask [Why are you angry?]even though she doesn&#8217;t mean that &#8211; she is Shiratori-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But even if we don&#8217;t whip you, if you voluntarily find those four assholes, we won&#8217;t have to whip you&#8230;&#8230;Do you now understand?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A number of gulping and slurping sounds could be heard. Shima-senpai walked straight up to Shiratori-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why&#8230; We can&#8217;t just wait around for the rest of the day. For now, we&#8217;re going to hit the ones we think are suspicious”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you mean, it’s me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai does not answer that, and silently looks at Shiratori-senpai.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I see&#8230;.. Even a casual comment like that would be an answer to a question. I would have answered it by accident. I still have to make sure I don&#8217;t speak at all&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ll have to answer our questions. Not the other way round. Do you know third-year student Mai Fujiwara&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..The one who was humiliated, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai silently and with a snap, she swung the whip down on Shiratori- senpai&#8217;s thighs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirotori-senpai raises her eyebrows. But she doesn&#8217;t seem to be intimidated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How is it? Do you know her? Tell me honestly! If you don&#8217;t know, you&#8217;re going to take at least ten more shots”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So unreasonable&#8230;&#8230;Yeah, I know. My friend&#8217;s brother is a good friend of hers&#8230;&#8230;and I heard she&#8217;s really rich.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hee—, that black gal has a lot of money. It&#8217;s true that appearances can be deceiving&#8230;&#8230;.And you, a money-grubber, tried to extort money from the rich gal, didn&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren&#8217;t you being paranoid?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up! Just answer the question!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I only know her from what my acquaintances have told me about her and I don&#8217;t even know what she looks like.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiratori-senpai shrugged her shoulders as if she were making fun of her, while Shima-senpai was miffed and asked a series of questions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who is this acquaintance of yours?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.a first-year student, Tachioka Kizuna. Sato is in the same class as her, though I had some talk with her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Hou,Sato..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shima-senpai turned her head while saying this, Sato-san jumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, I have nothing to do with it!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s noisy. Shiratori,Sato, Konparu and Adachi, the four of you, line up there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, Konparu-senpai and Adachi-senpai jumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why me!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve already been beaten by Miss Bowl! Isn&#8217;t that unfair!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So noisy. Get in line, quickly!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai whips them into a tailspin, shouting at them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, Shima-senpai had said from the beginning that she would hit the second-year students. That is why she probably made the three second-year students, excluding Amemiya-senpai, plus Sato-san, the first-year student whose name was mentioned, her target for today for the time being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. You guys turn your asses over here. Answer me honestly, will you?　Did any of you have lay your hands on Mai Fujiwara? If so, come forward!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, no one answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;re just ignoring us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It means it wasn&#8217;t us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Shiratori-senpai said that in a tone of exasperation, Shima-senpai swung the whip down on her buttocks and there was a tremendous sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U&#8230;&#8230;uuu&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiratori-senpai, whose face was distorted and writhing. The whip marks on her buttocks gradually became redder and redder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O,oi…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as Captain Tashiro was about to lean forward, Shima-senpai whipped the floor right next to her and quietly poke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu-chan, please be quiet. I don&#8217;t want to hit Hatsu-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, the four of them and Shima-senpai said 『Fess up!』『 I told you I don&#8217;t know!』 She finished the hundred lashes while shouting at each other but none of the four came forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All four had swollen buttocks. Just looking at them, they seem to be in a lot of pain.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Since they endured to the end, can we exclude these four from the list of candidates for the deadly sinner &#8230;&#8230;? But if they are found out to be deadly sinners, they will suffer worse, well, that&#8217;s not entirely true&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I think about this, Shima-senpai looks at Shiratori-senpai and opens her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiratori&#8230;.did you understand what I said?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How can you be so selfish&#8230;..after whipping people up so much?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shiratori-senpai glared at her resentfully. Shima-senpai went out into the corridor, fluttering her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, after seeing off Shima-senpai&#8217;s back, after a beat of breath, I suddenly realised. I realised.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;m the only one left now!?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was I dilly-dallying about? I realised that I was the only inquisitor present.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking around, the gaze of Amemiya-senpai, whose eyes are bright red, hurts. The menacing gaze of Shiratori-senpai hurts. The only relief is the worried look from Captain, but the rest of the glares all hurt.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What should I do?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly turned to the first-year students and they said, [Oh? Are you going to do it?] They glared at me as if to say that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;m scared. It&#8217;s too scary&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An?　Moribe, you&#8217;re not going to hit us just because you&#8217;re Moribe, are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t do it, Saori-chan, you shouldn&#8217;t force yourself. You&#8217;re shaking.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saito-san and Kishiro-san laughed out loud as they said this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe, we&#8217;re friends. We&#8217;re the ones who pace you when you&#8217;re running, aren&#8217;t we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, Saori, if you want to stay friends with us&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Omuta-san and Koike-san walked up to me from the right side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the first place, it&#8217;s impossible for Moribe to do that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t swing that whip, it&#8217;s dangerous, don&#8217;t let it come near me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hotta-san and Mako-san peeked at me from the left side.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I can&#8217;t take it anymore. I want to run away.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If these girls had not been tied up behind their backs, they would have been snatched up by the whip long ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sta, stay away from me &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I back away, helplessly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I can&#8217;t do it, I can&#8217;t do it anymore. Maybe it would be easier to just give up and fall becoming pigs&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I started thinking about this, the first-year students who had been coming up beside me turned their eyes behind me and said, [Hii!?] and retreated backwards all at once.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ee? Eh? What happened?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, someone gently grabs my confused shoulder. In my haste to turn around, I heard a soft whisper in my ear. It was the voice of a silver-haired maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe-sama, there is no need to be frightened. You are now a faithful servant of the Confinement King. The great Confinement King will not allow anyone to harm you. Please use your whip with all your might.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, but&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am with you. I will punish anyone who harms you with a punishment worse than death in the name of the great Confinement King.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U,uuu,uuuuu….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry. Believe in the name of the Confinement King-sama&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“u,UWAAAAAAA!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I am honest, I was more scared of the silver-haired maids than the first years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was no longer torn. I raised my whip and swung it down with no aim and no momentum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I barely remember the first blow. I remember hitting Koike-san&#8217;s chest. After that, I can barely remember anything else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve passed the hundred mark. Do you still want to continue?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to swing the whip selflessly until I came to my senses when the silver-haired maid called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t remember who I whipped and how much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I came to my senses, I found the first years, covered in red worm sores, staring at me with frightened eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m done &#8230;&#8230; for today”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her so, the silver-haired maid politely said, [Thank you for your hard work.] And she turned to the members and continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, if Moribe-sama leaves the room, you pigs will all be penalised.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha,WHY!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid shrugged her shoulders in dismay as Captain Tashiro stood up with an astonished expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s you. You. After all I said to you, but you interfered with Kayama-sama&#8217;s execution by protecting the bitch there”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, the members of the club voiced their condemnation towards Captain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain! You! You should just leave Amemiya alone!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That attitude again? I&#8217;m sick of it&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to hear anything anymore. I covered my ears to the ugly arguments of the club members and ran out of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu…uuuu…gusu….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Disgust swirling in my chest. Tears began to spill out in rags as I walked down the dimly lit corridor, and I dragged the whip in my hand with no effort as I walked back to my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened the door, I saw Yui sitting on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She appears to have just finished her bath and is dressed in nothing more than a bath towel. Her wet hair, which is in the habit of being curled vertically, looks unusually heavy, as if she has not even finished towel-drying properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You took your time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has certainly taken a long time. It has already been more than two hours since Yui-chan left the breeding ground first.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Because, you know, I can&#8217;t help it. I&#8217;m not someone who can whip people with impunity like Yui-chan&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked into the room and sat down there on the red carpet in a heap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what are you crying about? By the look on your face, I suppose you couldn&#8217;t have whipped those pigs?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gusu…..ueee….gusu,zubi,gusu….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whipped. I whipped them properly. I whipped them and came back. I tried to reply to that, but I couldn&#8217;t get the words out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t stop crying. I can hardly breathe. My emotions are already a mess. Guilt, a sense of achievement, and other emotions that can be named are fine, but what is this feeling that is swirling in the back of my chest, engulfing them all? What is this feeling that&#8217;s so black, yet so proud?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui makes a dumbfounded face and asks me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What happened after that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What happened after that]&#8230;&#8230;after Yui had completed a hundred whippings and left the breeding ground a step ahead of the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I finished speaking, faltering and sobbing, she smiled and squeezed my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230;you thought it felt good the moment you whipped them, didn&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I winced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thought. I thought that. I hate to admit it, but at that first strike, when I struck Koike-san in the chest, I did indeed feel a tingling, electric shiver down my spine, such a good feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I nodded my head, unable to say anything, Yui-chan whispered in my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would like to serve the Confinement King-sama&#8230;.. Why don&#8217;t we ask Masaki-sama together?”</span></p

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu….uuun….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I slept very well. Yet, my body feels lazy and dull.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to open my eyes, the sunlight coming in through the window was shining directly on my face and was extremely bright.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I close my eyes again. The fact that there is a window means that this is not 『Bedroom』 . In other words, it&#8217;s my own room. Perhaps Lili carried me out while I was sleeping.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I recall vaguely with my still-awake head, I can remember most of what happened last night. Of course, I also remember what happened during the rampage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoko&#8217;s sister&#8230;&#8230;er, Kyoko, I think. I think that was her name. I drank the whole bottle of nutritional drink to teach her. And then, as I had planned, I went on a rampage. I fucked her to relentlessly and heard the electronic level-up sound twice. That means Kyoko is now in a state of 『Subjugated』. Unfortunately, it seems that she didn&#8217;t go all the way to 『Enslaved』 at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after Kyoko passed out, I raped Ryoko, who had stepped in and ripped her clothes and in the process, I also raped Masaki-chan, who happened to come into the room, holding her against the wall and raping her.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Uwaa, I&#8217;m the worst&#8230;&#8230;I have to apologise to Ryoko and Masaki-chan later&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I had thought that far, I felt a rush of blood.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aa&#8230;..I attacked Lili&#8230;..although it seems I didn&#8217;t go all the way to the end.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the one hand, I think it was a bad idea, but on the other hand, I feel like it was a close call.If you ask me if I want to hold Lili, of course I want to hold her. Whatever the case may be, she is a very beautiful girl. She&#8217;s a loli, though.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What kind of face should I make when I see Lili…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost clutching my head, I became aware of a faint breathing sound coming from right next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone is clinging to my hand as if to pinch it between my thighs. I hurriedly turned my eyes towards the direction where I heard the  breathing, and there I saw the sleeping face of Fujiwara-san in ojousama mode, who was sleeping comfortably [Suu–Suu—]</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘wh,why, is Fujiwara-san&#8230;.mother must have let her into my room without permission again’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it&#8217;s Fujiwara-san, well, there&#8217;s no problem. I think it&#8217;s strange, but it&#8217;s possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gently raise myself up and stroke her hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I look at her again, I see that she is still cute. Her eyelashes are long and her skin is smooth despite her tan. Each part of her face is small and looks fragile and fragile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stared at her face, I suddenly heard a girl&#8217;s voice from the corner of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You finally woke up?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a panic, I looked in the direction of the voice and there was a girl leaning against the wall.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa&#8230;..san??”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an earth-coloured long skirt and a dark green tunic. Kurosawa-san dressed like a lightly dressed forest girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look like you&#8217;re wondering why you&#8217;re here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;.. yeah.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That&#8217;s exactly right.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m staying at Mai&#8217;s place. Mai said she was going to your house, so I said I wouldn&#8217;t go&#8230;&#8230;.But you see, Mai has a way of not listening once she starts talking, doesn&#8217;t she? So I was brought here by force.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa…is that so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence descends upon us. The air is very delicate. In the first place, it is unusual for me and Kurosawa-san to be in the same room and having a conversation with each other. There was no way we could continue talking. Instead of us not being able to speak, we could faintly hear the voices of the children chattering away from outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san, with her eyes downcast, mumbles something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What should I call you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m talking about you. Because when I call you Kimo-jima, it hurts Mai’s feelings. But I don&#8217;t want to call you Fu–min.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, ah&#8230;&#8230;then, you can usually call me Kijima-kun or Fumio-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san then turns her jittery eyes on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know why I have to call you [kun]. Are you an idiot..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eee&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a bad thing that the relationship is back to where I was kicked to the foot, but isn&#8217;t this a terrible way of putting it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Stop staring at me. It&#8217;s disgusting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, sorry. It&#8217;s just that Kurosawa-san not in uniform is a rarity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, it&#8217;s quite refreshing. I&#8217;ve only ever seen her in her underwear or naked, skipping all sorts of things when she&#8217;s not in uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I borrowed these clothes from Mai, but I&#8217;ll tell her later. I&#8217;ll tell her later that she should take them to the cleaners right away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They get dirty just by me looking at them?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouted out involuntarily, and that&#8217;s when Fujiwara-san suddenly stretched out, saying, [Fuwaaa&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Fujiwara-san starts rubbing her cheek against my chest, Kurosawa-san sniffs[Hmph] and turns away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s this? Did you get along with Misuzu?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, um, a little bit&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re not getting along at all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she says this with a discouraged expression, Kurosawa-san stands up quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai, it&#8217;s time to go home. Also, while you were sleeping, your mother came in to check on you, and when she saw Mai sleeping next to you, she said happily, 『Araaramama』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast to my involuntary pouting, Fujiwara-san said, [Haha, we&#8217;re a parent-approved couple!] and Kurosawa-san let out a,[Hmph] again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Fujiwara-san and Kurosawa-san had left, I braced myself and called Lili.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no response. There was an awkward silence in the room. I kept calling out to her and after about the twelfth time, a pouting Lili appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“umm&#8230;.. Lili, I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘uwa…she’s absurdly angry’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I need a manual on how to handle angry girls. In the end, I could only apologise flatly and around the three dozen or so [sorrys] I had accumulated, Lili let out a big sigh and dropped her shoulders a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No berserking in the future! Understand, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, yeah, I won&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll never do it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I nodded exaggeratedly, Lili giggled like a mother who had just finished scolding her naughty child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good that you understand, Devi. Well, thanks to you being a berserker, Ryoko&#8217;s sister was able to fall to a state of 『Subjugated』 in a single step, so it&#8217;s not all bad, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously? Heee&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;ll be fun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what are you going to do tonight, Devi?　In case you&#8217;re wondering, you&#8217;ve just been drained with all your might by an Elder Succubus and then you were drained again by the black gal, so I think you could do with a night&#8217;s rest, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute. Didn&#8217;t you just say something I shouldn&#8217;t have heard?　What do you mean, Fujiwara-san drained me out once?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“While FumiFumi was asleep, she drained you with her mouth, Devi. Right in front of Kurosawa-chan”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I widened my eyes, Lili gave me a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She&#8217;s quite a nice, crazy woman, Devi. But thanks to that, Kurosawa-chan has become quite conscious of FumiFumi, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? I think she was just poking me as usual&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, just watch and see, Devi. So, back to the topic at hand, what are you doing tonight, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I&#8217;ve managed to get her down to 『Subjugated』right? So I’m going to continue to focus on Ryoko&#8217;s sister. I think that if I continue to break her pride thoroughly and make her realise how helpless she is, I can get her down to 『Enslaved』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili raises her eyebrows a little and dismisses it curtly. I thought, maybe she&#8217;s still a bit angry with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I woke up, I was completely naked, without a stitch of clothing on. I was on the bed in the first room my sister took me into, a luxurious room with blue as its base colour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the bedside clock and saw that it was eight o&#8217;clock at night. How long had I been asleep?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell&#8230;..just happened?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, the nasty smiling face of that little shit flashed back into my mind. I remember the image of myself, crying and screaming, desperately begging for forgiveness after being raped so horribly and I clutched the sheets tightly in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re a monster, aren&#8217;t you&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shudder at the memory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made my debut at university, went clubbing at night, went out with a lot of guys who were so bad that I couldn&#8217;t have enough on both hands, got all the pretty girls across the board, made them sex friends and even cheated on men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I honestly didn&#8217;t think anyone was better at sex than me, male or female.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was just my ego.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was going to punish that cheeky little shit, but I was cummed all over the place and couldn&#8217;t even find a way to fight back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so scared when I thought he wanted to overwhelm me, who was dizzy and unable to stand on my legs and feet, and from there he started pistoning me like a madman. He didn’t care whether I cummed or cried out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I was about to lose consciousness, he  thrust up with such force that he smashed through my womb, forcing me back to reality and throwing me back into the sea of pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, my willpower and pride broke and I cried like a child, but he has no human heart. He won&#8217;t relent at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He kept ejaculating,ejaculating,ejaculating and I wondered how many times he had fucked me in the vagina without even pulling his dick out. Just thinking about it makes me lose my confidence.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can either live without getting involved with him or I can flirt and be pretty in front of him. I have to choose one or the other. They are such monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I remember sex like that, I must probably feel inadequate to be held by another man. In fact, just remembering what happened last night is starting to make me tingle deep inside. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I&#8217;m starting to crave that pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But with time, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be able to forget it one day. I want to believe that I can forget. Otherwise, I will really have no choice but to fall into the slavery of that little shit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; If I want to escape, it&#8217;s now or never!’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door opened easily. On the other side, the bedroom of the apartment is visible. But somehow, my feet suddenly stop moving there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, no matter how I tried, I couldn&#8217;t step out of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why? Damn it&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slammed the door shut and sat there limply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost at the same time as I muttered this in a daze, I heard a clatter and the door leading to the corridor opened. I stiffened in fear, thinking that the little shit had come to rape me again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what peeked out was a pretty girl in a negligee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good evening, Kyoko-san. Are you awake?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Smiling, the girl walks into the room. She has a childish face and petite figure, as if she were in primary school. And yet, she has huge tits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is Masaki Haneda. Fumio-kun asked me to help you find something to wear.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What to wear&#8230;.Oh, thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you know. He&#8217;s my lover, his sex slave, his wife”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ll understand in time. Especially tonight, Fumio-kun said he was going to take care of Kyoko-san all night long, so you have to dress up pretty!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That statement, which was tantamount to a death sentence, sent a chill down my spine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not joking, okay? When Fumio-kun says all night, it&#8217;s really all night. Oh, I&#8217;m so jealous. I want to be held too, but&#8230;..Kyoko-san is a newcomer, so I&#8217;ll give you priority.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can tell that this girl, Haneda Masaki, is really jealous of the fact that she can be held by that little shit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you like this Fumio guy, don&#8217;t you? Is it okay for the guy you love to have another girl?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t mind it. If it makes Fumio-kun happy, then I feel like he should just go ahead and hold you. Besides, Kyoko-san has experienced it, so I&#8217;m sure you understand that the sex from Fumio-kun is not something you can handle alone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;.. indeed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since only Ryoko-san and I are dealing with Fumio-kun right now, Kyoko-san is more than welcome!””</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The image of my sister&#8217;s fiancée, whom I&#8217;ve only met once, crosses my mind. He&#8217;s a much older, silver-rimmed, bespectacled, kind man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, I am now dressed in a red tartan check jumperskirt and heart-patterned knee-high socks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On my head is a big ribbon with a pattern that matches the skirt. The skirt is short and has white frills at the hem, in what is known as Lolita fashion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm&#8230;I told you I don&#8217;t like girls using [Ore], didn&#8217;t I?. Call yourself　『Kyoko-tan』 today. And you can call me 『Oniitan』. Please use infant language.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way I was dressed and talking like this. It&#8217;s like a stupid woman who lacks brains. The taste is too bad. It&#8217;s too much of a bad joke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a punk, rock, cool girl. That&#8217;s what I told myself ever since I made my university debut, and that&#8217;s what I thought of myself. That was my intention. But this guy just brushed it off as if it was worthless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll kill you, Onii-tan!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The little shit opens his mouth in a taunting manner as he walks towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I need Kyoko-tan to apologise to me because you’re making fun of me. You also stated that you intended to kill me. And now, you tried to hit me. Really, you&#8217;re the type of person who really resents thing”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Onii-tan. I&#8217;m sorry. Kyoko-tan was a bad girl. Please forgive me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My blood vessels are about to break out. My voice is shaking. And yet I&#8217;m apologising, rubbing my forehead on the floor, like I&#8217;m trying to appease this little shit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so frustrated, so disappointed, so helpless, so pathetic, that I started to cry. But even my cries sounded like those of a toddler.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can’t be helped…. Okay, I forgive you. So, come over, and I&#8217;ll take good care of you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she stood up, I took Kyoko&#8217;s arm roughly and pulled her closer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her wobbly feet. Her face is a mess of tears. She was so absent-minded that she didn&#8217;t put up much of a fight, and leaned back against my breastplate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is dressed as a Lolita, but her face and body are those of an adult woman. Her tone is lisping, but her words are defiant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The indescribable imbalance and the messed-up crying face are making my desire for sadism swell to the brink of critical mass.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Shit&#8230;&#8230;this is getting fun’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili once said that it was fun to twist other people&#8217;s destinies by force, and I seem to have discovered that it&#8217;s fun too.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyan, don&#8217;t be rough with me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko falls on her back, on her buttocks. Her tartan-check jumper skirt is rolled up, exposing the childish pumpkin trousers underneath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I twisted myself between her legs and covered her up. I thought she might resist a little, but she didn&#8217;t. She just looked back at me with defiant eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I&#8217;m satisfied.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held her arms together with one hand and untied the shoulder straps of her jumper skirt. And then I pulled down her top.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hya?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boobs are instantly mellowed out. Is it because children don&#8217;t wear bras that she has no bra?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Kyoko&#8217;s breasts are plump and well-shaped. Her body is similar to Ryoko&#8217;s but in this area, I felt that Kyoko&#8217;s breasts were slightly larger than Ryoko&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko blushes but turns away with a pout and bites her lip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;do as you like”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t need to tell me that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I grabbed the swelling of the breast, Kyoko&#8217;s eyebrows drew up in pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow, it hurts, you&#8217;re terrible!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The softness of her flesh that contorts in my hands and the elasticity of the skin that pushes back makes me forget how much force I need and I almost want to crush it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a different feeling from Masaki-chan&#8217;s prodigiously soft tits. Kyoko&#8217;s has an inner core, and the feel of that core pushing back is pleasant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time I put my fingers into them, I felt as if the sweet womanly smell that Kyoko emits was becoming clearer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After enjoying the feel of her breasts for a while, Kyoko laughed mockingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, you’re pathetic if you think your powerful massage will please a woman. It&#8217;s all pain and no pleasure”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, my bad, my bad. Ryoko is an M who likes to be punished hard and I thought Kyoko was the same. Because you are a degraded copy of Ryoko.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko seemed to have a momentary scowl on her face, and then, perhaps, she could not tolerate that one word. Suddenly, her tear-stained eyes became angry and she began to resist violently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muuuuuu! Shut up, shut up! Kyoko-tan has nothing to do with Onee-tan! I hate you, Onii-tan! I hate you so much!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Be quiet!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I commanded her to do so, Kyoko&#8217;s limbs instantly stopped moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought you weren&#8217;t going to resist?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up, Chine!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Die]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her behaviour is somewhat childish, with her cheeks puffed out and her face turned away with a pout. Perhaps her mentality is being dragged down by her dress and language.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her reaction, I shrugged my shoulders and reached her lower body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I roll her skirt up to her stomach, place my hand on the bulge of her pubic mound over her pumpkin trousers and trace my fingers up the crack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hin, ah, ya, wait&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t make such a fuss about it now. You&#8217;re confident about sex, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U,uuu&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stroked the slit above the pants with my fingers, I could see the slightest twitching of Kyoko&#8217;s insides through the fabric, which is much thicker than normal shorts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Keep spreading your legs”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don&#8217;t want to!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even though she said that with her mouth, her body began to move on its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her legs spread so wide that her hip joints creaked and squeaked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moo—! What&#8217;s wrong with me? I can&#8217;t stand it, my crotch hurts!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stroking down her pubic mound from the cloth and sinking my fingers into the crack, I pin one of her legs between her sides.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, a jolt of tension ran through Kyoko&#8217;s legs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that is of no concern. When my fingertips grazed her clitoris, Kyoko&#8217;s hips bounced. Then, as I slowly and impatiently traced the area around her horny buds, a sweet voice began to mingle with her exhales.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn&#8230;, Ah, Ah&#8230;. Nnn&#8230;. Ah&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I continued to play with my fingers relentlessly, the thick fabric of her pumpkin pants began to stain with embarrassing stains.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are getting wet quickly. You&#8217;re such a little pussy”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s not! You idiot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grinning and watching as Kyoko blushed and raised her voice, I put my fingers on the elastic pumpkin pants and pulled them down at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Onii-nitan…nakaa, chi-ne, hentaiiiiii!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Baka,Shine/Idiot,Die]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko raises her voice but she is restrained from moving. She is helpless, with her legs spread wide open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it&#8217;s time for me to have some fun too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take off my pants and take out my penis, rubbing myself a little to condition it. Kyoko, sensing my presence, looks away when she sees my towering thing, but curiosity gets the better of her and she glances at it again and is awestruck by its size.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now you don&#8217;t need to be freaked out, do you? You&#8217;ve already sucked it into my mouth so many times”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I,I&#8217;m not scared!! That’s not enough to be called big!　If you&#8217;re going to do something, do it quickly!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko closed her eyes and stiffened up. Her appearance seemed both lamely and somewhat expectant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, let&#8217;s have some fun, shall we?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take my penis in my hand and slowly trace the crack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230;a&#8230;&#8230;an&#8230;&#8230;an&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stroked her slowly, as if I was coating her with cowper, her vaginal hole twitched like a carp&#8217;s mouth, and a dribble of honey flooded out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good,Good, only the condition of the vagina is. Kyoko&#8217;s better than Ryoko&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T,that&#8217;s not a compliment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t mean it as a compliment. It&#8217;s a fact. So, I don&#8217;t need Kyoko&#8217;s bad but conceited sex, I&#8217;ll just use you as an onahole. You don&#8217;t even have to move”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“please, it&#8217;s enough&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment when Kyoko was about to raise her voice, I pressed my penis against her pussy and thrust my hips in at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“nHiiiii?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, ah, ah, ah, ah,aaaah, ah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko&#8217;s hips are jerking and bouncing, but her limbs are not moving at all. She is in what is known as a tuna state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I move my hips, cover over Kyoko and stick my face right up to her nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyoko is not bad looking and her pussy is not bad either. Then the best use for her would be to dress her up pretty and use her as a raw masturbator, wouldn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chine!! I&#8217;ll kill you, I&#8217;ll kill you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aramaa, you&#8217;re a foul-mouthed onahole. Well, then&#8230;.Don&#8217;t say anything other than I love you, Onii-tan.”</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/p237-697x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you, Onii-tan! I really love you, Onii-tan!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Onii-tan Daisuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her flittering voice is probably cursing, but what comes out as 『Onii-tan Daisuki』, which is pretty funny. I couldn&#8217;t help but burst out laughing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko&#8217;s frustrated face in front of me, tears of regret dripping from her eyes as she glared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, I love your expression…It makes me tingle. Because Ryoko is happy when I torment her, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you, Oniii–tan!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think she probably just said something like 『I gonna remember it!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oboeteyagare]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re really useless, Kyoko. The only good thing about you is your pussy. That&#8217;s why&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thrust my hips up all at once and crushed her womb.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiiii!? O-Onii-tan, Hii, I love you&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko&#8217;s eyes widened and she arched her back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to use you as a living onahole until morning”</span></p>

<p><strong> Sixth Day of Girls’ Track and Field Member Confinement</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Really, I spent all morning using her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A torture of being forced to lay on top of someone who cannot even move and continue to fuck them selfishly is a torture that can no longer even be called sex. I licked a nutritional drink and ejaculated three times, which I repeated until morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much Kyoko cried out, no matter how many times she cum, it didn&#8217;t matter. I shook my hips as I wished, and continued to release my sperm as I wished.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What would happen to the woman if I did that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lili, this onahole is broken”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told Lili when she came to tell me that morning was coming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa&#8230;.. this is awful, Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili gave a half smile. It&#8217;s a very devilish expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After 2am, Kyoko just let out an unintelligible moan, [ah&#8230;&#8230;ah&#8230;&#8230;]. Well, even so, there is no problem in using her hole. I kept on using it and after six o&#8217;clock, she couldn&#8217;t stop convulsing with her white eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I look into her face, I can see that she has a terrible goofy look on her face, as if no matter how beautiful she is, this is the end of her. It was a mess of tears and drool and she couldn&#8217;t wipe it off, and her snot was running in white streaks down her chin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her pretty jumper skirt was also bare at the chest and the hem was rolled up, only to wrap around her stomach. Thanks to her inability to move, it was also surreal to see that her hair was not much dishevelled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, Kyoko has not yet reached 『Enslaved』. If she can&#8217;t fall this far, then I should assume that physical stimulation alone is not enough to corrupt her to that level. There is some condition that has not been fulfilled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll have Torture heal her later, Devi. Only her broken spirit will be healed but her memories will remain intact. We&#8217;ll see if she can still be defiant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hopefully, she&#8217;ll charge at me again.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, just to smash it up again, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because, you know, I can&#8217;t do this kind of thing to Masaki because I feel sorry for her, and Ryoko would be delighted, so on the contrary, it&#8217;s not fun for me. In that respect, Kyoko satisfies my S-ness, so she&#8217;s probably quite my favourite type.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An extremely disturbing preference, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Lili shrugs her shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then take care of Kyoko, will you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to take a shower and left Kyoko in Lili’s care. I also release her from 『Ban』. Then I left the 『Room』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the morning, Mai and I were driven to school together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A rich man&#8217;s car must be a Mercedes, so I said, 『This is a cool Mercedes Benz』&#8217;Cool, this Mercedes&#8217;, to which she replied,『It&#8217;s a Citroen, DS9, my father&#8217;s hobby』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what kind of　Mercedes Benz Citroen is, even if she told me that. At any rate, I decided to nod my head and say, [Heh &#8230;..] I might have been a bit abrasive up there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were policemen standing in places on the way to school, and the number of reporters around the main gate had decreased considerably over the weekend.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘At this rate, the area in front of my house might be safe now, too. I&#8217;ll call my mum later and ask her how it&#8217;s going.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I step into the classroom with Mai, the scene is no different from usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the topic that leaks out from the students who are gathered together talking naturally about the disappearance of the girls&#8217; track and field team. I can feel their eyes glancing at me, and it seems that my name was mentioned many times on the news, so I guess it&#8217;s inevitable. I&#8217;m not happy about it, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu–min, Mornin!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai rushes to Fumio&#8217;s side as soon as she enters the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She throws her bag straight to the seat next to him and attaches her chair to Fumio&#8217;s seat and clings to his arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai doesn&#8217;t seem to care about what other people think of her at all. Fumio looks annoyed, but I can tell by looking at him that he doesn&#8217;t really dislike it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also walked up to Fumio before taking my seat and said a few words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh!!? Ah, aaa, oh, good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really don&#8217;t want him to make a face like he is 『surprised』 every time I say hello.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Bikkurishita]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was about to return to my seat, Mai opened her mouth as if she had just remembered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right, Fu–min. I have to go home with Misuzu today, so I can&#8217;t go home with you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, can you stop talking as if we always go home together?　I can go home alone, but Fujiwara-san always follows me around on her own.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh&#8230;&#8230;Fu–min so cold! I mean! You should call me Mai, not Fujiwara-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumio speaks naturally only to Mai. Well, maybe it&#8217;s natural for boyfriends and girlfriends but somehow I felt that it didn&#8217;t add up. It&#8217;s like a pet that doesn&#8217;t get used to being alone in the family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With such a bewildered mood, I took my seat and Jun-kun came up to me and sat on the chair in front of me, holding his neck, saying [Misuzu, good morning].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Jun-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What were you talking to KimoJima earlier?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was just saying hello&#8230;&#8230;What, are you jealous, Jun-kun?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jun-kun, who looks away, is adorable. I unintentionally felt my mouth relax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jun-kun looks a little fidgety and his voice is cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way&#8230;.is there somewhere we can meet this week?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m staying at Mai&#8217;s place after I left the detective&#8217;s apartment, but I don&#8217;t want to bother her. If the media finds out about me, it will be&#8230;&#8230;. I think I&#8217;ll be able to go home next week”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Well, then I guess we don&#8217;t have much of a choice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s not good if the press finds me but if I ask Mai, she&#8217;ll at least give me a lift in her car. But I&#8217;m still not sure how I feel about being alone with him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve heard from fellow models that once girls allow the boys to have physical touch, they will continually ask for more..It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like that, it&#8217;s just that I don&#8217;t want to compare&#8230;&#8230;things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s especially bad since Mai showed me Fumio&#8217;s cock. When I&#8217;m not concentrating, I start to have fantasies about using my mouth on Fumio&#8217;s thick cock instead of Jun-kun&#8217;s cute one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unexpectedly, a sigh escapes.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Dear me&#8230;&#8230;When did you become such a naughty girl? I&#8217;m not sure how long I&#8217;m going to be able to keep this up.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, since last night. It seems that there is no sign of the first year&#8217;s manager. There seems to be a bit of a commotion in the dorm”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? That&#8217;s terrible! But what does that have to do with Mai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The manager left this message”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a look at the screen of the smartphone that Jun-kun presented to me and I gasped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『I&#8217;ve just informed the police. I saw a third-year Kijima-senpai wandering around the track and field club room on the day the track and field club went missing. I&#8217;ve had a terrifying experience with that senior for quite some time. So, I was like, Serve him right. But If I vanish, it will most likely be because of him.wwww』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He kidnapped everyone in the track team? Haha, impossible! There&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s believable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230; I think it&#8217;s not possible,look at this&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Jun slides the screen down, there are some very disturbing exchanges on his SNS timeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[social networking ]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Surrounding, Kidnapping&#8230;&#8230; Isn&#8217;t it bad? This”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The missing manager is a girl who was liked by everyone. The first-year boys were fighting over her. They got angry&#8230;&#8230;. And they might do something like surround KimoJima on the way home. So, apart from KimoJima, if Mai also got involved, it would be a disaster”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shouldn&#8217;t you tell him about this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell KimoJima? I don&#8217;t have any obligation to do that. Even though I think it&#8217;s impossible, if I heard that he might be the one who kidnapped Misuzu and Masaki-chan, I would want to question him first”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute! Don&#8217;t do that. There are a lot of policemen standing by right now, and if Jun-kun gets caught, I don&#8217;t like it”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m not going to do anything. Don&#8217;t tell Mai-chan either. She&#8217;ll definitely get involved”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think Jun-kun is right. If I tell Mai, I don&#8217;t know what she will do. It&#8217;s too dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I looked back at Fumio.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumio is the culprit? That&#8217;s impossible. But if I think about it, I went missing the day after I trampled him. And the reason Masaki still hasn&#8217;t come back is because he confessed to her&#8230;&#8230;No, I’m probably thinking too much. I’m getting crazy lately. I don&#8217;t think he has the energy, strength and financial power to kidnap someone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But on this day, I kept wondering whether he should tell Fumio that he was being targeted.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-sama was not present at the dinner table last night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to serve the Confinement King. Yui-chan, who was going to ask, looked very disappointed. She asked me if I would like to serve with her, but I thought I had declined. I was not comfortable saying I didn&#8217;t want to, so I turned down the offer in a roundabout way, but I&#8217;m not so sure if Yui got the message.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, one night later, it was time for breakfast. We finish our fluffy cheese omelette and it&#8217;s time to feed the pigs. We step into the corral with buckets of oatmeal and milk in our hands, as instructed by the silver-haired maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We thought it would be the same&#8230;&#8230;as yesterday, but something unexpected happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu-chan! What&#8217;s going on? This!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai shouted loudly and we turned our eyes to where she was looking. There, we found Captain Tashiro, covered in bruises, lying on the floor as if throwing her body out.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the other members of the club, as the silver-haired maid had said, the whipping scars have disappeared without a shadow. This means that the bruises on the Captain’s head and body were not caused by the whipping.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who is it? Who did this to you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shima-senpai looks around at the pigs and raises her voice, Captain Tashiro weakly raises herself and replies in a pained voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shima&#8230;&#8230;I’m okay. Don&#8217;t worry. Just get everyone some food&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You idiot! Hatsu-chan, you’re hurt everywhere.They do not deserve to be feed!.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai was about to approach the pigs, but a silver-haired maid stood in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shima-sama, it&#8217;s feeding time. This is not the time for an interrogation”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As if!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you do not comply, I will penalise you”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ggghhh&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai bites her lip, looks around at the pigs, and says in a low voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys &#8230;&#8230; better brace yourselves later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai silently and angrily gave the food and as soon as she finished collecting the feed bins, she was about to charge straight into the breeding area with a whip in her hand. We hurried to stop her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s cool down for a moment. Okay?,how about it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know but, Moribe&#8230;&#8230;.Takasago?! Miss Bowel! You too. Don&#8217;t push! Don&#8217;t push!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The comedian&#8217;s 『don&#8217;t push』 means push, right? Anyway, it would be wise to start all over again”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who&#8217;s the comedian!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can understand why Shima-senpai is so angry. In fact, I also felt quite indignant at such a scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By all accounts, those are lynching scars. They are the marks of being kicked and trampled by a bunch of people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whoever did it, why didn&#8217;t the others stop it? Couldn&#8217;t they have stopped it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m calm! I&#8217;ve calmed down, so let&#8217;s move!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re not calm at all, Shima-senpai!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I somehow managed to drag her to the dining room but as soon as I sat her down in the chair, Shima-senpai was in a hurry to get up. I grab her hand and persuade her.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand how you feel, but if you don&#8217;t calm down, you will make an unexpected mistake.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think you need to cool down, don&#8217;t you? You can fall in with the pigs all you like, but I hope you&#8217;ll consider the trouble you&#8217;ll cause us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Shima-senpai glared at Yui-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Miss Bowel&#8230; you&#8217;ve been quite brave lately. You better watch out when you use your mouth!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please don&#8217;t take it out on me. You know what you&#8217;re getting yourself into. If it&#8217;s you now, I can see you being provoked by Shiratori-senpai and saying 『Get mad, answer the question,and then fall high to a pig』, like a product description on some phone shopping channel, and falling in with just three easy steps.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ghh…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai is not stupid. Apart from being able to study, she is what is called a person of wisdom. That&#8217;s probably why she found what Yui-chan said to be reasonable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai pounded the table with her fist. With that aside, Yui-chan spoke to me and Takasago-senpai.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takasago-senpai, please take care of Shima-senpai. Then, first of all, Moribe-san and I will finish the whipping first. And Moribe-san, it&#8217;s best if you don&#8217;t say anything. To be honest, I don&#8217;t think you look very calm either.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed Yui-chan out of the dining room and came to the front of the breeding yard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the silver-haired maid saw us, she bowed and pushed open the door, saying, [Please, enter].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s go. Moribe-san”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We gave each other a small nod and stepped into the menagerie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smell of leftover breakfast and milk hit my nose. Captain Tashiro was rolling around in the corner, her chest was going up and down, so she was probably fine. I told myself that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she saw Yui-chan&#8217;s figure, Amemiya-senpai said, [Hiiii!] and her face twitched. The club members retreated from around Amemiya-senpai all at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amemiya, you&#8217;re ready for this, aren&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nooo&#8230;&#8230;Please forgive me&#8230;&#8230;Why do you keep doing this to me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re a dumb pig. You still don&#8217;t know how to speak. Please, forgive me….‘Yui-sama’…isn’t it!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a large swing of the whip as it is, Yui sets Amemiya-senpai in motion. Following the sound of the wind-slash, a loud striking sound echoed out[Bachii!]. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It hurts!? P-please forgive me&#8230;&#8230; Yu, Yui-sama”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amemiya-senpai tearfully begs for forgiveness. But Yui raises the whip again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is still hesitation in your voice, isn&#8217;t there?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bish!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">　a sharper sound than before.[Gyaaaaaaaaaaa!!!]. Amemiya-senpai screamed and fell back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s only two whips. I don&#8217;t know if you can take another ninety-eight whips like that..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t! I can&#8217;t! Please forgive me, Yui-sama!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time Amemiya-senpai utters the word [Yui-sama], Yui-chan shudders a little. She is somewhat unable to suppress her excitement. She looks like that. She is Zokuzoku. Maybe she feels like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thrilled]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“More, more, more!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bishy, bishy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and the sound of a heavy whip with force. [Gyaaaaah!] and Amemiya-senpai&#8217;s beastly scream echoes through the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I somehow counted the number of whips,around the thirty-round mark, Yui-chan grabbed Amemiya-senpai by the hair, whose face was messed up with tears and drool and made her look up, then twisted her mouth into a shape like the moon on the lower sine, and whispered to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lick my shoes.”</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/p250-697x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no way&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lick them!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gyaaaaaaaaahh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan whipped her face sideways, it was painful. After further whipping Amemiya-senpai&#8217;s back, which was flailing about and she was out of breath, Yui-chan further pressed her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu&#8230;&#8230;u&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her shoes are held up in front of the kneeling Amemiya-senpai. Fluttering and weeping, senpai runs her tongue over Yui-chan&#8217;s boots.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How is it, is it good?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mwuchu…delici–reefu”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Is that so, don&#8217;t be shy, lick it more. But that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230; weird. Your face says it doesn&#8217;t look tasty at all. Why don&#8217;t you lick it like you&#8217;re happy?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He,Ehehe…..rerou…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With tears spilling from the corners of her eyes, Amemiya-senpai forced a smile.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think this is a terrible thing to do. But I have no reason or obligation to stop Yui-chan. It&#8217;s not like I was on particularly good terms with Amemiya-senpai. The only thing is, if Amemiya-senpai was one of the four, she would have come forward long ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui caressed the head of Amemiya-senpai, who was continuing to lick her shoes, and whispered to her in a gentle voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Obedient children are so cute. I would like to reduce the whipping, but I have to whip someone to complete the hundred whips. What shall I do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Amemiya-senpai raised her voice as if clinging to Yui-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-please listen! Omuta and Koike were talking badly about Yui-sama! They were calling Yui-sama a hungry bitch and a spoiled brat! Please whip them!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hee&#8230;..is that so? I wouldn’t know if you didn&#8217;t say that&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Yui-chan glared at Omuta-san and Koike-san, who are both first-year students, and they hurriedly shouted at Amemiya-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You made me say it!&#8230;. Kayama-san, that&#8217;s not true! I just went along with her because she said bad things about Kayama-san. We&#8217;re juniors, we can&#8217;t go against our seniors!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes! The one who is at fault is Amemiya-senpai! That person! That person!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a hurry, Amemiya-senpai raises her voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re right, it wasn&#8217;t you who was bad-mouthing her until the very end, Koike! That&#8217;s right! You were the one who said you were going to call the police”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Yui-chan&#8217;s eyes twitched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh&#8230;..it was you, wasn&#8217;t it? Koike”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blood quickly drained from Koike&#8217;s face. Yui-chan turned towards the silver-haired maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Freesia-sama, how much have I whipped~?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thirty-nine”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re lucky, Amemiya. I&#8217;ll forgive you for one more whip today. Then, I&#8217;ll give the rest to Koike and Omuta. In exchange, you will thank me in a loud voice and say, 『Thank you very much, Yui-sama』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tha,thank you very much&#8230;&#8230;nhiiii!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the last whip, Yui-chan turned to Koike and Omuta, without looking back at Amemiya-senpai, who had fallen down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, thanks for waiting. It&#8217;s your turn now”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiii&#8230; Noooo. I&#8217;m not at fault, it&#8217;s Amemiya who&#8217;s at fault!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re so noisy!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan raises the whip. From there, they were perilously beaten. The girls kept cursing Amemiya-senpai, not Yui-chan, while being whipped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I can&#8217;t just watch them forever either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Yui-chan whipping them, I turn to the other first-year students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, the girls look frightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-Moribe-san, we&#8217;re friends, aren&#8217;t we? You see, the second year were always yelling at you, right? Let&#8217;s beat up Amemiya-senpai and Adachi-senpai, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I think about it, you never whip Ota. It&#8217;s favouritism, favouritism, hey, let&#8217;s whip Ota-senpai”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hotta-san and Mako-san insisted, shaking their faces from side to side, and every time they mentioned someone&#8217;s name, the other side yelled out. Ugly. Really ugly. If I were in their shoes, would I do and say the same thing? Yes, I would probably say it. I am weak. I know I am weak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hey, please say something, umm&#8230;&#8230; Moribe&#8230;&#8230;-sama”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They finally called me 『sama』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m not as gutsy or smart as Shima-senpai or Yui-chan. Today, I have decided not to speak at all. I think it&#8217;s the only way to avoid making mistakes. I would like to question Captain about what happened, but if I show any weakness, I will definitely fail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about this, I heard a voice calling me from around where the second-year students were gathered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Moribe.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned my eyes towards the owner of the voice, there she was, Shiratori-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression was as pouty as ever, as if she was in a bad mood. Although I had said that it was just her eyesight that was bad, I could only assume that she was trying to pick a fight with me as she stared at me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I have to ignore&#8230;&#8230;her, she&#8217;s the person I shouldn&#8217;t deal with&#8230;&#8230;Shiratori-senpai.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am not a person who can compete with her when I exchange words with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned away, Shiratori-senpai raised her voice as if making fun of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You didn&#8217;t even reply, you have no sense of manners at all. I thought you were relatively better than them&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don&#8217;t be provoked. Ignore, ignore’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I didn&#8217;t answer anything, Shiratori-senpai spun more words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230; that&#8217;s fine. Hey, Moribe. I&#8217;ve already figured out who the four people you&#8217;re looking for are”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily raised my voice and hurriedly covered my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don&#8217;t worry. I didn&#8217;t answer her question’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking around, there was a sense of agitation amongst the club members at the comment from Shiratori-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha. Unlike Kayama, you&#8217;re not the type of person who enjoys hitting people. You&#8217;re taking it pretty hard, aren&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.I wonder what she&#8217;s up to’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My alertness is maxed out. Maybe I&#8217;m being bargained with. I will never open my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, I can make this easier on you. I can pull the four of them out and end this mess now but I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen after that, though&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Shiratori-senpai looked at me and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So…. you, swap places with me”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gulped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How did she know there was a swap?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked back at her with wide eyes, and Shiratori-senpai&#8217;s mouth twisted into a grin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I knew it. And now I&#8217;m convinced. There are conditions under which your position and ours can be swapped. Well, I&#8217;m pretty sure I know what those conditions are, judging by your attitude”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, I think I understand how dangerous she is. No, don&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t deal with her. Anyway, I have to get out of here as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my head towards the first-year students. Then I swung the whip down on Kishiro-san, who was closest to me.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takehiko-san, have some tea.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, thank you. Ryoko-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the morning meeting, Inspector Nakamura is looking over documents in the temporarily set up investigation headquarters on the third floor of the station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the investigators have gone out and it is just me and the inspector in the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am supposed to be a liaison officer with the head of the department, but I guess he simply wants to keep me close. The nature of the work is that of a secretary at best and a servant at worst.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I met Master, I think I would have been buoyed by this situation of being with my fiancée all the time, but now it&#8217;s just a nuisance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It helps that he is not a tramp who likes to flirt in the station, though&#8230;..’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost at the same time as Inspector Nakamura was sipping his tea, papers in hand, there was a knock at the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost as soon as he replies, the door opens and Inomoto-senpai enters the room. He walks straight up to Inspector Nakamura&#8217;s desk and opens his mouth in a formal manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hon buchou, I have a report to make.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Chief Superintendent]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nakamura threw his papers on the desk and relaxed his shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oioi, Inomoto. When there&#8217;s no one else around, it&#8217;s business as usual. We&#8217;re in the same class, you know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if you say so&#8230;..well, I&#8217;ll take your word for it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inomoto-senpai glanced towards me and scratched his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what&#8217;s the matter?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I was washing up along the lines of who can lead the members of the track and field club to the forest path,then, a somewhat worrying backstory has emerged with the track and field club advisor.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the worrying backstory&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hear that advisor is a rather famous coach in the world of athletics, but his personal life is in shambles. The family is in debt and has split up. His daughter is in the soap trade.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. The moneylenders must be in bed with the continental mafia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, the moneylenders aren&#8217;t much of a problem. The Marzie gang is behind it, but I can&#8217;t find anything definite wrong with them.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then what&#8217;s the problem?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s the cause of the debt. I can only wonder how he managed to spend that much money, but it seems that the debt, which reached tens of millions, was all the result of her daughter&#8217;s infatuation with a host and the tribute she paid. The host club manager is&#8230;&#8230;Anna Kamishima. She&#8217;s the sister of Teruya, a member of the track team.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Her name was mentioned during the questioning, wasn&#8217;t it? Anna Kamishima also has a criminal record for pimping and extortion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I interrupted, Inomoto-senpai nodded silently. On the other hand, for some reason, Inspector Nakamura&#8217;s expression changed to a stern one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The adviser, who was in debt, had the club members led away by the adviser, although this is only a theory. If we think that they were taken out of the forest road to the national highway, put in a car and handed over to, say, continental people, then it is quite possible that the culprit is Anna Kamishima, or rather the Kamijima clan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inomoto-senpai was a little excited. However, Inspector Nakamura looked at him coldly and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rejected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah! Why? It makes sense!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn&#8217;t make sense, Inomoto. I told you at the time of setting up the HQ, the Kamishima clan has no interest in abducting 18 schoolgirls in such a risky way. It&#8217;s not their MO to attract public attention, is it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If we take them to jail, maybe we&#8217;ll find something worthwhile to do!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be ridiculous. It&#8217;s different from the past. If we do it, we&#8217;ll immediately become a target for the human rights organisations and the media”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Inspector Nakamura showed an uncharacteristically emotional attitude, Inomoto-senpai and I involuntarily looked at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to get away from this place. With that single-minded determination, I cracked the whip. I was selfless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was swinging the whip, Shiratori-senpai seemed to be talking to me about something, but I somehow managed to ignore that by focusing my attention on the classmates writhing in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mako, Hotta-san, Saito-san, Kishijo-san, Sato-san, and Ota-senpai&#8217;s younger sister. Without thinking at all about who and how many times, I just hit the girls I saw. Once I stop whipping, it takes courage to start again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I whip with all my heart, the screams and the sound of the whip are only recognised as 『sound』, and their meaning disappears. My gestalt collapses and I find myself not knowing who is who very well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hands get tired, my shoulders ache, it becomes harder and harder to change the person I am striking, and I endlessly strike the one person in front of me, in a workmanlike manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was when the Captain jumped in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait! Moribe! Wait! If you do any more, Saito will die!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I nearly whipped the captain, I came to my senses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realised that Saito-san was lying limp in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was breathing on my shoulders and the faces of frightened, worm-swollen first-year students. The haggard-looking Captain looked at me with reproachful eyes.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, Haa&#8230; Freesia-sama. H-how many more times do I have to whip&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have already exceeded one hundred fourteen times”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan is already nowhere to be seen in the menagerie. I was afraid to look back at the club members, so I ran out of the breeding ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I went out into the corridor, Shima-senpai and Takasago-senpai were just walking towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “Senpai!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai smiled with a toothy grin. I felt a little relieved when I saw her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Watch out, senpai, watch out for Shiratori-senpai! She&#8217;s bargaining something with me just now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bargaining?  I see&#8230;..she&#8217;s a bit more motivated now, isn&#8217;t she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Shima-senpai forcibly pulled Takasago-senpai into the breeding area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I returned to the room I had been given&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230; ah, yes, that’s better&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan was lying on the bed, running her fingers over her bare breasts and crotch. She was comforting herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After some awkward silence, we bowed awkwardly to each other on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The thought of having Amemiya lick my shoes got me so excited&#8230;..I&#8217;ve never felt like this before. No, I don&#8217;t always have the chance to do disgusting things!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought she had opened her mouth teasingly, Yui suddenly asked me such a question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Steady gentleman?　You mean boyfriends? No, I don&#8217;t have one!　I don&#8217;t have a boyfriend. I&#8217;ve never had a boyfriend like that!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No boyfriend = age, yes’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about you, Yui-chan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of rich people. It&#8217;s an enviable thing for a passive person to have their parents take care of their marriage partner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, I don&#8217;t know if I should say who I like but&#8230;&#8230;do you have a guy you’re thinking about, Moribe-san?”</span></p>

He&#8217;s not the coolest guy, but he&#8217;s kind, and when we were in elementary school, he took my hand and took me to school with him, which&#8230;&#8230;was my first love.
