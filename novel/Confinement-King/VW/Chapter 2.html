<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Falling In-Love eith Mai Fujiwara</h3>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Intuition is also Surprisingly Sharp.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the afternoon I headed off to school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, it was for a police interview.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, Ryoko&#8217;s report made the situation clear. Thanks to her, I was able to take steps in advance to avoid the most unwelcome part &#8211; the reason why I am standing infront of the school. So there&#8217;s nothing to be nervous about.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I don&#8217;t have to&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe&#8230;.. this is already a date, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s not! I mean, why are you following me &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, the young lady version of Fujiwara-san was walking next to me, clinging to my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because, you know, an interview doesn&#8217;t have to take hours, does it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s true, but&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then we&#8217;ll just go on a date afterwards.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll be going home after this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I&#8217;ll go back to your place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please go back to your own house.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While we were having this exchange, we arrived at the school. The usual guard,that old man, was not there, and there was a policeman at the school gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told them that I have been summoned by Detective Terashima, the officer exchanged radio messages with someone and then opened the service entrance for us, saying that we should head for the headmaster&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we arrived at the entrance, two other policemen were waiting for us there. I was then led to the headmaster&#8217;s office, and Fujiwara-san was led separately, saying, [escort, this way].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we parted, she said, [Fu–min! Come home soon!] I dodge a kiss from Fujiwara-san and follow the policeman to the headmaster&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way, I passed Teruya-san in the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was probably being interviewed as well. However, we didn&#8217;t exchange any words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Teruya-san just glanced at me with a suspicious looking look in her eyes and probably in her mind saying,[Why is this guy here?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We haven&#8217;t even exchanged a few words in the classroom despite our seats being very close but our relationship is light-years away.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stepped into the headmaster&#8217;s office, I found a handsome uncle with silver-rimmed glasses and Ryoko on the sofa,and the headmaster sitting at the desk in the back, as he had done during past interviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: It’s Ikemen Ojisan hence handsome uncle]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When prompted to sit down on the sofa, the handsome uncle opens his mouth with a fake smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to have bothered you today. Did you have any plans for the afternoon?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I had a date with my girlfriend&#8230;&#8230;.Well, she came with me as an escort, so we&#8217;ll go for a walk in the park afterwards.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little vain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Well, I don&#8217;t want to make her wait, so I&#8217;d like to move on to a quick question&#8230;&#8230; It was after school the day before yesterday, right after sixth period. Were you around the girls&#8217; club building?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I was there, but&#8230;..why?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I make a surprised face and pretend to be puzzled, just as I had practised beforehand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Some people said they saw you there. This was before and after the women&#8217;s track team went missing&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had nothing to do with that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. Then what were you doing there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I faked a grunt and glanced towards the headmaster. I saw Ryoko give a small nod. Apparently, she had guessed my intentions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Headmaster, may I ask you to leave your seat for a moment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eee&#8230;&#8230;Yes, I understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoko urged the headmaster to leave his seat with an air of reluctance. After watching the door close, I dared to open my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;..actually, I had a bit of a bad lunch break&#8230;that’s why I took off during the fifth period but I was getting more and more pissed off&#8230;&#8230;so I skipped sixth period and went to the back of the old school building to sit in the sun.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sunbathing&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. So I&#8230;&#8230;was out and the next thing I knew it was the end of sixth period and everyone was starting to leave the school. I was skipping class, so I thought it would be awkward if my classmates found out&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I decided to go home through a hidden passageway&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hidden passage?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, we just call it that. The fence behind the girls&#8217; club building comes off if you lift it up a bit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the handsome uncle&#8217;s eyebrows raised.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked at the uniformed officer behind me and gave some kind of signal. I felt the door open and the footsteps moved away. He probably went to check the fence behind the club building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ground is surrounded by a high fence several metres high to keep the ball from flying out. On the other side of the fence is a forest path.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day before yesterday, when I captured the girls’ female track and field member, I actually went out onto the forest path from behind the club building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they examine it closely, they might find my footprints. However, I did not remove the fence at that time. I used a 『passage』 to get to the forest road.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After receiving Ryoko&#8217;s report, I asked Lili to take steps beforehand. I asked her to make it so that the fence would really come off. In addition, I asked her to dump one of the captured land crew members&#8217; student notebooks in the woods in order to disrupt the investigation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230; skipping school is it? It would certainly be difficult to say in the presence of the headteacher. I understand what you said, but I&#8217;m not impressed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The good-looking man looked appalled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;&#8230;I’m sorry.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, did you see anything unusual there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anything unusual? Er, &#8230;&#8230;nothing in particular that I can think of&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The handsome uncle glances down at his watch. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And&#8230;&#8230;you said earlier that you skipped school because you were sick of it, but you didn&#8217;t leave right away. You said that you were sunbathing in the old school building, but why didn&#8217;t you leave right away?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, this handsome uncle is very different from Detective Inomoto. What I was able to pick up on was the part of my answer that was 100 per cent false. He must be really good at it, to notice the unnaturalness of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I desperately try to turn my thoughts around. However, I felt that it was not a good idea to pile on the lies. Not all human behaviour can be explained by logic. I felt that it would be more unnatural to give a reason for this behaviour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, oh&#8230;&#8230; yeah, why not? &#8230;&#8230; yeah, sort of.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The handsome uncle is observing me closely. I can see that. Next to him, Ryoko was baring her displeasure and wrinkling her brow. She seems to think that the uncle&#8217;s comments towards me are unforgivable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230;By the way, is your girlfriend from this school?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, ah &#8230;&#8230; yes, she&#8217;s a girl in my class.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;.. actually. I&#8217;m going to get married soon too. I&#8217;m getting married soon, to Ryoko Terashima here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He, hey, inspector! What are you doing all of a sudden?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, yes! Co,Congratulations!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, thank you.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What? What is this uncle trying to say? Is he playing some kind of trick on me?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was unintentionally alarmed. At the same time, thinking that this is Ryoko&#8217;s fiancée, I feel a little sorry. Because she already belongs to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Kijima-kun. What is your girlfriend like”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Um&#8230;.. sorry. Does that have anything to do with it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, just making small talk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, ha&#8230;&#8230; right. At first I was fed up with being followed around, but then I kind of&#8230;&#8230;couldn&#8217;t leave her alone&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hou, so she confessed her feelings to you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heeee……”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don&#8217;t look so surprised there! I know it&#8217;s unexpected!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, there was a hurried knock at the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Excuse me!] says a uniformed police officer who enters, whispering in the ear of the handsome uncle. Immediately, his colour changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kijima-kun!　I heard that your girlfriend has collapsed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eehh?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First aid has been given and she&#8217;s resting in the infirmary, so please go to her as soon as possible.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After parting with Fu–min, I was shown by the officer to the counselling room next to the staff room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it is a school facility, I have never been in this room before. Normally, the school counsellor uses this room for counselling but it seems to be used as a temporary waiting room at the moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please wait here if you are an escort.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay~!! Thanks~!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thanked the officer and entered the room, it was a very small room. There was a sofa set for six people in a space about the same size as a chemistry lab preparation room, and there was one other person on the sofa at the back of the room.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘uwa, a very fancy lady. &#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hair was dyed platinum gold, almost white, and curled up in a bun with so much volume that it looked like she was wearing a lot of clothes. She is wearing an open-necked one-piece dress that is open all the way down to her shoulders. It has a sexy silhouette that seems to stick snugly to the body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By all appearances, she was like a hostess who is about to go to work. The way she floated away from the surrounding landscape was unbelievable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the moment the woman looked up from the phone in her hand──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiiiiiii!!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gulped unintentionally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;.. it&#8217;s been a while, Koganei.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a grin, the woman&#8217;s mouth twists into the shape of a crescent moon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, how badly I have been treated by this person with this smile&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Ah, An,Anna–na&#8230;&#8230;senpai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna Teruya senpai. She is the one who bullied,tormented and even made me do prostitution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why&#8230;&#8230;here &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Annn? Why, I&#8217;m escorting Hikari-chan. I promised to take her out for a nice meal, so it was just a side trip. But still, you&#8217;ve changed a lot, you seem to be in a good mood. Koganei&#8230;&#8230;or is it Fujiwara now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was aghast. My knees began to wobble and shake.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aa, she knows my new surname too….there&#8217;s no escape after all&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I thought that, my heart jumped. It was an unpleasant feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, Haa, Haa&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are~? What&#8217;s wrong with you? You look pale, “Ko・Ga・Ne・I”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t calm myself down. My breath, I can&#8217;t breathe. I can&#8217;t stop shaking. As I unexpectedly fall to my knees,  A policeman in a panic looks into my face[What&#8217;s wrong? Are you alright?]</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Help me, I&#8217;m in trouble, I&#8217;m being eaten, I&#8217;m scared, I&#8217;m scared, I&#8217;m scared.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I scream in my mind, but not in my voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, Haa, Haa,Haa&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey!! are you alright!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw the surprised look on the officer&#8217;s face and with his eyes wide open. After that, it was as if the TV had been switched off, and everything went black.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the place of Master who hurriedly ran out of the principal&#8217;s office, the uniformed policeman who went to check the fence at the back of the school came back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed, in one place, the fence had been removed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230;Then, please allocate an investigator to check it thoroughly. Oh, right. Please ask Detective Inomoto to take charge”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, sir!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the uniformed officer left, Inspector Nakamura turned his head toward me and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was an unexpected harvest, wasn&#8217;t it? If it is possible to go out of the school directly from the back of the club building, it will be a very different story.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye, yeah&#8230;&#8230;.I suppose so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? What&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm&#8230;&#8230; Takehiko-san. Why did you tell him &#8230;&#8230; that we were getting married?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Was it abrupt?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it was&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;..At first I was going to hold out for time until I finished checking the fence. I couldn&#8217;t help but think he was looking at Ryoko-san in a disgusting way. Well, think of it as a kind of childish jealousy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mouu&#8230;..Takehiko-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my cheek on his shoulder, pretending to be embarrassed. In fact, I feel like I&#8217;ve humiliated myself in front of master and my gut is boiling, but this is also for master&#8217;s sake. I guess that&#8217;s what I have to put up with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inspector Nakamura turned a satisfied eye towards me, then squinted and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“However, he should probably be watched for a while longer. He looks like a typical bullied person, with an odd air of confidence peeking through from time to time. He doesn&#8217;t seem like the type you see very often.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That, oddly enough, was the same impression I had given Inomoto-senpai when I first met Master.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this point, I had no way of knowing this, but at exactly the same time that Kimojima and Mai stepped into the school for questioning, I let out a deep sigh at the reflection of myself in the show window.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much of a disguise I use, this is terrible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sunglasses like the compound eyes of a dragonfly. A light blue medical mask and a baseball cap of a local team. To top it all off, Kyoko found a ridiculously tacky tour T-shirt of a Western death metal band in her closet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Nee-chan, you have unexpected taste in musicー』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko-san laughed when she said that, but it is an unbelievable object to belong to that cool Ryoko-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An illustration of a muscular, upper-body naked man raising a hammer above a pile of corpses. If you look at it favourably, it does resemble Rubens&#8217;s painting of 『The Resurrection of Christ』. Only the macho part, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bottom is a pair of black skinny jeans borrowed from Kyoko. That&#8217;s okay, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about the shoes, so they are loafers that I wore to match my uniform, which is also tacky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a reader model, I wanted to say,『Kill me already!』 because it&#8217;s so hopelessly lame.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought the world was really crazy because I would get into a situation where I had to dress like this just to see my boyfriend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I arrived at the meeting place while avoiding being seen, Jun-kun was already there looking at his phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as he saw me, he made a face as if he was shocked. Then he gave a mending smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, &#8230;&#8230;, you know, it looks good on you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. you don&#8217;t have to. I had no choice but to wear this as a disguise. I know it&#8217;s lame&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, this 『looks good on you』 is not a compliment.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I lowered my mask and pouted my lips, Jun-kun smiled bitterly and changed the subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, where should we go? We can go to a cafe or an arcade&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m dressed like this, and I don&#8217;t want the press to find me, so we&#8217;ve got to find a place&#8230;.where I can be out of the public eye.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So&#8230;.then, you know, that&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through his sunglasses, I could see his expression, as if he were stiff and stifled with excitement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is exactly what Kyoko said.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I knew Jun-kun would make a face like that too&#8230;. Aree? Jun-kun too? What do I mean by 『too』?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not disappointed by this, but I think&#8230;..boys are like that, after all. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m not annoyed by the way they keep moping around with a look on their face like they don&#8217;t want to be disliked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, what I want is Jun-kun&#8217;s shirt. So, I grabbed the cuff of his shirt and whispered to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wherever Jun-kun wants to go, I&#8217;m fine&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, Jun-kun pulled me by the hand and we entered a hotel called La Vian Rose behind the station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that there was a hotel here, but it was the first time for me and him to go to a love hotel and we were both a bit confused when we chose our rooms from the panel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we somehow arrived at the room, we both let out a big sigh, as if we had finished a job at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;&#8230; that was nerve-wracking&#8230;..”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“True&#8230;..but somehow, I feel tired.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I took off my mask, hat and sunglasses and sat down on the bed next to him. Jun-kun looked into my face and smiled. I thought again that I wanted to see this smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wanted to see you. I was really worried about you, you know. I&#8217;m really glad that you came back safely”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t remember anything about the time I was missing. I told Jun-kun that too. Or rather, that&#8217;s all I can say. I remember some things, but I can&#8217;t say them out loud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this is how I came back. I came back to Jun-kun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was embraced by someone other than Jun-kun. That is an undeniable fact but since I don&#8217;t even know who the other person is, it&#8217;s like an accident and it&#8217;s silly to even worry about it. The relationship that was temporarily interrupted will be spun back together again and I will start all over again as Jun&#8217;s girlfriend, just like before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I closed my eyes, Jun-kun quietly put his lips on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A long  deep kiss. But his tongue doesn&#8217;t enter at all. Is this a sudden play to rush me? Unable to resist, I put my hands around his neck and inserted my tongue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mugo?!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard Jun-kun&#8217;s surprised voice. But I can&#8217;t stop anymore. Because I love it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lick his mouth, gums and tongue with love. Eventually, our lips parted and a white thread was drawn between our lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;&#8230; haa&#8230;&#8230; Misuzu, what&#8217;s wrong? You&#8217;re soooo intense.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jun-kun&#8217;s eyes looked as if they were meltingly prodigal. At the same time, he seemed to be pulling back slightly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘A…Aree?? I&#8217;ve never kissed Jun-kun with my tongue in it, have I?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-is that so&#8230;&#8230;? But the thought of being with Jun-kun for the first time in a long time made me &#8230;&#8230; happy”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I mentioned this, he smiled happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I love you, Misuzu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yaaaan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He pushes me down on the bed, rolls up my T-shirt and touches my breasts over my bra.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jun-kun has very gentle hands. Yes, it was. It was like this on that first day, too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, I&#8217;m glad I refused Kyoko-san&#8217;s recommendation of the egregious underwear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Hyohー! Nee-chan, you&#8217;ve got some amazing stuff!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What Kyoko-san showed me with a big smile on her face, a black see-through. It was such a substitute that nothing could be hidden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He&#8217;s already a bit drawn in by the kiss earlier. If I had worn that thing, I don&#8217;t know if he would have been surprised seeing me donning it. I really have to be careful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, today is the second time that I and Jun-kun have had sex. But I’ve already had a lot of experience. If I show him that I&#8217;m used to it, even Jun-kun won&#8217;t be able to help but be suspicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not saying I’m innocent but even though I was able to come back, if my relationship with Jun is strained, I can&#8217;t see myself getting along with Jun-kun.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It may be frustrating&#8230;.even so&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jun-kun is still rubbing my covered breasts. It&#8217;s not that it doesn&#8217;t feel good at all but it&#8217;s not so much that I can&#8217;t hold back my voice.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Was it like this the first time we had sex?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, I was so embarrassed and ashamed that I covered my face with my hands all the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just accepted what Jun-kun was doing as he was doing it and when it came time to insert it, it was painful and it was hard to insert it and I remember it took a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was thinking about this, Jun-kun&#8217;s hand suddenly stopped.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I take it off?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“eh…yes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My T-shirt was easily taken off but the skinny jeans were apparently difficult to take off.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I wondered if I should have taken them off first. However, if I do that, I feel like he might be reluctant.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I felt frustrated that he kept failing to unbutton my jeans, so I finally said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jun-kun, wait a minute, I&#8217;m going to&#8230;..take them off.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooou&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I get off the bed, take off my jeans and lie down next to him again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know. I feel a little awkward. As if to cover up the awkwardness, Jun-kun kissed me softly and began to rub my breasts again from the top of my bra.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ah, what’s this? He still hasn&#8217;t moved on&#8230;..? It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t feel it, but&#8230; isn&#8217;t it a little too long? I think there&#8217;s a limit to how long I can play along with my impatience growing&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After another five minutes from there, Jun-kun finally pushes up my bra.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not long before I exhaled with relief. Jun-kun suddenly pressed his thumb on my nipple.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No, even if he presses it like a button&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be so much easier if it was designed so that if he pressed the button, I&#8217;d cum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After rolling my nipple a little with his fingertips, he asked again.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I lick it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Su,sure…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When my nipple is rolled in the mouth, the rough feel of the tip of his tongue is still pleasant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, anh, anh&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When my voice begins to leak out, Jun-kun becomes excited and begins to rub my breasts a little harder with my nipples in his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it also took him longer. So much so that my nipples hurt with saliva, all the way through it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;No, no, don&#8217;t get frustrated. This is only your second time, Jun-kun. This is the kind of thing you get better at over time.’</span></i></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And finally, or probably finally&#8230;&#8230;Jun-kun&#8217;s fingertips touch my crotch. Of course, he still starts by caressing my underwear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be unbearable if he continued kneading over my underwear for another ten or twenty minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I love Jun-kun.But this is a different matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Jun-kun&#8230;..I ・am ・wet♡”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I whisper this in her ear and cover my face in embarrassment. Even I can give an act like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oo,Ouuu…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jun-kun looks a little excited at my beloved&#8217;s pleas and hurriedly pulls down my underwear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuhaaaa…..!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he exhaled excitedly, he pressed my clitoris with his fingertips. Like a button.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why! Nothing is gonna go out!!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is it? Is there a misconception that if a man presses on the protruding part, it will make a woman feel better?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I could press on my clitoris and a beam would come out of my eyes, I would feel good all the way around, but in a different way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about this, Jun-kun traced around my labia and inserted the tip of his finger into my vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa..ahnnnmm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can feel his finger inside it. But he withdrew his finger when he had inserted it up to the first joint and smiled happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu&#8230;&#8230;is already very wet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s happy. But&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s a little complicated. It&#8217;s not so much that I feel it, but that the result of being rushed. Well&#8230; if I&#8217;ve been&#8230;&#8230;rushed like that, I&#8217;m going to get wet naturally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. I can&#8217;t take it anymore, can I put it in?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Eee────! Wait a minute! Isn&#8217;t the pacing wrong?　Aren&#8217;t you too focused on my breasts? Or rather, haven&#8217;t you only touched her breasts?’ </span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that&#8230;&#8230; but of course I couldn&#8217;t say it out loud. I can&#8217;t be drawn any further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;uun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a small nod, he raises himself up and stares at my crotch.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Eh? Wa,wait a minute!! This is too embarrassing! 　It&#8217;s a shame to come here and start the shame play.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I involuntarily covered my face with my hands in embarrassment, I heard him mutter, [Well, here we are, aren&#8217;t we?].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was a shame play, but I didn&#8217;t think it was just confirmation. Then, after some kind of fumbling movement, the tip of his penis touches a slightly misplaced place.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘N–no, not there, just a little lower, just a little lower. It&#8217;s too close! Not that hole!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, I felt a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">nyunrun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and his cock finally entered my vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anh&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An unintentional voice leaked out. I felt a tingle in the pit of my stomach at the long-awaited sensation.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yes, yes! This feeling! This ‘nyurun’ feeling feels so good!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu, are you alright? Does it hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-uh, don’t worry &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t blame him for being worried. Because the first time I did it, it already hurt so much that I cried raggedly. I remember now, it hurt so much that I honestly thought I was lucky that Jun-kun came so quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then&#8230;..can I start the move?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jun-kun begins to move his hips awkwardly and I tilt my head involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hmm? Let&#8217;s see&#8230;..his cock&#8230;&#8230;is inside?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can feel it rubbing around the entrance area but it doesn&#8217;t hit anything pleasant at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuu! That&#8217;s amazing, it&#8217;s so tight inside Misuzu&#8217;s vagina&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeee&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It doesn&#8217;t look any better &#8230;&#8230; maybe Atashi &#8230;&#8230; is not feeling well?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Jun-kun, go deeper, please”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye,yeah..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I begged him despite it being just an act and he seemed very happy and started to move his hips violently. But it didn&#8217;t make much difference.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Really, what&#8217;s wrong with me&#8230;..?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu, does it feel good?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Umm, yes&#8230;&#8230; it feels good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I&#8217;m already feeling too good, I&#8217;m cuming!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eee?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, there was a sensation of a cock jiggling and quivering in my vagina. Immediately afterwards, a warm sensation slowly spread to my lower abdomen.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘W-what? Why? Even though he let it out inside&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have that good feeling. I only feel a lukewarm, unsatisfying sensation.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Could it be that I&#8217;ve become insensitive?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuu&#8230;&#8230; Misuzu, it felt really good…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm, yes. I also&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smile back at Jun-kun, who smiles with satisfaction, while being inwardly upset. Then, looking at the cock being slowly pulled out, I realised something I shouldn&#8217;t have.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What&#8230;&#8230;? It&#8217;s small&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looked one size smaller than the one in my memory.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘W,what am I thinking! It doesn&#8217;t matter how big or small it is!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I desperately tell myself otherwise, Jun-kun lies down next to me with a look of accomplishment on his face, saying, [Fuuuuu&#8230;..]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu&#8230;&#8230; is the best, it felt so good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,yeah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While nodding back at him as he hugged me, I gently stole another look at Jun-kun&#8217;s cock.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I knew it was small&#8230;.but I had a feeling it was bigger when I first started..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about it properly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Maybe the size of a penis changes depending on how good he feels? Maybe I didn&#8217;t do anything earlier, that’s why Jun-kun didn&#8217;t get a full erection. Yes, I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s right. If I lick it, it will get bigger’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, I raised myself up and put my face close to Jun-kun&#8217;s penis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wai, Misuzu, w,what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He sounds surprised. But I don&#8217;t have time to worry about holding back or anything like that anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve been studying in a book for the next time I have sex with Jun-kun&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mi-Misuzu!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I twisted around, clucked and took his thing in his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I sucked it up, the taste of semen left in the urethra spread into my mouth.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Delicious but &#8230;&#8230;it’s a bit thin&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing sucking up his cock,I immediately started handling and squeezing it with my lips.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Jupup, Jupup, Rerororororor, Jupup.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I licked up the wilting cock and rubbed it desperately with my lips. The feeling of hardness gradually increases. The cock gradually gets bigger and bigger in my mouth.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It feels good,more like this, moreee!!!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait,too much, that&#8217;s too intense! Misuzu! If you do it to me like that&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While listening to Jun-kun&#8217;s impatient voice, I continued to handle and squeeze him further,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Gugu!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">　I felt a big swelling sensation.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yayー! It got a bit bigger again!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, at the moment when I was celebrating in my chest, Jun-kun let out a moaning voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Pyu!  Bururu&#8230;</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling of raw, warm liquid flooding the back of the throat. The taste of semen again spreads in my mouth.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I can’t believe it….you just ejacualte?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised, but it didn&#8217;t have that sobbing rush, the amount wasn&#8217;t too much and it tasted light. It was an easy-to-drink semen with a refreshing taste.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, the shrivelling penis makes me release from my mouth, while letting out a grief cry in the depths of my chest, [Aaaa&#8230;..].</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s small&#8230;&#8230; quick&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unintentionally dropped my shoulders,and Jun-kun smiled at me as if he was out of breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;&#8230; haa&#8230;&#8230; Misuzu, I didn&#8217;t expect you to suck me, so I cum right away.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aa, that’s true! It was like a surprise, so&#8230;&#8230;. Ehehe, right! Otherwise he wouldn&#8217;t have cum so quickly!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was convinced and a little relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did it feel good?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, it felt really good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;ll make you cum again soon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I put his cock in my mouth again, Jun-kun made a panicked noise.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait! Wait a minute!　Misuzu, you can&#8217;t do it that quickly!”</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It’s not over yet!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know who it was but I remember being held all night long. Even though it&#8217;s impossible to go that far, there&#8217;s no reason why it can&#8217;t be done once or twice.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I reached the infirmary, Fujiwara-san was lying on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She seems to have hyperventilated. She is stable now, but usually people will start to panic when they wake up, so please stay with her. If you are concerned, it might be better to take her to the hospital for a check-up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The policeman who seemed to have been accompanying me told me this and left the infirmary. I thanked her and saw her off, then sat down in the pipe chair by the bed and looked into Fujiwara-san&#8217;s sleeping face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a little pale but sleeping peacefully. I don&#8217;t really know what hyperventilation is but the way the policeman is talking now, it&#8217;s probably not something to worry about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After watching her for a while, Fujiwara-san opened her eyes with a small moan. At first, she looked as if she didn&#8217;t know what was going on. However, her eyes immediately became moist and she jerked herself up, clung to my neck and began to weep.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could not help but be perplexed by this. Is this the kind of panic the officer was talking about?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu,Fujiwara-san, what&#8217;s wrong? What happened?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m scared…Gusu…I&#8217;m scared…Gusu…I don&#8217;t want ….I don&#8217;t want to”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could tell by looking at her that she was seriously frightened. Her arms, which were clinging to me, were strong and tense. I hold her trembling body in my arms and stroke her head as if I were soothing a baby.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, alright, it&#8217;s going to be alright.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I continued to quieten her down, Fujiwara-san gradually regained her composure, although she was still hiccupping and shuffling. She somehow stopped crying, I looked into her face, smiling as best I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll ask you what happened when you calm down again. For now, I&#8217;ll walk you home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Fujiwara-san slowly started to tear up again and shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No! I don&#8217;t want to! Don&#8217;t leave me alone&#8230;..I&#8217;ll die if I leave Fu–min!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not what I said&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked puzzled, she looked up at me with eyes like an abandoned dog and pleadedly pleaded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ho, let&#8217;s go to the hotel! The La Vian Rose!　Please, all of it, I&#8217;ll give you all of it! Don&#8217;t leave me alone&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I came to the hotel behind the station &#8211; La Vian Rose since I was forced to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Together with Fujiwara-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way there, I tried to persuade her several times that I would take her home, but she stubbornly refused to accept my offer. On the other hand, when I tried to ask her what had happened, she shook herself in fright and clung to me tightly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if it was when I thought of her as a revenge partner or an unimportant woman but now, there is no way I could throw her out like this.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Embrace&#8230;..? Fujiwara-san in this state? Is that okay with her? Is that really what I want?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I choose a room on the panel with some hesitation, follow the arrows that light up and we start walking down the hotel corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We get on the lift in silence and press the flashing floor number button. Meanwhile, Fujiwara-san remained clinging tightly to my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I went down the elevator, I saw a room number flickering at the far end of the corridor. I might still be able to turn back here..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Fujiwara-san&#8230;..about this&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to her, she shook her head. The door to the room in front of ours with the lighted room number opened with a click.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu&#8230;&#8230; was soooo good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jun-kun smiled with deep emotion. But for me, who is looking at him in such a good mood, although he is a little tired, is feeling bewildered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu, you feel too good. I&#8217;ve never come like this before, and this is the best record I&#8217;ve ever set.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After getting ready and paying the bill at the cash machine next to the door, he jokingly said something like that, which made me feel gloomy.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yes it&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;.this is the best record&#8230;..it doesn&#8217;t get any better than this &#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t think about that. Sex is not everything. When I tried to think that way, Kyoko-san&#8217;s words crossed my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Women are selfish creatures, and in the end, they like men who can satisfy them.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Kyoko-san is right, will I stop liking Jun-kun?　I want to think that&#8217;s not true, but I&#8217;ve lost confidence in my ability to say so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, let&#8217;s leave.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following Jun-kun, I step out into the corridor with my head down. However, as soon as I stepped out, I&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geeeh&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jun-kun stopped, letting out such a voice, and I looked up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following his gaze, I look across the corridor and see a couple in a dimly lit corridor with indirect lighting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kimojima is the one who let out a dumb voice. And next to him was Mai, clinging to his arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly hid behind Jun-kun. It&#8217;s too embarrassing to face each other in a situation where it&#8217;s obvious that you&#8217;ve just had sex. I&#8217;m sure the other side would be the same way.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But, I see&#8230;.Mai and Kimojima are going to have sex from now on.’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I thought that&#8230;──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;m telling you, your penis is amazing! Fu-mio penis is so big! It&#8217;s like the best thing ever! Of course, it&#8217;s so good!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words that Mai had uttered on the rooftop were swirling around in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, my heart starts to pound and I feel my face heat up. As we pass each other without a word and pretend to not notice each other. I couldn&#8217;t help but notice the crotch area of Kimojima, and although there was no way I could tell the size of it from the top of his trousers, I couldn&#8217;t help but follow it with my eyes.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It looks good&#8230;.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I realised I was thinking like that, I shook my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu&#8230;&#8230; why was she dressed like that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as we entered the room, Fujiwara-san tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a disguise, isn&#8217;t it? Kurosawa-san is quite famous now&#8230;.and a lot of things are bad right now&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san, who passed by Kasuya-kun as if hiding behind him, was wearing a hat, sunglasses and a mask, a very extreme disguise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was trying to keep my composure in front of Fujiwara-san, but because I saw them eye to eye, my heart was surging to the extent that I was surprised at myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I think that my Kurosawa-san was held by that man, I almost vomit with displeasure. Even if that man was the original Kurosawa-san&#8217;s boyfriend.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll definitely take her back.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now is not the time to be obsessed with Kurosawa-san.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I push down my displeasure, which is in turmoil and smile at Fujiwara-san. My face that was about to change desperately relaxed, as if nothing had ever happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to take a shower&#8230;..first. I&#8217;ve been crying too much and my face is all messed up&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she entered the room, Fujiwara-san put her bag on the sofa and walked quickly towards the bathroom. She is somewhat restless, maybe she is nervous in her own way.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Now &#8230;&#8230; what to do, me’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of water was heard from the shower. If I look into the glass-walled bathroom, I can see her skin-coloured figure behind the steam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve seen Fujiwara-san naked, but I feel uncomfortable because I&#8217;ve completely skipped the steps that normal men and women would take to get here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of the faucet closing with a squeak echoed, and the sound of water turned into a faint drip of falling drops. A moment later, the door opens and she steps out towards me, wearing only a white bath towel wrapped around her.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look up at her nervously, sitting down on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at her like this, Fujiwara-san with no make-up on is still cute. She has untied golden hair, wheat-coloured skin and droopy eyes. The bridge of her nose is softly curved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her wheat-coloured skin, slightly reddish after bathing, was strangely fresh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know&#8230;.. Fujiwara-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai, call me that&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of my eyes, the bath towel falls easily to the floor. In the dim light of the indirect lighting, her naked body painted a glossy shade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Gorgeous] I thought. [I want to hold her]. That&#8217;s what I thought. She certainly didn&#8217;t have breasts but her puffy, cherry-red nipples were rather very attractive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when I see the look on her face, I am convinced. what I should do.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.What happened?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes slightly moisten at my question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A long silence. After a long, long silence, she opens her mouth, her shoulders shaking slightly.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/p093-697x1024.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anna-senpai was&#8230;..there, and just seeing her face made it hard for me to breathe and I lost consciousness. She said, 『It&#8217;s Fujiwara now, right?』 and now that she knows. There&#8217;s no escape&#8230;.I thought so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recall passing Teruya-san on my way to the headmaster&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I see, so she was to escort her sister? And Fujiwara-san went into the waiting room where she was waiting for me&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one could have predicted that Fujiwara-san would visit there as my escort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that doesn&#8217;t mean I can forgive her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made the girl I love look like this, so I&#8217;ll make sure she pays for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up and hugged Fujiwara-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am aware, of course, that she stiffened at the moment I reached out to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s okay&#8230;..don&#8217;t be frightened. You don&#8217;t need to be frightened.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at me with somewhat clinging eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hold me&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I said this, she blinked. And then a bead of tears appeared in the corner of her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I&#8217;m sorry. Gusu, yes&#8230;.that&#8217;s right. You mustn&#8217;t want to hug such a&#8230;..filthy girl”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My chest tightens as she tries to force a smile with a crying face. I put all my strength into my arms holding her and whisper into her ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not the time to hold you. Mai, the wounds you carry can&#8217;t be healed by being held, can they?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s fine. You don&#8217;t have to do that to try and hold me like this, I&#8217;m not going anywhere.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quietly take her lips. A gentle kiss, just lips touching each other. Then I lay my forehead on her forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will not stand in the same line as the men who played with your body.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear her gasp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know I don&#8217;t have the face for racy words. But I have to say it. But I have to tell her that it&#8217;s not the physical connection that&#8217;s going to save her now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m your boyfriend, and you&#8217;re my girlfriend, right? You were physically hurt and forced to become an adult. Then, Fujiwara-san&#8230;. Mai, let&#8217;s regain your time”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard a gurgling, sobbing sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m thrilled by every kiss, I&#8217;m happy just to be with you, we date all sorts of places, I get lonely on the way home, I&#8217;m happy and sad by every message&#8230;..let&#8217;s spend some time and take the proper steps between lovers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then looked at her and told her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no need to panic, Mai. I&#8217;m not going anywhere.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Fujiwara-san started crying like a child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears were falling in rags, and if I hadn&#8217;t supported her, she would have sat up straight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Messy, mangled and ragged, her heart is screaming. She is screaming in pain. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just kept hugging her for a long time, without any further words. In the end, she cried for an hour or so from there. She kept crying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu–min&#8230;&#8230;let’s go. I&#8217;m going to go wash my face. Right now, ah, I&#8217;m a very ugly girl.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, she laughed at that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she came back from the washroom, her eyelids were swollen and the area around her eyes was quite red. She is certainly a little bit uglier than usual. But her expression was very natural and cute. That&#8217;s what I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sits down next to me, naked, and smiles, showing her white teeth[nishish].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What is it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing&#8230;..my boyfriend likes me too much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t get carried away, small tits.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you do like her, don&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..No comment”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell me you like me”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she pokes the tip of my nose with her finger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;. are you sure? It&#8217;s almost like you have a disease, being in bed with a naked girl and not do it”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up, if I attack you here, I&#8217;ll ruin everything”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha….that’s true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I fall on my back and look up at the ceiling, Fujiwara-san lies down next to me and holds my hand, intertwining our fingers together, the so-called lover&#8217;s link.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though I&#8217;ve sucked your Ochinpo-chan, I&#8217;m barely at the starting line”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll make you suck me off so much in the future that you won&#8217;t want to anymore. ”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm&#8230;&#8230;that comment is exactly what I think is ruining it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment of silence. The ceiling I looked up at was mirrored, and in the mirror Fujiwara-san was staring at my profile with a happy expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Fumin. If Anna-senpai makes a move on me&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll protect you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, run away. Fu-min looks weak”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll manage it somehow”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then a giggle and her faint laugh sounded in my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8230; it was Fu-min who saved my life from Teruya-chan and Tachioka”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we fell asleep while holding hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How is it, Hikari? Is it good?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah. We don&#8217;t get to eat meat this thick in the dormitories.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ufufu, you can eat as much as you like.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the interview, I went shopping with Hikari-chan. I gave her a new pair of training shoes and then we drove an hour to a steakhouse in the suburbs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A renowned restaurant owned and chef-operated by a former head chef of a prestigious hotel. The restaurant is a safe place to use for entertainment when doing business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, Aneki, you didn&#8217;t have to come all the way here at a time like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not really involved in the disappearance of the track kids at all. It&#8217;s better to keep an open mind, so people don&#8217;t get suspicious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari then thrusts a fork with a meat stick in it in front of me, her lips pouting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if it&#8217;s not related, if they start looking into it and another case comes out, it&#8217;s just too much, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you, didn’t I? Even if they raided our house, they wouldn&#8217;t find anything. And if you know who the detective in charge is, there are plenty of ways to get around it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a guardian, I greeted the detective in charge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The head officer&#8217;s name is Nakamura. The female detective who was with him was Terashima. The female detective apparently seemed to know me and the whole time we were face to face, she was looking at me as if she was searching for something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s easier to take it up with a man, but if I go back to the gang office and have an informant check it out, he&#8217;ll probably find out something about this female detective as well. There is no one in the world without a guilty conscience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Aneki, do you know who kidnapped my club members?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have no idea. I checked with the continental mafia with whom I cooperate, but the reply I got was: 『Who would do such an unprofitable business』&#8230;&#8230;Which is true. If we&#8217;re going to collect young, beautiful girls and sell them off, it&#8217;s faster to pick up runaway girls. So at least I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the work of a professional.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm&#8230;..so you&#8217;re saying some amateur kidnapped them in some kind of magic trick?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who knows. By the way, Hikari, do you think you&#8217;ll get the W University sports recommendation??”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, I don&#8217;t know. Sensei said it would be a sure thing if we win the next tournament. With only two members, we&#8217;ll have to withdraw from the tournament.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm&#8230;&#8230;.I see.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Shall I threaten the bald old man of the advisor again?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari is my treasure. We lost our parents early on but we came this far by supporting each other as sisters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to make Hikari-chan&#8217;s dream of becoming a first-class athlete come true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I threatened the bald old man who was her advisor, who was on the board of directors of the track and field association, by putting him in debt to get him to recommend her for sports at this high school. Now, if he can get a sports recommendation from the University of W, his debt is forgiven. On the other hand, if he doesn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll feed him to the fishes. That&#8217;s what I promised him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh yeah, I met Koganei today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the waiting room for the escort&#8230;&#8230;. As soon as she saw my face, she fainted”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, her boyfriend was called in for questioning next to me, so I guess she came with him”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heee—, Koganei, she has a boyfriend?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m amazed at her brazenness in still trying to find love like other people, even though she&#8217;s had her body played with by old men for as long as I can remember.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I threatened her because she was making eyes at someone I liked, and the next week she started going out with Kimo-buta, who was at the bottom of the class. I think she was trying to show that she would never go against me”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, Koganei has a cute side too. But Hikaru-chan, you&#8217;ve found someone you like. What kind of person is he?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Shut up. There is almost no possibility. He has a very pretty girlfriend”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? She&#8217;s that cute?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, she is&#8230;..But she was the one who went missing and only one person came back. If she had stayed missing, there would have been at least a chance”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I pretended to think about it, Hikari gave me a reproachful look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nee-chan, you mustn&#8217;t think about kidnapping her. In a situation like this&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, okay, it&#8217;s fine”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, it&#8217;s fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I&#8217;ve been thinking about kidnapping Koganei anyway. So, I have no problem with one more person being taken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I was thinking of letting a group of continental kidnappers take them, but this time, I think it would be better to let the Hangure, who can turn tail at any time, take them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Note. Credit to TinyTL. Hangure,is loosely-organized criminal gang, non-yakuza organised crime group]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They don&#8217;t even know who is giving them instructions. If they follow instructions, they get paid. If they don&#8217;t follow instructions, they are dealt with. That&#8217;s the only relationship they have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They kidnap them, load them onto a container ship bound for South-East Asia and that&#8217;s it. After that, I don&#8217;t care what happens to them.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It would be more perfect if one of the detectives could be bribed&#8230;..In the meantime, let&#8217;s find out about Nakamura, the Chief Inspector.’</span></i></p>
