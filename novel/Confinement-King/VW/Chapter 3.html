<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Saori Moribe Doesn't Want to Fall</h3>

<p><strong>The Fourth Day of the Girls’ Track and Field Confinement- The Split Within.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The early morning entertainment district is sad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dreams of old men have disappeared with the foam of beer and the wreckage of a night&#8217;s pleasure is in a rubbish bag waiting for the rubbish truck to come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Morning scene in the drinking street behind the station. Amidst the cawing of wild cats and crows fighting over territory, Fujiwara-san and I leave the hotel, hand in hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a man, it&#8217;s hard for me to ask her to pay for the whole hotel, but I only have coins in my wallet to begin with. I tried saying, [I&#8217;ll let you pay here] with a superior attitude but she replied, [Yes, yes] with a wry smile, which made me feel a little sad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Gununu, chippaime] As I deliberately bite my teeth, Fujiwara-san looks into my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wears no make-up at all. What about the fact that she looks prettier that way? It&#8217;s a story that could shake the very raison d&#8217;etre of make-up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu–min.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? It&#8217;s not what! This is the part where you say, 『What is it, Ma–I ♡』Fu–min is the one who said, [Let&#8217;s do something loverly], right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Anyway”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, you faked it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sharpens her mouth. But I ask her, without care.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You stayed out overnight without permission, is that okay? Aren&#8217;t you afraid you might get in trouble?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s okay. I sent a message to my mom. I told her I&#8217;d stay at Misuzu&#8217;s place. I also sent a message to Misuzu to make sure she knows.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When did you &#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t underestimate a gyaru&#8217;s flick typing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fujiwara-san then,[Fufu–nn!] and puff out her poor chest with a smug look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And so &#8211; it would be even more suspicious if I hurried home. Let&#8217;s go have a morning meal. I want an English muffin.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, Fujiwara-san will pay for it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t pay for someone who calls me Fujiwara-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai, I want a morning meal on your money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said this, I picked her chin with my fingertips and brought her face close to mine and she gave me an indescribable look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look like you&#8217;re trying to be cool, but that&#8217;s really the worst thing you can say”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I myself was allowed to leave quite early yesterday, partly because there had been progress in the investigation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when I returned to my flat, I could not find Misuzu-sama in my room. This made me panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, I interrogated my idiot sister, who showed signs of being upset that I had unexpectedly returned home early. The interrogation was a familiar one. [Spit it out, orah!] As I twisted up her chest, Misuzu-sama came back, as if she had timed it perfectly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, um&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Misuzu-sama stiffens in the doorway. I smile affectionately and gently release Kyoko.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air was indescribable, very delicate indeed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her again, she told me that Misuzu-sama had met her boyfriend. What a rubbish thing to say. How could I allow another man to get his hands on the precious Misuzu-sama, who is in the care of Master?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, I asked Misuzu-sama to behave herself and lectured Kyoko until midnight. And this morning, while thinking about how I should apologise to Master, I left the flat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oou, good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I arrived at the department, Inomoto-Senpai was just about to take his seat with a cup of coffee in his hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, I go to work at the station, not in the field. The investigation on campus was generally completed yesterday. The investigators will have a debriefing at 10.00 am, including a summary of the investigation up to yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I took my seat, Inomoto-senpai asked me a question with an air of interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard that Anna Kamishima was here yesterday”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I was surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What was she like?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It feels like&#8230;&#8230;she had that kind of air about her, the kind of woman who could make people fall down with a laugh.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inomoto-senpai shook his large body and cowered his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s scary”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inomoto-senpai had not yet discarded the theory that the Kamishima gang was responsible for the series of kidnappings, which had been completely dismissed by them, including Inspector Nakamura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you made any progress over there?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The information that Master had given 『the fence behind the clubhouse building comes off and leads out to a wooded area.』 was spearheaded by Inomoto-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, it&#8217;s a pretty big one. I found the victim&#8217;s student handbook. It was a first-year student named Yui Kayama. I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the route she took was through the fence and out the back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see….”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s so certain about that.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there&#8217;s no way she could have gone that way, since she just went straight into Master&#8217;s 『room』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just&#8230;..unfortunately, because of the rush of the press to the main gate, quite a few students went home the day after the incident via the wooded path. The path has been trampled over, so I wouldn&#8217;t expect to detect any footprints or anything like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s unfortunate&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, but if you think about it, if you want to move eighteen people, you have to make them walk on their own two feet. There&#8217;s no sign of a struggle and it would be too conspicuous and impractical to move a large group of eighteen girls by carrying them.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I suppose you&#8217;re right”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to try to find out if it was the OG or the advisor&#8230;&#8230; who led them”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what Inspector Nakamura also said, that someone may have guided them. But this could be an interesting development.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there is a connection between the OG or the advisor and Anna Kamishima, it will be a great reason to raid the Kamishima clan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Isn&#8217;t it too convenient to use them&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Moribe&#8230;&#8230;is it almost morning?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I don&#8217;t know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I responded to Shima-senpai&#8217;s question with my eyes closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, several days have passed since we were trapped in a room without a single window. There is no longer any sense of time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened my eyes, I saw Yui, who had rolled over onto her stomach, regretfully crawling her tongue over the pet water tray that was still in front of her. As the daughter of a good family, she is probably not very good at holding back but her misery is even more pronounced because of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although we, the girls’ track and field members are still held captive. For the first time, we made contact with the culprit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a few hours ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a creepy woman with a sloppy sackcloth on her head appears and places a tray full of water in front of everyone, one at a time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been several days since our capture and our thirst was long gone. We jumped on the trays without a second thought. But as we were still tied up behind our backs, the only way to drink water was to stick our faces in and sip it, or to lick it off with our tongues like dogs.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a pathetic sight, but no one could resist the extreme thirst and for a while the dimly lit room was filled with countless small sounds of chattering water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few hours have now passed since then and the room is as dismal as a morgue. Although the thirst has been quenched, the stomach bugs are 『gukiruru』 in various parts of the room, gnawing and asserting themselves in a lively manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m about to die,this me”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stupid, you&#8217;re in your third year, why are you whining?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment when Captain Tashiro condemned Shima-senpai&#8217;s words in a scratchy voice, one corner of the wall suddenly opened and light leaked out in the form of a door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we gasp, three figures enter the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One is the creepy woman in the headdress. She wears a feather-like object on one side of her back and is dressed in a leather rider&#8217;s suit that seems to stick snugly to her body.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other is a foreigner with silver hair and blue eyes. She is quite beautiful, dressed in a British-style maid&#8217;s outfit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as soon as I saw the last one who came in, Shima-senpai let out a moaning voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ma, Masaki, isn&#8217;t that you, Masaki&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman, who entered as if led by two people in front of her, was dressed in a parasol skirt made of pink fabric and richly decorated with white lace. The tiara on her head reflected the sparkling light from the jewels. She was dressed like an anachronistic mediaeval princess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was probably about our age, with a childishly pretty face and only her breasts have half the volume of ours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A luxurious chair like a throne suddenly appeared ahead of her as she walked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was in a place where nothing had been there before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we watched with bated breath, the princess sat down on a chair, the maid and the sackhead lady knelt on their knees on either side of her and an intense light came on behind the chair, making it impossible to even look directly at her.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I can only be puzzled. What on earth are we being shown? At least to my eyes, all three of them looked like three participants in a costume parade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Masaki! Masaki! You&#8217;re safe!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone&#8217;s eyes are drawn to Shima-senpai, who suddenly raises her voice. It seems that the princess is an acquaintance of senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when the princess turned her face towards Shima-senpai, she narrowed her eyes disapprovingly and shrugged her chin at the head-bag lady.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the head sacked woman walked up to Shima Senpai and suddenly kicked her in the stomach with force, leaving her lying on her stomach and confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geboo!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「Hiiiii!!?」」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The kick was so powerful that she was lifted several centimetres in the air while in a prone position. A muffled cry, almost like vomiting, escapes from the Shima-senpai’s mouth, while those around her choke back a scream, kicking the floor frantically and retreating behind her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U…uuu….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shima, get a grip, Shima!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai is writhing, foaming at the edges of her mouth. Captain Tashiro hurriedly crawls to her side. Everyone around her, including me, retreated towards the wall at once, creating a large space in the middle surrounding the princess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is the height disrespectful to call out Masaki-sama. What shall we do, Masaki-sama? Shall I deal her away now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the maid politely bows, the princess looks around at us and opens her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am Masaki Haneda, the first favourite princess of the great Confinement King. I hope you now understand that it&#8217;s up to me to make the most of your lack of brains and to decide whether to kill you all or not.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Confinement King?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head at the unfamiliar name. Could it mean he&#8217;s the mastermind behind our captivity?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you going to do with us?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Captain Tashiro rises to her feet and shouts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone winded their eyes at this. After all, Shima-senpai had just suffered a terrible attack. She is not afraid of anything. However, it is not that we are uncomfortable with her behaviour. For better or worse, she can&#8217;t read the air, this person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there is no real element of bullishness in this situation. This is different from protesting against the adviser. Probably in everyone&#8217;s mind, a future in which Captain Tashiro would be treated badly would have flashed through their minds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprisingly, however, the princess responded to the question with a faint smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are four among you. Four of you have committed a mortal sin.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mortal  sins?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell them, Freesia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The princess tucked her chin and the silver-haired maid stood up and faced Captain Tashiro.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“One of the favoured princesses of the great Confinement King. Those four are guilty of humiliating Mai Fujiwara-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, a faint gasping sound was heard. There must be someone who knows what she&#8217;s talking about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the princess looked around at everyone and smiled kindly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I&#8217;m going to give you a chance. If all the four come forward before I count to ten from now on, the rest of you will be sent home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa,wait! What happens to those who come forward!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Captain Tashiro raised her voice, the princess smiled a terrible, cruel smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll let them go in the end. But I will cut them into pieces, stop the bleeding so they don&#8217;t die, and they will be sent home by refrigerated courier after several years of literally cutting their bodies down to the bare minimum of viable organs”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone is speechless at the gruesome, hair-raising tale and the scene falls silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, I&#8217;m going to count. One, two&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the princess began to count, everyone began to look around at each other and then Yui screamed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who!　Who is it? Come forward quickly!　Don&#8217;t drag me into this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Calm down, Kayama! You&#8217;re selling out your own friend!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not one of your friends! Let me go home! Send me home!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, the other members of the club started shouting. I just felt [OroOro]. Even so, the princess&#8217;s counting doesn&#8217;t stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[オロオロ:flustered]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eight, Nine&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was me! I&#8217;m the only one who did this! Let the others go!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Ten”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the cursing fades away and the sobs of the club members echo through the air, the princess looks at the head of the department, who stares straight at her, and lets out a deep sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, what is your name?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tashiro&#8230;&#8230;Tashiro Hatsu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have the mentality that it&#8217;s beautiful to take a stand and defend others. Your chances of getting out of here are now gone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I say I did it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve got some of the characteristics of those major sinners. You don&#8217;t fit them at all. But&#8230;&#8230;is fine. For your courage, I will give you one more chance.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re still playing with&#8230;..us!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, we do. That is somewhat true in some parts. Entertainment is important. But you have to obey. Don&#8217;t you agree?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Entertainment&#8230;..you say.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Captain bites her back teeth in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those whom I am about to call, come here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The princess began to look round at each of us and suddenly pointed to a person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You there. Come here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye,yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is your name?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M,My name is Yui Kayama&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You,next, come here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who got up quietly, without saying a word, was a second-year senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is your name?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takasago Kei”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takasago Senpai is a beautiful black-haired girl who is quiet and always has sleepy eyes. Despite being a tremendous pain in the ass, she is apparently quite popular with the boys, who call her Sleeping Beauty because of her idol-quality face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Last&#8230;..you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hya, hyaI!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Saori intended to say hai;roughly saying yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next one who the princess pointed to was&#8230;&#8230;me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got up hurriedly and walked over to the princess as if to roll over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is your name?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mo,mo,mo, mo, it&#8217;s Moribe Saori”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My tongue twitched with nervousness. The princess giggled at my stammering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then there was Tashiro-san, wasn&#8217;t there? I&#8217;m appointing you and the other four to be the inquisitors.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Inquisitors?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Captain stares at the princess with a glare.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Captain! Stop it! Don’t make more trouble!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I plead so in my heart. It would be nothing but reckless to defy them in this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right, I&#8217;m asking the four of you to find the major criminal who humiliated the Confinement King’s favourite princess, Mai Fujiwara, on my behalf.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ho,How would that be possible?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui asked the princess, her voice trembling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The solution is simple. I will give you four whips. Until all the deadly sinners come forward, you must beat any pig at least a hundred times every day. If you do not whip them at least a hundred times, you will be dismissed from the Inquisitorial Board. You will go back to being pigs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ridiculous! You want me to whip the club members?!&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Captain continued to defy. The princess looks at her and smiles a ridiculing, teasing smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“AraAra,are you afraid people will hate you?　Don&#8217;t worry. You inquisitors will be treated as my direct subordinates. If they cross you, the pigs will be jointly and severely punished. You will also be given a room for two, a hotel suite, clothes and a sumptuous meal. And let&#8217;s just say that if you successfully find all four of them, you&#8217;ll be on your way home&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You bastard!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kisama!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ara? Are you dissatisfied? It can&#8217;t be helped. Then you should be on the receiving end. Instead, yes,&#8230;..how about you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U, uchi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[M,me?. ウチ  word is often used by young women when it is casual, such as with friends.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is your name?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Shima, my name is Natsumi Shima.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai looked confused when asked her name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let&#8217;s replace her with you. Or do you want to make a face like that inflexible girl over there and refuse?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai glanced at the captain and then said, [I&#8217;ll do it!　I&#8217;ll do it!!] nodded with a serious face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well. Then, you four will follow me. The rest of the pigs will be fed two meals a day from today onwards. We can&#8217;t let them die an easy death by starvation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid urged us to follow the princess out of the room. I glanced back and saw all the members of the club looking at us with reproachful eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we leave the room, the princess looks back into the room and opens her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, you must be punished for your disobedience there. Lili, 『paralysis』 please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the princess says this──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Higu!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pya!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone who followed her to a new room suddenly began to jerk and convulse as if struck by lightning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side of the door was a dimly lit stone corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s like a dungeon from a subjective point of view. &#8230;&#8230; It would be interesting if it said 『Iroikkaizutsu』 or something like that.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, being able to think about such a thing, I may have unexpectedly become relaxed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right.Torture, untie these girls.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if she just remembered, the princess gives the order and the sackhead lady comes towards us with a knife in hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take back what I said before. I can&#8217;t afford it.. I&#8217;m so scared. Our faces twitch involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But we were not cut down and with a light swing of her knife, all the red ropes that bound us were cut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuaa&#8230;.. it&#8217;s untied.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The princess nodded and looked back at the silver-haired maid after she saw that everyone&#8217;s ropes had been untied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, Freesia, you take care of the rest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The princess then walked down the corridor to the right and entered the door at the end of the corridor. Before I realised it, the sackhead lady had disappeared as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we gazed blankly at the door through which the princess had entered, the silver-haired maid spoke quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are not authorised to enter beyond that point. If you do enter, you will be taken to&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like going back into that room?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, we will remove you on the spot. As you wish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We nodded, our cheeks twitching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, then, ladies and gentlemen, this way, please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We followed the silver-haired maid down the corridor a few metres to the left, and we saw a door in the wall on either side. The door was a very ordinary wooden door, the kind of door I would find anywhere.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“These two rooms will be your rooms for the time being.The two of you will occupy one room.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the silver-haired maid opened the door, we all let out an exclamation in unison[Waa&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stylish indirect lighting. Long-felted red carpet floor. The white walls are decorated with goldsmith&#8217;s work. In the foreground was an expensive-looking black leather sofa set, and beyond it, in the centre of the room, sat a large canopied bed that could accommodate up to five people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The princess said it looked like a luxury hotel suite and it was true that all the furnishings looked expensive but as a commoner I could only think, [So this is what a suite room looks like].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;&#8230;how will the room assignments be?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Yui asked this, the silver-haired maid simply replied with a blank expression, [Be my guest].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, Shima-senpai. First years are fine with each other, aren&#8217;t they?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“e, &#8230;..aaa, it&#8217;s fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, then, Shima-senpai and Takasago-senpai will be in this room. Me and Moribe-san will be in the room on the other side.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, Yui is very lively. She always looks like she is about to die at competitions and never comes back after going to the toilet but doesn&#8217;t she feel pressured at times like this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have two sets of clothes in the wardrobe. A loungewear and the inquisitor&#8217;s uniform but for the time being, please change into your uniform. I&#8217;ll be waiting for you, so please come back here when you&#8217;ve finished changing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,yes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were hurriedly separated into our respective rooms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. they&#8217;re all really top-notch.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I entered the room, Yui rubbed the sofa and let out a sigh of admiration. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a first-class product or not, but since Yui, a young lady from a good family, says so, it must be so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s see, closets, closets&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She opens several rows of cupboard-like objects in sequence and finds clothes on hangers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yui-chan,I found the clothes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The doors at the back are the bathroom and toilet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bathroom? Then I&#8217;d like to have a bath before I get dressed&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We can’t. If we make her wait too long, I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;ll do to us. Let’s get changed quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, ah, &#8230;&#8230; yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out a set of clothes that had been hanging and laid them out on the bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, the negligee is probably for loungewear. The problem is the inquisitor&#8217;s uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230; Min〇suka Po〇ice~”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230; Minisuk〇〇 Police”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We wear a hat like the American policemen I often see in the movies and a tube-top undergarment. A short blue jacket, a tight mini-skirt of the same colour and thick-soled boots. The shorts they had on hand were string-like and had very little fabric. However, compared to being naked, it was a little better, as it hid any danger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I,it&#8217;s embarrassing, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite saying this, Yui was posing in front of her appearance mirror after she had finished changing her clothes, as if she was not fully satisfied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I went out into the corridor, Shima-senpai and Takasago-senpai had already finished changing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai has a slender, athlete-like figure and the Min〇suka Po〇ice uniform suits her well. The other side, Takasago-senpai, looks sleepy as ever but as the saying goes, children who sleep grow up well, for a person of her height, she has a very ample bust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I wear these clothes, it emphasises the fact that I&#8217;m the only one with an infant body shape, and it makes me very sad. I&#8217;m depressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see you&#8217;re all here. Now, please follow me”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid urged us to walk a few metres further and I saw another door on either side. The silver-haired maid stopped in front of it and said simply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On your left is the dining room and on your right is the swimming pool.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A swimming pool?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, you can use it in your spare time. We don&#8217;t have swimming costumes available but you are the only ones using it, so please, you can go naked.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she opens the door, it is a vast light blue space. The smell of chlorine leaks out. Behind the door was a magnificent pool of 25 metres and four lanes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. are you sure we are free to use this at our leisure?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, of course.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I wonder if this guy, the Confinement King, has a lot of money?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment after Shima-senpai muttered that in dismay, the silver-haired maid held a knife to her neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hee!!?　Hiiii&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For the time being, I&#8217;ll pretend I didn&#8217;t hear what you just said, but don&#8217;t call him Confinement King. Instead, please call him Confinement King-sama”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I-I understand. Confinement King-sama! It&#8217;s Confinement King-sama!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mood that had been on the verge of slackening is now all at once tightened. What was I really doing to be so stupid? There should be nothing to relax about. Perhaps we are still walking on thin ice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let&#8217;s have dinner. As it is this time of day, I have prepared a form of brunch for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the word &#8216;food&#8217;, Takasago-senpai reacts with all her might. With the pool in the background, the silver-haired maid closes the door, this time walking over to the door on her left and opening it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smell of delicious food tickles our nostrils and we gulp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The table is rather large for four people. We could see that the food was laid out on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As this will be the first meal in a few days for everyone, we have prepared a variety of dim sum, with a focus on Chinese’s rice porridge, which is easy on the stomach.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ rice…..porridge”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Food….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui and Shima-senpai muttered in dismay, we looked at each other and hurriedly took our seats and reached for our food. I think I said something about the thin ice just a few minutes ago, but that&#8217;s not the point.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Can I describe it as a narrowing of vision? At least for me, I could only see the food on the table. We are starving, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as we were seated, we hurriedly scooped up the porridge in front of us with a bamboo ladle and put it in our mouths without regard to our manners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hot! It&#8217;s hot, but it&#8217;s so tastyyyyyyyy!! It’s hopeless, It&#8217;s so delicious!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha-hafu, hafu, i-it&#8217;s so delicious!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima Senpai and Yui are noisy. But it sure is absurdly delicious. I can&#8217;t stop eating. It may be due to hunger, but the porridge with beaten eggs is absurdly delicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I look at Takasago-senpai, who always moves in a slovenly manner except when running, is also hurriedly bringing a lengua to her mouth. This is probably the first time I&#8217;ve seen her so agile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[beef tongue]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui easily ate up the porridge, which was supposed to be hot, and then, without fear, demanded a second helping from the silver-haired maid, who, with the same momentum, reached for one dim sum dish after another, including shao mai and shrimp dumplings</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid, who had always been expressionless, smiled slightly at this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t panic, we have plenty of refills and desserts for after dinner.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dessert&#8230;..what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the word [dessert], Takasago-senpai reacted again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a thick custard pudding from Ginza Imaido.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid says casually. Immediately, everyone stops moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re lying&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not a lie.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; is it for real?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s for real.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at Takasago-Senpai, she is tsuー&#8230;&#8230; and quietly shedding tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may seem exaggerated, but it is what it is. The thick custard pudding from Ginza Imai-do is a rare item, with a price of 2,000 yen for one and a limited daily production of 20.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For us students from regional cities, it is a legendary pudding that is only available on TV, and is absolutely out of reach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until now, the taste has been shown on TV in images of TV personalities fainting in agony as soon as they put it in their mouths, saying [N────!]. Now it is here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were stunned, but the silver-haired maid told us without a single expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s brunch, so it&#8217;s a light meal, but you can be assured that you&#8217;ll be getting more than this for the next three meals.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“More than this&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid&#8217;s mouth turned up a little at my question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, you can count on it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shima-senpai said that and trembled, the silver-haired maid shrugged her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s normal. Because Confinement King-sama cherishes those who obey him.  The other side of the coin is that he has no mercy on those who disobey him. That&#8217;s all there is to it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You mean he sees us as obedient?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Yui interrupted her, the silver-haired maid gave a small nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like it or not. If you work hard, the great Confinement King-sama  will surely reward you. For the time being, your tasks are to feed the pigs in the morning and evening and whip them a hundred times. Of course, this is not about flogging. It is a means to identify the biggest sinners. As soon as a major sinner comes forward, I can promise you that the treatment of the others will be raised from chattel to something more reasonable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does that mean&#8230;&#8230; Hatsu-chan will also be rescued?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai looks at the silver-haired maid with an upward glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu-chan? Oh, that person. Of course. Frankly speaking, it&#8217;s hard to understand why she opposed it so much when she could have saved the rest of the people if she could have identified the major sinners&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In other words, only us can save everyone in the club&#8230;&#8230; is that what you&#8217;re saying?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Yui-chan stood up, the silver-haired maid just smiled at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s something wrong with her. While thinking so, I could not put it into words, and just stared at everyone&#8217;s expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuaaa…..I–am–tired…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I left Natsumi and the other four in Freesia&#8217;s care and returned to the 『Bedroom』 , I dived into the bed in my dress. Around the same time, Lili appeared in the air, spinning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes,Oppai-chan, good work Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first contact with the girls’ track and field team members started without Fumio-kun. I was nervous inside but we managed to pull it off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey&#8230;&#8230;Lili, can I take this dress off already?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay Devi. The only work you have left to do today is to have dinner in the evening with the four people you have chosen as your Inquisitors. Until then, nothing special Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, my corset is so painful&#8230;..Lili, can you unbutton the buttons on my back?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, by the way, how was my performance?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her this as she took off my dress, Lili smiled, showing her teeth, [Nishishi]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perfect, Devi. You really gave off the evil queen vibe, Debi”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m glad. But you know what? The lighting in the back of the room was so hot&#8230;&#8230; What was that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good point, Devi. The theory is that if you want to overwhelm your opponent, you need a strong light behind you, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Devi. First of all, being dazzled is quite stressful for the other person, Devi. On top of that, they can&#8217;t make eye contact with you,they have to turn their faces away from you. If they are forced into a situation where they can&#8217;t read your facial expressions, psychologically they can&#8217;t be strong anymore.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;..but it was Tashiro-san, wasn&#8217;t it? That girl defied us, didn&#8217;t she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili shrugs her shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sometimes it happens, Devi. People who have an abnormally strong persona of what they think they should be like&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Persona? What is a persona?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the case of that ponytail, she&#8217;s the leader, so she has to pull everyone else along with her. She has to protect. She has to be superior. Such a self-suggested acquired personality, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t really understand but&#8230;it seems kind of troublesome.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s the opposite, Devi. Rather, it&#8217;s easy, Devi. If you take away her persona, she lose the support, Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuun….But I removed her from the inquisitor, but I wonder if it&#8217;s okay. You said she was the type that Fumio-kun likes, right? Tashiro-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not at all, no problem Devi. If anything, from a Oppai-chan point of view, it would be better if we could get rid of FumiFumi&#8217;s favourite type of girl, wouldn&#8217;t it be Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili looks a bit mean.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not true. If it would make Fumio-kun happy, I would do anything for him. If Fumio-kun wants to hold this girl, I want to let him hold her, and if he&#8217;s happy with that, I&#8217;m happy too…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You became a good wife, Devi”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“However, I&#8217;m not going to give up the idea of having Fumio&#8217;s first baby with me, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Lili laughed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, since FumiFumi seems to be already back home, and since you didn&#8217;t have sex last night, you can ask him all you want.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?　Yay, I&#8217;m looking forward to it! Fumio-kun, I can&#8217;t wait for you to come home&#8230;..”</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The pigs are all unconscious. They won&#8217;t wake up until tomorrow, so the flogging will start tomorrow morning. Today, you are free to stay until dinner.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After dinner, the silver-haired maid told us this and we returned to our allocated rooms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at the clock on the small desk by my bedside and see that the time is just after noon. I am somewhat relieved to find that a serious sense of time has returned after a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui and I take our turn to shower and change into the negligee that has been prepared for us. And now we were both lying on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our current situation was so unrealistic that no matter how much we tried to understand it in our heads, our hearts could not catch up with them at all. I could only think it was because of this that I remained strangely calm in a situation where I could have been crying out for more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe-san, what is your strategy?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan suddenly asks me a question and I raise myself up. She remains staring at the ceiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Strategy? Strategy for what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re a carefree person&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s all about who to flog. If we don&#8217;t whip them a hundred times a day, we will be the ones being whipped.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,yes…I don&#8217;t know, but I thought that if we spread them all out, we can get away with less per person. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa…I&#8217;m going to choose Amemiya-senpai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckle involuntarily. Because it was so predictable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan and Amemiya-senpai, a senior in her second year, don&#8217;t get on well anyway. Both of them are very proud, but Yui-chan is always being pushed around because Amamiya-senpai is more articulate. It was also Amemiya who gave Yui-chan the nickname『Miss Bowel』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please don&#8217;t get me wrong. If you want to reduce the number of times you have to whip everyone, it would be ideal to find the four people in question as quickly as possible.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then wouldn&#8217;t it make the most sense to spot the most suspicious and hurt them so much that they might as well come forward?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yui-chan, you think Amemiya-senpai is suspicious?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, someone humiliated the favoured princess of the Confinement King&#8230;&#8230;didn&#8217;t they?　Of course it&#8217;s that woman with a twisted character who would do such a thing!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahahaha….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for me, who is not on good terms with Amemiya-senpai, I have no choice but to laugh and deceive her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, Moribe-san, hitting everyone means that you will be resented by all of them, don&#8217;t you think?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, for you, even if you think you cared for everyone, from the point of view of the person being hit, all that will be left is the memory of being hit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it&#8217;s not like&#8230;..there&#8217;s anyone I don&#8217;t like.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it a good thing? People are individually counted for favours received. Resentment is a cumulative count. Even if at first there are people who understand you favourably and say, 『Oh, I see, you&#8217;re spreading it out to everyone and making it less per person』, if it goes on for a long time, your way will probably result in the most resentment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Yui is right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then, who am I supposed to whip?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is the morning return. The Confinement King’s  home in the morning. Or rather, I arrived home in the early afternoon.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I like the name 『Confinement King』, but the reality is that I am far from being a king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When my mother questioned me about going away without permission, I quickly told her a lie: [Fujiwara-san&#8217;s father liked me, so he asked me to stay over.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom showed signs of acceptance, so I thought I had passed the barrier safely, but then she said, [Well, I have to call him to say thank you], and the Confinement King was in even greater trouble. I rushed to the toilet, called Fujiwara-san and somehow got over it by getting him to talk on the phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Confinement King is a human child, and he could not win against his parents and a crying child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I returned to my room after somehow managing to get through it, Lili gave me a very sour look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“FumiFumi&#8230;&#8230;you screwed up, Devi”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t I tell you yesterday, Devi? Today is the start of the training of the girls’ track and field team members, Devi. It&#8217;s Oppai-chan&#8217;s debut, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s because of that&#8230;&#8230;unavoidable circumstance&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaa, she worked so hard, but FumiFumi wasn&#8217;t there, and Oppai-chan&#8217;s breasts were so sad, Devi.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Masaki&#8217;s breasts became dejected??!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course Devi. If you don&#8217;t take good care of them soon, they&#8217;ll get too saggy and droop.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Masaki&#8217;s rocket tits were to sag, it would be a big problem. I hurriedly called the door and stepped into the bedroom. On the bed, I found Masaki-chan waiting for me on all fours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What just didn&#8217;t make sense was her fur bra with a furry cat-like pattern and fur shorts with a tail. She was dressed in cat ears of the same pattern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“NyaaーNyako will die if it&#8217;s lonely, so hurry up and love her!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Neko]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it is rabbits that die when they are lonely but apparently it is an appeal to be adored as soon as possible. Her cheeks were bright red, as if she was embarrassed while doing it herself.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Cute&#8230;..my wife is too cute’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,yes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I got on the bed, Masaki-chan came up to me on all fours and rubbed her cheek against my chest as if to pamper me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nyaa, I missed youNyaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I say that and stroke her head, Masaki-chan squints her eyes pleasantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumio-kun, today, Nya wants to make Fumio-kun feel goodNyaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Masaki-chan is going to stay in this cat character for the rest of the day. I wonder what it would be like to have sex in the middle of the day, but at any rate Masaki-chan was too cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Then, I&#8217;ll ask you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I&#8217;ll do my best-nyaa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She whispered this in a tone of voice that showed a hint of hearty enthusiasm, and urged me to [stand up].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stood up as she told me to, she put her hands on her belt and pulled down the zipper. Then her hand slides down my jeans and pants to my ankles, and my thing bounces vigorously up to the ceiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nya &#8230;&#8230; smells so naughtyNyaa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s kind of embarrassing&#8230;&#8230;to be told that again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without caring about me laughing, Masaki-chan put her hands on my thighs and started licking my inner thighs.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, Masaki-chan! &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A very cat-like tongue. I trembled slightly at the unexpected stimulation. Masaki-chan, perhaps pleased by my reaction, continued to lick my thinghs relentlessly while handling and squeezing my cock with her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fua…haa…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not so much a stimulant. Rather, it is probably more the visual of her getting down between my legs and licking me up like a cat that excites me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, Fumio-kun&#8217;s penis is so cutenyaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki kissed the glans with a [Chu]. She continued to make  [Chu,Chu] sounds, raining kisses all over my penis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While she was thinking about this, Masaki&#8217;s soft lips moved to my scrotum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ufufu, this is an important place for younyaa. Please be healthy, my little baby…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttering this as if it were a spell, Masaki-chan begins to lick around the ball sack. Her little red tongue crawls all over the scrotum, and the tickling sensation makes me wince. She carefully licks up to the underside of the pouch to stretch out the wrinkles, sucks on one of the balls and releases it with a plop sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tone of Masaki-chan&#8217;s voice is very sexy. It is a very exciting tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gently moves her right hand up and down while she licks up the balls with her tongue in a mousy manner. When did she learn this lewd and masterful technique? Perhaps Lili or her servant must have taught it to her again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it&#8217;s amazing. Masaki-chan&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it seems she doesn&#8217;t intend to let me ejaculate for a while yet and frustratingly, she dares to avoid the frenulum and continues handling and squeezing them. If she did that, I couldn&#8217;t hold back and my hips would move on their own. The enduring juice that overflowed from the bell mouth was entangled in her fingers, making them slimy and further increasing the pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look down again and see her cat ears swaying cutely between my legs. I can&#8217;t stop loving her, thinking that she is dressed like this to please me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki stops her hand and looks up. She squinted her eyes pleasantly as I stroked her head, probably because her hands and tongue were tired. But it was just an interval, apparently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I screamed and turned my head to look behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Masaki-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only thing that was there was Masaki-chan with her nose between my buttocks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, it&#8217;s working-nya, it&#8217;s an anal lick-nya”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you shouldn&#8217;t lick my ass, it&#8217;s dirty”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not dirty because it&#8217;s Fumio-kun&#8217;s-nya. I want you to feel my tongue-nya!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan said so firmly and started licking my asshole.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What is this, it&#8217;s bad, it&#8217;s bad&#8230;&#8230;!?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Would it be better to say that pleasure crawled up an unusual pathway? The tongue is slippery, and the unknown sexual zones start to tingle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-don&#8217;t do it, Masaki-chan! Even if Masaki-chan is fine with it, I&#8217;m worried about it. Aaah, don&#8217;t lick so much, aaah&#8230;&#8230; aaah&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily clutch the sheets, my voice trembling with the pleasure of anal licking. A terrible sensation of shame. My face is hot.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is so exciting. I&#8217;m so embarrassed&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if mocking my embarrassment, my penis warped to its limit, quivering and trembling, wetting the apex with the evidence of its pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumio-kun&#8217;s ass tastes so naughty and deliciousNyaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can&#8217;t taste good!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s true-nya. At least it excites me-nya. And I&#8217;m sure Fumio-kun is happy to be licked-nya”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not happy. This is just embarrassing. Ugh&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she unexpectedly kissed my anus, I felt a shiver run down my spine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmfufu, my body is begging for more. I&#8217;m going to take this opportunity to thoroughly fuck Fumio-kun and make him a prisonerNya”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a thick sadness clinging to her excited tone. I remember that Lili had said that Masaki-chan was 『actually an S』. At the time, I thought there was no way that could be true, but now that it&#8217;s come to this, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a lie anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nfufu, I&#8217;m going to lick you deeper so that Fumio-kun ny-an be more obedientNyyaa”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she said so, she kissed my anus and inserted her tongue into it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyaaaah!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Neru]. The hot tongue pushed through the wrinkles and entered, causing me to squeal in shame at the strange sensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[licking sound]</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Uuuu, what&#8217;s this&#8230;&#8230;weird feeling’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An intruder enters from the opposite side of a one-way street. Disgust came first, before pleasure. Her tongue, which is fighting against the sphincter, feels surprisingly large. It shouldn&#8217;t be that big, but the foreign body feels tremendous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But as the tongue wriggled inside my body, an unknown pleasure slowly welled up from the entrance area. The pleasure gradually swelled and gradually spread to the whole body.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘wha,what&#8217;s this?&#8230;.. N,no. I&#8217;m getting more and more comfortable.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was betrayed by my own body. I felt like that. My whole body gradually lost its strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, what’s wrongNyaa? Fumio-kun starting to like having your ass licked-nyaa?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that&#8217;s not true”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, Masaki-chan was looking at me with a grin on her face, as if she could see right through my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t help itnyya. I&#8217;ll keep licking you until you&#8217;re honest with mennya”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her tongue enters again. This time, it penetrated even deeper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaa……”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The very sensation of being raped. The tongue moves in circles and lays waste to my insides.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is dangerous, if this becomes a habit, it&#8217;s going to be a problem&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, say itnyaa. Tell me honestly that it feels goodnyaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pleasure of the subjection rushes up the spine. The narcotic, dangerous pleasure robs her of the will to resist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pleasure is so great that I can&#8217;t even close my mouth that is half-open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, you have to say it properlynyaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finally couldn&#8217;t hold back and spoke my honest opinion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;it feels good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Masaki-chan looks up and lets out a laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re a pervertNyyaa. Fumio-kun is a pervert!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh, isn&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230; a pervert too much?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The person who takes pleasure in being licked in the butt hole must be a pervertNyaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one would expect such abuse. With this, my suspicion of her being [S] is no longer a suspicion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m happynyaa. That&#8217;s what makes it worth licking. Nya loves even the perverted Fumio-kun. In fact, I love the perverted Fumio-kunnyaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel happy, but it&#8217;s kind of hard to be happy!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mfufu, I&#8217;ll reward the pervert Fumio-kun for being so honestNyaa. I&#8217;ll make you cum while I lick your assNYAAA!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Masaki-chan inserted her tongue again, and with her right hand in front of her, she wrapped her fingers around my slender object. Then, while moving her tongue, she begins to rub up and down the frenulum, sliding her fingers in a quick rhythm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was tortured in the front and the back at the same time, and I began to squirm helplessly. The familiar pleasure of the penis and the dangerous pleasure from the shallows of the anus came at me at the same time.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is, this is not good, this is not good, this is not good’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I clench the sheets and desperately clutch my feet against the unexpectedly extreme service. If I let my guard down, I feel like I&#8217;m going to be swallowed up by the pleasure all at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“aaa, Aaa,you can’t Masaki-chan, nnnn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if to ridicule my resistance, the big-breasted catgirl furiously accused me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably my asshole is already blistering. I can only imagine who trained her, but the way her hand handles my cock is tremendous. Masaki-chan&#8217;s unexpected love of torture is simply astonishing to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within a few minutes, the desire to ejaculate is imminent. I desperately tried to resist reaching it, but it was futile in the face of her overly skillful use of her tongue and fingers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m cumming, I&#8217;m cumminggg!!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byu! Byururururu!!! Byururururu!!!!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It just feels like I’m going to explode. Hot white spurt out, sloshing and staining the sheets. A tremendous pleasure rushed up my spine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should I call it a forbidden pleasure? As the desire gushed out, I felt as if my body was losing all its strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, Masaki-chan will not relent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa,aa….Haaaa…Aaaaa..kh..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was cumming, she kept on torturing me with her fingers and tongue, as if to say 『give me more』. Waves of climaxes were overtaken by even higher waves. Eventually, when I reached the point where I couldn&#8217;t get another drop out, her hand finally stopped and her tongue was withdrawn.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..I thought I was going to die’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s my honest opinion. That&#8217;s how bad it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How was it, Nyah&#8217;s service?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was breathing heavily, Masaki-chan looked into my face as if she was covering me from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It felt good, it felt really good, but&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m gladnya. I&#8217;m glad Fumio-kun is feeling goodnya”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were many things I wanted to say, but when she smiled innocently like that, I couldn&#8217;t say anything else.</span></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A conference room with the words 『Headquarters for the Investigation of the Large-Scale Disappearance of Schoolgirls』 posted ostentatiously in black ink. The debriefing session held there, where all investigators gathered together, has just ended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The investigation is making progress. They are closing in on the culprits. None of the investigators doubt this. Such was the atmosphere in the meeting room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The inference that the girls were taken out through the fence behind the club building and onto the wooded path behind is now treated as if it were a done deal.</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the meeting was over, those who left in a hurry were those who had been ordered to secure the area around the woodland path.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering their footsteps after they left the forest road, it is natural to assume that they were put in a vehicle at some point. After all, it was a large group of 18 people. A large vehicle or several vehicles? In any case, we had to devote a large part of our staff to interviewing people about any suspicious vehicle, mainly in the vicinity of the national road after the forest road.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In conjunction with this, Inspector Nakamura was asked by senior officer Inomoto whether he thought someone he knew might have led them there. In addition, the police also decided to review the relationships between the advisor, other teachers and the girls’ track and field club OGs, with Inomoto at the centre of the investigation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I believe that the reason why Inomoto-senpai looks happy is not only because his opinion has been taken into account, but also because he will have more opportunities to meet the school nurse,Ms Kitora.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ryoko refer to Kitora as Kitora Joshi hence the Ms]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I&#8217;m not at all interested in how senpai and Ms Kitora got to know each other, but Master and Masaki-sama were quite interested, so I&#8217;ll have to find out more about this somewhere else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, everything is off the mark. A laughing stock. The sight of these fools pathetically turning left and right was more than enough to reaffirm the greatness of Master.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within a few minutes or so after the meeting, most of the investigators had left and the only ones left were the career team from the main office. In addition to that, I am the only one left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am supposed to be a liaison officer attached to the director-general, but to those who know the relationship between me and Superintendent Nakamura, it is nothing more than a mixture of public and private affairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For this reason, the career  officers who would normally address the competent authorities from a higher position were extremely polite in their treatment of me and some even tried to improve Inspector Nakamura&#8217;s impression of me by elevating me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are a bunch of utterly stupid insects.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I listen to their chatty conversation, which now turns to the motive of the murderer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Normally, you&#8217;d have to assume that the aim is to take the victim into custody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, young women have the highest commodity value. I think it&#8217;s more likely to be the continental mafia, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about ransom?　Are any of the victims daughters of wealthy families?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, the victims do not include particularly wealthy daughters. If I had to guess, I would say that they include the daughter of a former president of Sirius Industries&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sirius, that company that went bankrupt last year, didn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I say the former president and the couple are divorced. The daughter lives with her mother in a four-and-a-half-metre flat and has managed to pay her school fees by relying on relatives. She&#8217;s a struggling student working at home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Homework, she can&#8217;t afford to do club activities, can she? That is…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She&#8217;s reportedly withdrawn from the club, but her adviser was holding her back and it seems she was held in very high esteem.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about this, the conference room extension suddenly rang and a detective nearby picked up the receiver.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither the victim  has any privacy. But what they just said should be brought to master&#8217;s attention in one way or another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cheif, there&#8217;s a call for you from a woman called Fukuda-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fukuda? Ah, the schoolgirl from the other day?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inspector Nakamura accepts the receiver&#8217;s phone with a quizzical look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin Fukuda &#8211; the abominable schoolgirl who had been hanging around master.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes, thank you for taking the trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he hung up the phone after saying this, Inspector Nakamura spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She&#8217;s quite a solid young lady. She is going away for family reasons at the beginning of the week. She took the trouble to give us her mobile phone number in case we needed anything. Well&#8230;..it doesn&#8217;t look like I&#8217;ll be hearing anything new from her at the moment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the third day in Terashima-san&#8217;s flat. I was sitting on the sofa with her knees in her arms, idly watching an afternoon information programme.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I switched channels, the disappearances of girls’ track and field team members were being reported with a lot of speculation. After all, to the uninvolved, the disappearances are nothing more than a form of entertainment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The press conferences of the headmaster and the advisor of the track and field team are repeatedly broadcasted but fortunately, Masaki and my portraits were never seen on TV.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm&#8230; Good morning. FuWaaaaa&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was after 1pm when Kyoko-san woke up from Terashima-san&#8217;s bedroom, dressed in underwear and a T-shirt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what kind of sleeping style gives her such a spiky sleeping pattern but with her red hair, she looks like a character from a shonen manga.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry about yesterday. It seems Terashima-san was very angry with you because of me&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it&#8217;s okay, it&#8217;s okay. I was the one who set it off. And I&#8217;m used to being lectured by Nee-chan”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Kyoko-san sits down next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I couldn&#8217;t ask you in front of Nee-chan, but how was&#8230;&#8230; your boyfriend?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How&#8217;d it go? How&#8217;s what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t play dumb with me now. It&#8217;s about your physical chemistry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, I fell silent. But Kyoko-san seemed to have guessed it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think yesterday was the second&#8230;&#8230;since he was my first”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;&#8230;this is your second time, then maybe you&#8217;re not very good at it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko-san must have been very considerate, but unfortunately it is a problem before whether she is good or bad at it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8230;&#8230;Kyoko-san, you&#8217;ve been with a lot of men, haven&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, no,that&#8217;s an exaggeration, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I could feel it around the entrance, but it didn&#8217;t hit the back at all&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rather, I think it&#8217;s amazing that Kurosa-chan says he can&#8217;t hit the inside on the second try&#8230;&#8230;But your boyfriend is the same age as you, right? Basically, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to get any bigger than that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, you know, even women get bigger breasts when they gain weight&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because a man&#8217;s cock isn&#8217;t fat, you know?　It&#8217;s more like, if they get fat, it&#8217;s buried in the flesh until it gets short. I mean, this is your second time, right? Doesn&#8217;t that mean he was nervous and it shrunk?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I tried my best to make it bigger, but he came in the middle of making it bigger&#8230;&#8230;In the end, he cum four times and seemed to be satisfied, but I couldn&#8217;t do it even once&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Acha—&#8230;&#8230;short and premature ejaculation, huh? That&#8217;s no good. I think you should break up with him as soon as possible. He&#8217;s rubbish.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But sex isn&#8217;t everything, you know&#8230;&#8230;like surgically enlarging a man&#8217;s penisor&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The idea of surgically enlarging a man&#8217;s penis is already scary. In addition, even though premature ejaculation can be dealt with, there is really nothing that can be done about the small size. I think you should break up”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;&#8230; but&#8230;&#8230; but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears are slowly coming to my eyes. I don&#8217;t want to break up with him. Even though I&#8217;ve come all the way back. There is no way I can break up with someone I like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko-san shrugs her shoulders when she sees my tears welling up in my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not that there isn&#8217;t a way to avoid breaking up&#8230; Do you want to listen to it&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What &#8230;&#8230; is that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can separate love and sex”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Love is with your boyfriend and sex is with your friends”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-w-w-what are you talking about? Isn&#8217;t that an affair!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Kyoko-san put her face close to my nose and pinched my chin with her fingertips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t you understand? If it&#8217;s between girls, it&#8217;s not cheating. You don&#8217;t have to worry about having a baby. If you&#8217;re looking for a partner, don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m bi. I don&#8217;t have a boyfriend at the moment, but I have three girlfriends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shima-senpai &#8230;&#8230; May I have a moment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I visited the room opposite in the near evening, I found that Shima-senpai had just showered, or perhaps she was stretching with a bath towel over her wet hair and wearing underwear that looked like strings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouu, what is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess it&#8217;s nothing to be concerned about since we were all completely naked until this morning, but stretching in that underwear with your legs spread is just too much to look at. Incidentally, Takasago-senpai was completely asleep. That&#8217;s, well, normal operation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was wondering who&#8230;&#8230; senpai was going to whip”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230; I hadn&#8217;t thought about it yet”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her about the conversation I had with Yui-chan, she folded her arms and began to ponder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230; as Miss Bowel said. I think it would be more efficient to find a way to find the four of them sooner rather than later”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I think so too. But I don&#8217;t know how to do it&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ummm&#8230;&#8230;we humiliated the favoured princess Mai Fujiwara&#8230;&#8230;.sama. I guess I have to put a 『sama』 on it, don&#8217;t I? I know that Mai Fujiwara-sama. We&#8217;re not that close, I just know her face&#8230;&#8230;She&#8217;s a black gal from the class next to mine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The third-year black gal&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if there&#8217;s anyone who has any connection with that black gal, it&#8217;s almost certain that she&#8217;s the culprit”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, you&#8217;re saying one of the third-year students is suspicious?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe-chan, are you an idiot?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So cruel!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After all, if you don&#8217;t count Hatsu-chan and me, the only other third-year student is my Ane, Ota. Do you think that muscular idiot can do something as insidious as humiliating people?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I don&#8217;t think so”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, I guess it&#8217;s a second-year student and a first-year student, but I don&#8217;t have any more clues&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;&#8230; wait a minute. I have something to write”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Shima-senpai took out a pen and paper from the cupboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, I&#8217;m going to write down a few things. First, the third year are&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">× Tashiro, × Shima, × Ota (Big Sister).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I put a cross next to each of them to indicate that it&#8217;s not the culprit. It means that we and Hatsu-chan were judged differently when we were chosen as inquisitors. And the second year..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">× Takasago, Shiratori, Amamiya, Adachi, and Konparu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takasago-senpai is the only second-year student who was given an X, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right&#8230;.. and the first years are…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">× Moribe, x Kayama, Inui, Ota (Little Sister), Hotta, Saito, Kishigi, Sato, Omuta, Koike</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I look at it like this&#8230;&#8230;There are a lot of first-years. For now, I&#8217;ll try the second year. Moribe-chan is a senior, so it will be difficult to hit them. Then, do you think we should try to eliminate them by a process of elimination?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we were talking about this, a silver-haired maid suddenly opened the door and walked in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s almost time for dinner. Everyone, please change into your uniforms and gather in the dining room. Today&#8217;s dinner will be hosted by Masaki-sama, so please make sure not to make any untoward incidents. I don&#8217;t want to have to dispose of more dead bodies, either”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I changed into my inquisitor&#8217;s uniform and stepped into the dining room, I found that the shape of the table, which was square during the day, had changed to rectangular. And at the so-called birthday seat at the table, Masaki-sama is already sitting down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her deep purple evening dress is different from the daytime. As usual, only her chest area was abnormally raised, as if the dimension was distorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good day, everyone. Oh, Mini〇uka Po〇lice??　Whose hobby is this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is I.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid replied dutifully and I couldn&#8217;t help but grumble inside my heart.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is your hobby!!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably everyone else was thinking the same thing at the same time. I could see it in their faces but we didn&#8217;t say it out loud, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although not as creepy as the sackhead woman, this silver-haired maid is scary enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we take our seats, the silver-haired maid begins to explain the dishes that are crammed on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Today we will be serving you with South American cuisine, with a focus on rib steak on the bone. There are five different sauces for the rib steak. We recommend the honey sauce. Of course, we have prepared as many refills as you like, so please eat as much as you like.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nfufu, sounds delicious. I&#8217;m very hungry today because I&#8217;ve been treated so well by the Confinement King-sama”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that comment from Masaki-sama, we involuntarily looked at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, we knew that. We knew that because she was a favoured princess &#8211; in other words, a princess who was favoured, it was of course a sexual relationship. However, the way Masaki-sama was saying it now, it sounded like she was boasting, or to me, it sounded like she was saying, 『Aren&#8217;t you jealous?』 I could only think that she was proud of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, let&#8217;s eat”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Masaki-sama&#8217;s words, we reached for the food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, we had already eaten a full meal during the day, so we weren&#8217;t as hungry as we should have been.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dining table is silent. It can&#8217;t be helped. The silver-haired maid&#8217;s threat of 『&#8230;&#8230; any rough treatment』 is so frightening that I&#8217;m afraid to open my mouth. Takasago-senpai was silent as usual, but when it came to Shima-senpai, who was kicked up by the sackhead woman and thrusted a knife by the silver-haired maid, she was on maximum alert. Her fingertips were even trembling as she reached for the food.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, should we be called celebrities ─ ─</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Masaki-sama, that necklace is very beautiful~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ufufu, Thank you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui praised the large diamond necklace adorning Masaki-sama&#8217;s chest in a rather perfunctory manner. Masaki-sama smiled as if nothing had changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was given to me by the Confinement King-sama as a reward for my hard work. It&#8217;s a natural diamond of twenty-six carats”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that comment, Yui-chan and I both widened our eyes and stopped moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「Twenty-six&#8230;&#8230;?」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some time ago, I heard on the news that a twelve-carat natural diamond was valued at 90 million yen. I couldn&#8217;t even imagine how much a twenty-six-carat diamond would be worth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, the question that passed through my mind. Yui-chan said exactly the same thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of person is the Confinement King-sama?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, I and Shima-senpai looked at each other, wondering if that question was a bad idea. Incidentally, Takasago-senpai was absorbed in the task of removing the meat from the bones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ufufufu, as long as you guys do your job properly, I&#8217;m sure you’ll have the chance to meet him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, Masaki-sama&#8217;s smile never ceases and I breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But if the current question is acceptable, it might be safe to go a little further…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I open my mouth with an intent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, um!　Masaki-sama. Well, um, can you tell us anything you know about the four people we need to find?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing in particular.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-sama was still smiling but it was a clear rejection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, &#8230;&#8230; Masaki &#8230;&#8230;-sama.&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next, it was Shima-senpai who raised her hand with a complicated look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, what is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll do my best, but I&#8217;m going to do it properly.  If those four people&#8230;&#8230;are found, will they be killed?　I&#8217;m feeling really depressed when I think about it&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a little thoughtful gesture, Masaki-sama clapped her hands and smiled happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then let&#8217;s do it this way. In exchange for promising not to kill those four, shall we raise the difficulty level a little? I&#8217;ll add one new restriction. 『You must not answer any questions from the pigs』, and anyone who breaks this will be reduced to a pig on the spot. Yes, let&#8217;s do that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time as Shima-senpai makes a 『oh shit』 face, Yui-chan glares at her with a look that says 『I&#8217;m going to kill you』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite Masaki-sama&#8217;s casual manner, the level of difficulty increased at a steep angle. It is very hard not to answer questions. In extreme cases, if one of the detained members asks us 『How are you?』 and we answer 『Fine』, that is enough to keep us from being deported to the piggery. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a while there, we were silent. With only the occasional Yui-chan chatting with Masaki-sama about other things, we went on eating in silence and Takasago-senpai alone was having second helpings of meat with sweet honey sauce smeared on it to the point of heartburn, one after the other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After an hour or so, the meal was over, and after watching Masaki-sama leave the table, the silver-haired maid quietly opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, it&#8217;s time to get to work. From now on, I would like you all to feed the pigs. The whipping will start tomorrow morning. Today, you will first learn the feeding procedure. The food will be prepared in the corridor in front of the 『breeding yard』 where you were just a few hours ago and from now on, you will feed the pigs after breakfast and dinner. Now, please, come this way”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following the silver-haired maid&#8217;s lead, I saw a row of buckets in front of the room where the club members were locked up, on either side of the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fourteen blue plastic buckets, very typical. There were also seven iron containers that looked like planters for plants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking into the buckets, I saw two types of contents. One contained something that looked like sawdust and the other a white liquid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The contents are oatmeal and milk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ueee&#8230;&#8230;is this&#8230;&#8230; the food? Seriously?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it&#8217;s rather common in the West. It&#8217;s used for breakfast and as a diet food, but&#8230;.. cornflakes are also a type of oatmeal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan explains to the Shima-senpai, who frowns involuntarily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“First of all, you put the feed bins in front of the pigs, then you put oatmeal in them and pour milk on top. That&#8217;s all you have to do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s easier said than done but we honestly feel quite guilty compared to what we ate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then you may begin.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We each hold a feed box in our hands and step inside the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, all the members of the club turned to us at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at them again, the members of the club look quite shabby. Until this morning, they would have been the same, but they are naked, tied up with red ropes, haven&#8217;t had a bath for several days, their hair is covered in sebum, and they haven&#8217;t eaten, so they look very thin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard the Captain&#8217;s voice asking, [Are you okay, did they do anything to you?] I was about to answer when Yui-chan grabbed my shoulder and shook her head from side to side.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I suddenly remembered, I shouldn&#8217;t have answered any question.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a close call. It would be better to decide that I would not open my mouth at all until I get used to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We did as the silver-haired maid instructed and placed the feed bins in a row in front of the club members. There are seven of them, so I guess the calculation is one for two people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shima! What is this? What are you guys trying to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Captain raises her voice as if she were choking her, but she can&#8217;t answer. I feel incredibly stressed. I just shouldn&#8217;t answer the questions, but I wonder if this is actually a fatal restriction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The club members looked at what we were doing with frightened faces, wondering what was about to start. Even in between the work, I could hear the club members whispering, [They&#8217;re taking a bath] or [Why are they wearing Minis*ka P*lice?]</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘We don&#8217;t wear them because we like them!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I think so, I can&#8217;t say it out loud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We then pour oatmeal into the feed bins in a bucket-relay fashion, followed by a splash of milk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After one round of work, the club members just look at us and the feed bins with quizzical eyes. That&#8217;s probably true. We don&#8217;t even know if it&#8217;s something we&#8217;re allowed to eat, even if we suddenly put this unintelligible thing on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s food! I don&#8217;t think it tastes good, but you can eat it. If you don&#8217;t eat it, you&#8217;ll die. You have to be patient and eat it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai said as if to appeal, but there was no plate, no spoon, and before that, their hands were tied and they couldn&#8217;t move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai looked towards Captain and she nodded. She took the initiative to stick her nose into the fodder box and start eating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it may look like that, but it&#8217;s surprisingly good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Captain said this out loud so that everyone could hear, and after a pause, the members of the club rushed to the feed bins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The club members plunge their faces into the feed bins, which are lined up side by side. The sounds of intense watering and chewing echoed through the dimly lit room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Members of the club would occasionally look up to catch their breath. Milk dripped from their mouths, running down their chins and staining the ribbon around their necks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Members of the club would occasionally look up to catch their breath. Milk dripped from their mouths, running down their chins and staining the ribbon around their necks.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is &#8230;&#8230; really livestock&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I scowl at the filthiness of the scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought from the bottom of my heart that I did not want to be corrupted by this position.</span></p>
