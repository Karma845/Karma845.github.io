<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you very much for purhcasing Confinement King  3.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am Masai, as you know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that in the publishing industry there is a three-volume barrier, but thanks to you, our readers, I am relieved that we have somehow managed to overcome one of these barriers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, this third volume contains the first half of what is commonly known as the 『Group Confinement of girls’ Track and Field Club Members Incident』. The fourth volume is the second half, and the erotic delicacies are concentrated in the second half.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, the main character 『Rin Fukuda』, who appeared in this volume, has no erotic scene in the third volume, so the character design has been postponed to the next volume.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, whether or not we can continue publishing depends on how well it sells. If we do a bad job, it could become an unsolved case and we could end up saying goodbye to Fukuda Rin, so we are very seriously praying to God and HifumiShobo–sama to continue publishing it. If I had my heart set on it, I would like to continue to publish more volumes and become the GuinOga of the juvenile pornography world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Guin Saga, famous fantasy novel 1979]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, by the time this book hits the shops, the first volume of the comicalised version of 『Confinement  King』 will have been released and although it will be a little further down the line, a new series, 『The Legend of Me』, will also be starting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after three volumes, the Corona Disaster is still not over and the world is not very bright, but I will do my best to provide our readers with as much fun as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now, last but not least, an acknowledgement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to thank everyone at 123 Shobo, including S-sama, who was in charge and E-sama, who discovered me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am truly grateful to Pei-sensei, who has exceeded my unreasonable demands and for allowing me to work on this work with him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Kadokawa Shoten, who has been involved in the comicalisation version, and to Ashimoto Yoika-sensei, who has done a wonderful job on the comicalisation. Thank you very much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my family and friends who pretend not to see me, to everyone who has read volumes one and two, to everyone who has read the web version, and to everyone who has given me feedback and encouragement there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And finally, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for purchasing this Confinement King 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you very much.</span></p>
