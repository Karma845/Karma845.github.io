<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Shima Natsumi wants to Help</h3>

<p><strong> Fumio Kijima’s Attacks</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder what happened..一ow</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, Kurosawa-san was acting very strangely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She always comes to Fujiwara-san&#8217;s desk during break time and it seems like she&#8217;s glancing at me while they&#8217;re talking about something trivial.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no, that can&#8217;t be it. I thought I was just being self-conscious&#8230;&#8230;but Fujiwara-san also seemed to have noticed somehow, and during lunchtime, when we were eating our lunches──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Today, Misuzu is acting kind of weird, isn&#8217;t she?　It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s conscious of Fu–min somehow&#8230;&#8230;Did she finally realise how attractive Fu–min is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tilted her head as she said this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Attractive….?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no such thing, if I may say so myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the current relationship between Kurosawa-san and I, she is probably plotting what kind of harassment she’s going to give me. It still feels better to think of it that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, during recess after the fifth period, Misuzu Kurosawa began to harass me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She suddenly said,[Janken!] and waved her hand in front of me. I was wary of the situation. I’ll  at least try to play along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Rock, paper, scissors!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san is bad at playing rock-paper-scissors. Although she had a tendency to harass me, she’s quite bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she never stopped, no matter how many times she lost.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she finally won after the ninth time, she let out a relieved exhale and then poked her finger at the tip of my nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won. Then you shall receive a penalty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, her eighth-inning loss was not counted.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What’s with her? Is she buggy?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s pretty pointless, since Fujiwara-san, who is usually unintelligible, is also puzzled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought she was going to say, [Go buy some coffee milk], but for some reason she said, [You should take the long way home from the back gate today].</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Subtle. What a subtle way to harass me. Just make me go the long way round or something&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied [O,okay I understand] but of course I had no intention of obeying her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, I can’t use the back gate. Kurosawa-san has no way of knowing this, but the forest road is now a hotspot for police investigations at the moment. If I go there, I could be perceived as 『the culprit returns to the scene of the crime』.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;No, perhaps it’s because I watched too many cop dramas.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school, I watched Kurosawa-san and Fujiwara-san leave the classroom and waited for a while before heading to the main gate as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number of media in front of the main gate is much smaller than last week. There were no TV cameras at all, and only a few people who looked like journalists with cameras around their necks, whether for newspapers or magazines, I don&#8217;t know. They were leaning against the gate, chatting away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a little after five o&#8217;clock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sun is still high in the sky and the clarity of the sky reminds me that summer is near. As I brush the swarms of winged insects peculiar to this season away from my face, I turn my feet towards my usual route to school, towards the residential area.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially in this new residential area, people don&#8217;t seem to get to know each other very well, and there are no housewives having friendly discussions on the street.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And just when I was about to go down the hill, with the children&#8217;s park where I witnessed Masaki-chan confessing her feelings for Kasuya-kun&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch! Tsutsu&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, there was a violent shock at the back of my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dull thud travels through my skull and shakes my eardrums. I&#8217;d heard the expression stars scattering in front of your eyes before, but this time it was true. I&#8217;m not sure if it was a star or a spark, but it flew directly in front of my eyes.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘w-what is this&#8230;&#8230;? It hurts?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I groan in dull pain and crouches down, holding my head. Throbbing sensations on fingertips, the smell of rusty iron poking my nose.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Shit…I&#8217;m bleeding!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing I knew, I was grabbed by the collar and dragged into the park.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was thrown out onto the grassy knoll, and my nose fell on the bald grass. The ground was warm and smelled of dirt after a day of exposure to the grass, dirt and direct sunlight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugehh!!&#8230;u..Guaa!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I tried to raise myself up in a panic, one after another someone kicked at my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I rolled on the ground to escape the pain, a cloud of dry earth drifted up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what is happening. My thoughts are not catching up with me at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look up, my face contorted in pain and see a group of men, their faces hidden by masks and knitted hats, looking down at me as I remain slumped over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are six of them. They were wearing school uniforms, so they seemed to be students at our school, but they were not wearing school badges or yearbooks, and there was nothing to indicate who they were at a glance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of them is holding what looks like a wooden sword. Apparently, I was hit on the head with that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Seriously&#8230;&#8230;I could have died if you hit me with that thing’.</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They may not be the kind of people who are used to fighting. But because they don&#8217;t know how to take it easy, I&#8217;m more afraid of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what are you doing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow, that hurts! Ugh&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I curled myself up like a beetle larva and endured, but each kick was absurdly heavy and hurt beyond recognition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the masked men had kicked me in a scattered manner, one of them stomped on my side and raised his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Excited scruffy voice. But it sounds a little juvenile somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bastard! Where&#8217;d you hide Rin-chan! Aaan!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U,uuu…wha,what are you…talking about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be stupid! You&#8217;re the one who took her! Aaan!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking&#8230;&#8230;about. Uuu&#8230; you&#8217;ve got the wrong &#8230;&#8230; person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guy with the wooden sword in his hand shouted in a pissed-off manner, and then he kicked with all his might into my side.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They&#8217;re reckless. You could have at least broken a rib, &#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each blow is an all-out. Too desperate. It seems they are not used to fighting after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, let him stand up, we&#8217;ll take him before someone else gets through.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oraa!! Get up!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I do as I&#8217;m told and stand up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Six against one and I&#8217;m already a wreck. The masked men have completely underestimated me. The only chance is now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I stood up, I pretended to stagger and rammed my head between the masked men. I guess they weren&#8217;t paying attention at all. And it made them completely unable to react. So with that opportunity, I rolled out of their encirclement and ran at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha? You bastard! Don&#8217;t let him get away!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, my slow legs are guaranteed to be slow. Even if I were to escape at a moment&#8217;s notice, it is obvious that they would soon catch up with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I desperately moved my legs, shook off the hand that was reaching for me,and somehow managed to run into the public toilet at the corner of the park.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dirty Japanese-style toilet. I enter its private room and hurriedly lock the door. A beat or so later, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Don</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">!　and a kicking sound echoed through the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t you run away, you piece of shit!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He wants to stick his face in the toilet bowl!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s nowhere to run now! This is what I call a rat in a bag!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, this would be an absolute death sentence. It was as if I had jumped into my own deathtrap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I have that ability.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I call up the 『Door』  on the wall of a toilet room, its wall, and roll inside. Beyond that is the 『Bedroom of the Confinement King』. Around the doorway of the room, where a large canopied bed sits, I fell down on the long furred red carpet, sticking my nose into the carpet.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is bad&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m getting dizzy’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I activate the 『periscope』 while holding the back of my head, which is dripping with blood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of my eyes, the scene in the dirty toilet I had just jumped into appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the first time I&#8217;ve used 『periscope』 and apparently it&#8217;s not very useful. The view was limited to the front of the door, and I couldn&#8217;t move from there. But I can hear the sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They probably think I am still there. They were kicking the toilet door hard. The door rattles and shakes in time with the loud blows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, the door opened with a loud bang as the bolt lock bent with a cracking sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, he&#8217;s not here! What&#8217;s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A guy with a wooden sword in his hand is seriously peering into the toilet.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stare at his face but I can&#8217;t make out who he is at all, just from the part of his eyes that is not hidden by the mask.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shit! I don&#8217;t get it! He can&#8217;t have gone far! Look for him! Look for them!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I watched the masked men disappear, I felt my tense body relax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lay sprawled out on the carpet and let out a loud sigh. Instantly I felt a throbbing head wound tingling.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Owow…….I&#8217;m the one who doesn&#8217;t understand what happened. Anyway, the head injury looks pretty deep and needs to be treated quickly’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lili!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s up, Devi&#8230;&#8230;UWa!? W-what happened, Devi!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she appeared, Lili shouted, who dexterously jumped her body while floating in mid-air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8230;. it&#8217;s fine, just call Torture”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuh…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Torture’s treatment was over, I let out the breath I had been holding in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wound was completely closed and there was no pain at all. But still, it was a terrible thing. If it hadn&#8217;t been for Torture, who had the power to heal, I might have been in a lot of trouble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell happened, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili was surprisingly upset. She looks into my face with concern, and I smile at her and tell her what happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was attacked. I don&#8217;t know who they were, but&#8230;.. about six of them. They were in uniform, so I&#8217;m pretty sure they were from my school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Attacked?!! We can still chase them, Devi! I&#8217;m going to catch them and beat them to a pulp, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What&#8217;s a GittanGittan&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Lili uses this paraphrase instead of saying it outright ‘beat them to a pulp’ hence Fumio talk to himself what </span><span style="font-weight: 400">ギッタンギッタン </span><span style="font-weight: 400">is]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head slightly while smiling at Lili, who was so excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, we don&#8217;t need to capture them. If they go missing, it will be a problem&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, let&#8217;s Freesia mark at least one of them so that she can identify them later”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mark?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Succubus&#8217;s mark, Devi. It is a mark to claim that male is theirs, Devi. Such power is only given to the Succubus Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili disappeared for a moment and returned less than a minute later. Perhaps she went to give instructions to Freesia–san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure you&#8217;re okay, Devi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, thanks to Torture”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, Lili still looked worried.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What this&#8230;there&#8217;s something unexpectedly cute about her’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what I thought──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230;you still have an ugly fat face,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take back my previous statement. I knew this guy was the devil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t talk like that…It&#8217;s quite hurtful.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With pursed lips, I let my thoughts wander about the people who attacked me</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh, they did say something about&#8230;.. Rin-chan.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I think about it calmly, there is a face that comes to mind by the name of Rin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chestnut-coloured hair up to her back, braided on either side of her head. The face of a girl with a mischievous smile that gives the impression of a cat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rin Fukuda, that girl again&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a real plague. For the time being, I will take my anger out on Kyoko but she&#8217;s her own person, and I&#8217;ll have to give her a firm talking-to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the guys from earlier were asking, [Where did you take her?] .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The simple answer is that she&#8217;s missing and they think I&#8217;m the one who took her. &#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What the hell is that about? That doesn&#8217;t make any sense at all.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s hot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I stepped out of the airport, the strong sunshine burned my eyes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it was evening, the sun was still quite high. Summer sky. Summer was here, one step earlier than in Honshu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I dragged my heavy luggage toward the cab rank at the end of a roundabout lined with blue banners that said 『Welcome to Okinawa.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because it was still early in the summer holidays, the airport as a whole had a somewhat deserted atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hotel where I’m staying is a resort hotel with a private beach, located outside the city centre.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since it was not the on-season, I was able to make a reservation online at a reasonable price.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, a spa and beauty treatment are included. However, it seems to be in an inconvenient location and the only means of transport is by car. Of course, I don&#8217;t have a licence, so I had to take a taxi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The driver put my luggage in the boot of the car and I sat in the back seat and told him where I was going.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To FW Paradise Hotel, please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The car starts to move slowly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I wonder if it&#8217;s about time for that creep to get beaten up…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this in mind, I gazed out of the car window at the endless rows of tropical plants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And who, in the end, was it that did that to Captain?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All of them, almost all of them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was at the dinner table. Shima-senpai frowns with a turkey leg in her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She and Takasago-senpai did not return from the breeding ground until lunchtime. It seems that they spent a lot of time interrogating the pigs.  Shima-senpai probably didn&#8217;t allow Takasago-senpai to go home, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The only one who didn&#8217;t join in the lynching was Shiratori”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiratori-senpai?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That seemed very surprising to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Konparu always hated Hatsu-chan, so I thought this girl must be doing it. And when I interrogated her, I just focused on her toes, and she easily vomited the truth within five strikes. She said it wasn&#8217;t just her”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But how can they all be&#8230;&#8230;doing that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to Yui-chan&#8217;s question, Shima-senpai holds up two fingers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The first one is because Hatsu-chan defended Amemiya yesterday and everyone was penalised”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I can understand that. If I had been flogged a lot and was exhausted and then I had to be whipped again, I would be very angry&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The other reason is because&#8230;&#8230;Hatsu-chan is depraved.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;ve all lost their minds. After just a few days, they&#8217;re like livestock. Shallow, nasty pigs. All they can think about is how to get away from trouble. If only one of them had not fallen to the same level as them&#8230;.they would be pissed off”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s cruel!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the athletics club as a whole, it can hardly be said that everyone got on well together. The relationship between Yui-chan and Amemiya-senpai is obvious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I couldn&#8217;t even imagine that they would band together and lynch one person. And moreover, it&#8217;s that Captain Tashiro, who was relied upon and respected by everyone&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan squinted at Shima-senpai as she blew on her gratin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But don&#8217;t you have problems too? Shima-senpai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean! I&#8217;d like to say that&#8230;&#8230;but I think you&#8217;re right. From their perspective, we&#8217;re favouring Hatsu-chan. That&#8217;s how it is”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai then threw the turkey leg bone on the plate and grabbed the roast beef.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s hard not being able to treat her, but for now,Takasago and I have thoroughly beaten anyone who messes with Hatsu-chan, so I think she&#8217;s safe now. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is that really the case &#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have nothing but a bad feeling about this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I remember that today, Captain threw herself on the ground to protect Saito-san from me. Tonight, too, all of them are probably being penalised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan glanced at me as I slumped down and shrug her shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the end, no one bothered to find out who the four people were&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t talk about this as if it were someone else&#8217;s problem. You didn&#8217;t even try to find them in the first place&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it would be fine if it stayed that way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere from then on was somehow heavy. In spite of the luxuriousness of the meal, the conversation was not lively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The four of us&#8230;..but I’m not sure about Takasago-senpai and Yui-chan. At least for Shima-senpai and I feel that our minds have been worn out a lot.</span></p>

<p><strong> Seventh Day of Girls’ Track and Field Team Confinement</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu-chan&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next morning, stepping into the breeding grounds for feeding, I heard Shima-senpai muttering in dismay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed her gaze and I saw Captain Tashiro lying there limp. Her face is pale and sallow, and although her chest is slightly rising and falling, she is extremely weak. Insect breath, so to speak. She had clearly suffered an even worse lynching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu-chan! Hatsu-chan!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps her consciousness is clouded, she shows no sign of even replying to Shima-senpai&#8217;s frantic calls. She merely leaks out a moaning voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai tried to rush over to her, but the sackhead  lady stood in her way. She pointed a huge machete at Shima-senpai and moved her hand to point at a bucket of food. Apparently, she was trying to say,『now is feeding time』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuh&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai bites her lower lip regretfully and hurriedly starts preparing the food. There is nothing we can do until the pigs have finished their feeding. The only thing we can do now is to finish feeding as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai and I were in a hurry, Yui-chan didn&#8217;t seem particularly flustered, and Takasago-senpai proceeded to prepare for the feeding as usual in a troublesome manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, eat!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Yui-chan announced this, the pigs rushed to the feed bins. Ugly pigs, their mouths smeared with milk, gobbled up the food. The disgust that welled up in me formed wrinkles between my eyebrows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Captain Tashiro remained slumped in the corner of the room during the feeding, not moving an inch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment Konparu-senpai kicked the captain in the back as if to say she was in the way, an unspeakable emotion swirled deep inside me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You female pig!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was about to raise my whip, the sackhead lady stood in front of me, and I hurriedly back away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found myself surprised to find that I no longer hesitated to use the whip to strike people. I was astonished that I had raised the whip as a spinal reflex.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Weird, this is not right&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However much I may think so, this is the reality. If this situation continues, I may no longer feel guilty about whipping people up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feed bins were emptied and we cleaned up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With tears in her eyes, Shima-senpai hurriedly carried the feed bins out into the corridor, and when it was all over, she stepped back into the breeding area without a pause.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu-chan!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shima-senpai rushed towards Captain, the pigs around her looked at her with a frightened but somewhat 『Suck it up』 grin on their faces.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How can you make that kind of face!　People are dying! You&#8217;re killing her!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost at the same time as I was biting my back teeth, Shima-senpai held up the director&#8217;s body and called out in a tearful voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu-chan, get a grip, Uchi, Do you recognize me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Uchi is the context not referring a house, it’s ‘me’ ウチ]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Ah, of course&#8230;. Stupid&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Captain&#8217;s eyes are unfocused as she smiles weakly. I don&#8217;t even know if she can see Shima-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anta!　The one with a sack on your head! Please!　Please treat Hatsu-chan, help her!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai appeals to the sackhead lady standing around the entrance, but she just shakes her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuhh…Which one of you&#8230;..did this to Hatsu-chan!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking around at the pigs with bloodshot eyes, Shima-senpai barked. To this, Shiratori-senpai responded, shrugging her shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s the same as yesterday. Everyone except me”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys, you&#8217;ve never learnt your lesson!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the head of the department in her arms, when Shima-senpai shouted loudly, the pigs jumped up and down and backed away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Shiratori-senpai looked at Shima-senpai and opened her mouth without changing her colour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s you who&#8217;s at fault, Shima-senpai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did you say!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you think you&#8217;ve punished everyone who laid a hand on Captain but they&#8217;re getting used to being whipped, all of them. What you&#8217;ve done is taught them that if they all do it together, the number of times each of them gets whipped is not that big a deal.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ghh…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai clenches her back teeth in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu-chan defended you guys! She refused to become an Inquisitor because she didn&#8217;t want to beat you guys! And yet you guys!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai barks like she is vomiting blood. Yui-chan tapped her on the shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Calm down. If you&#8217;re that excited, you&#8217;re going to make a mistake”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How can I calm down! This is crazy!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not crazy. It&#8217;s just the way it is. When they see someone above them, they are jealous, when they see someone below them, they are relieved. If they can&#8217;t pull you down, they flatter you, if they think they can, they drag you down. They are creatures who cannot sleep in anxiety unless they keep checking their position, above them, below them&#8230;&#8230;these people are now subhuman pigs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I knew it well before I came here. I have learned first-hand that the world is a place where people come together to beat up the weak and vulnerable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan smiled a somewhat sad smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is insane! People are dying!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;re not people. They are pigs. Unfortunately, no matter what you think of the director, a pig is a pig. They are not like us inquisitors, aren&#8217;t they, Amemiya?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes. It is as you say, Yui-sama!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed that Amemiya-senpai was standing by Yui-chan&#8217;s side, with her legs spread in an M-shape with her secret parts fully exposed, the so-called dog&#8217;s pose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ufufu, you&#8217;ve done exactly what I trained you to do~. I don&#8217;t hate smart girls. Amemiya&#8230;&#8230;is there any stupid pig who was talking bad about me?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes! Adachi and Saito clucked their tongues after Yui-sama walked out!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, those two are the ones who are going to be whipped today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Adachi-senpai and Saito-san start cursing Amemiya-senpai. However, Amemiya-senpai remain unafraid of them. She was being patted on the head by Yui-chan and had an enraptured face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here again, a hierarchy is about to be established. By appeasing Yui-chan, Amemiya-senpai will have power over the other pigs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Insanity. Those above beat those below them, and those below them beat those further down. The repetition continues. There is no end in sight. I felt as if I was being told that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was unintentionally stunned, Shima-senpai asked Shiratori-senpai in a voice that seemed to stifle her emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shiratori&#8230;&#8230;how can I help Hatsu-chan&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha&#8230;really, you&#8217;re not very sociable, are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai smiles wryly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How to help? Is there? Is there such a thing?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stood there stunned, Shima-senpai suddenly turned her head and smiled at me. A smile like that, somewhat weakly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe&#8230;&#8230;I’m really scared, though. It seems this is the only way to save Hatsu-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Shima-senpai put Tashiro-senpai&#8217;s head on her lap, looked into her face and began to speak to her in a trembling voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, Hatsu-chan&#8230;..it&#8217;s almost summer holidays, we used to go to the swimming pool together.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Aaa..it was nice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A weak voice spills from Captain’s lips, who opens her eyes slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the way home, there were lots of sunflowers, and I bought ice cream at my grandpa&#8217;s candy shop on the corner, and drank&#8230;&#8230; ramune”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grandpa? I thought it was&#8230;&#8230;your grandma?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Shima-senpai quietly meditated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her lips distorted in self-mockery. I understood it. I understood it all too well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Don’t do it』I almost said that, but I kept my mouth shut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sackhead lady was standing behind Shima-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai slowly lays Captain’s head on the floor, then stands up and looks at the sackhead lady.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it&#8217;s not a pig, but an inquisitor, you&#8217;ll treat her, right? Hatsu and I will switch places!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hand is on Shima-senpai’s collar and she tears off her clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Captain was left to her own devices. The sackhead lady, who was immediately stripped Shima-senpai naked, put a red rope on her with a terribly skillful hand and completed the tortoise-shell bondage in no time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shima&#8230;..Senpa,ii.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Moribe. Please be as gentle as possible&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai smiles jokingly. The sackhead lady throws her out on the floor and walks over to Captain Tashiro and holds her body in her arms. She then walked out of the breeding ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A stunned silence descends on the dimly lit menagerie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as soon as the sackhead lady  was out of sight, the pigs all burst out laughing and surrounded the Shima-Senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahahahaha! You&#8217;ve fallen! Finally, you&#8217;ve fallen!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll take good care of you, Shima-senpai”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You whip me up pretty good, so brace yourself”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Konparu-senpai immediately tried to kick Shima-senpai&#8217;s feet and I hurriedly raised the whip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s enough! Stay away from Shima-senpai!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I whipped the floor and looked at the pigs while protecting Shima-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pigs were grinning at me from afar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it. I can&#8217;t protect her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pass through the door prepared by the princess and go down to the park where FumiFumi-sama was attacked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time was already dusk, the sky, separated by electric cables, was an azure colour, and the other side of the roofs of the residential area was coloured with a gradation of red and blue, and the street lights were beginning to shine.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, shall I look for our prey then?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Succubus nose is a sharp nose. If I concentrate on my sense of smell, I can see the group of people, cloaked in the lingering scent ofFumiFumi-sama, moving away from me. It is about 400 metres to the north-east.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then let&#8217;s begin.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I start to move. I jump from roof to roof of the house and capture the target in the street below. It certainly appears to be a gentleman of the same age as FumiFumi-sama. It’s smell was quite delicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will mark&#8230;&#8230;but Ohime-sama should have allowed me to have at least a nibble or two.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, it is almost time for dinner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My personal preference is for mature, dirty old men, but sometimes a blue banana is not so bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I listened carefully to their conversation on the roof and I could definitely hear the voice of the gentleman in question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn, I still don&#8217;t get it. Disappearing from a toilet cubicle, is that an illusion?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, well, I cracked his head open,  so the creep must have learned his lesson”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t think&#8230;&#8230;he&#8217;s dead, do you?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think he’s going to die from that. It&#8217;s even worse that we couldn&#8217;t find out where Rin-chan is..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are talking about the attack on FumiFumi-sama. From what they have said, they seem to think that the person called 『Rin-chan』 is the one that Fumihumi has captured.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, reason and logic are irrelevant. They harmed FumiFumi-sama and Ohime-sama is angry. That is the only fact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I jumped down from the roof and landed right in front of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A heavy thud echoes from the roof, but it is not because I am heavy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I weigh about the same as four koalas. I will not answer any tactless questions such as why I compare myself to a cute little thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A maid fell from the sky!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No wonder they are surprised. It doesn&#8217;t usually rain maids. The day a weather forecaster starts saying it&#8217;s sunny and sometimes maid, you&#8217;ll probably be questioning his and your sanity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, amongst the retreating crowd, there was only one person who, without fear or trepidation, came towards me. He is the type of gentleman who belongs to the tribe of [Chara-Otoko].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gentleman was very unreserved in thrusting his face at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my hand around the neck of that gentleman and took his lips as it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first. the gents around him say, [Oh!] [Really? ] [Amazing!] [Lascivious woman!] but when I sucked up his sperm in one go,only then the other gents around me were scared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「「HIIIIIIII」」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, the other gentlemen gasp and retreat at the sight of the Chara-Otoko collapsing in a heap.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Haa&#8230;.I am disappointed. Is it good that it&#8217;s so thin? If it&#8217;s so thin at this age, it&#8217;s no wonder the birth rate is declining.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s truly lamentable. At the beginning of the Meiji era, many of the gentlemen had rich and thick sperm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was when I was a Taifu and lived in Yoshiwara. I was once invited to ride in a carriage by a gentleman with a fine moustache, and we spent the whole night in the carriage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I later found out that he was the first Prime Minister of this country, and that the event of that day is recorded in his biography as the first car sex in Japan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oo, oi, you all right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the fuck did you do to him, you fuck!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other gentlemen are on edge as they help the shattered, limp gentleman. I have already put up a ward to block recognition and avoid people, so there is no problem when they make a fuss, but it is also a hassle to answer every single question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around at them and activated the lewd demon Succubus’s unique skill 『charm』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there was no way an ordinary human could resist. Immediately, the light vanished from their eyes and their gaze changed to a vacant stare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are now crazy about me and will listen to anything I say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, gentlemen, please take off your underwear for the time being.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gentleman who had just sucked the semen out of him, still seemed to be unable to move but the others quickly took off their underwear and lined up side by side with their lower halves exposed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it is not popular, it is in a residential area. In normal circumstances, this is undeniably a reportable incident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I examine the items one by one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, they are all average. They do not have the same kind of magnificence that makes me gasp in surprise, like FumiFumi-sama. One of them has run out of energy and cannot stand up, so I have five penises left. Well, even if I have five penises, I can fill my stomach to a certain extent.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ancient warlords of the Warring States period also said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was said that even if one penis was not enough, five penises in a bundle would do the trick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, my dear, lie down there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let the one with the best penis lie down and I take off my maid&#8217;s uniform. I’m is not wearing any underwear from the start but I wear a garter belt. Naturally. It is a wonderfull taste as a maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I straddle the gentleman and begin to slowly lower my hips. With my fingertips, I pick up the gentleman&#8217;s object and guide it into the wet and obscene meat cave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn….aa….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensation of nubby vaginal flesh being pushed open. The size is somewhat short, but not bad. When I had finished taking the meat spear all the way to the base, I leaned forward and lifted my buttocks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, the next one, please. You, over there, please come.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The brown-haired gentleman gripped me firmly around the waist and thrust his cock into the unholy hole, although it was a rather painful position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooo&#8230;.. oh, mmm, an&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh &#8230;.. you surprisingly have a good penis.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not big enough, but the thickness is quite good. The hardness is not bad. It is a nice pressure feeling. The tip is even more slippery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them began to move their hips as if they couldn&#8217;t hold back any longer.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> gusari, gusari, gusari</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> penises thrusting in and out of the shivering flirtatious flesh, echoes through the residential streets at dinner time. This must be their first time. Their movements are awkward but impulsive and violent. Which is a good thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nngh, anh, ah, ah&#8230;&#8230;now, the rest of you, nngh, please come here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The remaining three men surround me and thrust their penises out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took the front gentleman&#8217;s penis in my mouth, followed by those of the two gentlemen on either side.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oya? The gentleman on the right still has a foreskin? That&#8217;s good. I will have him skinned by the end of the day.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, a lewd expression is important in fellatio. The face is shallow, with the nose stretched out and my eyes looking up. While I sucked the front gentleman&#8217;s cock hard, I rubbed the left and right gentlemen&#8217;s cock with my hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“[Kuaaa,aaaaa….], [Haa….haa..Ha…], [Gu,uaaaa], [Aaaa], [O,ooooo]”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rough breathing and the moans of the gentlemens can be heard in unison. Oh, what a lewd three-dimensional sound. It is really pleasant to the ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I look down at the face of the gentleman who is thrusting up from below, I see a really dishevelled face, debauched with pleasure. If I look up at the man who I am sucking, his eyes are closed and his brow is wrinkled as if he is enduring pain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the untrained eye, it may look like five men forcibly raping one woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, it was the other way around.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ufufu…it&#8217;s a good opportunity for me, isn&#8217;t it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it looks like I’m being gangbanged, it&#8217;s fun to enjoy that situation. It is easier for a succubus to show a gentleman a lascivious dream than it is to breathe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These gentlemen are vile rapists, forcibly raping maids who pass by &#8211; I have poured these false memories into their brains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I saw that their bodies trembled, their expressions twisted viciously. Se・Bon!　They have a splendidly evil face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heeheehee! You perverted maid! Don&#8217;t take pleasure in having your ass raped!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The brown-haired gentleman twisted my breasts wildly as he thrust his penis into my unholy hole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Puhah! N–no, please don&#8217;t do that! You,you’re all the future generati–ahh,Aaaaaa”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I spit his penis out and raised my voice, the gentleman in front of me grabbed my hair and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, You! Who told you to take my dick off your mouth?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S,sorry..fugooo..Jyubo,Jyubo”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He forced his own cock into my mouth and thrust it down my throat even harder. The piston movement is really violent. It&#8217;s a really bad blowjob.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How does it taste? How does her pussy taste?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehe, not good enough.. It&#8217;s squeaky and entwined like a vine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The brown-haired gentleman, who is thrusting up from below, responds to the brown-haired gentleman&#8217;s question with a look of delight as he rocks my voluptuous naked body back and forth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gentlemen on either side of me were grinning, pressing their glans against my cheeks, sniffing my hair, reaching into my breasts and plucking my nipples, doing exactly as they pleased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no&#8230;&#8230;ugh&#8230;Uuuuu&#8230;&#8230; oh, forgive me&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They look more and more aroused when I pretend to be reluctant, stifling the excitement in my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aaa&#8230;&#8230; how wonderful it is to be the sole recipient of the desires of the gentlemen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is also wonderful to be treated roughly. The euphoria of masochism surged through me as I was tortured by a storm of humiliation and the pleasure of almost debauchery numbed the marrow of my brain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Puhhh, ahahan&#8230;..I don&#8217;t want to&#8230;..aaaaaahhh a&#8230; Please forgive me already…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who will forgive you, you bitch! Come on, Suck harder!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!Mnphh, Jyubo,Jyubo..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must have been a sight to behold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle of a residential area, in the middle of the street, I was stripped naked, raped in every hole and have their raging penises rubbed all over my pure white soft skin, which has not a single stain on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The title of the film is 『Miserable Maid, Three Holes Violated by Animal Lust』. It&#8217;s thrilling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyahahaha, you&#8217;re feeling it, you perverted maid!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if in response to my sucking voice, one of the gentlemen lords sneered at me, the miserable maid.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aaa, wonderful, please curse me more, please humiliate me&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While giving blow-job services, I constantly emit charming tones from the tip of my nose and boldly wiggles my perky waist to further arouse the lust of the gentlemen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t rest, come on! Shake your hips”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nm,Nnnn,nnnmmm…Jyuru,nnnmmm!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mouth is being fucked and my hole in the front and back are being penetrated, causing the lower half of my body to tingle as their movement increases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gentleman, thrusting from below, was intoxicated by the feel of the melting layers of flesh and sent his penis to the bottom of my womb, while the brown-haired man who fucked my unholy hole from behind covered me up and squeezed my breasts recklessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While rubbing the two penises with my hands, One of them pinched my nipple and the one I’m sucking until just now suddenly shoved his penis into the back of my throat, sending shivers down my spine with the pleasure of suffocating abuse. The mucous membrane of my secret garden was already melted and every time I was thrust deeply and forcefully, a burning pleasure ran through my whole body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gent&#8217;s breath began to turn urgent, and soon──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m cuming, I&#8217;m cuming!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m cumming, too! I&#8217;ll make her swallow it all!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One by one, the gentlemen began to moan and groan.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is it over already?&#8230;..Well, they&#8217;ve lasted long enough.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first to cum was the brown-haired man who was penetrating the unholy hole, followed by the one penetrating from below.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「I&#8217;m coming!」」”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byuru! Burururururu!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the two holes,the gents&#8217; desires popped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the gentleman in front of me grabbed me by the hair with an impatient look on his face. Then, in time with the pitch of his ejaculation, he pushed his penis into my oral cavity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;n&#8230;&#8230;mugg&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I drool and wriggle as the sperm shoots down my throat. Furthermore, the penises in my left and right hands trembled slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Khh, I&#8217;m going to spray you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Releasing!!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byuru! Burururururu!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gents on both sides of the room are splashing with joy, and the white fluid arches down on my hair, face and breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The expressions on their faces as they climax are adorable but only for a moment. As soon as they have finished releasing their semen, all five of them fall down into a crumpled heap with their mouths sloppily open and their eyes white.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is exactly what it means to release semen into a Succubus. Originally, I would have squeezed them until they were nothing but a corpse. Only for this time, the purpose is just marking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cannot disobey the instructions from Ohime-sama.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘In this case, the brown-haired gentleman was in relatively good shape&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just the other day, I got rid of my old semen milk. When Ohime-sama has finished her business, I’lll ask her to give him to me as a replacement.</span></p>
