<h1>The Devil&#8217;s  Campaign Girl.</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a heavy wooden door, like a foreign temple.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door suddenly appeared in the middle of my room.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Wh, Wh–What is this?’</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a few moments ago, I looked up a cute idol I saw on a singing show online and discovered that her age and birthday month were the same as mine, and with a small sense of satisfaction, I looked behind me and before I knew it, it was there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is scary. Extremely scary. It&#8217;s just plain scary.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door is half open. As far as I can see from here, it&#8217;s pitch black inside and I can&#8217;t see anything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fearfully walked towards the door, switched on the light on my phone and looked in through the gap.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W- wh,What is going on?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side of the door is a stone room about six tatami mats in size. The room has the atmosphere of a dungeon, like the ones you often see in the movies. When I peered into the back of the room with dismay, I could only see the back of the door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does that mean it&#8217;s connected to&#8230;.somewhere else? Like that Doraemon’s door?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U–n, close, but not quite.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> I suddenly heard the voice of a young, innocent girl in my ear. As I turned my head, my back was suddenly and I fell forwards towards the door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Owh&#8230;&#8230;What the hell!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha! You were surprised, weren&#8217;t you? Ne,You were surprised!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiii!! W-Wh-W-Wha eh! Uaa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I backpedal frantically, flailing my legs like an upturned bug.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi! You don&#8217;t have to be so scared.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-Wha, What is going on? Why are you floating!? Wait, I mean, Who are you?!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, okay, I&#8217;m not gonna hurt you, just calm down, okay?　Alright, take a deep breath. Breathe in!　and Breathe out!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Confused, I do as I&#8217;m told, taking a deep breath and let it out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">U–n, deep breathing is great. I feel a bit calmer.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm, yeah, maybe&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at her again, she is quite a beautiful girl.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In terms of appearance, she would probably be around junior high school age.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has a childlike, pretty face, red eyes that seem to be coloured contact lenses, and a short cut with fiery red curly hair.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two twisted horns grow from her temples, and fang-like double teeth peek out from her smiling mouth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The clothing has a bondage vibe covering her modest chest and the crotch area. If you imagine the stereotypical succubus cosplay, it probably won&#8217;t be too far off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, um, who are you &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her, she seemed to think a little, and she put her finger on her chin and replied</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I had to say, I&#8217;d say I’m a campaign girl.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Campaign&#8230;..gya, lu?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup,a campaign girl.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I was making a rather strange face at this point because the answer was so unexpected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that&#8217;s right, isn&#8217;t it? Because I don&#8217;t know what it means.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without regard to my bewilderment, she was all smiles and raised her voice with a loud cracker, ringing loudly, wondering where she had taken it from.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m a devil&#8217;s support campaign! Congratulations on your win, ────!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D–devil?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, the Devil.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O&#8230;.O–en..”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Campaign.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turns the corner of her mouth up in a grin as she confronts me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I-I-I- I! I did not apply for that type of position!!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she held up her index finger in front of me and clicked her tongue, [tsk, tsk, tsk].</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A bit annoying. But cute. Frustrating but cute.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not like you’re applying for a job or anything. It&#8217;s a campaign to celebrate the 10,000th anniversary of the founding of the kingdom of hell, so we&#8217;re going to unconditionally support the talented people we&#8217;ve listed here!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes? A talented person? Me?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, you. You may not realise it, but out of millions of candidates, you were by far the most talented!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…Is that really true? Heeee, so that’s how it is.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right! You&#8217;ve got a talent for being an incredibly detasteable villain!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; No, I&#8217;m not a bad guy.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but retrace her words back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s so misguided. I may look like this, but I am a good person to the extent that I put every penny of change in the donation box at the convenience store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now that may be so! But, but! Your talent is really outstanding. Your talent for evil that no con artist or murderer could ever hope to match, even if they were a bunch of idiots!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you trying to humiliate me?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m not! It&#8217;s a huge achievement–!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shakes her head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In other words, this is what I&#8217;m saying!　The more evil that spreads in this world, the more powerful we demons become, so we&#8217;re going to support talented people with all our might in the demon world.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And that&#8217;s me?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The self-proclaimed campaigner nods cockily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For it to come to this. There was no way I could be deceived by such a thing.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, I understand now. I understand now. All of this is fake, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s the kind that fools amateurs. Where&#8217;s the camera? You&#8217;re a TV personality, aren&#8217;t you?　There&#8217;s no such thing as a pretty devil.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No—! I’m really a demon! I may be cute, but I’m really a devil!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t deny the cute part&#8230;&#8230;but you&#8217;re not the least bit devilish when you say it like that.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she looked a little hurt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m really a devil, Devi! I&#8217;m the Devil Devi!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sloppy?! Your characterisation is sloopy!　You can&#8217;t be a devil even if you end it with [devi]!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyways, The more evil you do, the more powerful we, the demons become against the angels.”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it, Devi?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because, you know, I&#8217;m supporting you, so you want me to do something bad, right?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, Devi! I&#8217;m not forcing you to do anything bad, Devi. You just have to behave according to your desires, Devi. You don&#8217;t have to do anything bad because I support you.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if she is just stubborn or that she doesn’t want to give up but for some reason or another she has continued to add the word “devi” to the end of her sentences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it would be a pity to ridicule and tease her any further, so I decided not to mention that in particular.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But that kind of thing, you know. Don&#8217;t they take souls, or end up self-destructing with ironic consequences in the end?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know. In Manga and short stories, the end result is disastrous.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bullshit?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup,yup.Good and evil are the same thing, Devi. In short, this campaign is to do good. What angels and devils are doing is the same Devi. Who decided that good is right and evil is wrong in the first place?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, because&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s right, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s not! It&#8217;s really like black and white in reversi, Devi. It&#8217;s just that right now the angels are so powerful that good is right&#8230;..Devi.”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s the way it is, Devi. If you win, you are the government. If evil prevails, then evil is righteous, Devi. And you have a huge evil in your heart, Devi. In the future it will become uncontrollable, but if you don&#8217;t do anything about it, you will become just a small villain and you will spend the rest of your life going back and forth between prison and this place.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not a bad student, and I even got an A in my mock examinations for the school of my choice. I&#8217;m one of the serious students. I&#8217;m not good at sports and I have bad eyesight, but my mother said that it doesn&#8217;t matter once I get out in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By this time, I was having a bit of fun with her with this otherworldly exchange.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What am I supposed to do with this gloomy, cramped stone room I&#8217;ve been given? She wants me to use it as a storage room?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken aback by the unexpectedly shabby story. She, however, confidently proclaimed it with all her heart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Precisely the ability to create this room, Devi!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.doubtful.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, well, hear me out first,Devi!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her explanation that followed was quite long. To be honest, it was long to the point of being tiresome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was tedious, so I&#8217;ll try to summarise it briefly as follows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One, this door can be called anywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two, This door can only be seen by the owner and those authorised by the owner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three, Please note that if a room is removed, the objects inside will also disappear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Four, Once a person has set foot in a room, they cannot go outside without the owner&#8217;s permission.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five, As my level increases, my abilities will be upgraded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How you use it is up to you. You can use it as a shed or a hideout. No penalty whatsoever. Not a bad deal, is it? Um, I think your name is&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is Kijima Fumio.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, Fumi Fumi.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? That name seems to be kicked by a foot!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it fine! Anyways, I will leave you with this ability! I’m going now, Bye.. Devi.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She left behind the 『Devi』 as if it had been taken from her and suddenly vanished, just as she had appeared.</span></p>
