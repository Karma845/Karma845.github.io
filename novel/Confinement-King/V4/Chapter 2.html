<h3>Chapter 2: Hatsu Tashiro was Still Hatsu Tashiro, Even Though She had Fallen</h3>

<p><strong>2.1 - When the Label Came Off</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu Tashiro&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt as if someone had called my name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if emerging from the depths of the water, my consciousness slowly took shape. With the awakening of my ego, my whole body creaked and the pain gradually returned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Where am I&#8230;..?’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something warm enveloped my wounded body. As I twisted and turned, the sound of water echoed in the darkness. If I moved around, I felt a rippling sensation on my skin.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hot water? I feel&#8230;..calm’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone was holding my body. The warmth of our bare skin was touching each other. I felt a sense of relief spreading like rippling ripples from where we were touching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu…u…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to move around and I instantly felt pain. It was as if it wasn&#8217;t my own body. I was so exhausted by the violence thrown at me by my own club members that I couldn&#8217;t even speak properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you awoken?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard a voice in my ear. A calm, gentle&#8230;&#8230;a man&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened my eyes dimly and saw the outline of what seemed to be a boy&#8217;s face in the darkness. Apparently, I was being held by the man and soaking in the hot water.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Who…?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Confinement King&#8230;&#8230;that’s what they call me.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A shiver ran down my spine. Was that not the name of the villain who had thrown us into this hell?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was most terrifying was that this man replied to the voice in my mind.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘W,what are you going to do to me&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m here to help you, Hatsu Tashiro.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Help&#8230;..? What are you saying, you idiot? It was you who did this to me in the first place.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m glad I made it in time. It sounds like you were treated very badly by the club members. It must have been hard for you. But it&#8217;s all right now.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It was your fault that I was treated so badly!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I howled in my chest, I heard the sound of a sigh leaking in my ear.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Indeed &#8230;.. this man can hear my heart speak&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can&#8217;t be helped if you feel that way&#8230;&#8230;.But think about it again. Are you dying because you were whipped? Or are you dying because I did something to you?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s not because of the&#8230;..whipping. It is true that I was&#8230;&#8230; beaten up by my friend&#8230;&#8230;club members, but &#8230;&#8230;.it&#8217;s because you confined us!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even If I confine them, why did you all start hurting each other? Is that what you call a friend?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu…u…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost shouted. However, the only thing that came out of my mouth was a grunt.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don&#8217;t make excuses! It&#8217;s because you pushed us into a corner! People are weak creatures!’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, they are. They are weak creatures. That&#8217;s why I have to protect the people I care about. I locked you up because some of you have shamed my loved ones. They stripped her naked, took photos of her and gave it to lowlifes who demanded her body. And the photos are still in the hands of those four people. Now, what would you do?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Uh, ugh, sorry about that&#8230;&#8230;. But!!! That doesn&#8217;t mean you have to involve everyone who isn&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;involved. I could help you identify the culprits, and talk&#8230;&#8230;to them’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if those pictures leak while you&#8217;re doing that? My loved ones could be hurt very badly by it, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T,that’s….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve been watching you. I&#8217;ve seen you try to be right and to be strong. Are you right now, protecting the guilty and allowing people I care about to get hurt?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That&#8217;s not what I mean!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I raised my voice in my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the statement that he&#8217;d been watching me for a long time caught me off guard. Did this mean that this man had known me for some time?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean then?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I told you, people are weak. We will make mistakes. We hate our sins, but we do not hate others. I was just trying to protect the members of the club, just like you protecting your loved ones. And I did not approve of hurting your loved ones!’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand that people are weak. You put yourself on the line to protect the weak. But what was the result? Those weak people almost killed you. Why was that?　Was it because the people you were trying to protect were evil?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No! Because of their weakness!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then let me ask you this. Isn&#8217;t it arrogant for you to think that others are weak and you have to protect them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No, it&#8217;s not…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s arrogance. And before that, it&#8217;s an illusion. You are weak. You were almost killed because you are weak.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘B,but I think I did the right thing. And I&#8217;m even proud of the fact that I risked my life to do what I believe is right.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The right thing huh? ….Then, then let me ask you once more. What do you think about the fact that your friends are now also on the verge of death because of your complacency in trying to fulfil what you believe is right?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Wh-what do you mean?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the darkness, white noise ran across the screen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The screen switched to reveal an image of a room peering through a doorway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the scene that one of my favourite princesses is actually seeing right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the image, Shima was lying limp on the floor. The image of the members of the club who came together and kicked her in the foot was shown.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Shima! Stop it! Make it stop!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is what&#8230;&#8230;your so-called righteousness has brought about. To save you, your friend gave herself up. This is the negative cycle of a weak man drunk on false righteousness. And you, the weak one, can only watch your dying friend with your fingers holding your mouth. She is dying because of you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu…uu…..”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does this still make you feel righteous?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, I&#8230;&#8230; don&#8217;t mean to&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard his sigh again in my ears as I was trying to say something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do you have to be strong? How did you come to have such an illusion that you have to be strong, that you have to be right?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;..Illusion?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me put it this way. Hatsu Tashiro is a strong girl, Hatsu Tashiro is a righteous girl. How did you come to have such a misunderstanding?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s not a misunderstanding&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Humans are weak. That&#8217;s what you said. You are also weak. But there are people who force you to play a role that requires you to be strong and right. Hatsu Tashiro, a good girl, tried desperately to be strong and right in order to live up to expectations. Isn&#8217;t that right?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;.I don&#8217;t get it.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am sure they all admired you. Hatsu-chan is strong, Hatsu-chan is serious, Hatsu-chan is right. It is only you who are like that, you become convenient to the people around you.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No, I&#8217;m not! I was&#8230;&#8230;born this way myself&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the contrary, I&#8217;m sure the inconvenienced people would have been repulsed. That&#8217;s why you were almost killed this time. Annoying, uptight, troublesome person, pretending to be good&#8230;..you&#8217;re supposed to be on the right path, but they won’t admit it.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But he&#8230;&#8230;Hiratsuka-kun likes me strong and righteous, and if he&#8230;&#8230;admits that he likes me, then I&#8217;ll be &#8230;.with..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen to me! I do not dislike the real Hatsu Tashiro, who is neither strong nor right! But because of your weakness, you&#8217;ve been at the mercy of the labels people have put on you, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Labels….?’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right! A weak, ignorant girl, deceived into believing that she had to be this way, a false image of being 『righteous and strong』&#8230;&#8230;that is the current Hatsu Tashiro&#8230;&#8230;face it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">── False image.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a shock. I had never thought of it that way before. But I was slowly convinced. No, I was convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I didn’t know what to do anymore, I burst into ragged tears.  What on earth was I? What was I going to do?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;..now that you mention it&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the deep silence, only my sobs echoed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was frightened by the feeling of being left alone in a dark world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu Tashiro, I love you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that single word uttered by the Confinement King, my eyes widened involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Wha! What are you saying all of a sudden?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not all of a sudden. I’ve told you, I&#8217;ve been watching you for a long time, haven&#8217;t I?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘B,but….’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now I have the power. I can save your friends and save yourself.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You&#8217;re taking advantage of my weakness and trying to cage me&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can think that if you want. But I know you are weak. I don&#8217;t care if you are weak and helpless. I love you, Hatsu Tashiro. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you’re not right, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you say it&#8217;s hard when it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s okay for you to be just as you are&#8230;&#8230;.I can accept that in its entirety.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His words sank into my cracked heart. I could not resist even if I wanted to.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is it&#8230;&#8230;okay&#8230;&#8230;to be weak?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll save you first to prove it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, I felt my lips being sealed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnn&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sudden kiss made me twist and turn in a panic. But my weakened body could not resist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The taste of the liquid poured slightly into my mouth. It was sweet. As soon as I thought that, I felt my body temperature returning to my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Open your heart for me, Hatsu Tashiro.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Open&#8230;&#8230;my heart&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I muttered this in a somewhat fawning head, a light like a six-pointed star began to flicker in the surroundings.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Wh,what&#8217;s that?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This hexagram is the proof that you became my property. A hexagram that shows you loved me, Hatsu Tashiro.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the flickering light, I caught a glimpse of the man&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a somewhat familiar face. I could not remember who he was , but&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;d certainly met him before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was not a handsome person but for some reason I found it endearing. I felt it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘H-have I become this man&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The devilish man who had done us a terrible disservice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But my body and mind trembled not with anger but with pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This shouldn’t be happening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it the liquid that poured from my lips to my throat or was his voice that recognised me, that had been cast away like rubbish? No, I must have been subjected to some dubious technique. Yes, it must be. It must be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not my fault. It was not my fault. This was surely something inevitable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the hands of this man, I was nothing but a weak and helpless being. I was weak. I was a pathetic woman who could not even protect herself without this man&#8217;s protection. I could not even help my friends, I was just a woman without power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was what made me feel so comfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, irresistibly, my heart desired this man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I &#8230;&#8230; can be weak, can&#8217;t I? It&#8217;s okay if I&#8217;m pathetic, isn&#8217;t it? In front of you&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He nodded his head in response to my question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The status of Tashiro Hastu has been changed to 『Submissive』. Accordingly, the following functions are now available.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Room creation level 8──up to 28 rooms can be used at the same time.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Furniture installation level 7──you can install extremely luxurious furniture in your rooms.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Special equipment (courtyard)──A courtyard can be installed.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Mysterious Dreams──You can show any dream to the person sleeping in the specified room.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An echoing electronic sound. I stared at her in my arms while listening to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had slanted eyes and a beautiful bridge of the nose that looked as if it had been traced with a painted brush. Her pale pink lips were reminiscent of flower petals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her waist-length black hair was tied back in a ponytail, and even now, in her weakened state, she exuded an air of dignity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8230;&#8230; I am now yours, aren&#8217;t I&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her cheeks burned as if in a fever, her eyes closed silently and I placed my lips on hers again.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;m kissing that Tashiro-san&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite my calm demeanour, my heart was about to burst with joy. My relationship with her was as far away as the distance between Earth and Jupiter. I was about to overflow with unexplainable emotions at the fact that I had pulled it off with all my might.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I dug back into my memory, the only connection between her and me was that we were in the same class in the first grade. That was all there was to it. Of course, there was no dramatic drama between us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, she only remembered me as 『vaguely familiar, but I don&#8217;t know who I am』. In her story, I was only a supporting character and a minor one at that, mob A.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was really good-looking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She behaved as the absolute leader of the class and was principled. She never tolerated bullying or being left out. So I didn’t remember being bullied in my first year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I remembered, she was really awesome.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She took the initiative to do the dirty work and never asked for praise. Her straightforward words had a persuasive power that could not be denied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a dignified manner, a sharp gaze and a kind smile that she sometimes showed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was the protagonist of the story and I was mob A. I thought from the beginning that we were inhabitants of different worlds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, the feelings I had for her were far from romantic feelings. For example, they were completely different from the feelings of love I had for Masaki-chan. The expression [admiration] was closer to reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, when I found out that Hiratsuka-kun and Tashiro-san had started dating, I did not even feel jealous. I thought it was something that happened in a world far away from mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the time I locked up the 18 members of the track team this time, I was not aware that she was among them. I only became aware of her existence when Lili told me to『choose four girls of your choice from among them』. I spotted her in the panel floating in the air and felt my fingertips tremble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that I might be able to make that Hatsu Tashiro mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I parted her soft lips and inserted my tongue. I felt her body jump.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fua…Aa..a..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her breath was sweet and hot, melting my eardrums.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I traced her gums and twirled the tip of my tongue around them, and her tongue, timidly as if frightened, responded in kind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chup, chup&#8230; Jyururi…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of the water echoed and my excitement grew higher. Gradually, her tongue also began to boldly seek my tongue.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘So, what am I supposed to do&#8230;..from here?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could not make a bad move at this point. I began to recall from my mind the lecture Lili had given me just a few hours before.</span></p>

<p><strong>2.2 - The Devil's Handiwork</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of people do you think are the easiest for the devil to corrupt, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;&#8230;a bad person?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied this while sitting cross-legged on the big bed in the『The Confinement King’s bedroom』 while Lili, who was floating in mid-air, made a big cross with both hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bubbu, wrong, Devi. The correct answer is a good person. In all stories, ancient and modern, it is often saints, children of God and virtuous priests that the devil tries to corrupt, because they are actually the easiest to corrupt.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Devi, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili nodded her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s a bit surprising.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think we have talked about this before, but good and evil are relative things, Devi. You could simply say it&#8217;s a difference in vectors, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaー&#8230;&#8230;you said something like that, about the two sides of a reversible paper&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“DeviDevi. Most people stay in the middle that is the level of the 『tendency』 that swings slightly to one side or the other, but the crazy people who have greatly disrupted that balance are 『the good people』 and 『the bad people』, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Either way, you have to have a very strong belief system to be able to do that and if you twist that belief system, good people can easily be corrupted.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn&#8217;t sound so easy&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“一I&#8217;ve had them do some research and this Tashiro girl is the daughter of a strict old family, the youngest daughter of a judicial family from her grandfather&#8217;s generation, Devi. Her father is a judge and her brother is a lawyer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa….Gachigachi.Well, I suppose it&#8217;s typical.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Usually, it can be used as ‘chattering’ but on this context it means ‘overly serious/rigid’]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Lili stuck her finger right up my nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m changing the subject, Devi, but do you know why people are called 『humans』, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th, that’s a bit abrupt. What&#8217;s it got to do with anything?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Devi, of course there is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From the point of view of Lili and other demons, humans are really strange creatures who form their ego through feedback from the people around them. They are human because they can only exist amongst people. There is no other creature like that, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa&#8230;..you&#8217;ve started saying something difficult again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not difficult, Devi. In other words, we are made to sense what other people see us as and adapt to that on our own. Those who are perceived as bad are made more bad and those who are perceived as good are made more good. &#8230;&#8230;Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You mean they become what they&#8217;re treated like?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s what I mean, Devi. So now Lili is going to give the gospel to all the bad people in the world, Devi. Listen to me with your ears open, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know what happened all of a sudden but seeing Lili&#8217;s serious expression, I unintentionally gulped.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“IT&#8217;S THE FAULT OF THOSE AROUND YOU WHO MADE YOU A BAD PERSON.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s with the worst comment!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the worst, Devi!? That’s a fact, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili put her forehead against mine with a look of disapproval.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your horns! It’s stabbing me! It hurts!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You may have heard the expression 『labelling』. But the Dutch word 『label』 means 『label』. In other words, if you are labelled a 『bad person』, people around you will treat you according to that label and you will behave accordingly because of the way you are treated.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeh&#8230;..that sounds bad, being influenced by people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whether you like it or not, that is a fact, Devi. For example, [I&#8217;ve made up my mind, I&#8217;m going to be serious from today!] but because people around you still see you as a failure, you are forced to put the brakes on. If you manage to overcome that and if the people around you start to see you in a better light, you can start a virtuous circle but it&#8217;s not easy to overcome that, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand what you&#8217;re trying to say&#8230;..so you&#8217;re saying that Tashiro-san is labelled as a 『strong and righteous girl』 and behaves accordingly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Devi. That&#8217;s the kind of house she grew up in, Devi.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili nodded exaggeratedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-so, you’re saying that we should pull that label off&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, she shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t rip it off, Devi, just replace it. She is a weak woman, who can&#8217;t do anything without FumiFumi to protect her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what should I do if I wanted to replace it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does that mean I should treat her as a weak girl?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s the general idea, Devi. But you have to prepare properly, Devi. The other party is weak and battered, so use a large bath to warm up your body, stimulate the sympathetic nerve and create a situation where you can touch each other naked, Devi. Feeling the body heat of the opposite sex can make a woman noticeably more relaxed, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, and then?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, FumiFumi pretends to be a strong person and imprints the message, 『Actually, you are weak』. We&#8217;ll do this thoroughly later, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T,take it easy on me&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Once she re-label herself as a weak woman, there will always be a crisis of identity disintegration, Devi. That&#8217;s where you come to the rescue, Devi. 『It is okay to be weak. It&#8217;s okay if you are still weak.』 You&#8217;re going to reach out and protect her, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At the end, you&#8217;ll see something that looks like a deliberate magic circle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Magic circle?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is no need to think too hard, Devi. For example, you can embed electric lights at the bottom of the main bathrooms in the interior design work, Debi. Lili will switch them on at the right time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t tell me, DIY!!? But why would you do that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Executioners can kill people because it&#8217;s their responsibility, Devi. If it is not their responsibility, people can easily do any immoral thing, Devi. If they think they are under some kind of dubious magic, they will accept anything without any resistance.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili then smiled wickedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then just remind her thoroughly that she is a weak woman. With your body. Devi.”</span></p>

<p><strong>2.3 - Captain Tashiro's Honey Trap</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After getting out of the bathtub, I hugged her to my side and moved to the next room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, it was quite tough to hold a girl in my arms. But that was where my endurance came in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu Tashiro. From now on I will embrace you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Is that so..but I&#8217;m covered in bruises like this. I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lowered her onto the bed and sat her down. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bruises instantly disappeared from her body and the scars vanished without a trace when I held my hand out to her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha?! Is this your power&#8230;.? The power of the confinement king&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was nothing of the sort. It was Torture, who turned invisible, that exercised her healing power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Tashiro’s eyes as she looked at me changed into enraptured ones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are &#8230;.. my master&#8230;&#8230;my Danna-sama&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ED: Danna =</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> husband, master, or patron.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body, which was completely free of any unnecessary flesh, had a glamorous curve. Her abdominal muscles were well-cracked and her tight, firm neckline was so thin that it looked as if it could break at any moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her plump, swollen breasts were also well-shaped. The way she moved up and down according to her breathing was luscious and her nipples were a bright pink colour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t think it was a good comparison, but she might be a bit bigger than Kurosawa-san in size. As for Masaki, she was in another league. She was a super heavyweight. Totally a different class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-umm….Don&#8217;t look at me too much. It&#8217;s a bit embarrassing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gulped at the sight of her cheeks and wriggled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The contrast between her swaying ponytail and the whiteness of her nape. I involuntarily throbbed at the bewitching line from her neck to her back.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘There&#8217;s no way I can stand&#8230;&#8230;this.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suddenly pushed her down on the bed.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Oi,  Confinement King, wait a minute!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro-san was perplexed by my sudden action. But I couldn’t stop now. I covered her and forcibly took her lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm!? Mmm, uh&#8230;Nnchuu, chu, jyu, churu,chu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if to say [I won&#8217;t let you go], I put my hands around the back of her head and devoured her lips even harder than before. I violated her mouth violently, pouring saliva into it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I caressed the silky smooth skin with my other hand. Her toned limbs..were very soft when stroked. It felt as if it was being sucked into my palm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I moved my hand from her side to her breast, tracing the lines of her body.  Was this also a matter of muscles? Her breasts remained upturned and did not sag even when she lay down. I crawled my fingers to her breasts and rubbed them with desire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She opened her eyes in surprise. Was it too much stimulation? Or was she too sensitive? But I didn’t intend to relax my excited hand here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn, Nnnnn, Haa, Puha&#8230;&#8230; Nnnn”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before long, her nipples were hard and towering as I rubbed them in a kneading manner, while our tongues twined around each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was feeling it. I was making Tashiro-san feel it. When I thought of that, a sense of joy welled up from deep within my chest. I pinched and rolled her nipples with my fingertips as the urge struck me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fugu&#8230;&#8230; muu, nnmmuu, fugu&#8230;&#8230;nnnn&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A muffled exhale escaped between our joined lips and her body began to respond with a bouncing response. While kissing her insistently, I played with her breasts further with one hand and gently reached down to her lower body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stroked her thighs and felt the moist sweat on my hands. Excited. Her body was hot, as if she had set herself on fire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nngh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I moved from her thighs to her groin, drawing lines on her skin with my fingertips. Then I split open the labia with two fingers and her eyes widened in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I moved my fingertips and poke the entrance of the female hole and I felt a wet sensation. Love Juice. The touch of honey on my fingertips and the movement of my fingers made her lustrous limbs squirm like a caught fish, she shook her head and shook her ponytail violently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn…Aaaa….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her initial reaction aroused me even more. I raised myself up and pushed her thighs open. Her secret cleft opened up and the bright pink flesh was exposed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaa…d,don&#8217;t look at me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro-san covered her face with her palms in shame. But if you were told not to look, it was human nature to want to look more. I put my face between her legs and I could smell the smell that made me swoon. The place was slippery as if it had been coated with syrup and the pink flesh was wriggling hungrily.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.This is getting more exciting…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kissed her crotch and extended my tongue into the folds of her flesh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S,stop please! You&#8217;re making me crazy!! I wouldn&#8217;t do this…!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s okay. Show me the slutty Tashiro that no one has ever seen&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I extended my tongue and carefully licked and sucked each fold of flesh. I ran my tongue over the clitoris and licked it up as if I were squeezing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, Hii?! Wha,what is this..!! So much&#8230; Aa, Aaaa…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro was confused by a pleasure she had never experienced. That was what it looked like. But I was not going to go easy on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I inserted my tongue into her vulva, the folds of her flesh tightened up. A comfortable pressure. Feeling this, I licked up her insides.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku, ku, ku, aaa……mmn!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wiggled her hips, the sound of her skin rubbing against the sheets spreading across the room. Her supple legs kicked up into the void and the pleasure made her buck.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘More, more. Feel it more.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The more I licked, the more her love juices gushed from deep inside. A little salty, a little sweet. The smell of the love juice soaked into my nose. I felt my cock rising to an irresistible boil because of the enticing aroma.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, nnah! Aaaaaa!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I sucked her clitoris wildly, she screamed. Tashiro probably couldn&#8217;t take it anymore. Her open thighs closed and she clamped my head tightly between them.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Cumm! Cum! Cum more!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was almost time. I&#8217;d make her feel it thoroughly. I licked around inside her even harder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro’s buttocks began to twitch and the love juice she secreted seemed to be thicker and stickier&#8230;then finally──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah!? Ah, ah, nn, nnnnnn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shuddered as she pressed her hips together. Her back was arched like a bridge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The walls of flesh tightened around my tongue. Numerous coral-coloured folds of flesh twitched. The thick love juices overflowed from the vulva and a thick rancid smell wafted through the air. After a beat of breathing, her stiff limbs relaxed and she threw herself limply onto the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaa,Haaa..wh,what was that just now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was you cumming.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“However, I don’t know why, but I&#8217;m so happy&#8230; and the feeling of loving you overflows from deep in my heart. Oh&#8230;..I love you, Confinement King, I love you, I love you&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she let out a moan, the electronic sound of the level up rang out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The status of Hatsu Tashiro has changed to 『Subjugated』. Accordingly, the following functions are available.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Disguise──You can disguise yourself only inside the room.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Sensory sharing──You can share your senses with other people of the same gender in the room.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything was going as planned. It would not be an exaggeration to say so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason I couldn&#8217;t corrupt Kurosawa-san was because of the existence of Kasuya-kun. Masaki-chan was able to be subverted because she was able to overcome her complex. Tashiro-san&#8217;s persona, which should have been an obstacle, had already been stripped away. I was sure that I would be able to corrupt her to the very end.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I can&#8217;t take it anymore!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no way I could hold back after being shown such a sight of the girl of my dreams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to hold her. I wanted to connect with Tashiro-san. I felt an unbelievable desire to possess her, not wanting her to be seen by anyone other than me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got up and grabbed my own thing and rubbed the tip of it against her vulva.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to insert it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her this, looking straight into her eyes, Tashiro looked frightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait, wait!　You can&#8217;t, it’s impossible! I&#8217;m scared &#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m scared.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like I was repeating myself, but I couldn&#8217;t stand it anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N,no! Stop!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I covered the resisting girl under my body, I thrust my hips out at once while holding down her with all my strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiaaa,Aa,Aa,Aa, It–it’s in?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I sank my big cock into the sea of flirtatious flesh, a slippery sensation enveloped the glans. It was tight. It was squeaky. But I was not stopping now. As if piercing with a huge stake, I pushed my way through her birth canal, which was decorated with a terribly narrow membrane. I dilated the narrow meat hole, which had never been explored before. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn, Aa,Aa,Aa,Kuhh….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro’s body became tense and even her narrowest hole tightened around my cock. There was a lot of resistance, but in the end I let the force do the work. I stabbed it all the way to the depths of her vagina without mercy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fugiii?!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a popping feeling and her hands scratched in the air. Tears slowly appeared in her eyes as her brow furrowed tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It hurts oo&#8230;&#8230;don&#8217;t bully Hatsu-chan, it hurts yaaa&#8230;&#8230; uuueeee….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro-san suddenly started crying like an infant. I couldn’t help but be perplexed by this. The woman who had endured being beaten up so much was suddenly regressing into an infant due to the pain of her cherry being popped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remained stiff with confusion for about five minutes. After remaining still, Tashiro-san somehow stopped crying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she wiped away her tears, she looked embarrassed and hung her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S,sorry. I&#8217;m so distraught. I heard rumours about the pain of deflowering, but I didn&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;realise how painful it could be.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It varies from person to person&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s nothing to apologise for. You can cry. It&#8217;s okay to be weak. Right?”</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-85104 lazy" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20698%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/p067-698x1024.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="1024" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She smiled self-deprecatingly and muttered a little ruefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It must have deflated by now &#8230;&#8230; so I guess that&#8217;s it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re talking about my cock?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, her face turned bright red again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of wilting away, my cock was straining to get a good pumping in her vagina once again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tashiro-san is so cute when she cries, and her vagina is squeezing so hard because of the pain, how long do you think I&#8217;ve been holding back from moving my hips?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Sorry. But &#8230;&#8230; Fufu&#8230;..now there&#8217;s no going back, is there? I really am yours.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, you are. I&#8217;m not going to let you go back on this. So, make me feel good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu, do whatever you want to me, please love me with a lot of love…!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she said this, she pulled my face to hers and laid her lips on mine. A hot kiss with a rush of emotion. Her tongue entered my mouth, and I twirled it in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please love me too&#8230;.. No, please love me a lot, A・Na・Ta.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Anata = dear, darling]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guessed she was embarrassed to say it to herself. I couldn’t hold back any longer when she turned her head in embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started moving my hips again. While holding her body tightly, I began to violently fuck her hot honey pot with my cock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaa, I can feel it, I can feel it, it&#8217;s moving, your thing is inside my vagina&#8230; Nnn, Nnn, Nnn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does it hurt?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s fine, don&#8217;t worry about me, just move your hips more&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, she did not appear to be in pain. Even the gasps she let out in time with the movement of my hips seemed to have a somewhat sweet sound to them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ah, ah…nnn,Haaa,Nnnn…!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t have time to think about positions or strokes. I just shook my hips desperately. I rubbed the folds of her vagina with my rod and pushed up deep inside her with my cock. I kept scraping the blood-red juice out of her painfully dilated vulva, pulling it out until it was just barely out then sharply slamming it against her lower belly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It might have been the roughest sex I&#8217;d ever had. That was how excited I was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah,if you poke me that deep, Ah, Nnn, Nnnnn! Anata…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She twitched and shuddered in time with the movement of my hips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reached down, grabbed her breasts and brought my lips to them, sucking wildly on her nipples.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh! Aah! Ah, ah&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, she arched herself up and held my head tightly. Her folds that entwined around my cock became so hot that they seemed to be on fire and each fold was lovingly entwined around my cock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, it&#8217;s really good, ah, ah, it&#8217;s amazing! It feels good!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro-san began to speak honestly of her pleasure, and awkwardly began to move her hips in time with my thrusts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we rubbed our hips against each other, I even felt frustrated that I was not in one body with her. I wanted to become one with her more and more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tashiro-san! Tashiro-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaa….!!! My darling..!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Calling out to each other, we hugged and kissed each other vigorously and repeatedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nchuu, chu, chujyuru, juru, ah, nn, ah, ah, ah, nn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We rubbed the bellies of our tongues against each other. We couldn&#8217;t care less about the saliva spilling out of the edges of our mouths. The tongue-to-tongue sex was too good to bother anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her legs pinched my hips and I pressed down on her body with my weight. The folds of her vagina tightened around my cock. Her body, which had never known a man until just a few minutes ago, trembled with pleasure like a whore&#8217;s and her mucous membranes were quivering violently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m gonna cum, swear you love me!　If you do, I&#8217;ll fill your vagina with my semen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, I swear! I will love you for the rest of my life!　Come on, come on! Fill me up with your semen!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling of her vagina had already taken me over the edge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slammed my cock, which had swelled to its highest level ever, deep into her vagina as a finishing blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ah, heh, ah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A charming sound leaked out every time my cock and her vagina collided. It was getting higher and higher in pitch. That lustrous voice made me even more aroused. And then&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to cum!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finally reached my limit. The tip of my flesh broke open and the white fluid began to overflow with great force.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byururu, byurururu, byurururururu!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nku, Ah, it&#8217;s so hot, it&#8217;s amazing, I&#8217;m drowning, Ah, ah, ah, Nnnnnn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My pulsating rod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large amount of semen poured into her vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro-san stiffened her body with her eyebrows knitted together, gripped the sheets with her fingertips and shook herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at that moment &#8211; I heard the electronic sound of a level-up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The status of Tashiro Hastu has changed to 『Enslaved』. Accordingly, the following functions are available」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Revisit──If a place has been visited once before, the door can be opened regardless of the distance」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the electronic sound of the level-up echoed through the air, I fell on top of Tashiro and buried my face in her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear her heart pounding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A tremendous sense of accomplishment. 『Enslaved』&#8230;&#8230;I felt an inexpressible sense of elation fill me when I thought that I had made that Hatsu Tashiro completely my own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to move my hips again immediately. I wanted to make her cum more. I pushed down these thoughts that welled up in me, pulled out my rod and rolled next to her as it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to see what state she was in now that she had fallen into 『Enslaved』. That was what I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, the only sound in the room was the sound of our breathing [hah, hah]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Confinement King&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She moved herself closer to my body and rubbed her cheek against my breastplate as if to pamper me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Honestly, I&#8217;ve become yours, haven&#8217;t I?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, one of my favourites.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“One of your favourites&#8230;&#8230;? Why am I so happy? It&#8217;s supposed to be a doubtful situation even though I&#8217;m being told I&#8217;m one of many women&#8230;..and I don&#8217;t really know how to describe this feeling,&#8230;&#8230;. But I feel like liking you or loving you isn&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;enough yet..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love&#8230;&#8230; you too. No, maybe even more than that&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said so, she smiled slightly and closed her eyelids quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, then&#8230;&#8230;My Confinement King. My dear danna-sama. Will you not listen to one selfish request of your beloved favourite princess? I have something I want as a token of your love.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll give you jewels, anything you want.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had heard that there were a lot of jewels lying around in the demon world. However, as a side note, when I said that I would sell them and make a lot of money, Lili flatly refused, saying, [You can&#8217;t do that because it would cause a big fuss, Devi].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But as soon as she heard my reply, her mouth twisted into a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, anything, right&#8230;&#8230;? I&#8217;ve heard of it for sure. Confinement King.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh, this is the [I want a child] pattern.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had already experienced this with Masaki and Ryoko. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised about that now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what came out of her mouth were words completely different from what I expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What I want is&#8230; the custody of the club members!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaaaaaaa?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised by this.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don&#8217;t tell me you were pretending to be entangled with me in order to save the club members?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unintentionally stiffened my expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she smiled wryly and poked me with her finger on the tip of my nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufu, don’t be so surprised. I do love you but I&#8217;m also the captain of the track and field team. It&#8217;s not a lie that I love you from the bottom of my heart but that doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t care about them.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I see, this is where she is different from Ryoko, who was violently and forcefully corrupted.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I thought about it, Ryoko would never disobey me but Masaki-chan frequently swooned, sulked and pinched me for what it was worth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili said that it was boring, but personally, I think it was better to be as obedient as Ryoko so that I didn’t have to go through all the trouble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But the four people who messed with Fujiwara-san are no good. And the princess candidates are also no good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muuu&#8230;&#8230; cheapskate”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pouted her lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, at least &#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered what she was trying to do, but Tashiro-san  persisted. Negotiations continued for more than 30 minutes and in the end I was made several promises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was this also called a honey trap?　There were a lot of things that didn’t add up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, despite my confusion, it was an action that was very much like Hatsu Tashiro, whom I admired.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I guess it&#8217;s the weakness of love&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In haste, I asked Torture to treat the girl called Shima, one of my promises and Tashiro-san happily kissed me on the cheek.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufu, Confinement King&#8230;&#8230; you&#8217;re a generous man and I&#8217;m very happy about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m still a little unsure how I feel about&#8230;&#8230; getting taken advantage of.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t say that. By the way, in addition to&#8230;&#8230;this, I also want&#8230;&#8230;you again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Tashiro-san gazed at me with debauched eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are welcome to beg for it. Oh, yes&#8230;&#8230; Do as you please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do what I please?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Insert it yourself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By myself? That&#8217;s&#8230;..indecent thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think you&#8217;re cute, Tashiro-san, even if you&#8217;re a little naughty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu….uuuu…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro-san made a fidgety, embarrassed gesture and then willingly straddled me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to insert it&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With tension in her twitching cheeks, she looked down at me lying with debauched eyes and inserted my rod into herself in a cowgirl position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her soaking wet flesh swallowed my things and she let out a hot moan. And she started moving her hips slowly, like she was frightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This, this is good&#8230;..I, this, this, I might like&#8230;&#8230;this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she liked the cowgirl position. Tashiro-san gradually and boldly sped up the movement of her hips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah, aah, aah”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her moaning got into a rhythm, she closed her eyes and turned her chin back in an intoxicated way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt good as it was, of course, but&#8230;..a little frustrating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C, Confinement King? Wha, what are you&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grabbed her hips and suddenly thrust my hips up hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hgyyiii!? Ah, Ah, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, suddenly intense!? Ahhh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Screaming voices, limbs tossed about like ears of rice in a storm. As I continued to thrust relentlessly, my desire to ejaculate gradually increased. I had already begun to wobble and tremble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to cum!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I told her that, my cock exploded.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byurururu! Byurururu!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnngh, aaahhhh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro-san tightened her pussy against my cock, contracting the folds of her flesh as I continued to ejaculate. But it was not enough. It was not enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, haa, not yet, not yet!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want&#8230;&#8230;more, more, I want you to make me cum too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had already cum, but my pleasure didn&#8217;t stop. So, I raised myself up again while we were still connected and then shook my hips in the missionary position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaah, Aaaah, Ah, i-it&#8217;s so good!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time I thrust deep inside her vagina with my rod, her breasts bounced up and down and she let out a flirtatious, pleasured moan. Even though I had just cummed, it only took a few moments for the waves of pleasure to hit me again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, I&#8217;m cumming!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let it out!　Fill me up!　Give me more, give me more!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My cock bounced and her body tensed up. The semen spurt out and Tashiro-san immediately climaxed like a conditioned reflex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uaaaaaa!!! It&#8217;s coming out, g,great amount,Fuhi!!!! Aaaa,it&#8217;s amazing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our desire was running wild. Tashiro-san&#8217;s limbs were shaking with a wobbling sensation. I tortured her even more, gushing semen from the tip of my cock, even though she was in the middle of a climax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not yet, not yet!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yaan!! I,impossible…a,amazing..!! It’s moving while ejaculating!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before her climax could recede, a new climax struck Tashiro-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I-I&#8217;m going to cum like this! Even though I&#8217;m still cumming, I keep cumming, cumming, cumming again!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Drowning in the tsunami of pleasure, Tashiro-san continued to moan uncontrollably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ah, ah&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We stayed connected to each other and kept cumming for an hour, two hours, three hours. We had been devouring each other&#8217;s bodies for a long time. It was almost morning when I realised it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kept thrusting into Tashiro-san, who was still lying on her back on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyaa,Aaku,Heaaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was no longer even able to focus her eyes. Every time I thrust my rod into her, the white fluid that I had poured into her so far spurt out between my penis and the folds of her vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Love you, love you&#8230;&#8230;. I really love you, my dear…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you too, Hatsu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mere mention of [I love you too] made her body twitch and jerk. Apparently, she came lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at the moment I kissed her, Lili appeared in the air, saying, [It&#8217;s almost morning, Devi].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While she looked around the room, she gave me a shocked look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa…..You guys really are a beast, Devi. FumiFumi and her too&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Usually it was only me who was treated as an animal but this time Tashiro-san was treated in the same way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, even though we continued to mingle all the way until morning, Tashiro-san did not faint.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, she was actively drowning herself, as if the sex she had just learnt was too good to stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a long-distance athlete on the track and field team, and I was doping up with energy drinks&#8230;&#8230;As a result, this was what happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gently stroke her hair as I pull out my cock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can rest now, Tashiro-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her that, she immediately closed her eyes and said, “Okay&#8230;.Umu….Oyasu…mi.”</span></p>

<p><strong>2.4 - Hunting for Girls with Too Much Self-Consciousness</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The newly acquired 『Revisit』, with Tashiro-san as the corruptor, was an absurdly useful feature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;it is like anywhere door&#8230;&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door that appeared in the wall of the old school building, peeking out from there, I let out an involuntary exclamation of admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It only took a few seconds to reach the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although there was a restriction that it must be a place I had been to before, as long as I met that condition, I could go anywhere in an instant, which was a really useful feature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Tomorrow I can have more last minute sex. Guhehehe …] With an overjoyed look on my face, I strode quickly to my classroom, thinking such things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No problem, the bandage was in place. It hadn’ t come undone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, it happened yesterday. If they found out I didn&#8217;t have a scratch on me, it would be more than suspicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stepped into the classroom, all my classmates&#8217; eyes were on me at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a shy person, the number of stares were almost lethal. As I turned my head and took my seat, I could hear them whispering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t this bad? Mai-chan didn&#8217;t come to&#8230;..school, maybe he is the guy after all&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was cowering to my seat, Kurosawa-san entered the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked around the classroom and came straight to my seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as I thought she looked down at me with a grim expression, she said&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──Suddenly, her cheeks flushed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, ah, oh, good morning&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I greeted her back with a puzzled look on my face, she looked fidgety and told me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that one word, the classroom was instantly buzzing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guessed  that was natural. The way she said it could be very misleading.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By all accounts, she was just a tsundere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Kurosawa-san looked around menacingly at her surroundings and walked straight to her seat. Soon after, Kasuya-kun walked up to her side and was talking to her as if to ask her something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, it was highbrow, trendy and celebratory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The yellow and orange colours formed a multilayered pattern in the glass and the rim was decorated with sliced dragon fruit. It was nothing short of sublime, to put it mildly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, Rin-chan, you&#8217;re so cute, Rin-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at my face reflected in the glass I held up through my sunglasses and muttered to myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One after another when I was dancing in a club. When I was tanning on the beach. When I went to the fishing port, the fishermen treated me like their granddaughter and pampered me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the last one was not a pick-up&#8230;..but if a beautiful girl like me was alone in a resort like this, it was natural that any boy would want to talk to me. I got pampered a lot. I felt a bit like a princess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;d go out to eat with them (but only if they were good-looking), and I&#8217;d even let them dance with me at a club (but only if they were good-looking).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were some very cool boys, but I was not a cheap girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never gave out my room number and I tried to come home early in the evening. I was not interested in one night&#8217;s avant-garde. My first time would be with my favourite guy, romantically, in a suite at a resort hotel. That was what I had decided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I enjoyed a tropical drink and took a swim. I had brunch at the poolside buffet and returned to my room before noon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt pleasantly tired. Going back to my room, taking a shower and having a nap. In the evening, the hotel would provide a courtesy car to take me to the American Village for some shopping.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would probably get picked up again, so if there was a man who looked rich, it might be a good idea to beg him for a present.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was walking thinking about this, I passed a very large man in the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was dressed in a dark suit that didn&#8217;t look out of place in a resort and wore sunglasses. His lips were shaped in a pout, and he looked like the Terminator.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably bodyguards or SPs, something like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a high-class resort, so there might be celebrities here. It would be nice if I could get to know them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to hang out with a celebrity and I caught the eye of a famous producer who said, 『Hey, you want to be an idol?』 then I would reply, 『Yes, I do.』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, in no time at all, I would become a huge national star. I became a celebrity. Being pampered wherever I went and &#8230;&#8230;I couldn’t stop imagining such a lifestyle. Today&#8217;s nap was going to be a good dream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went back to my room and opened the door with the key card. I didn’t remember leaving the room with the curtains closed but the room was dimly lit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, welcome backー!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl&#8217;s voice echoed unexpectedly, and I jumped up involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-w-w-who are you! This is my room!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I hurriedly turned my eyes towards the direction of the voice, I found a girl sitting on the bed, dishevelled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blonde side-tail. A gal in a worn-out school uniform. She had brown tanned skin and looked like she was playing around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to her, thinking that such a thing was impossible. I couldn&#8217;t think of anything else to say.</span></p>
