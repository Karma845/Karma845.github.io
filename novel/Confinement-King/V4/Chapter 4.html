<h3>Misuzu Kurosawa is Too Used to Being Kidnapped</h3>

<p><strong>4.1 - Swept Away by Tsundere</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way home from school. I was walking arm in arm with Kurosawa-san. It was very natural, as if it was a normal thing to do, she intertwined her arms with mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It couldn’t be helped because I was restless. But today, she didn&#8217;t even have any excuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought the fact that we got into a bit of a good mood yesterday was still lingering, but I honestly didn’t know what was going on in her mind. Still, the feel of her soft breasts against my arms made my cheeks slacken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;..so, this is what you call a tsundere&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I didn’t know what kind of change of heart she had. But I underestimated the destructive power of a tsun turning into a dere. Now I realise this firsthand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held Kurosawa-san many times while she was locked up, but this was a different story. It was completely different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I had here was not Kurosawa-san who was forcibly made submissive by force, but the conventional tsun Kurosawa-san, who was still tsun, blotting out the dere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I said the difference between farmed Kurosawa-san and natural Kurosawa-san, would that help explain it?　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I was probably not the only one who was nervous. Somehow, I felt as if I could feel her heart beating through my entwined arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could tell that she was anticipating what would happen next, just as I was. It even felt like that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘She’s gonna do me, orally again today&#8230;&#8230;I had to send Ryoko a message telling her not to come until I called her.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, if Ryoko hadn&#8217;t interfered, I was sure I would have been able to fuck her to the end. I was completely sure of it. So, if the same thing happened as yesterday, I might be able to completely make Kurosawa-san mine. Not as the Confinement King, but as Fumio Kijima.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As my expectations grew, I naturally got distracted. With a flustered gait, my steps unknowingly became faster and faster. Then, Kurosawa-san raised her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mouu—You&#8217;re going too fast! That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re not popular. When you&#8217;re walking with a girl, you have to match her pace!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I-I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My God, I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re panicking about…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I hastily slowed down my steps, she smirked and poked me on the cheek in a teasing manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not, I didn&#8217;t mean to do that&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, what are you being so coy about? Gross, gross!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words were the same as ever, but the tone of her voice was rather joyful. She stuck her tongue out at the end, and it was really cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we talked about the manga I had lent her, we left the forest road and approached a residential area along the main road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was only until this moment that things were peaceful. When we were about to leave the residential area, Kurosawa-san suddenly stopped and stepped away from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ju-Jun-kun&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san&#8217;s expression stiffened. I followed her gaze and saw Kasuya-kun leaning against a telephone pole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After looking at each of us, he walked towards Kurosawa-san and I, </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it? Ka, Kasuya-kun?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but be frightened. To be honest, I was scared of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Oi, Kimo-jima. I don&#8217;t know what kind of story you&#8217;re using to threaten Misuzu, but I&#8217;ll never forgive you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a low, stifled voice that seemed as if it was about to burst. And I couldn&#8217;t help but step back when I heard that he was about to burst with anger.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I&#8217;m not threatening her…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t play dumb! There&#8217;s no way Misuzu would ever voluntarily approach a creep like you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not! I&#8217;m not threatening her&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jun-kun, wait, I&#8217;m not threatened!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kurosawa-san raised her voice, Kasuya-kun gave her a pitying look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about it, Misuzu. You don&#8217;t have to pretend to be something you&#8217;re not. I&#8217;ll help you now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ju, Jun-kun, no, that&#8217;s not it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time as Kurosawa-san said this, Kasuya-kun suddenly grabbed onto me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uaa?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought he grabbed my chest, but instead, he head-butted me right between my eyes. And suddenly, stars scattered in front of my eyes. The next thing I knew, I wobbled unconsciously and felt a dull pain in my midsection because Kasuya-kun&#8217;s knee had sunk into my stomach.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O,oooooo,oo….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pain was followed by a sour taste coming up from the inside of my throat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shit. He was really used to fighting. The next one was between the eyebrows, and the next one was at the groin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to breathe, I almost fell to my knees. At that moment, he grabbed my chest and pulled me to the ground with all his might, dragging me forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From there it was even more one-sided. He kicked me in the stomach, and my body floated up, drawing the letter [he]. I couldn’t hold the pain when the ace of the football team kicked me in the stomach with all his might. I didn’t know what it was, but I was writhing in pain as a liquid of gastric juice or something like that spilled out of my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL: letter [he] = へ)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8230;&#8230; messed with something you shouldn&#8217;t have messed with! Kimo-jima!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He kicked me in the stomach again, and I fell to the ground with all my might.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t you ever go near Misuzu again, you shit!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like I had been beaten to death. I couldn&#8217;t take it any longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was going to prepare a more miserable life for him, and it would be a shame to end my revenge in such a simple way, but I had no choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I jumped at him by making a door appear behind him, I should be able to at least push him into the door.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;ll show you hell&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at the moment I looked up to make the door appear, I stiffened with my eyes wide open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell is that look in your eyes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kasuya-kun&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaan!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa-san is being kidnapped&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a panic, Kasuya-kun looked back behind him and we saw a black wagon drive off a short distance away from us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I looked up, what I saw was the sight of Kurosawa-san being taken into the car.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mi, Misuzu!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya-kun rushed out. I was no longer on his radar. I took advantage of the opportunity to open the door on the wall and rolled into the inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lili! Lili!!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the bedroom of the Confinement King, crawling on that red carpet, I raised my voice, and unlike the last time, Lili appeared with a face that seemed to say she was dismayed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it, Devi? You got hit again, Devi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m okay&#8230;. Call Torture now! Kurosawa-san has been kidnapped!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa-chan? By whom?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili must have thought that this was no joke. Her expression became stiffened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Torture! Hurry up and treat FumiFumi, Devi!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the corner of the room. The one-winged fallen angel wearing a sackhead emerged from the shadows. She held her hand above my head and the pain immediately receded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;&#8230; thank you for saving me, Torture.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I called out to her, I activated my 『Periscope』and checked the outside of the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the projected scenery, Kasuya-kun was making a phone call with a pale face. Probably the police.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, it was too abrupt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time was evening. Even though there were few pedestrians on the street, it was still a corner of a residential area. The crime was too daring. Because of the circumstances, it was unreasonable to think that they targeted the girl indiscriminately. No matter how I looked at it, it seemed like they were targeting Kurosawa-san with pinpoint accuracy.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It means they knew we were coming this way. Who?　How did they know?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I pondered this, Lili opened her mouth.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“FumiFumi, you can track Kurosawa-chan&#8217;s whereabouts with 『Marker』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Marker』 &#8230;&#8230;huh? I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had forgotten all about it, but I certainly had such a function. I could locate people under my control, whether they were Submissive, Subjugated or Enslaved. It must have been such a function.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I activated the 『Marker』while thinking of Kurosawa-san, an image like an aerial photograph appeared in front of me. In the middle of it, I saw a red light spot blip moving slowly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Zoom it, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Lili uttered this, the image expanded as it approached the red light spot blip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was moving on the motorway. If it went straight through the residential area where Kurosawa-san was kidnapped, I would find the entrance to the motorway. It probably entered the motorway from there. The direction it was heading was south.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The first thing to remember is that if the mark is still visible, she is not dead, Devi. And as long as she&#8217;s not dead, Torture can heal her from any injuries she may have, Devi. Don&#8217;t worry about it, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not the point&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would never allow anyone to mess with my property.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, we have to wait for the car to stop, Devi. Then, once we know where they&#8217;re going, we can do whatever we want, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So all we can do is wait&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I deactivated the 『Marker』, I activated the 『Periscope』 again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Japanese police were excellent. It had only been about ten minutes, but several police cars had already arrived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The detective appeasing the distraught Kasuya-kun looked familiar. It was Detective Inomoto. Ryoko was nowhere to be seen. I took out my phone and sent a message to Ryoko.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa-san has been kidnapped. As soon as you get any information, send it all to me&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aneki. So, how did it go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? I don&#8217;t know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean you don&#8217;t know? That&#8217;s irresponsible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because I told you we&#8217;re very careful not to get our foot in the door.　Once we&#8217;ve given instructions to the semi-greys, we don&#8217;t have any contact with them until we hear from the local brokers that they&#8217;ve received the money.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“uuWaa…You&#8217;re doing a shabby job.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I &#8211; Teruya Hikari &#8211; threw myself onto the bed in my room with my phone to my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During lunchtime today, I peeked at the note that Kurosawa Misuzu had secretly slipped under a textbook for Kimo-jima to look at, and learnt that the two of them were going home through the back gate. Since they were going out of their way to return home through an unseen back way, I could only call it a chance. So I urgently asked my sister to arrange for a kidnapper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The relationship between Junichi-sama and Misuzu Kurosawa was currently strained. If she went missing while the relationship was deteriorating, Junichi-sama would probably give up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called my sister, she said she would do something about it, even though her tone was one of dismay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had originally asked my sister to kidnap Misuzu Kurosawa, but she simply dismissed it. In actuality, she was planning to make Kurosawa into a package to be put on next week&#8217;s shipping, but she said the ship would be ready for the next day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ship was leaving tomorrow morning for a nine-day journey. It would be unloaded with other luggage at a port near Yogyakarta and the rest would be overland. Even my sister didn’t know what happened after that. All she knew was  that she would never come back to Japan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Yogyakarta is a city somewhere in Indonesia]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure it&#8217;s okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I reminded her of this, she said lightly, as if she was blowing up a paper balloon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it should be fine. I haven&#8217;t made a single mistake so far. They&#8217;re pretty good for Hangure. More importantly, Hikaru-chan, once the girl is kidnapped, you should take care of the rest. A depressed man will fall right away if you treat him nicely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ED: Hangure means </span><span style="font-weight: 400">loosely-organized criminal gang, non-yakuza organized crime group]</span></p>

<p><strong>4.2 - The Second Princess’ Dinner</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Moribe Saori’s P.O.V]</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know but it&#8217;s really scary when it fits like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai, in her underwear, hugged herself and pretended to be scared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After getting out of the bath, we were led to another room with bath towels wrapped around our bodies. There, we were handed a pair of underwear, all of which fit us perfectly, without the slightest deviation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was no point in being surprised every time. I just had to accept that this was the kind of place to be.</span></p>

<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The underwear itself was nothing suspicious. It was a luxury silk item, and as far as I could tell from the tag, it was a commercial product made by a domestic manufacturer. And what was given to me together with it was a colourful party dress. I had a mint-coloured dress and Shima-senpai had a lemon-coloured dress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have the accessories here, so please wear them to your liking. As for hair arrangements, I am sorry, but we are short on staff, so please do it yourself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, the silver-haired maid bowed and left the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She wants us to dress up for a dinner party? I really don&#8217;t get it&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai was in an unenthusiastic mood, but whatever the case may be, all the club members were girls so of course we would like to dress up. In the end, everyone spent about an hour picking out accessories and arranging each other&#8217;s hair, having fun without any sense of tension.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is everyone ready? Now I will show you to the dinner room.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid returned, and we followed her as she led us through the hallway.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A corridor extended where yesterday there was a dead end, and the silver-haired maid invited us in at the door at the end of the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as we stepped through the doors, we couldn&#8217;t help but say [Waa&#8230;&#8230;].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I had only seen it in pictures, it was a majestic, glittering gold hall, like the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles. A large table that could seat more than 20 people was sitting there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking towards the wall, I could see the four people &#8211; Kishijo-san, Hotta-san, Saito-san and Mako-san &#8211; wearing maid uniforms, looking downcast and embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were wearing cute maid uniforms different from those worn by the silver-haired maid, like waitresses at a maid café, with short skirts and excessive frills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, as I explained earlier. Show everyone their seats.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y, yes! Head Maid-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mako, who had a strained smile on her face, came up to us and led the way, saying, [Ladies, this way please]. I looked at Amemiya-senpai, who happened to be next to me.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mako..those guys&#8230; are they being forced to do this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I suppose they are, but&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was urged to sit in the so-called birthday seat and a few empty seats on either side of it, and I sat down in the exact middle of the table, with Shima-senpai on my right and Amemiya-senpai on my left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the table were some very expensive-looking tableware and cutlery. In the middle, there was a gorgeous flower arrangement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;This is silver, all of it. How much does it cost?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she poked at the cutlery with her fingertips, Shima-senpai let out a sigh of admiration, and I heard Amemiya-senpai muttering, [It&#8217;s like a wedding], in a whisper. It certainly had that kind of atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The semi-favored princess apprentices will enter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A short time later, the silver-haired maid announced this and Yui, Takasago-senpai and Shiratori-senpai entered the room, led by Kishijo-san, who was dressed in a maid&#8217;s uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were not in party dresses like us, but in gorgeous bell-line dresses with tight corsets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui,  haad an atmosphere of being used to wearing such clothes, while Takasago-senpai, still looked sleepy, and Shiratori-senpai, who looked sulky and unsociable, clearly had an atmosphere of being forced to wear the clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, the Second Favourite Princess will enter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That comment from the silver-haired maid caused tension on all of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second favourite princess meant that she must be a different person from Masaki-sama. She was probably a strange person because she was the one who produced the large bathhouse that looked like a Showa-era bathhouse, which made no sense at all, but we hoped she was someone we could talk to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when the door opened and we saw the figure enter, we involuntarily rattled out of our seats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu-chan!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「「「 Ca,Captain!?」」」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was natural for us to be surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Captain Tashiro who appeared in a pure white dress like a wedding dress. It was that person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked around at us and smiled softly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu, I&#8217;m glad to see that everyone seems to be okay. It seems like such a long time ago, even though the last time we saw each other was yesterday.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hatsu-chan! You&#8217;re safe, right? I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai&#8217;s eyes began to moisten, and Captain Tashiro chuckled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You worried too much about me, Shima.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as soon as the Captain reached the birthday table, Yui, who was sitting closest to her, hurriedly asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Second Favourite Princess&#8230;&#8230; is it really you, Captain?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu, I’m not surprised that you would ask that question. I made a deal with the  Confinement King and became his mistress. Don&#8217;t misunderstand me. I love the Confinement King with all my heart.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We looked at each other involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Isn&#8217;t this&#8230;..bad? It&#8217;s brainwashing or hypnosis&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, we didn&#8217;t have the courage to say it out loud, but it was written on everyone&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, but, didn&#8217;t you have a boyfriend?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hey, you idiot!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air-headed Ota(little sister) and Adachi-senpai, who was sitting next to her, hurriedly covered her mouth. What was funny was that next to her, Ota(older sister) laughed, [Gahaha].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu, indeed. But Hiratsuka-kun would surely understand. He was a good man too, but I should say that we didn&#8217;t have a future together. It was a fateful encounter with the Confinement King. It can&#8217;t be helped.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can&#8217;t be helped?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiratori-senpai muttered to herself with a pouting face, and Tashiro-senpai nodded broadly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s done. And I may already have a child of the Confinement King in my belly. We made love all through the morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that one word, a clamour, almost like a scream, filled the area around the table. The declaration that they had sex each other and it was until the morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;m sure we have a lot to talk about, but let&#8217;s do it over a meal. Freesia-san. Can you do that for me?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid clapped her hands and Mako and the others brought in the soup, which was laid out in front of each of us.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Today is the debut of the second favoured princess, Hatsu-sama, so please enjoy a course meal from the famous French restaurant Petit Le Tour.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui immediately widened her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-Petit Le Tour&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you know that &#8230;&#8230; Miss Bowel?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shima-senpai asked in a somewhat theatrical tone, Yui&#8217;s voice trembled slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a famous restaurant in Paris that has maintained its three-star rating since its establishment. It&#8217;s also famous for being sought out by leaders of each country to serve them food at summit meetings in France.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that statement, everyone went into an uproar.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaders of each country&#8230; I didn’t even know what level she was talking about anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain, no, Hatsu-sama! Please tell me. What kind of person is the Confinement King?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui asked Captain as if to bite her, and she chuckled as she held the spoon in her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of man&#8230;&#8230; is he? He is not a handsome person. But I have nothing else to complain about him. Generous and honest&#8230;..though there may be some favouritism towards the man I fell in love with.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And he&#8217;s rich, isn&#8217;t he?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rich? I don&#8217;t know about that, but I suppose so. He said if I begged him, he&#8217;d give me anything I wanted, even jewellery&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I heard Yui gulp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are those pieces of jewellery you are wearing also Hatsu-sama&#8217;s?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Captain&#8217;s cheeks flushed red, as if she were embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said I didn&#8217;t want it, but&#8230;&#8230; Confinement King told me to always keep it to make me pretty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the food served at the dinner was unbelievably delicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even I, who had been fed delicious food day after day as an interrogator, thought it was exceptional. I wondered how it would be for most of the members who had been fed only oatmeal until this morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, except for Yui-chan, who kept asking questions, and Captain, who kept answering her, everyone else seemed to be absorbed in the food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the main dish began to empty, Captain smiled at Yui-chan who was still trying to ask a question, stopped her with her hand, and looked around at the group.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want you to listen to me while you eat. I&#8217;m talking about the treatment of everyone after this&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not something that could be ignored. Everyone stopped and looked up at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First of all, as for Kishijo, Hotta, Inui, and Saito. They’re punishment was to be cut up into little pieces&#8230;&#8230;but somehow I managed to reduce their sentence to one year of labour as an apprentice maid. I know you want to go home, but even with this, the Confinement King was adamant.  I&#8217;d appreciate it if you four could bear with it, thinking it&#8217;s better than the death penalty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned my eyes toward the four, they were standing by the wall with their faces down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps they had already heard the story. But if it meant that their sentences had been drastically reduced from death to one year in prison, I didn’t think they had anything to complain about. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next, Kayama, Takasago, and Shiratori were supposed to serve the Confinement King as semi-favored princess apprentices, but&#8230;&#8230; I begged and pleaded, and somehow they were allowed to go home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Captain said this, Yui kicked her seat and stoof up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, please don&#8217;t do anything unnecessary! I will stay here no matter what anyone says!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kayama, you say that, but you live alone with your mother. She must be feeling lonely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Yui clammed up, someone unexpectedly spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to stay too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Shiratori-senpai. She looked around with her usual unfriendly face at everyone who looked surprised, and then opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t this a chance to get rich? Right, Miss Bowel?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By all accounts, Yui-chan was also in it for the money, but she didn&#8217;t like to be told that, so she turned mushy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the Captain folded her arms and made a thoughtful gesture, [Fumu].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about you, Takasago?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The dessert is delicious. I like it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she wanted to stay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, let me put it this way. As for you, I will ask Confinement King to allow you to travel back and forth between here and outside, as I do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t understand the nerves of wanting to stay here even though they said they would release us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I could understand Yui for money and Takasago-senpai for dessert, I could not imagine what Shiratori-senpai was thinking when she said she wanted to stay behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As for the others, all of you will be released tomorrow. I&#8217;ve been told that some of your memories of what happened here &#8211; about people &#8211; will be sealed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“About people?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked that, Captain nodded her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You will forget that I have become the favourite of the Confinement King, and those who have been flogged will remember that they were flogged, but will not know by whom they were flogged. And vice versa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa…..isn&#8217;t that just going to make things even more awkward?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shima-senpai let out a complicated voice, Amemiya-senpai raised her hand and said, [Umm&#8230;..].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong, Amemiya?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you can come and go, I&#8217;d like to stay too&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, surprised gazes gathered towards Amemiya-senpai. That was probably true. It was 100 per cent Yui&#8217;s fault, but Amemiya-senpai was the person who had been whipped the most here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, Freesia-san. What do you think?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s up to Confinement King-sama to decide, but if she&#8217;s someone&#8217;s servant&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll allow it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the silver-haired maid replied, Amemiya-senpai looked down in embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “Th,Then, I will be Yui-sama&#8217;s servant&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yui?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“-sama?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shima-senpai and Captain looked at each other and tilted their heads, Yui-chan twisted her mouth into a grin and said, [Oh, you say the cutest things].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that&#8217;s the case, Hatsu-chan. How about I be Hatsu-chan&#8217;s servants too?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, I don&#8217;t mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about you, Moribe?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai turned the conversation towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know why anyone would want to stay here, and more importantly, I had a decision to make.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N,no, I have something I want to do when I get back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you want to do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, the thing I regret most about before coming here is that I didn&#8217;t tell the person I love that I love him, so I&#8217;m going to try my best to tell him&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><strong>4.3 - The Beginning of a Long Night</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks for the food!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumio, tea?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thanks!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After dinner, I hurriedly returned to my room and picked up my phone to find a mountain of unread messages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“……Maybe I made a mistake in giving instructions, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the messages were from Ryoko. They were sent one after the other, without selection, as per the instruction to send all the information as soon as it came in.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The black van that kidnapped Kurosawa-san was a stolen car, which was found abandoned in the mountains just a short while ago. So far there were no more clues. Forensics was currently investigating. It was thought that they might have changed vehicles, but there were no surveillance cameras in the area and her whereabouts had not been traced since then.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya was sent home after a brief statement. When Kurosawa-san and I were going home together, Kasuya-kun made a false accusation that I attacked him.</span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Detective Inomoto, who took the statement, also did not believe the part about me attacking him, but Ryoko, who was disgusted by Kasuya’s testimony, put dirty dish water from the kitchenette in his tea. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: I also don’t know what the author meant by 給湯室のＯＬか , but my ED told me kitchenette is like a small kitchen, where there&#8217;re usually just simple appliances like mini fridge, microwave, sink. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">it can be used during office hour, to reheat their meal, or make a cup of coffee, and yes even gossip/chat with their coworkers]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked into the aerial-like image being projected into the air, the red light spot blip on the screen stopped at a point and flickered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the sea?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looks like the inside of a docked ship, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the camera zoomed in, it was not clear where that place was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I scaled it down, the flickering blip was a ferry port on the Pacific Ocean side. It seemed to be on the other side of the border between two prefectures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was shouted at and stepped fearfully out of the car.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I stepped outside, the two men who had gotten off before me grabbed my arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was a large man with a very long, slovenly face and a square-faced man in a shabby suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I got out of the car, I smelled the smell of the sea. I could see a ship in front of me. There was a large container ship with several containers on the deck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve got some guts, don&#8217;t you? Most people in a situation like this would be in tears by now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A woman got out of the passenger seat and looked into my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was dressed in a pastel-coloured tank top, hot trousers and long black sauvage hair, as if she was from a samba country. Was she half-Japanese?　In fact, she looked South American.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m used to being&#8230;&#8230;kidnapped.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I responded without a shred of amiability, the woman&#8217;s face turned a bit odd for a moment, and then she laughed out loud, [Gyahaha!] Perhaps she thought it was a joke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nee-san, Chen-san is waiting for you. Let&#8217;s hand her over quickly”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A nervous-looking young man got out of the driver&#8217;s seat and rubbed his stomach as he said this, and the woman tucked her chin toward the men who were holding my arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the samba woman walked out, the men also walked, holding both sides of my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They went up the movable stair ramp to the deck of the ship and went deeper and deeper, weaving between the three tiers of containers stacked on top of each other. When they reached the middle of the deck, a man was waiting for them there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was wearing a national uniform and had a loach beard. He was a man with very narrow eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aiyah, Aina-san, you are late.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that comment, I was convinced that he was Japanese. I didn’t think there was any Chinese person who spoke in such a manga-like manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up! Ochinchin. Where should I throw her?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not Ochinchin, it&#8217;s Chen, Chen!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s Ochinchin or Ochinpo! Just tell me what I should do. I want to go home and watch my drama!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the samba woman ruffled her hair in a troublesome manner, the pseudo-Chinese pointed to one of the containers with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she turned back to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, little girl, but from here you&#8217;re on a nine-day boat trip. I don&#8217;t know where they’ll send you but I&#8217;m sure there will be water and food on board, so you shouldn&#8217;t be too hungry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard that there was water and food, I thought to myself that I had become so accustomed to the situation that I was being conscientious.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I can&#8217;t escape it, can I?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before being put on the ship, I looked around, but apart from the ship windows, I could only see the light of the lighthouse in the distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from the faint sound of straight muffler exhaust, which sounded like a biker gang, not a single sound could be heard. Naturally, there was no sign of anyone. In this situation, there was almost no chance that help would come even if I cried out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go in there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the big man opened the door of the container, I heard a squeak and women’s sobbing from inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were six women in the container. A small oil lamp was illuminating them. The women were of different ages and in different shapes and sizes. Were they all abducted?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I entered the container, the door closed and a heavy metallic sound was heard. This probably meant that it could not be opened from the inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please excuse me&#8230;..”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman who was sitting in the back of the room with her legs thrown out raised her eyebrows in a suspicious manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know but you&#8230;..seem to be fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not fine, but I was abducted from another place a while ago, so I&#8217;m used to it&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The women who were inside looked at me all at once when I answered that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I opened the door to the wall of the museum using 『Revisit』 , I pulled out my bike, which I had brought in beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll leave the navigation to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave it to me, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded to Lili, who was floating in the air, and I got on my bike and started riding briskly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The height of summer was near, and the wind was fresh and warm. I was sweating just from peddling the bike for a little while, sweat dripping under my T-shirt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man&#8217;s hand reached out to Kurosawa-san. The sound of her crying and screaming was going through my head. Shaking off these bad fantasies, I pedalled frantically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As this was a redevelopment area on the waterfront, there were hardly any shops or houses within sight, and the huge factory was lit up against the dark sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no pedestrian traffic, and although it was a large road, cars came and went only sparsely. In the distance, the sound of a biker gang&#8217;s straight pipe mufflers echoed loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After driving straight down the main road on the beach for about 30 minutes, we eventually saw a sign with the words and arrows for a ferry terminal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Devi, turn at that sign.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was now covered in sweat.I didn&#8217;t have time to reply, so I did as I was told and made the turn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the left and right is a warehouse district, with few streetlights and a dark road. Driving straight through, I saw three cargo ships on the other side of the countless containers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Which ship?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The one in the middle, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I reached the area of the stacked containers, I was too exhausted to stand up on my bicycle, so I rolled it over as if to throw it down and hid myself behind the containers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched the ship as I regained my ragged breathing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The windows were lit, but there was no sign of life around the ship. There were no streetlights around, and even if they were watching from the deck, it would be too dark to see us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa-san…which part of the ship is she in?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably one of the containers on deck, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Worst case scenario, I&#8217;ll just have to go through them”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stepped out from behind the container and ran towards the ship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The movable staircase tarps were up. The only way to get in was to use the 『passthrough』and slip over the side of the ship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even though the ship was berthing, there was still a considerable distance between the ship and the shore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ll just have to do it&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouted to Lili as the door appeared to be stuck to the hull.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lili! Open the door!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger that, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Lili floated in the air and opened the door, I took a large running start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oraaaaaaaaaa!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stepped forward as fast as I could and flew through the air with the momentum of the run. Kurosawa-san&#8217;s face passed through my mind. If I didn’t reach her, I would drown in the dark sea. But there was no time to be afraid of that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just barely, really just barely. I rolled head first into the inside of the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa…Haa….Haa….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I could make it a meter or so with a good run, but it was much shorter than I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay, Devi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, uhh.. I&#8217;m fine, I think”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I activated the 『Periscope』 while breathing heavily and looked through the door in the opposite direction to the one I came in, on the other side of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The projection showed a room on board. It was a very long and narrow room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Iron walls, iron doors. There were two bunk beds on each side of the room and a number of nude pin-ups on the walls. Some were reddish brown and peeling, others were relatively new, but the overall impression of the room was simply messy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was probably the crew&#8217;s quarters. Fortunately, there was no sign of anyone in the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used the 『Passthrough』 to go down to the crew&#8217;s quarters and walked up to the door at the entrance, opened it slightly and looked through to the other side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side of the door was a passageway with orange lamps casting colour. It was such a narrow passage that two people would have to cross their bodies if they wanted to pass each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I strained my ears and did not hear a single footstep. The only sound was a low humming noise that sounded like something from the air-conditioning system.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you call these things&#8230;&#8230;ahh, sneaking missions?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A mixed feeling of anxiety and excitement. My heart was pounding more and more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stepped out into the passageway with all my might. Carefully, so as not to make a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If someone came from the front, I would immediately summon the door and hide. With this image in my mind, I stood on tiptoe and walked softly and gently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How many sailors were on board this ship now? Ten?　Twenty?　It couldn’t be a hundred, could it? Or were the sailors staying on land until the ship set sail, thus only a few of them remained on board?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, I ended up at the end of the corridor without meeting anyone. There was a spiral staircase leading to the upper floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking up, the staircase appears to extend two levels up. If I could get there, I might be able to get to the deck I was aiming for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grabbed the handrail and started to climb the stairs carefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The noise of my own breathing. My pumping heartbeat. I was too nervous, my hands were sweating badly. No matter how hard I tried to kill the sound of my footsteps, the steel stairs made a high pitched </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Gan, Gan, Gan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was getting impatient, but it was not good to make a sound. I felt as if my heart was growing frayed with impatience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When they somehow reached the second level, suddenly, from the other side of the corridor, [Wah!] I involuntarily bend down.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What&#8217;s that&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Listening under my breath, I heard the scraping of dishes and voices chatting and laughing. Apparently, somewhere on this level, there was a banquet or something going on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I regained my composure and started to go up the stairs again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How much time had passed? When I climbed the stairs, I came to a small room-like area. Looking out of the window, there was a deck with containers stacked on top of each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that I had made it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phew&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out an involuntary breath of relief and stepped onto the deck using the 『Passthrough』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smell of the tide tickling my nose. A lukewarm breeze. The deck was stacked with containers, the moonlight casting their shadows on the chemical floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was little light around. The full moon, slightly to the east of mid-sky, looked unusually bright.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you tell which container it is?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This way, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili led me through the containers and I reached the middle of the deck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stacked containers. It was like a back alley in an entertainment district, lined with multi-tenant buildings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roughly around here Devi&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right. All I have to do now is search until I find the right one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I set up the door so that I could stick it to a container close at hand, activated the 『Periscope』and looked inside the container.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The container was probably going to be repaired and then sold off. The container was full of used washing machines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest was more of the same, one container after another, until finally, on the fifth container&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There she is!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ I found Kurosawa-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under the pale light of an oil lamp, several female figures. Among them, I found the figure of Kurosawa-san sitting with her knees in her arms. She was dressed in her uniform as she was when she was taken away. She did not appear to be injured.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Thank God&#8230;&#8230;you&#8217;re safe!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Emotions ran high and I jumped into the container, using the『Passthrough』 without a second thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I jumped in suddenly, and the woman inside screamed, [Gyaa!!] Kurosawa-san didn&#8217;t scream, but her face turned surprised and she became rigid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu&#8230;&#8230;Fumio!? Ho,How?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she realised that it was me who had jumped in, a look of joy came over her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was only for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That door is&#8230;&#8230;no way&#8230;&#8230;it was you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she realised the presence of the 『Door』 behind me, her expression turned grim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I knew this would happen and I was prepared for it. I didn’t want to make excuses. Right now, the more important thing was to get out of here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll explain everything later, just get in the door! We&#8217;re getting out of here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.the others are fine too, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I nodded, Kurosawa-san looked back at the other women and raised her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those who want to escape, follow me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kurosawa-san jumped into the door, the other women looked at each other and then rushed into the door ahead of me. After seeing that everyone had finished entering, I too passed through the door and closed it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room used for the 『Passthrough』 was in its smallest state in order to shorten the travel distance. In short, it was the initial default state in which no changes had been made.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A stone room about the size of a six-tatami-mat room. Looking around it, Kurosawa-san let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well…I&#8217;m back here again&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, the room was in this state when I first locked Kurosawa-san in. For her, it must be a very familiar room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san made a complicated face. In spite of her, an Onee-san who looked like a cabaret girl asked me a question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H, hey, you! What are we going to do from here? You look so calm, but if we don&#8217;t get out of here quickly, they&#8217;ll come after us!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was natural for the girls to be terrified. After all, they were going to run away, but they had only gotten through one door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry. We&#8217;ve already escaped. This room is in another dimension, so no one will be able to follow us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Another dimension&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Onee-san&#8217;s face instantly turned blank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know how else to explain this room, although I didn’t know if it really was in another dimension.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All I have to do is open a door somewhere appropriate and get out of here&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said that much and then I pondered.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I could put 『Quiet』 and 『Forget Person』on them right now and let them out, but that would be dangerous during this time of night&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no reason to keep them here, but it would be a bad idea for them to wake up in another dangerous situation after they have been rescued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the morning, I will open a door somewhere in front of the station, so for the time being, you will have to put up with us here for the night.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said this as I spread out the room and set up the six beds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The women looked at me in horror as the room changed in real time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, after setting up the room for a moment, I turned to Kurosawa-san. I honestly didn’t care about the other women. The problem started here at&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, Kurosawa-san, come with me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.do anything weird and I&#8217;ll scratch you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san stared at me with a full sense of discomfort. I left the room with her. I set up a corridor beyond the door and connected the end of it in real time to the 『Confinement King’s Bedroom』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as soon as I stepped into the 『Confinement King’s Bedroom』, Kurosawa-san glared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. It was you, Fumio. The animal who kidnapped me and raped me as much as he wanted&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you going to do with me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing. I&#8217;m not going to do anything. It&#8217;s late, so in the morning I&#8217;m just going to erase your memory of me and ask you to leave.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You expect me to believe that story? Do you think I&#8217;m an idiot?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san raised his eyebrows in suspicion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was inevitable that she would be suspicious, I could only laugh bitterly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I released you from here before, I promised Kurosawa-san that I wouldn&#8217;t get involved with you at all in the future. I thought I was keeping my distance&#8230;&#8230;I would appreciate it if you could consider this time as an exception among exceptions. If I wanted to help Kurosawa-san, this is the only way I could think of.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re trying to deceive me by saying such an auspicious thing, aren&#8217;t you!? That&#8217;s right. You&#8217;re the one who kidnapped the girls from the track and field club too, didn&#8217;t you!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I kidnapped them. After all, some of the girls were trying to threaten Fujiwara-san by taking naked pictures of her. And because I couldn&#8217;t figure out who it was, I kidnapped them all and finally found them today. But I&#8217;m going to release them tomorrow morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you saying you did it for Mai?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, if anything, I think it&#8217;s still for my own sake&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s the same with coming to Kurosawa-san&#8217;s rescue this time. It was only because you were in trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For myself &#8211; as soon as I said that, I heard Kurosawa-san gasp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;&#8230;well, it&#8217;s hard to blame you if you put it like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry, this time I&#8217;ll make sure I never go near Kurosawa-san again. I&#8217;ll tell Mr Fujiwara, 『I hate Kurosawa-san, so I don&#8217;t want to go near her.』 That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to say.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, for some reason, Kurosawa-san showed an air of panic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you don&#8217;t have to go that far&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very moment she mouthed off, there was a sudden slam and another door opened, different from the one we had come in through.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumio-kun!The one you asked me for the other day&#8230; &#8230;&#8230;huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person who came was Masaki-chan carrying a large amount of toilet paper rolls. As soon as she caught sight of Kurosawa-san, her face twisted in displeasure.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Seriously&#8230;&#8230;.of all times, why is this happening now…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But whether she noticed her expression or not. Kurosawa-san rushed towards her with a look of great emotion on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Masaki! You&#8217;re safe!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Masaki was also clear in her disgust, and she spoke coldly to Kurosawa-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing here? You thieving cat!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, thief&#8230;&#8230;cat? Wha,what is it? What&#8217;s wrong, Masaki&#8230;&#8230;Kya!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Throwing the toilet paper core in her hand at the puzzled Kurosawa-san, Masaki turned her hostile gaze towards her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re planning to seduce Fumio again, aren&#8217;t you!　Isn&#8217;t that right!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you talking about, Masaki&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly intervened between the two of them at the sight of Masaki-chan, who looked as if she was about to grab her at any moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Masaki-chan, calm down a little!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because, Fumio-kun! This woman!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan stomped her feet in a jittery manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, another door opened with a bang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooouu!　You&#8217;re back, Confinement King!　I&#8217;ve missed you! I hope you&#8217;ll be loving me again tonight, won&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro-san came in, wearing a white dress. She came running towards me and clung to my arm tightly. When she noticed Kurosawa-san&#8217;s presence, she raised her eyebrows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who are you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And who are you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumu, I&#8217;m Hatsu Tashiro, the second favoured princess of the Confinement King. So, who are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she heard the words Second favoured Princess, Kurosawa-san glared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I didn’t want her to glare at me there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am Misuzu Kurosawa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Tashiro-san tilted her head, [Ehh?].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve heard that name before&#8230;&#8230; Oh, I remember now, Lili-dono claimed that was the name of a poor woman who lacked the ability to judge men.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“HaaaAAAAA?! What are you talking about!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oops&#8230;&#8230;I somehow thought that might be the case, but &#8230;&#8230;Tashiro-san is the type of person who can&#8217;t read the air very well..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san was very upset, but Tashiro-san looked down at her and tucked her chin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because that&#8217;s the only way to put it. I&#8217;m appalled that you&#8217;d put your manipulative misao on a stupid man and wear this best man on your sleeve.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:操 Misao chastity; fidelity; honour]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? The best man? Him? You’re making me laugh. What&#8217;s ‘best’ in him, did you see?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All of it, you fool!　I&#8217;m currently writing a chronological history from Lili-dono, the life and birth of the Confinement King, and the more I learn, the more I&#8217;m falling in love with him!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chronology?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I raised my voice unintentionally, Masaki-chan made a face like [I didn&#8217;t know there was a way to do that!].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The timing for this is good. I think you said something about Kasuya, right? I&#8217;ve always wanted to see the look on the woman&#8217;s face when she chooses such an irrepressible man.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re really something, aren’t you! Jun-kun is not an irrepressible man!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kurosawa-san raised her voice, Tashiro-san snorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He is a very silly man indeed, anyone would think so after listening to that audio!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Audio?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kurosawa-san asked this, Tashiro-san raised her voice into the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lili-dono, are you there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All of you keep calling Lili too casually, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Lili appeared with a dissatisfied look on her face, Kurosawa-san jumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she didn&#8217;t seem that surprised. Even though Lili was floating in the air. Perhaps she had subconsciously become accustomed to Lili&#8217;s presence, even if she didn’t remember it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but I want you to play that audio you played for me this morning for this poor woman.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili then looked back and forth between Tashiro-san and Kurosawa-san, and then again at Tashiro-san, with a glazed look in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. you don&#8217;t seem to have many friends, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Suddenly, you’re cursing me out of nowhere?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t that right, Devi? You&#8217;re the type of person who does things that people don&#8217;t like without feeling bad about it. Have you ever had a friend stop talking to you all of sudden?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it happens a lot, but so what!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It happens a lot&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan looked as if she had seen something terrible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Think about how people feel, Devi. I feel sorry for Kurosawa-chan if I let her hear that. Kurosawa-chan will be really depressed. Lili doesn&#8217;t want to see Kurosawa-chan cry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was convinced that Lili was making a series of comments that were out of character for her.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ah&#8230; she must be planning something&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audio would be the conversation between Kasuya-kun and his juniors that Lili mentioned. To be honest, I wouldn&#8217;t mind letting her hear it. Men could be vain, couldn’t they? I felt it would be too unforgiving for the devil to dig into that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it seemed that for the devil, such things didn’t matter. Tashiro-san must have been in prediction of what would happen..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And if Lili hooked Kurosawa-san like this&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa? Aren&#8217;t you an idiot? There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to cry! I&#8217;ll listen to it, so get that audio out of here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, Kurosawa-san was successfully hooked.</span></p>

<p><strong>4.4 - It's All God's Fault</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m telling you Devi. Lili doesn&#8217;t want you to cry, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you, I won&#8217;t cry!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The devil child snapped her fingers in a very arrogant tone when I raised my voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, even though there seemed to be no speaker, an audio noise echoed throughout the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Damn it, you guys&#8230;don&#8217;t just fooling around, Kimo-jima is still alive and well.』”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Jun-kun&#8217;s voice that I heard. It seemed to be a bit languid, but it was definitely Jun-kun&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The voice was recorded during a lunch break the day after FumiFumi was attacked by unknown thugs, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lunch break the day after Fumio was attacked was the day I asked Jun-kun to stop the juniors. Jun-kun did indeed say that he was going to talk to the juniors during the lunch break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I listened to the conversation, Jun-kun was talking to the juniors about not attacking him anymore. Although there were some nuances that were a bit tricky, it was not that he was saying anything strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the conversation gradually turned into something fishy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『So you&#8217;re saying that Kimo-Jima is irrelevant?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Why would he not be irrelevant? I&#8217;ve been following Rin around, you know. That&#8217;s just fine, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s like pest control. Spread the rumour that he kidnapped her even further.』”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Wa, wait a minute? Does this mean that Jun-kun knew that the missing girl was safe? Does this mean he knew and had his juniors spread bad rumours about Fumio?’</span></i></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I realised the meaning of that one word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Don&#8217;t fuck it up.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That meant that it was actually Jun-kun who used his juniors to attack Fumio?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The fact that he&#8217;s dating Mai is also irritating, and recently he&#8217;s been eyeing Misuzu as well. I think it&#8217;s best to crush idiots like that before he got the wrong idea.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ah, I see, that&#8217;s how it is, isn&#8217;t it? Senpai is doing for Misuzu-senpai&#8217;s sake.』”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘For me? Don&#8217;t be stupid! I don&#8217;t want that! Don&#8217;t tell me that I’m his monopoly!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was sceptical about whether this audio was authentic, but now I was convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only thing I had ever wanted Jun-kun to stop doing was saying that everything was for me.  Then──</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Well, senpai!　Have you had sex with Misuzu-senpai yet?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『How was it?　Is it the best?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Of course it&#8217;s obvious. But, well, it seems that Misuzu is more crazy about me. I made her squeal, saying 『Come deeper and so on』. Misuzu wants to be fucked hard, so it&#8217;s hard work.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The image of Jun-kun smiling and rubbing the bridge of his nose with his finger flashed through my mind. It was a habit he had when he was proud of himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, I let out a [uwaa&#8230;&#8230;.it’s the worst], and Masaki gave me a pitying look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At a hundred paces, it was not hard to understand why a boy would want to boast about having sex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was impossible and disgusting to tell people a secret between two people, but, well, if he apologised&#8230;&#8230;and promised not to do it again, I couldn’t help but forgive him. But──</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘When did Jun-kun make me squeal!? If he could make me say it, I would! I&#8217;d rather say it! It&#8217;s fine that he&#8217;s more into me than I am into him. Well, it&#8217;s okay. I actually like him. But when did I ever want to fuck him?  Especially after that lousy sex, does he have any idea how much I was worried about it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man was worth more than just sex. If I kept going out with Jun-kun, I might never cum again. With that in mind, I was still trying to make up my mind that he was the man I loved. That was exactly how I felt as if I was going to be ordained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I admitted that my feelings were wavering when Mai showed me Fumio&#8217;s cock. I admitted that I couldn&#8217;t forget the taste of Fumio&#8217;s semen and I thought that today would be the last time I would do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And by the way, I had to admit that I had started to think rather seriously about what Kyoko said about [romance with a boyfriend and sexual gratification with a sex friend].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But!　But!　But!　Jun-kun had no right to boast about sex with a smug look on his face!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I unintentionally shook my clenched fist, the ponytailed woman said, [Nah!　It&#8217;s stupid, isn&#8217;t it?] She looked into my face with a triumphant look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was angry, but I couldn’t think of the words to say back. I heard the sound of my own back teeth creaking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I&#8217;m so glad. I&#8217;m glad I was rejected by Jun-kun. I&#8217;m so sorry, Misuzu-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki grinned and agitated.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I don&#8217;t remember seeing her with such a bad personality. Ah, I&#8217;m so pissed.’</span></i></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the fact was, I couldn’t hold it anymore. I liked him so much that I thought I might be able to put up with such lousy sex, but if I cut away that feeling of 『love』&#8230;&#8230; I couldn’t do it anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was what the devil girl said. I was really depressed and I would have been crying if I was not paying attention. At that moment when I couldn&#8217;t help but cast my eyes down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『When you have good sex chemistry, every time you fuck, the expiry date of your 『love』 is renewed. Women are selfish creatures, and in the end, they like men who satisfy them.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko-san&#8217;s words like that flashed through my mind.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, either way, it means that&#8230;..someday the 『love』 will expire&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And again, Kyoko-san&#8217;s words echoed behind my ears.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“A man who is good for sex is like a partner of destiny, isn&#8217;t he? When you think that God created them that way&#8230;”</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘God created them that way. Then &#8230;&#8230; isn&#8217;t it useless to resist?’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought so. I deeply thought so.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yeah&#8230;&#8230; the bad one is God.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“……Hey, Masaki.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it, thieving cat?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki made a disgusted face with one cheek contorted. And I, smiling wryly at that, opened my mouth. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I’m a thieving cat. So&#8230;&#8230;Fumio, give him to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Masaki and the ponytailed woman widened their eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.W, why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because I like him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But when it came to Jun-kun, you were very reserved with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, because I felt sorry for Masaki and felt like you would break if I didn&#8217;t protect you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I hate that about you, Misuzu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, you can say that you don&#8217;t like me like that now. But I&#8217;m not going to hesitate anymore. It&#8217;s my turn to ask Masaki to be more reserved. I&#8217;m the challenger.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Masaki&#8217;s eyes widened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked surprised, and I could see tears slowly starting to well up in the corners of her eyes.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Y-you can do whatever you want. Either way. Fumio-kun&#8217;s libido is not at a level that can be managed by me or Hatsu-chan alone&#8230;&#8230; If Misuzu wants to be Fumio-kun&#8217;s thing, I will not oppose it anymore.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll leave you alone with him today. It&#8217;s just for today! Tashiro-san, get out of the room too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? No, I&#8217;m staying with the Confinement King tonight…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just leave!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if to drive away the disgruntled ponytail, Masaki hurriedly left the room. And before closing the door, she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry Misuzu, but I&#8217;ll be the first one to have Fumio&#8217;s baby!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t know why Masaki&#8217;s attitude suddenly changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Fumio was smiling happily for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s good to see that you guys have made up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did we make up&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, we both fell silent. I didn&#8217;t really know what to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left my boyfriend and now I&#8217;m trying to love the horrible man who confined me.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell was this? How did this happen?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that was the way it was, but if, as Kyoko said, God created him that way, then it might have been a rather roundabout way of going about it. Yes, it was all God&#8217;s fault after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I walked up to Fumio and hugged his body, begging him for a kiss. When our lips met silently, my heart jumped loudly in my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnchu! Muuu&#8230;&#8230;chu&#8230;&#8230;chupppu, chuuu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t seem to stop now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wriggled my tongue and devoured Fumio&#8217;s lips as my emotions took over. He twirled my tongue around it and bit at his lower lip as if to spoil it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I poured out my own saliva and sipped his saliva. I leaned into his tight embrace and stroked his back again and again.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nmu&#8230;&#8230; Nfu”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, his fingertips traced over my body. That alone caused breathing to become erratic. The body reacted. Reason melted away. Instinct took over the body. Such was the sensation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He kissed me on the mouth and grabbed my breasts from above my blouse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It hurt a little. But it made my body jump. I was sure Fumio was excited too. I was happy to think that he wanted me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “Mufuu&#8230; nnn, fuahh, ah, ah”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Caressing me over my clothes felt good but frustrating. Gradually, I could no longer hold back my voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling of our bodies touching, the area where his lower abdomen touched, was getting harder and harder.</span></p>


<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘He&#8217;s feeling it…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stroked his crotch over his trousers, he raised his eyebrows as if he was holding back pleasure. His expression was so cute. I loved it. I wanted him to feel even better. Such a feeling came up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I continued to stroke him from the top of his pants, he occasionally shivered as if he had a chill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then his hands, which had been squeezing my breasts, gradually moved downwards. Crawling over the surface of my skin, down the flanks to the buttocks. Finally, he reached down into my skirt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I became embarrassed and tried to close my legs. But his fingertips had already reached my crotch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel his fingertips through my shorts. His fingertips traced the slit, making me aware of the shape of my part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re really wet&#8230;&#8230; Misuzu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she whispered like that in my ear, my face started to heat up with embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yaan&#8230;&#8230;stupid&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I involuntarily turned my face away, his fingertips became more vigorous, shifting my shorts and touching my pussy directly. A drop of embarrassing juice dripped onto the floor and made a stain, and I felt so hot that my cheeks almost caught fire.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aaaa&#8230;..I remember the feel of these fingertips&#8230;..the fingers that made me so crazy, so many times&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He stroked around the area so that I could clearly see the shape of my genitals, and my hips began to buckle on their own in frustration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, Fumio&#8230; Don&#8217;t tease me&#8230;&#8230; don&#8217;t rush me &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I leaned over him and ran my tongue down his neck as if begging him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as if in response to my request, he spread my labia and began tracing each fold with his fingertips. As he continued to stimulate my erect clitoris by rolling it, I felt a rush of pleasure that made me feel as if I was going to collapse from my shaking knees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that place&#8230; Ah, hafuu, t-that so good, ah&#8230; It&#8217;s tingling&#8230; It&#8217;s not good, it makes me crazy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were already several drops of love juice on my thighs. The sticky wet fingers finally entered my vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn, nnnh! I-it&#8217;s entering&#8230; Fumio&#8217;s finger&#8230;. is entering…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel my flesh tightening up around his finger. It was pleasurable. My hole swallowed his fingertips in a shallow way, and I shuddered with pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he rubbed the inside with his finger, a pleasure ran up my spine as if an electric current had been sent through me. And at the moment he bent his finger, it hit a very good spot, and my body arched back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uaahh!? Hii, t-that&#8217;s so good!?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;m gonna come so fast! No! I want to make Fumio feel even better! I don&#8217;t want to come yet. It&#8217;s too early!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gritting my teeth, I pulled down his zipper and put my hand inside his trousers. Then I squeezed his muscular cock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear him gasp.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aaaa….it’s so hard..amazing….’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A thick and big stick of flesh throbbing in my hand. It was hot and had an incredible presence. It was so swollen that it could have ejaculated at any moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A stick of flesh that drove me crazy over and over again. I thought my eyes were already melting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I started handling and squeezing him slowly, Fumio tried to back away as if to escape. But I didn’t let him get away. Once I got hold of him, he was all mine. I had a hand job technique that Freesia-san taught me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I began to twirl the liquid overflowing from the tip in my palm and smear it all over. This was the lubricant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lightly scratched my fingernails on the back muscles and squeezed the glands up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaah &#8230;&#8230; Kurosawa-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, his face contorted as if he was in pain.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aww&#8230;that&#8217;s cute. Ufufu, doesn&#8217;t it hurt? Didn&#8217;t you feel like you were going to cum?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumioo&#8230;..so cute&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I whispered that into his ear, the movements of Fumio&#8217;s fingers playing with my crotch suddenly became more intense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hii!? So sudden&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is he going to make me come first?　Fumio is so competitive when it comes to sex.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I also wanted to make Fumio feel good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of us huddled together, fighting against the pleasure that came our way, and torturing each other&#8217;s crotches.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pleasure was so great that we both pulled our hips back. Fumio and I continued to play with each other&#8217;s genitals, stretching out their tongues and licking each other&#8217;s tongue tips, never letting go of each other&#8217;s fingers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Ah, Ah, Ahh, Haa, Ah&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;.haa&#8230;.haa&#8230;.haa&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room was filled with gasps and rough breaths, and like beasts, we continued to torture each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, the limit was reached.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byuru! Burururu! Byu!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumio&#8217;s body jumped, and a copious white fluid overflowed into my hand. The hot, sticky semen stained my hands.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I did it!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment after I was excited in my chest, Fumio pushed his fingertips up to a great place in my vagina, shaking with pleasure. The next moment, I was dazzled and a tremendous feeling of pleasure ran up my spine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Ahh, Nnnn, Nnnn, Ahhhhhhhhh”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a scream, my eyes went blank and I choked. My whole body began to twitch with a sensation that my pores were widening, a [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BotaBotaBota</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">!] and a large amount of love juice dripped onto the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“HaaaaaHaaaaa…Aann….I love you, Fumioo&#8230;..I love you, Nchuh, muuh&#8230; Hmm-hmm, ku-chuh”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of the languidness of the post-climax, we leaned against each other and kissed each other hungrily.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No&#8230;&#8230;this is not enough. I want to do more. I want more, more, more.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t think I could hold back. I believed it was a shame, but I begged Fumio to do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumio, fuck me &#8230;&#8230; and do what you want&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, this time I&#8217;ll make you mine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m so happy…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked into my eyes as he said this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was bad. It was really not good. I was already crazy about him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I liked Fumio&#8217;s voice, Fumio&#8217;s outline, I liked Fumio&#8217;s eyes, I liked Fumio&#8217;s body lines, I liked Fumio&#8217;s fingertips, I liked Fumio&#8217;s words, I liked Fumio&#8217;s cock, I liked everything about him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stared at him, I felt as if I had been affected by a fever. Fumio took off his pants and underwear. The muscular cock had just ejaculated, but it was already towering painfully high, and my eyes were glued to it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is it better not to take off the uniform&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know, but I had heard that boys get more excited that way. Whatever made Fumio happy was fine. I put my hand on my skirt and removed it. My underwear, which were already soggy and heavy, made an unpleasant sound on the floor.</span></p>

<p><strong>4.5 - The First Woman is a Special One</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, even now, I was still perplexed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I swore to you, I really did intend to bring Kurosawa -san back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someday I would get her back. I thought so, but I never thought that now was the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for Kasuya-kun&#8217;s voice, it was definitely Lili&#8217;s idea. It might well be enough to make her fall in love with me. Certainly, it might be enough to make her give up her affection for him. However, the main reason I was unable to dispel my confusion was that, as soon as she had given up on Kasuya-kun, she said, 『I love you!』and I had no idea why she came to that conclusion. I could not see any change in her feelings at all.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Did Lili know this was going to happen?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about this, Kurosawa-san lay on the bed and beamed with embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come &#8230;.. Fumio.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She lay on the bed, her breasts bare and her crotch open. With her cheeks flushed red, she pushed her secret cleft open with two fingers, revealing her wet, pink flesh to me. Her bra pushed up to her chest. Her familiar uniform looked so lewd.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could not stand it. There was no way I could. I would think about it later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I covered her and rubbed my glans against her vulva, and with a sharp snort, I thrust into her vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnnnn! Haa, nku, it&#8217;s coming in! Ahhh, it&#8217;s so big, it&#8217;s so hot, Fumio!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A warm, wet, narrow cavern. Her pussy was a molten slop, and as soon as she accepted my cock, her vaginal flesh shuddered with delight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sweet pleasure of flesh rubbing against flesh. The wet folds squeezed my cock intensely, leading it deeper and deeper. The pleasure of a man who had acquired an exquisite bitch in the midst of pleasure crawled up my spine.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the glans collided with her cervix and crushed it to the point where it changed shape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nhhhhhh! It&#8217;s so gooooood!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body arched back, and the slimy folds of her flesh tightened around my cock as if squeezing it. I was not letting go. I would not let go. I would never let her go anywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her flesh, which I had savoured many times before, was now even wetter and tighter than before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was so comfortable that it almost took my consciousness away. She left him and chose me. I had to live up to her expectations. I must give her more pleasure than she expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put all my strength into it again and crushed her womb with my weight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face contorted in pain and she gritted her teeth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lewd view of our crotches fitting snugly together to the base, our wet pubic hairs tangled together. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha&#8230;&#8230;ah, it&#8217;s moving, Fumio’s cock is moving inside me&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I pulled the rod out close to the tip and thrusted it vigorously back into her vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uaau!? Kufuu..nnnn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pressed my glans against the depths of her vagina. And I pushed the swirling thoughts, [I love you! I love you!] in my chest deep inside her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My first woman. The woman I once had to let go of. The thought of that excited me to the point that my head almost boiled.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let my excitement take over and started pistoning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In synchronisation with the movement of my hips, a charming sound spilled from her shapely lips. The sound of her voice was already ripe, sweet and debauched from the start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my hips with all my might, creaking the bed, thrusting my rod into the lewd hole overflowing with honey, as if to imprint on her body that she was mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Nhh, Nhh, Nhh, Ah, Ah, Ahh..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time she moaned and shook her hair, her vagina contracted and squeezed my cock. I even had the illusion that my thing was melting in her womb.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa-san!&#8230;&#8230;feels good, Kurosawa-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I unintentionally let out a voice like that, her expression turned debauched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh&#8230; I&#8217;m so glad that you feel that way&#8230;&#8230;Please make me feel better with you&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whispering this to her, I quickened the movement of my hips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuuh, hiii!? Ah, Ah, Kuh, hiiii! i-it&#8230;. feels so good, it&#8217;s too much! It&#8217;s too muuuuuch!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thrusted so hard that I penetrated her womb and slammed my hips hard into her crotch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, deep inside, deep inside, amazing! Ah, ah, it feels good, it feels good!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her shapely breasts swayed with each thrust, wrinkling the bed sheets as she clutched. Our crotches were soaked with the love juices overflowing from her, which bubbled and turned cloudy white, staining the skirt she was still wearing in a heaping mess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mating odour, like fermented cheese, was growing thicker. As I thrusted in, her cheeks turned even redder and her breathing became more erratic. Eventually, she began to shake her head violently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnnn, noo, ah, i-it&#8217;s made me crazy, if you keep thrusting like this, I&#8217;ll stop being myself&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was not going to slow down even though she said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay, it&#8217;s okay to go crazy. I&#8217;ll make you feel good from now on. Drown yourself, Kurosawa-san. I&#8217;ll make you feel even better!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seen in this way, Kurosawa Misuzu was still a superb beauty. She had translucent white skin and glossy black hair. Her eyes were cool and glamorous. However, she was a girl who was out of reach, a girl I had never been able to reach before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl who trampled me. The girl who was the girlfriend of the man who abused me. The pretty girl who was the reader&#8217;s model everyone in my class admired. The girl who looked down on me in a big way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was feeling my cock, with eyes so moist that they seemed to be shedding tears. Her cheeks were bright red as she was left to her own devices. Her vaginal folds were trembling shallowly while she was sucking my cock into her body. She wanted to be loved by me. She begged me to love her. How could I not be excited by this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiiiiii!? Your penis is getting bigger again! My vagina being spread, i-if you do this, ah, ah I&#8217;m going to cum, I&#8217;m going to cum!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san finally climaxed at the sensation of being pushed apart by my swollen and excited cock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just cum! Cum and be my woman!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s happening! I&#8217;m turning into Fumio&#8217;s woman, aah, aah, aah, it&#8217;s too muuch! No, I&#8217;m really going to cum!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her vaginal walls tightened around my cock. I was at my limit too. But I desperately tried to suppress the ejaculation feeling that came over me and just kept shaking my hips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as a finishing touch, I pushed up against the cervix with all my might.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaahhhhhhh!! I-I&#8217;m cummmmmmmmming!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Kurosawa-san&#8217;s flirtatious flesh contracted to the point of devouring my thing. Each and every one of the folds became entangled in the trunk of my flesh. I couldn’t stand this kind of tightness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuh, I can&#8217;t endure it. I&#8217;m going to cum!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reached my limit and my cock pulsed loudly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byuru! Bururu! Byu! Burururururu!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mass of desire that had been swirling at the base of the body became a large amount of white fluid and overflowed into Kurosawa-san&#8217;s womb.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, it&#8217;s pulsating! Your penis is pulsating! Ah, yes, even though I&#8217;m still cumming, I&#8217;m cumming againn, it feels so good! I&#8217;m cumming! I&#8217;m cumming! I&#8217;m cummmming!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rhythm of the meat stick and the feeling of the semen hitting her womb pushed her to another climax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nkku, Nnnnnnnnnnnn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san lowered her eyebrows into a figure eight and bit her lip. Her hands hugged my body tightly. Her nails dug into my skin, causing a slight pain in my back. Then, she took my lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nchu, Chu, Slurp, Slurppp..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both shuddered in pleasure as our lips met, and then we parted our lips and began to eat each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, our lips parted and our prodigal eyes gazed into each other&#8217;s&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electronic sound of the level-up echoed high in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The status of Misuzu Kurosawa had been changed to 『Enslaved』. Accordingly, the following functions were available.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hundred Percent (Hole in One). You can fertilise any woman, regardless of gender or race.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Two Glans in a Row (Tandem Twin). You can grow another one.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That’s…kinda bad.. Let&#8217;s pretend I didn&#8217;t hear about this feature. Especially, the 『Hundred Percent (Hole in One)』 is bad. If Masaki-chan finds out about it, I’ll be in big trouble. And&#8230;&#8230;what is this? I can grow Another one!? Here comes a function which makes me feel like I’m finally going to stop being human!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was making a comment to the electronic voice in my head, Misuzu looked at me with a puzzled look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong&#8230;&#8230; Fumio?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, &#8230;&#8230; sorry. I&#8217;m not sure what to say. Kurosawa-san was so cute that I got a bit spaced out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Idiot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She averted her eyes as if embarrassed, and her gesture was also very cute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Fumio&#8230;&#8230; you can still do that&#8230;&#8230; right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if begging for it, her honey pot tightened around the rod that was still in there. Her sweet breath reached my ear as well. And as a result, even though I had just ejaculated, my cock was getting harder and harder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn, it&#8217;s getting big again&#8230;&#8230; Ufu, I&#8217;m so happy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to make you stay with me tonight until I&#8217;m satisfied.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230; After all, I am Fumio&#8217;s woman. You can love me as much as you want and fuck me as much as you want”</span></p>
