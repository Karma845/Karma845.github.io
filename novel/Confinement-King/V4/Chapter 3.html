<h3>Chapter 3: Saki Shiratori Unravels</h3>

<p><strong>3.1 - Eighth Day of Confinement in the Women&#8217;s Track and Field Club ──Female Pig Show</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Saori Moribe’s POV]</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way to the morning feeding, Yui looked into my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look like you&#8217;re having a hard time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s because&#8230;&#8230;it is. I’m worried about Shima-senpai so much that I couldn&#8217;t sleep at all last night&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To put it bluntly, I could not sleep well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably by now, Shima-senpai must be in a bad state as Captain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, by the looks from everyone, she had probably been beaten up even worse than Captain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At dinner last night, one of the seats was left empty. The director didn&#8217;t come back, and the quiet dinner table was terrible, as&#8230;&#8230;Shima-senpai was a rather noisy person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t even finish my meals, but that was just me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui, as if she didn&#8217;t care about Shima-senpai, was just asking about the Confinement King and making the silver-haired maid fed up. Takasago-senpai, as usual, was eating two whole tarts of blueberries for dessert without saying a word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as soon as we headed out for the evening feeding after dinner, Shima-senpai&#8217;s body was already covered with several blue bruises. All in the space of an hour, while we were having dinner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the night feeding was over, we were not allowed to set foot in the menagerie until morning. There was no one left to protect her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was hard to imagine what kind of fate awaited Shima-senpai if she had to stay like this until morning.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I hope she will be safe, but&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was concerned about Shima-senpai&#8217;s safety and I didn’t want to see her in a pitiful state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Shima-senpai were dying, would I be able to throw myself away as she did for Captain? To be honest, I was not sure. No, I was sure I couldn&#8217;t. There was no way I would have the courage to jump in there knowing that I would be beaten to a pulp like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a sigh, I lifted up the feed bins and stepped into the breeding area. I turned my head down, but I could feel the eyes of the pigs on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When this feeding was over, the flogging would begin again. I didn’t have much of a problem with flogging people anymore. However, no matter how much I protected Shima-senpai during the day, night would come again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I wanted to get out of this insurmountable loop, I must find the four deadly sinners.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I have to do it. &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll &#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But as soon as I bit my lip and looked up, I froze, eyes wide open.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai, who was looking very pale before, was smiling at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blue bruise she had last night was gone, and her blood colour was very good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The club members around her looked as if they were looking at something unpleasant, and kept their distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-are you alright? Shima-senpai!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, no, I am not alright. I got into a lot of trouble. These guys are just out of control. Especially Konparu! You, you!　You broke my leg!　Don&#8217;t get nasty with me just because you can&#8217;t beat my time, you idiot!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Shima uses Bokeボケ] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not broken.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiratori-senpai, who was still leaning against the wall, muttered a few words, and Shima-senpai shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, no! I don&#8217;t know what happened, but it healed suddenly in the morning!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeeee&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Suddenly healed? What&#8217;s that? I don&#8217;t understand at all!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was pulling a face, Yui looked entranced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the power of the Confinement King. That&#8217;s right, isn&#8217;t it? Freesia-sama! Isn&#8217;t that right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I leave it to your imagination.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid smiled at her. Regardless of the content of her words, her voice sounded as if it could only be taken as an affirmation, no matter how I looked at it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then, that brought up another question. Why did the Confinement King&#8230;&#8230; help Shima-senpai?</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Does he like Shima-senpai?’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I tilted my head, Shima-senpai glared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if I&#8217;m healed, it&#8217;s true I&#8217;ve been hurt!&#8230;&#8230;These guys are really reckless. It was really tough. To think Hatsu-chan had to put up with a lot of that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Shima-senpai turned her head to Takasago-senpai behind me and opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For the time being, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to have to show these guys a great deal! Hey, Takasago. Can you take over for the day? We&#8217;ll switch again tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we answered the pigs question, we would be immediately replaced. In other words, when Shima-senpai’s question was answered, whether it was yes or no, the swapping took place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, Takasago-senpai ignored her appeal and turned away. And then she talked to me, not to Shima-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just heard. The dessert for lunch was limited edition Yubari melon jelly. Then, at night, there was a limited edition tiramisu at La Bramange. I&#8217;m looking forward to it&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guessed the point was that she didn’t want to switch when there was dessert to be eaten.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This sweet girl! Get fat!　Double your weight! You&#8217;re fat enough to be named Shikona!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL: Credits to TinyTL. Shikona is a sumo wrestler&#8217;s ring name)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sumo wrestlers didn’t get the name shikona because they were  fat. It was a reputational damage that must be complained about by the Sumo Association.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the morning feeding, we stepped into the menagerie with whips in hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a little relaxed that Shima-senpai was okay, but the truth was that nothing has changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only way out of this hell was to identify the four deadly sinners!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I need some clues. Something to help me identify those four&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around again at the faces of the pigs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The third year students were Shima-senpai and Ota (older sister)-senpai. There was zero chance that these two were major sinners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because aside from Shima-senpai, Ota-senpai was an idiot, but thanks to that she had barely been whipped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next were second-year students Amemiya-senpai, Shiratori-senpai, Adachi-senpai, and Konparu-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought Amemiya-senpai was clean.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because, after being whipped by Yui so much, she was now almost like a pet. If she were a major sinner, she would have confessed by now.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, the most suspicious person was Konparu-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her bad character had been highlighted by the way she treated Captain and Shima-senpai here. This was quite a shock to me because I thought she was a good-natured senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Konparu-senpai was the case, then Adachi-senpai, Omuta-san and Koike-san would also be suspicious. The reason was that these girls were usually working together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of the four, Shiratori-senpai, Takasago-senpai, and first-year student Sato-san were usually together, and although she was not here, second-year student Ninagawa-senpai sometimes joined them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this group seemed unlikely because of the presence of Takasago-senpai, who was the inquisitor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for the rest of the first-year students, there was no particular group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui and I, Mako and Ota (little sister), Hotta-san, Saito-san, and Kishijo-san. On the other hand, I had the impression that Sato-san, Omuta-san, and Koike-san, who always worked together with the senpais, did not really join in the conversation among the first-year students.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Looking at it this way, I think&#8230;&#8230; Konparu-senpai is the most suspicious.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was still pondering like this, Yui suddenly raised her voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sure of it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeh, what? Did you find out who the great sinner is?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rolled my eyes involuntarily, and Yui looked at me doubtfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you talking about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeh? Because you sound convinced, I thought you were talking about the&#8230;&#8230;four deadly sinners.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have not been looking for the deadly sinners from the beginning. I have no desire to change the status quo.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then what is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it was the Confinement King who healed the Shima-senpai&#8217;s injuries, then the Confinement King must surely be watching over us, even now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Watching over us..?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘She must be mistaken about being watched, right?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I didn&#8217;t say it out loud because I knew Yui would get angry if I did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That means, Moribe-san, if we do something that would please the Confinement King-sama&#8230;..maybe he&#8217;ll give us a compliment.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No, no! That doesn&#8217;t make me happy!’</span></i></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right..after all&#8230;&#8230;gentlemen like sex&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite my heartache, Yui looked a little thoughtful, then swung the whip and struck the ground with a crack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You bitches! If you don&#8217;t want to be whipped any more, lick Shima-senpai&#8217;s body!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A stunned silence descended and everyone stopped moving with a snap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a pause for breath, Shima-senpai peeled her eyes and raised her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute! Wait a minute! What the hell do you mean?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Yui completely ignored Shima-senpai and turned her head toward me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it&#8217;s the Confinement King, I&#8217;m sure he’d like to see girls in a lascivious state!　Especially if it&#8217;s Shima-senpai, whom he loves so much that he is willing to heal her.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A,are you crazy?! I don&#8217;t understand!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai stomped her foot jitterily with a twitchy look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, you pigs, do it and get it over with! I promise I won&#8217;t whip anyone who obeys me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Amemiya-senpai pushed Shima-senpai down on the floor and her body collided with hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yu, Yui-sama&#8217;s order. Come on, Shima-senpai, I&#8217;m going to make you feel good to the fullest!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah! Idiot!　Wait!　Wait? &#8230;&#8230; Hyahn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Shima-senpai raised a high-pitched voice and jumped. Looking over, Saito-san had her face between Shima-senpai&#8217;s legs while Amemiya-senpai pressed her body against hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, come on, everyone~. If you don&#8217;t hurry up, you&#8217;ll be receiving my whip!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-stop it, don’t lick me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Driven by Yui with her whip, Kishijo-san and the others swarmed toward Shima-senpai in a flurry. With six people surrounding her, there was no longer any room for them to stick their faces in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa,wai–aahnn!? Nhi, Ah, Hi, Ah, no, stop it&#8230; Ah, ah &#8230; Ah, ah, ah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The turtle-bound girls swarmed around, frantically stretching out their tongues and licking up Shima-senpai&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai flailed her legs, but could not shake off Saito-san, who first stuck her head between her legs, and she was already inserting her tongue deep into Shima-senpai&#8217;s secret parts as if she were biting them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Stop, stop it, Ah, Ah, Don&#8217;t do this&#8230; Ngg, Nnn!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, her right breast was taken by Mako, and the left breast was taken by Ota-san&#8217;s little sister, as if they were biting into a steamed bun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai&#8217;s face turned bright red in an instant, and Amamiya-senpai, who was riding on top of her, bent over and covered her lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chuu, chuu, Jyuruu,Jyuruu&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of thick kisses, Amemiya-senpai&#8217;s tongue lashing out at Shima-senpai&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How should I put it&#8230; rather than being obscene, I could only feel like I was being shown hyenas swarming around a corpse.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/p095-698x1024.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="1024" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! Good, Amemiya! I&#8217;m sure the Confinement King-sama is enjoying this spectacle!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a high pitched laugh that was somewhat over-the-top character-building, Yui whipped Konparu-senpai, who had been pushed out of the circle surrounding Shima-senpai, with her whip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa,wait, Yui! You&#8217;re being so unreasonable!　What are you doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I came to my senses and stormed over to Yui.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s just like I said before. I&#8217;m just letting the Confinement King-sama enjoy this pig show.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s just absurd!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? But Takasago-senpai seems to agree…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I looked at it again, Takasago-senpai, like Yui-chan, chose to whip those who were pushed out of the crowd by Shima-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takasago-senpai just wants to have fun&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same moment that I involuntarily dropped my shoulders, Shima-senpai suddenly let out a shriek and arched her back as if to bridge the gap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop it, please forgive me, I-I&#8217;m cumming, cummmmming! Aaaaahhhh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai bounced her body as well as Amemiya-senpai who was on top of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“AraAra, you&#8217;re very sensitive, Shima-senpai, you said you&#8217;ve never been with a man before. But I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had one too many..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you stupid&#8230; T-this kind of thing is bound to happen. That&#8217;s enough&#8230;&#8230; Please make these guys stop&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wish I could, but this is just the beginning!　Everyone! Your tongues have stopped!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan then whipped Mako&#8217;s ass, who had taken her mouth off her breast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hii!? I&#8217;ll lick it, I&#8217;ll lick it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I-I just came! Ah, ah, ah, ah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai was no longer feeling pleasure, but writhing with a face that looked as if she was enduring pain. After looking down at it with satisfaction, Yui scooted her chin toward me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe-san. I&#8217;m going to ask you to take care of that thing for me. I don&#8217;t like disobedient people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned my eyes toward the direction Yui pointed with her chin, I saw a person who was staring at me from the corner of the room, without joining the rowdiness surrounding Shima-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. Shiratori-senpai”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yui-chan&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m no good with Shiratori-senpai either&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><strong>3.2 - Longing for Chuunibyou Patients</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as lunch break started, I dashed away from the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya-kun was definitely going to come at me. That&#8217;s what I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time we entered the recess, he would talk with Kurosawa-san and sometimes look menacingly at me. The hostility was overt. There was no need to go to the trouble of waiting for him to poke me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ran out of the classroom and ran straight into the private bathroom to make the『door』 appear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side of the door was the bedroom of the 『Confinement King』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I arrived in the morning, there was no sign of Tashiro-san, who was supposed to be sleeping in the bed. Perhaps Lili had moved her to the room she had prepared for her.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If no one&#8217;s here, that&#8217;s a good opportunity, right?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I activated the 『Visual Possession』 and hacked Ryoko&#8217;s vision.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of me was a mirror. Ryoko&#8217;s figure washing her hands was reflected in the mirror. The place seemed to be a restroom. Good, I didn’t see anyone around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Might as well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then activated 『Slave Summoning』and summoned Ryoko to this room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoko appeared with her hands poised to wash, and for a moment she stopped moving with a look of surprise on her face. However, she must have grasped the situation immediately. She took a handkerchief from her pocket, wiped her hands and smiled bewitchingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for calling me, Master.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 『Slave Summoning』 was another feature that I had not had much opportunity to use, but now that I had the 『Revisit』 I could use it without hesitation. The reason was that once I had done what I needed to do, I could open the door to the police station and send her back to the police station.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s going on with Teruya&#8217;s sister?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for the track and field club, we would find out today who the 『four people who messed with Fujiwara-san』 were. Lili said so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro-san was now mine, and the track and field club member kidnapping case would soon reach its finale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that happened, I would need the scapegoat who kidnapped 18 members of the track and field team. Teruya&#8217;s sister &#8211; Anna Kamishima &#8211; was the perfect person to take on this role in terms of revenge for Fujiwara-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoko had been ordered to prepare it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she cast her eyes down in disappointment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry. It&#8217;s going to be difficult to get us to search her house. The head of the investigation division, Inspector Nakamura, stubbornly refuses to get involved with the Kamishima clan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nakamura&#8230;&#8230;Oh, that handsome uncle. As I recall, he was Ryoko&#8217;s fiancée, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, unfortunately. Considering his personality, it is hard to believe that he is being bribed, if anything, it is more likely that he is being blackmailed&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm&#8230;..I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unbuttoned her blouse and put my hand into Ryoko&#8217;s breast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn&#8217;t intended to embrace her just to check out the situation, but seeing the expression on her face when she saw me made me horny.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An&#8230;&#8230; master. Are you going to eat me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I do. Shall I  have Ryoko for lunch today? &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m glad. Please enjoy it.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The more I ate, the hungrier I got for lunch&#8230;&#8230;my thoughts swam about as I pushed Ryoko down on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnn, lello lello &#8230;&#8230; chu,Jyuru,Jyururu&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoko, naked only in the lower half of her body, knelt between my legs on the bed and licked my penis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks, Ryoko. That&#8217;s enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Master.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I patted her head and she smiled happily as she wiped her mouth, which was sticky with drool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two shots in the back was the best I could do during my lunch break. I would have liked to have given her a little more, but I couldn&#8217;t keep Ryoko away for that long, not on my part.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I put on my underwear and watched her back as she was pulling up her pants again. She would be working this afternoon with my semen in her womb, I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed so lewd and immoral that it made my groin tingle again.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Ryoko finished getting ready, I connected the door to the police station and that interview room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was all right. I looked around outside the door with the 『periscope』 and didn’t see anyone in particular.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s clear. Ryoko, I&#8217;ll call you again soon. “</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I will be waiting for Master.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After sending her off, I lay down on the bed in my bedroom again. The fifth period had already started.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; The bed is very soft.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I went back to the classroom now, I would surely be noticed. It seemed to me that taking a break here would be a wise choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about it, I failed to ask Lili what they had accomplished, whether they had identified the attackers or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, well&#8230;&#8230;it was because I was so preoccupied with Tashiro-san last night that I couldn&#8217;t get to that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lili, are you there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s up, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I called her name, a red-haired demon girl appeared in mid-air, spinning around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at me and then opened her mouth with a sullen look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t class currently in session, Devi? If you start skipping class now, you&#8217;ll never grow up to be a good student.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Hmm, Devil-san. What position are you preaching from?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed to me that when I got involved with Lili, my path to becoming a so-called 『mature adult』was cut off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, right. Did you manage to identify the people who attacked me yesterday?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Devi. It was the first-year members of the soccer club, Devi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just as Kurosawa-san had said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I recorded what they said, but they don&#8217;t seem to want to attack us anymore, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s good to hear.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I patted my chest in relief. Even though I was wary, it would be unbearable if I was suddenly attacked. Even if Torture could heal me, it would still hurt if they hit me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those&#8230;&#8230; guys are just going to keep spreading the rumour that FumiFumi is the kidnapper.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are they going this&#8230;.. far?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kasuya&#8217;s instructions, Devi. He is quite annoyed with FumiFumi&#8217;s proximity to Kurosawa-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s how it is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That made sense. Even now, I was taking refuge here because people seemed to be coming at me about Kurosawa-san. It was not something to be grateful for, but it was much better than being in a situation where I didn’t know the reason or logic behind it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sure it will all stop once The-real-criminal are arrested.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged my shoulders. The real criminal here, of course, was me. But Teruya&#8217;s sister was who I was trying to pin the blame on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right, Devi.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, it&#8217;s the Kamishima group, and Ryoko said it&#8217;s hard to bring them in for a raid.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The big guy in charge of the investigation is being blackmailed or bribed by Teruya-san&#8217;s sister, so Ryoko can&#8217;t get a search warrant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm, that&#8217;s not good news, Devi. Everything else is getting ready, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She crossed her arms and seemed to think about it, then after a moment, her mouth twisted into a sudden grin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnfufu…I&#8217;ve got a good idea, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A good idea?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered what it was. I didn’t know, but I had a bad feeling about her expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“FumiFumi, do you want to be the hero who rescued the girl from the kidnappers?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! That&#8217;s good, Devi! This is the situation Chuunibyou has always dreamed of, Devi. They&#8217;d love to be in a situation where they have to go into the yakuza&#8217;s office alone to save a girl, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you trying to kill me!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, Devi, don&#8217;t you long to be in a situation like this? Isn&#8217;t that the kind of situation that every Chuunibyou dreams of, like when terrorists take over the school and I&#8217;m the hero, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s fun because it&#8217;s a fantasy!　If it were real, I&#8217;d be dead in two seconds!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muuu….Gutless Devi. But if we don&#8217;t do something about it, Devi, the timing will not be right with the action on the track and field club&#8217;s side. Before noon today, the track and field team will end the deal, Devi.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it settled?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Devi. I was able to identify the four people who humiliated the black gal, and the inquisitors who were supposed to be left as candidates for the favoured princess ended up being the three people Fumi Fumi wanted, the ringlets, the lazy, and the unsociable, Devi”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t even know who&#8217;s who.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Except for Tashiro-san, I chose the other three girls on the spot based solely on their faces. They were cute girls, no doubt, but I didn’t remember what kind of girls they were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, if everything&#8217;s ready there, does that mean it&#8217;s going to happen this evening? Without a warrant?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili looked at me with a distant look in her eyes and immediately raised her eyebrows. Then, after giving a thoughtful look, she said with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s probably not going to be possible today, so we&#8217;re going to do it tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it impossible?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head, thinking that was a strange thing to say. And then Lili was able to evade my question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no choice but to return to the classroom at the end of fifth period.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though the person who had skipped fifth period had returned, there was no one who would ask, [What&#8217;s wrong with you?] . Instead, I was greeted with a look of disgust and a click of tongues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down in my seat and found an unfamiliar piece of paper tucked under the fourth period classics textbook I had left behind. I opened it and found the following words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『After class, go ahead and wait for me at the back of the old school building. I&#8217;ll catch up with you when Jun-kun goes to his club activities. Misuzu.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t remember Mr. Kurosawa&#8217;s handwriting, but it was clearly a girl&#8217;s handwriting. Normally, I would be on the lookout for a prank, but I doubted that a prankster would write such a pinpoint message.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There must have been a dispute between Kasuya-kun and Kurosawa-san while I was away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, many students saw me walking down the hallway with Kurosawa-san holding my hand. Of course, Kasuya-kun must have heard about it. Even though it was a request from her best friend, he couldn&#8217;t help but be concerned that his girlfriend was going to school alone with another man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As proof of this, Kasuya-kun kept staring at me during class with a really swarthy look in his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as sixth period ended, I grabbed my bag and rushed out of the classroom. Behind me, I heard Kasuya-kun yelling, but I pretended not to hear him. I headed straight for the back of the old school building.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If Lili is right, I won&#8217;t be attacked anymore even if Kurosawa-san is not with me&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──I waited for about an hour, thinking about the following.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sorry!] Kurosawa-san rushed over to me, clasping her hands together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She came up to me and put her hand on my chest to catch her breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa,Haaa…Jun-kun wouldn&#8217;t let me go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8230;&#8230; go home by myself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you can’t! I promised to Mai! I would not let you go home alone, and if you were attacked, Mai would be very angry with me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pulled my hand, which was sitting on the step, to make me stand up, and then she pulled her hand away and started walking toward the back gate. As soon as we stepped out of the gate, she clung to my arm and said to her upturned eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I made you wait a long time, so I&#8217;ll give you another oral&#8230;..apology, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t get me wrong! It&#8217;s an apology, it&#8217;s an apology!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-well&#8230;&#8230; if you say it like that&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;ve got a boner, and it&#8217;s hard to walk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said this, and she looked at me with a puzzled expression for a moment, then her face turned red and she kicked my leg with her toe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Id, idiot&#8230;&#8230;I told you it was an apology, don&#8217;t imagine weird things, pervert.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it was a bit of a stretch to say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">[Don&#8217;t imagine weird things]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> when you were  told to do it with your mouth.</span></p>

<p><strong>3.3 - Saori Moribe Fights Like This</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of a tub hitting the tiles echoed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yellow tubs piled up in the shape of a mountain. The noisy voices of the girls echoed off the walls decorated with Mt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh&#8230;&#8230;. that&#8217;s just unfair!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to me, sinking into the hot water up to her mouth, Shima-senpai stretched out pleasantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuun, Nnn! Well, Moribe-chan had a lot of work to do with that girl. It can&#8217;t be helped. I think you did a good job, my friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?&#8230;&#8230; I fell into a pig at the last minute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a good thing it was at the end. I&#8217;ve been through so much, thinking I&#8217;d been beaten to a pulp, and now today I&#8217;ve been subjected to such&#8230;&#8230; embarrassment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai shook her head, as if remembering that situation all over again. Her face was bright red, and it was not only because of the heat of the hot water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; that, how many times did you cum?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you so curious? W-well&#8230;&#8230; after the third time, I didn&#8217;t know what happened. They were relentless. And after we were released from here, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel embarrassed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are we going to be released&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned to the four people who were interrogated as deadly criminals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know what they did to them, but the girls were still crying themselves to pieces. The four of them were huddled together at the edge of the bathtub, crying continuously while stifling their voices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The truth is&#8230;&#8230; if Hatsu-chan hadn&#8217;t been in such a state yesterday, I would have switched places with Shiratori.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The first day I whipped her, it was just to encourage me. She&#8217;s a smart girl. But she&#8217;s bluffing, so it&#8217;s hard for me to make a decision&#8230;&#8230; But still, she&#8217;s someone I can trust.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Someone you can trust? Shima-senpai, were you close with Shiratori-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha…actually, she&#8217;s my niece.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m the youngest of seven siblings, and she was the child of my oldest sister who married in Tokyo. She came here to go to college and now she&#8217;s staying with me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve never heard of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s because I never told you guys. But she&#8217;s one of my relatives, so I can believe her. Well, I&#8217;m sorry about it, Moribe. I hope you don&#8217;t feel bad about it. She&#8217;s just a competitive person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While replying to the question, I remembered the exchange with Shiratori-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah, no…noot good..aahh,ahhn…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While listening to Shima-senpai&#8217;s gasping voice surrounded by the pigs, I approached Shiratori-senpai.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..if you’re scared, you’ll lose!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, Shiratori-senpai looked up at me with her usual glare. As soon as I stood in front of her, I swung the whip as hard as I could, no questions asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That hurts!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiratori-senpai&#8217;s face was contorted in pain, but she looked somewhat relaxed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This made me feel helplessly anxious. I thought she might be up to something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I wanted to get information out of her. She told me that she knew who the four sinners were and that she had found out everything about them. If I could get her to tell me that, I might be able to end this whipping today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is one of the great sinners, Konparu-senpai?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think so, Moribe?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cracked the whip without replying. I wouldn’t play into her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What makes you think it&#8217;s Konparu?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiratori-senpai still asked me questions. But I kept my mouth shut and swung the whip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t think Shiratori-senpai also expected me to reply easily but was she planning to keep repeating the question and making me impatient?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t want it to end, do you, Shiratori?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t like losing in a competition.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What in the world was this person talking about? This was not a competition or anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shrugged her shoulders as she looked at me, unintentionally letting her irritation show on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, okay. If you want to know,I&#8217;ll tell you in order from the beginning. First of all, what was the common denominator among the four of you chosen to be the Inquisitor?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Common denominator?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first four chosen were Yui, Takasago-senpai, Captain Tashiro, and myself. What did the four of us have in common?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We competed in different events. We were in different grades. Even our personalities and friendships had almost nothing in common.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t even know what it is?　It&#8217;s the hair. Of the eighteen, twelve of us have short cuts. And yet, four of you are not all short-cut, so of course there must be a reason for that.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It is true that&#8230;&#8230;the captain of the club was left out, and the next one chosen was Shima-senpai, who has short cut hair.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can see what you&#8217;re thinking on your face, you must think that Shima-senpai has short cut hair, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped whipping my hand and closed my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is bad, she can even read my expression.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as I inhaled to take a deep breath, Shiratori-senpai spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The fact that the Captain was out of the picture meant that it was unexpected for that side as well. That&#8217;s why they had to add someone on short notice. You saw how Shima-senpai behaved, didn&#8217;t you? That First Favoured Princess and Shima-senpai know each other. That person must have known that Shima-senpai was not included in the four deadly sinners. So it doesn&#8217;t matter that she has short hair.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I,I see, if you ask me&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s certainly true.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened my eyes, and before I knew it, she was on her feet, walking up to me and thrusting her face so close to mine that the tips of her nose rubbed against mine.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hyiii!!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I backed away in a hurry. She looked at me with wide eyes, and still poked me in the face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That brings up the next question, doesn&#8217;t it? The other two who don&#8217;t have short hair. Why weren&#8217;t I and Konparu chosen?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost let out an audible [Eh] but I spun my mouth and I hastily covered my mouth with my hand. I didn’t think this would be enough to answer the question, but I felt that once I broke down, I would reply without a second thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because, I am right, aren’t I? If short-cut hair is a characteristic of those four people, why not me or Konparu instead of Shima-senpai?　Just because we know each other, there&#8217;s no need to go out of their way to choose the short-cut Shima-senpai.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I wonder if that&#8217;s so&#8230;&#8230;.If you say so, it seems like it. &#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was puzzled, Shiratori-senpai suddenly twisted her cheeks in a hateful manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The answer is simple. It’s because we’re ugly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I had no idea what she was talking about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the other hand, the interrogator has to be pretty in her own way. Once this search for the guilty is over, you will be able to see the Confinement King──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shiratori-senpai had said that much, the silver-haired maid interrupted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s Confinement King-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That means you&#8217;ll become the comfort of the Confinement King-sama&#8230;. And he has no use for ugly people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for me, I could only be puzzled.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from Konparu-senpai, Shiratori-senpai was not ugly. She just had bad eyesight and was unsociable. I thought her face itself was rather beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s with that face?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyii?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Shiratori-senpai shouted so loudly that I winced. I didn’t even know what kind of face I was making.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re thinking like that huh!? Don&#8217;t get carried away! You think you&#8217;re prettier than me, and you look down on me!　Oh no, no, no. Pretty little brat. You act like you&#8217;re having a hard time with the whip, but when you step out the door, you&#8217;re laughing your head off. I bet you are. You black-hearted bitch, you horrible woman!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiratori-senpai was in my face, hurling out words that I could only think of as backbiting. I didn&#8217;t have time to retort, so I simply backed away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Admit it!! You think you&#8217;re the cutest, huh?! Oh, I get it. I&#8217;ve figured it out this time. The truth is that the four deadly sinners were the first four chosen, right? That&#8217;s the kind of twist you see in movies. Tell me. It&#8217;s you, isn’t it? It&#8217;s you, right?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I backed away, Shiratori-senpai still kept coming at me. This person was so reckless. I meant, did it mean that this time she didn&#8217;t actually know who the deadly sinner was?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost shouted, [No!] but in my haste I swallowed my words and raised my whip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Shiratori-senpai said in a sarcastic tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Arara.., you whip me when things get inconvenient. Hee&#8230;&#8230; I mean, if it&#8217;s not convenient for you, aren&#8217;t you a deadly sinner after all? If you&#8217;re flogging me now, that proves you&#8217;re a big sinner. Everyone watch me! Because if she flogs me, she&#8217;s the big sinner!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her reasons and logic were muddled. But the momentum pushed me all over the place and I began to get confused. Still, if I didn’t open my mouth, I&#8217;d be fine. I repeated in my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Can&#8217;t you answer?　Are you scared?　You little fish!　Damn small fry!　It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re confessing you&#8217;re the biggest sinner of all!　Apologise to everyone!!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don&#8217;t say it back. Don&#8217;t talk back.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> But when she abused me this much as she liked, I felt frustrated and my eyes started to burn with regret.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why do I have to be told this much!　I should be the one holding the whip!　It should be Shiratori-senpai who hurts when she gets hit!’</span></i></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, apologise to everyone!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No! It&#8217;s not me!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, as if possessed, Shiratori-senpai suddenly returned to her usual muffled and unsympathetic face, and turned to the silver-haired maid and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maid-san. How&#8217;s this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230; out, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Eh? Eh? I-I didn&#8217;t reply!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so distraught that Shiratori-senpai replied with a pouty look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys were probably told you weren&#8217;t supposed to answer questions. I thought there might not be a binding 『with words』 there&#8230;&#8230;.It&#8217;s called non-verbal communication. Even if you don&#8217;t verbalise it, if you indicate yes or no to a question, of course you&#8217;ve answered the question. So I tried to push Moribe until you unconsciously did that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;w,what do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You just shook your head as hard as you can”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel the blood drain from my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was too distracted by her words. I should have known that, but because I was pushed up all at once, I didn&#8217;t have time to pay attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around and before I knew it, the headless sackhead woman was standing behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-noo&#8230;. Stop…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My resistance was futile and in an instant my clothes were stripped off, and my body was entangled into a bondage before I could even exhale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was rolled on the floor in a tortoise-shell bondage, the sackhead woman walked up to Shiratori-senpai and untied the rope that bound her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuu..so stiff…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking up at Shiratori-senpai, who was snapping her neck as she said this, I was overcome with a sense of despair.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;ve fallen. I have fallen. I&#8217;ll be whipped. I&#8217;m going to be beaten to a pulp like the captain&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought of that, I was so scared and afraid that I burst into tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Uuu..Gusuu..uuu…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiratori-senpai looked down at me and, as usual, with an unsociable face, spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about it. I&#8217;ll finish everything before Moribe gets flogged.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked up at her in confusion, she turned to the silver-haired maid and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The sinner are the four first-year students, Kishijo, Saito, Inui and Hotta.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, everyone who had flocked to Shima-senpai stopped moving, and Yui turned her eyes towards the silver-haired maid with a look of surprise on her face. The only sound in the silence was the lustrous and bewitching breath of Shima-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. Now, those four people will be interrogated in a separate room. Torture, please take them in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sackhead woman then took out what looked like a knife and urged the four girls to step out into the hallway, squaring their chins. As the four girls walked out, terrified at the sight of the knife, the silver-haired maid opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to interrogate them now. I&#8217;m sure this will be over soon, so everyone please stay put.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the silver-haired maid left, a sigh of relief flooded the breeding ground. No one opened their mouths. Only Shima-senpai was bouncing her body with an ahegao face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I boldly asked Shiratori-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. how did you know it was those four?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it&#8217;s rather strange that you don&#8217;t know&#8230;&#8230; Oh well. It&#8217;s a simple process of elimination. As I said before, the characteristics of a great sinner are short-cuts. In other words, the first four, plus the six of me and Konparu are unlikely. And Shima-senpai is also unlikely, as I said before. There is no way the Ota sisters could do something so insidious, and Amemiya is also different because she doesn&#8217;t have the guts not to talk after being beaten so much. Now there are eight of us left.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To that extent, I could sort of imagine it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And if it was four of them who humiliated her, then it&#8217;s kind of unnatural for people who don&#8217;t usually work together to do that, isn&#8217;t it? That&#8217;s why Adachi, Koike, and Omuta who hang out with Konparu are unlikely. I don&#8217;t think Sato, who hangs out with me and Takasago-senpai, would be able to do that&#8230;&#8230; So that leaves four people: Kishiro, Saito, Inui, and Hotta. It&#8217;s not that these guys are always together, but&#8230;&#8230; you can think of one girl who treats all of these guys like dirt, right? The top student in the same short distance as these guys&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Teruya-senpai!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Correct. I checked with Shima-senpai just to make sure, and she said that the person who was humiliated, Fujiwara-senpai, and Teruya-senpai are in the same class, so you can guess the rest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About 30 minutes later, the four girls in question returned, accompanied by a silver-haired maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although they did not appear to be injured, the four of them were crying non-stop. They were sobbing and unable to speak properly, I wondered what kind of terrible treatment they had suffered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking round at us, the silver-haired maid opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you all for your hard work. Now that we have confirmed that these four are the major sinners, I would like to inform you of all of your plans from here onwards.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard a gulping and choking sound. Probably everyone was thinking the same thing. Whether we could go home or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We waited patiently for the silver-haired maid to continue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tonight, the Second Princess is planning to host a dinner party, so I hope you will all enjoy yourselves there to the fullest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh–what about the dessert?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please look forward to it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When asked by Takasago-senpai, the silver-haired maid smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First, the inquisitors, Kayama-sama, Takasago-sama and Shiratori-sama, please go back to your rooms, and Shiratori-sama, please use the room that Moribe-sama is using. Please finish bathing before I come back later to dress you individually.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The word [dress] caused a bit of a commotion. But the silver-haired maid didn&#8217;t seem to mind and looked around at us, saying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As for the former pigs, I will now take you to the large bathhouse created by the Second Princess. Your clothes will be prepared there, so please take your time and enjoy your bath.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were then untied and brought to a large bathhouse that, no matter how one looked at it, looked like a public bathhouse in the city and overflowed with the smell of the Showa period.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the second favourite princess who produced it had a bit of a strange sense of style.</span></p>
